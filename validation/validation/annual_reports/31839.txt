SIR GEORGE BUCKLEY
CHAIRMAN Smiths Group plc  Annual Report 2017

STRA TEGIC
REPORT
As individuals or as companies, 
we can either create the future or 
we can be visited by it – and who 
is to say that if we just wait for it, 
whether we’ll like that future visit 
when it arrives? 
It’s clear from the challenging experiences 
of many great companies in recent years, 
that unless we prepare properly for the 
future, the one we want probably won’t be 
there when we need it. It reminds me of 
the old saying “the best time to replace 
the roof is when the sun is shining.”
Choosing our future
There are, in fact, many possible 
‘futures’ that can be created for a 
company. So it’s far better that it’s 
one we intentionally design ourselves, 
rather than an accidental one we may 
not like when it arrives. That’s the 
fundamental job we have to do as a 
leadership team and as a Board, ie to 
create a new sustainable and viable 
future for Smiths, one which creates 
more value for our shareholders and 
more opportunities for our employees. 
By design, it will be one which is much 
better than if we had simply waited at the 
bus-stop of opportunity for something 
serendipitous – or not – to come along. 
A fact which is rarely acknowledged 
by observers is that the core of every 
company is slowly dying. This includes 
even the most ‘modern’ companies 
such as those focusing on software, 
social media and the internet. 
The core of every company is being 
constantly attacked by competition, 
by end-of-life technology, product 
substitution, regulation and 
cannibalisation, and also by changing 
customer preferences and performance 
expectations. The core of every 
company is trickling away like a 
melting ice cube in the hot sun. 
The rate at which this decay or attrition 
happens can be surprisingly high, 
depending on the type of end market 
being served. So clearly, there is no 
way to succeed in the competitive 
game by simply standing still. The only 
way to overcome this natural attrition 
problem is by continually replacing 
the core business with new products, 
new customers, new technologies and 
new markets. If a company wants to 
grow faster than the market, it has to 
make this replacement at a rate which 
well exceeds the natural rate of core 
attrition. While this may seem to be an 
obvious statement, you’d be surprised 
by how few companies recognise this 
problem and address it head on. We 
will not make that mistake at Smiths.
So what do we want our company future 
to look like? First, we can observe that 
all great companies are innovative 
companies. A company cannot beat 
entrenched competition, and certainly 
cannot beat aggressive new market 
entrants, unless it’s innovative. 
Operational excellence clearly has 
a big part to play in a company’s 
competitiveness, although there is 
no amount of process excellence that 
can ever adequately substitute for 
a healthy dose of innovation. Nor is 
there an adequate substitute offered 
in productivity initiatives alone. As the 
saying goes, you can’t save your way 
into prosperity. We can see this most 
clearly in electronics and software 
companies where the market, product 
and technology changes are easily 
the fastest. But exactly the same 
gradual attrition phenomena happens 
to industrial companies, consumer 
packaged goods companies, healthcare, 
transportation, energy and food. So 
while the rates of decline may be a little 
slower than in electronics markets, 
they are nevertheless there. Second, 
great companies grow faster than the 
markets they serve and, as a result, 
they steadily build market share 
each year. It also implies that their 
new product vitality index is high.
High performance companies also have 
strong levels of employee satisfaction 
and customer satisfaction; they have 
best-in-class margins, and attractive 
and stable returns on capital investment. 
They are also inclusive of ‘all-comers’ 
– creative talent needs to come from 
everywhere – and they are places with 
a good employer brand where able 
people want to work. These companies 
also have good Environmental, 
Social and Governance scores. 
In broad brush strokes, this is the 
kind of company and ‘new future’ we 
are determined to build. We have not 
changed or deviated from this mission 
one bit since I became the Chairman 
of Smiths, though I’m proud to say that 
under the dynamic leadership of our 
Chief Executive Andy Reynolds Smith 
and his team, we are now executing 
against this mission much faster.
 
Creating new value
In terms of new financial value creation, 
companies have only five levers they 
can pull to improve shareholder value 
creation. Higher sales growth, margin 
expansion, improved working capital 
turns, lower taxation rates and an 
improving P/E multiple. For most 
mature industrial companies, with their 
typical underlying characteristics of 
high margin and lower sales growth, 
the best method of creating new value 
for all stakeholders in the company is to 
drive higher levels of profitable organic 
growth. Achieving a point of sales growth 
usually exceeds the value creation of a 
point of margin improvement by several 
multiples. Plus, there are natural limits 
to profit margin that the laboratory of 
life teaches us are possible. If margins 
go too high, customers complain and 
even greater competition is enticed 
into your market. A strategy of only 
improving margin eventually runs 
out of runway. Growth never does.
We have scope for higher levels of growth 
at Smiths Group – along with huge 
opportunities for improving our working 
capital efficiency. Here and there, we also 
have opportunities for margin expansion 
in some of our businesses – particularly 
in Smiths Medical. So this essentially

We were delighted to welcome Noel Tata to the Board in January 2017 
as an additional non-executive director and member of our Audit, 
Nomination and Remuneration Committees. We welcome Noel’s 
extensive experience and expertise in higher-growth economies such 
as Asia and Africa. As I have said on previous occasions, the ability to 
manage change is a good indicator of a business’ resilience. Following 
Chris O’Shea stepping down from his role as Chief Financial Officer in 
May, we were pleased that my Board colleague and Audit Committee 
Chairman Bill Seeger agreed to step into the Chief Financial Officer 
role on an interim basis while we seek a permanent replacement. 
We were also delighted that non-executive director Mark Seligman 
agreed to take on the Chair of the Audit Committee.
is the nub of the Group’s strategic plan. 
A balanced combination of operational 
excellence and high levels of organic 
growth, driven mostly by innovation. 
Here and there, we may yet trim the 
portfolio in those places where we feel 
we can’t create the kind of value-creating 
growth profile and company we want.
An everybody wins strategy
Yes, we will certainly continue to 
use acquisitions as an accelerant to 
growth, but in today’s market of high 
purchase prices for companies, we will 
be selective and thoughtful about how 
to do this. We still have a mission of 
achieving sensible returns on investment 
well above our cost of capital. 
Acquisitions can bring many positive 
things (and some negative ones if a 
company isn’t careful), but done properly, 
one thing acquisitions always do is to 
bring speed of execution of the strategic 
plan. The wonderful thing we can 
observe about growth and innovation 
is that it’s an ‘everybody wins’ strategy. 
Investors win with better returns, 
employees win with greater career 
opportunities, suppliers win with higher 
volume and customers win with better 
products. We have lots of opportunity 
too for improvements in working capital 
turns and again, like growth, this is 
already on the docket of things being 
done to substantially improve the Group. 
Adapting for change
What might that new future look like for 
Smiths? If we think carefully, much of 
the general direction of technology and 
customer preferences can be forecast. 
The details no, but the generalities yes. 
So another element of a company’s 
profile is that it must be a learning 
company and be agile and adaptable to 
changing circumstances. For change, 
these circumstances certainly will. For 
example, there’s no reason to believe 
that border crossing and airport security 
challenges will become easier in the 
future than they are today. So executed 
properly, this will be a great business 
to be in long term. But more and more 
advanced detection technologies will 
need to be developed, expanding from 
sophisticated explosives detection to 
all forms of contraband detection at 
border crossings and inspection points. 
The same opportunities apply to medical 
businesses. People are living longer 
and that part of the world we refer to as 
higher-growth markets are demanding 
better healthcare, better education and 
communications, cleaner air and water, 
higher levels of food safety, better cars 
and better housing among others. The 
three large disease states of cancer, 
heart disease and diabetes can, and will, 
be improved by medical science and we 
will play our part in that. Energy needs, 
petrochemical-sourced feedstocks 
and electronics-oriented products will 
continue to be huge features of our daily 
life, in fact, ever more so. So this puts our 
John Crane and Interconnect businesses 
front and central in this new world.

REPORT
Higher growth market focus
We have decided to build a much stronger 
focus on growing in these higher growth 
regions. Arithmetically, if our portfolio 
had the same percentage of sales in 
these regions as do our peers, our 
organic growth rate would be about 100 
basis points higher than it is today. That’s 
a missed value creation opportunity 
lingering from the past. To help address 
this, we’ve assigned a top Smiths 
leader, Roland Carter, to that task, with 
operational control of Asia Pacific.
When I moved to live in the United 
States in 1978, one of the first projects 
I worked on was electric vehicles and 
the fundamental architecture of the 
drive system was more or less identical 
then to what we see in electric vehicles 
today. Yet it is only in recent times that 
they had become commercially viable. 
There is no question that electric 
vehicles, autonomous driving, artificial 
intelligence, robotics, advanced 
materials and nanotechnologies will 
all have their increasing place in this 
new world. Energy storage devices, 
electrostatic as well as galvanic, will 
see big changes. However, sometimes 
we have to temper our enthusiasm 
about the rate at which these things 
will be adopted, but gradually adopted 
they will be. I have no doubt.
Possibly the greatest impact inside 
the Group will come from that fastest 
moving area of technology, ie electronics 
and the internet, with its underlying, 
sensing, algorithmic, computational 
and software elements. Those will have 
tremendous effects on virtually every 
product we make over the next 10 years. 
Embracing the digital future
Smiths is making significant upfront 
investments in digital, including in 
centres of excellence in the US and 
Europe, to make sure we are properly 
prepared to respond to this emerging 
opportunity. These technological 
ideas are altering the way people think 
about the products they buy, about 
marketing, communications, healthy 
eating, entertainment, transportation 
etc. In a not-too-distant future, virtually 
all products and their components 
will be tracked and traced and 
automation, robotics, linked intelligent 
self-diagnosing and self-correcting 
devices will be features of our daily 
lives. All companies need to be better 
prepared for the challenges of cyber 
security, since many of these devices 
are going to be connected to the Internet 
and communicate with us and with 
each other. We can either prepare 
for this future or be run over by it.
The solution to all creative problems 
requires a blend of optimism, curiosity, 
imagination and relentless execution. 
The optimism is needed to believe that 
something can be done, imagination is 
required to create it, and curiosity is 
required to identify it when it’s finished 
and lastly, relentless execution is 
needed to achieve it. These factors 
will increasingly become features of 
our company culture. No matter what 
the company does, it will always be 
world-class talent which is the greatest 
need. Nothing in the company ever 
gets done except through people. 
Repositioning our portfolio
In terms of progress along this pathway, 
the past year has seen steady execution 
towards building a vibrant and faster-
growing Smiths, reminiscent of the 
high-growth innovative company which 
existed around a half a century or more 
ago. To this end, in FY2017 we’ve made 
one major acquisition in the detection 
business, Morpho Detection, and 
trimmed the company’s portfolio by 
selling four other non-core pieces of 
the portfolio where the chance to drive 
strong growth seemed less obvious. This 
has resulted in the Group being about 
the same size as it was a year ago, but 
with much better growth prospects. We 
are investing in new product platforms 
everywhere and as these products are 
released to market, they will accelerate 
our growth and competitiveness. 
We’ve also made improvements in our 
use of working capital, with a £85m 
reduction this past year. Much more has 
yet to be done here. We made excellent 
progress in our pension plan and in 
getting the kind of leadership we need 
in key places around the Group. As 
far as innovation is concerned, there’s 
always a longer lead time than we’d 
like before we see the green shoots. 
I know from past experience that if 
we continue down this innovation 
pathway the growth will come, 
additional value will be created and 
a much happier and better Group.
I’d like to thank all of our investors 
for believing in us. It will work – 
I’m sure of it – and ultimately all 
of us will be the beneficiaries.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE  Smiths Group plc  Annual Report 2017

STRA TEGIC
REPORT
Smiths has seen a year of good 
progress, amidst a world of 
uncertainty and an unprecedented 
pace of technology development. 
I set out my ambition of establishing 
Smiths as one of the world’s leading 
technology companies in September 
2016, and we’ve spent the past 12 months 
doing what we said we were going to do. 
FY2017 performance
We delivered a good performance in 
FY2017, with underlying revenue broadly 
in line with the prior year. We saw growth 
across the portfolio offset by John 
Crane’s oil & gas business and in Smiths 
Medical due to market challenges in John 
Crane and a delay in some new product 
launches in Smiths Medical. Group 
revenue grew 11% on a reported basis, 
benefiting from foreign exchange, and in 
particular the strength of the US dollar, 
partially offset by the impact of four 
divestitures and the acquisition of 
Morpho Detection.
The underlying quality of our businesses 
and the increasing impact of the Smiths 
Excellence System supported a strong 
headline operating profit performance of 
£589m, up 3% on an underlying
1
 basis 
and up 16% on a reported basis. The 
Group’s headline operating profit margin 
increased 70 basis points on a reported 
basis, with margin expansion in all 
divisions reflecting our focus on 
operational efficiency and the upgrading 
of the portfolio. 
Strategy update
We’ve made good progress against our 
strategic objectives of outperforming our 
chosen markets and delivering world-
class competitiveness, supported by our 
strong financial framework. 
Sustainable growth and attractive 
returns are what we’re about and we’ve 
moved forward on repositioning the 
portfolio and establishing the 
organisational building blocks to deliver 
on our ambition. This is helping to 
establish Smiths as a high-performing 
diversified Group with high-quality 
businesses that are well-positioned in 
growing markets, with active portfolio 
management, a clear operating model, 
and a culture of relentless execution and 
continuous improvement.
Outperforming our chosen markets
The repositioning of the business for 
growth through organic and inorganic 
investment is well underway and we 
have made excellent progress. With 
the sale of four non-core assets and 
the completion of the Morpho Detection 
acquisition – creating a true world 
leader in this market – around 75% of 
our portfolio is now well positioned by 
market and competitiveness, up from 
60% eighteen months ago, and we expect 
further progress in the coming year.
Our goal is a portfolio of businesses 
that hold sustainable top three 
positions in attractive markets and 
demonstrates the key characteristics 
of a Smiths business: asset-light and 
competitive operations, technology 
differentiation, a high proportion of 
aftermarket revenues and increasing 
digitisation. Organic growth will always 
be my top priority but we expect to 
run a carefully considered parallel 
path of acquisition and divestiture to 
accelerate our repositioning globally.
An example of our work to reposition 
the portfolio is the focusing and 
restructuring of Smiths Interconnect.

AND COMMERCIALISATION OF NE W PRODUCTS IS 
CRUCIAL TO OUR SUCCESS TODAY AND TOMORROW
We sold non-core assets representing 
around 40% of revenue and the 
remaining core is now positioned as a 
faster-growing leader in high-speed 
secure connectivity for demanding 
markets such as space, defence and 
commercial aerospace, and ready 
to develop further. There are similar 
examples elsewhere in the portfolio.
We have also increased our focus on 
key higher-growth regions, including 
relocating one of our Executive 
Committee members, Roland 
Carter, to Asia as Smiths Group 
President of Asia Pacific to head up 
our growth drive in the region.
Driving world-class competitiveness
As we increasingly focus the Group 
on the most attractive end markets 
with good long-term profitable growth 
prospects, it is critical that we establish 
the capabilities to ensure relentless 
execution. This has been a priority 
during the last year and we have 
been driving three areas: operational 
excellence, innovation and people.
Many years in the hard-fought automotive 
world have taught me that all customers, 
whatever their industry, value speed 
and efficiency, and that’s the essence of 
the Smiths Excellence System (SES). 
SES gives us a shared operating model 
that will help us to apply best practice to 
drive speed, efficiency and a culture of 
continuous improvement, right across 
the Group. Results are already starting to 
come, with around £40m in procurement 
savings and an £85m reduction in 
working capital of which £52m is 
reduction in total stock over the past year, 
helping us to fund investment in growth. 
And I’m convinced there is more to follow 
over the next 12 months and beyond.

performance in FY2018 to be weighted 
towards the second half. Growth in 
John Crane’s non-oil and gas markets, 
as well as an increase in aftermarket 
activities, is expected to more than offset 
the challenging market conditions in 
oil and gas. We expect the introduction 
of new products during the year to 
support a gradual improvement in 
Smiths Medical. In Smiths Detection we 
anticipate a strong second half-driven 
by the transportation market, which will 
generate good growth for the year as a 
whole. In Smiths Interconnect, our focus 
on fewer, higher-growth end markets 
will support further good progress in 
this division, while Flex-Tek is expected 
to deliver continued steady growth. 
We are increasingly confident that we’re 
establishing the operating model for 
excellence and leadership capability 
to deliver long-term sustainable 
growth and attractive returns. 
Dividend
The Board is recommending a final 
dividend per share of 29.70p, giving a 
total dividend for the year of 43.25p, an 
increase of 3% year-on-year. The final 
dividend will be paid on 17 November 
to shareholders registered at close 
of business on 20 October. The ex-
dividend date is 19 October.
We’ve made good progress on our 
journey to establishing Smiths as 
one of the world’s leading technology 
companies over the past year 
and I’d like to sincerely thank my 
22,000 colleagues around the world 
for their dedication, contribution 
and absolute professionalism. I 
look forward to reporting further 
progress in the coming months.
ANDY REYNOLDS SMITH
CHIEF EXECUTIVE
Technology is moving faster than ever 
before and we‘re committed to being 
at the cutting edge. It’s essential 
that we’re technology leaders, 
defining new ways to bring value to 
our customers and developing new 
business models for the future. 
Developing a culture of innovation with an 
ecosystem to drive faster development 
and commercialisation of new products 
is crucial to our success today and 
tomorrow. Our Group-wide innovation 
framework, i
3
, will consistently drive 
increased, smarter investment in R&D 
and convert it into sales more quickly. I 
believe that it will differentiate us in our 
markets, make our customers happier 
and make us sustainable. We have 
already increased our R&D spend to 
4.6% of revenue and created a central 
Innovation Fund to build digital and other 
disruptive technology capabilities – such 
as 3D printing and nano technology – and 
create critical mass where individual 
divisional efforts would be sub-scale. 
We have announced two digital forges, 
with one in Silicon Valley and another 
planned in London, to help accelerate 
our digital transformation. These 
forges are global centres of excellence, 
helping us define new digital business 
models and build Group-wide capability 
in areas of focus including artificial 
intelligence, analytics and data security.
This is not just about planning for the 
future – we are already generating 
meaningful revenue from digital. 
Nor is it just digital technology to 
complement existing businesses – it’s 
about defining new business models for 
the future and ensuring we are ahead 
on the capabilities they will require. 
I was also pleased to announce our 
strategic partnership with Microsoft 
to further accelerate our market-
leading artificial intelligence-
based detection capability in the 
ports and borders market.
The final, critical area of focus for 
us is people – our one true source of 
sustainable competitive advantage. 
Our people plan is aimed at building 
a learning organisation that attracts, 
retains, develops, engages and 
inspires the very best people around 
the world to deliver our ambition. 
We’ve made good progress during 
the year, including launching a new 
leadership development programme 
in partnership with UCLA Anderson 
Executive Education, a new approach 
to measuring employee engagement, 
a Group-wide communication plan to 
help everyone understand the part 
they play, and the adoption of our new 
‘Smiths Way’ of working, including 
shared values and approaches to 
how we do things across the world. 
Those shared values of integrity, respect, 
ownership, customer focus and passion 
underpin our commitment to doing the 
right thing, every time, no matter our 
role. Keeping our people safe is our 
top priority and I’m particularly proud 
of our performance this year, with our 
lowest ever Recordable Incident Rate. 
That said, I truly believe that any injury 
is one too many and we will continue 
to strive for our goal of zero harm. 
Looking ahead
The progress delivered in executing 
our strategy through portfolio 
repositioning and disciplined organic 
and inorganic investment has ensured 
that we’re well positioned for the Group 
to return to growth in FY2018. As in 
previous years, we expect Group

At the core of our financial strategy is a 
financial framework to generate cash-flow:
• operate an asset-light profile, with 
targeted investments and efficient 
working capital;
 – deliver sustainable operating 
margins across our businesses; and
 – demonstrate strong financial 
discipline, maintaining a stable 
investment-grade credit rating.
With the cash we generate, we aim  
to create superior returns by ensuring 
capital is invested in value enhancing 
opportunities:
• invest for growth in new technologies 
and products in our existing 
businesses;
• execute value creative acquisitions and 
dispose of our non core assets;
• operate a progressive dividend policy, 
with the aim of increasing dividends in 
line with the long-term underlying
1
 
growth in earnings and cash-flow; and
• maintain a net debt/headline EBITDA 
ratio at two times or less.
FY2017 performance overview
As a global business with a diversified 
portfolio, we are well placed to manage 
exposure to any specific sector or 
industry trend. This is reflected 
in our 2017 results, with a strong 
operating profit performance in four 
of our five divisions, offsetting the 
continued impact of the oil and gas 
market on John Crane. The Group 
headline operating profit margin 
increased 70 basis points to 18.0%.
Revenue
Reported revenue increased by 
£331m (11%) to £3,280m, including the 
positive effects of foreign currency 
translation (£421m) and the net impact of 
acquisitions and disposals (-£65m). On an 
underlying
1
 basis, revenue declined 1% 
as growth in Smiths Detection (+£22m; 
4%), Smiths Interconnect (+£4m; 1%) 
and Flex-Tek (+£11m; 3%) was offset by 
declines in John Crane (-£33m; -4%) 
and Smiths Medical (-£29m; -3%).

REPORT
Operating profit
Headline operating profit of £589m 
was £79m higher than prior year (2016: 
£510m), including the positive effects 
of foreign currency translation (£71m) 
and the net impact of acquisitions and 
disposals (-£10m). On an underlying
1
 
basis operating profit increased 3%, 
with improvements in all divisions 
except John Crane. Headline 
operating margin increased by 70 
basis points to 18.0% (2016: 17.3%), 
with improvements in all divisions 
reflecting operational efficiencies.
John Crane margin improved by 110 
basis points to 23.0% (2016: 21.9%), 
benefiting from the disposal of the 
Artificial Lift business, favourable mix 
and operational efficiencies. Smiths 
Medical increased 60 basis points to 
22.0% (2016: 21.4%) as the benefits of 
cost control, efficiencies and a medical 
device tax refund, offset lower revenue 
and pricing pressures. Smiths Detection 
delivered a 200 basis points improvement 
to 15.0% (2016: 13.0%), reflecting sales 
growth, increased focus on aftermarket 
and favourable mix. Morpho contributed 
£8m of operating profit in the period 
post acquisition. Smiths Interconnect 
improved operating margin by 30 basis 
points to 13.4% (2016: 13.1%) due to 
increased revenue, coupled with benefits 
from restructuring and a range of 
productivity and efficiency initiatives. 
Operating margins in Flex-Tek improved 
by 130 basis points to 19.3% (2016: 
18.0%), reflecting the impact of increased 
revenue and efficiencies. Central costs 
increased by £13m including investment 
in corporate development activities, 
resources to support the Smiths 
Excellence System, and investment in 
people development, to build capabilities 
to support sustainable growth.
Operating profit on a statutory basis, 
after taking account of the items 
excluded from the headline figures, 
was £674m (2016: £387m) – see note 
3 to the accounts for information on 
the excluded items. The increase was 
driven by the £175m profit on disposal 
of businesses during the year, coupled 
with a decrease in charges for legacy 
liabilities and no impairment charges 
being recorded in the current year.
Finance costs
Headline finance costs during the year 
totalled £61m, £2m higher than the 
previous year. This was principally due to 
adverse foreign exchange movements, 
partly offset by lower interest payable 
due to the repayment of the higher 
rate £150m 7.25% Eurobond which 
matured in June 2016. Statutory finance 
costs totalled £73m (2016: £41m).
Cash-flow and net debt
Operating cash generation remained 
strong, with headline operating 
cash-flow of £695m (2016: £520m), 
representing 118% (2016: 102%) of 
headline operating profit (see note 29 
to the accounts for a reconciliation of
headline operating cash and free cash-
flow to statutory cash-flow measures). 
Net debt reduced from £978m to £967m.
We delivered a good financial 
performance in the year and our 
strong financial framework supports 
the optimisation of cash generation 
and capital allocation to focus on 
sustainable growth and superior 
returns. Further information on our 
financial performance is set out in the 
Financial Review on pages 52 to 57.

Through our five divisions, we serve 
seven markets: medical technology, 
energy, security and defence, space 
and commercial aerospace, 
transportation, construction and 
general industrial. 
Around half of our revenue is derived from 
servicing our customers’ aftermarket 
needs or supplying consumables that are 
used as part of our customers’ everyday 
procedures. This gives resilience to our 
revenues and provides strong cash-flows.
Our largest single end market is 
medical technology. The majority of 
revenue comes from Smiths Medical, 
while both Smiths Interconnect and 
Flex-Tek supply components to medical 
device manufacturers. The medical 
technology market is driven over the 
long term by ageing populations, the 
increasing incidence of chronic diseases 
and increasing healthcare spending in 
developing countries. Some 82% of  
Smiths Medical’s revenue is from 
single-use devices used in everyday 
hospital procedures. The remaining 
18% of revenue is from capital 
equipment, such as infusion pumps.
Smiths Detection provides threat detection 
equipment that enhances safety and 
security for airports, ports and borders, 
urban security, military and emergency 
responder markets. Demand is driven 
in the medium term by growth in air 
travel and ongoing geopolitical unrest 
and associated terrorist and criminal 
threats, although there is considerable 
variation by geography and end market. 
The growing installed base creates 
opportunities for aftermarket and software 
upgrade revenues. The defence segment 
is served by both Smiths Detection and 
Smiths Interconnect, who provide a 
range of trace detection and mission-
critical secure connectivity solutions 
respectively, and is primarily driven 
by spending on specific programmes 
in developed markets like the US.

SPACE AND COMMERCIAL 
AEROSPACE 
STRA TEGIC
REPORT
This market is primarily served by John 
Crane, with oil and gas representing 
around 55% of its revenues. Long-term 
drivers include increasing global demand 
for energy and increasing environmental 
and safety requirements. John Crane’s 
mechanical seals and seal support 
systems are primarily used in the process 
equipment found in downstream (eg 
refineries) and midstream (eg pipelines, 
gas storage, liquefied natural gas (LNG) 
transportation) applications. Demand for 
original equipment (36% of revenue) is 
affected by customer capital expenditure 
cycles, while aftermarket service (64% 
of revenue) depends on utilisation 
rates and equipment age. The drop in 
oil prices since late 2014 has reduced 
customer capital expenditure, but we 
have seen investment in growing areas 
such as LNG and pipelines and increased 
aftermarket demand due to pent-up 
maintenance and upgrade requirements.
Flex-Tek provides hydraulic hoses and 
fuel lines for airframes and aeroengines 
and Smiths Interconnect supplies 
connectors, microwave components 
and antenna systems for aircraft and 
satellite communications. Aerospace 
demand is driven by investment in new 
fuel-efficient aircraft and increasing 
passenger and freight traffic.
Flex-Tek manufactures a range of 
products such as flexible gas piping and 
ducting for Heating Ventilation and Air 
Conditioning (HVAC) applications that 
are used in the construction of homes 
and commercial buildings, primarily in 
the US. Demand for homes for families 
is driven by population growth.
ENERGY SPACE AND COMMERCIAL 
AEROSPACE 
CONSTRUCTION
In the rail segment, Smiths Interconnect 
supplies cable solutions, ferrite 
components and connectors for 
communications, control command 
and signalling systems in autonomous 
trains. Growth is driven by increasingly 
sophisticated digital train systems, high 
data-rate connectivity for passengers 
and the distribution of high levels of 
electricity to support the power demand 
of these systems. In the automotive 
segment, Flex-Tek supplies hoses 
for fuel and brake fluid delivery.
We serve a range of general industrial 
sectors including petrochemical, 
mining, pulp and paper, water treatment, 
semiconductor test, heating elements and 
automotive, through John Crane, Smiths 
Interconnect and Flex-Tek. There are 
different drivers for each of these markets 
but overall they tend to track GDP.

Navy for nearly 60 years
John Crane provides mission-critical 
solutions for pumps, compressors, 
and other rotating equipment across 
process industries. 
Markets and trends
We combine technology leadership with 
proven field experience, helping to optimise 
customers’ manufacturing operations. 
Our comprehensive product portfolio 
includes mechanical seals, seal 
support systems, engineered bearings, 
power transmission couplings and 
specialised filtration systems. These 
engineered solutions drive reliability 
improvements in customer operations. 
Our large installed base – built over the last 
century across several vertical markets – 
drives significant aftermarket demand. We 
have one of largest global sales and service 
networks in the mechanical seal industry, 
ensuring we are close to customers and 
provide rapid service. These centres 
provide a range of services including repair 
and refurbishment, root cause analysis, 
and alignment and condition monitoring 
to improve equipment performance 
and reduce operational downtime.
Our primary vertical market – oil and gas 
– has experienced the most severe market 
downturn in the past 30 years. Major 
oil and gas producers remain cautious 
around capital expenditures in the face 
of low and volatile commodity prices, 
although we have seen improving market 
sentiment and expect a gradual recovery 
over the next few years. In particular, 
customers are investing in growing areas 
such as liquified natural gas and pipelines, 
and we have recently seen increased 
aftermarket activity in the form of demand 
for ongoing maintenance and upgrades.
We believe megatrends such as the global 
demand for energy, and more stringent 
environmental and safety requirements, 
will continue to generate demand for 
our products over the longer term. 
We also have a significant and growing 
presence in other process industries 
(around 45% of revenue), including 
chemical, power generation, water and 
wastewater, and pulp and paper. We expect 
these verticals will continue to grow in 
the near term, helped by building demand 
in higher-growth regions. Although 
global industrial production forecasts 
remain cautious due to an uncertain 
macro-environment, drivers such as 
improved plant productivity, workforce 
safety and equipment reliability will 
continue to create growth opportunities 
over the medium to long term. 
Around 64% of our sales stem from the 
aftermarket servicing and support of 
existing installed equipment, which has 
proven resilient. We continue to expand 
our footprint through opening new service 
centres in selected higher-growth markets.

REPORT
DRIVING DIVERSIFICATION 
Leveraging our century of engineering expertise in 
mission-critical components and extensive global 
service footprint, FY2017 has seen John Crane 
successfully expand our presence in non-oil and gas 
markets around the world. 
Through focused account management and 
partnerships with OEMs, we are helping customers 
across process industries including chemical, power 
generation, water and wastewater, and pulp and paper, 
among others, to improve reliability, maximise uptime 
and reduce operating costs. Non-oil and gas now 
accounts for c. 45% of revenue – with a strong 
aftermarket component – and further expansion is a 
core priority for FY2018.
Performance
Growth in John Crane’s non-oil and gas 
and aftermarket revenue was offset by 
declines in its oil and gas activities that 
were impacted by the difficult conditions 
throughout global energy markets. On an 
underlying
1
 basis total revenue fell 4%. 
Reported revenue increased 7%, with 
favourable foreign exchange translation 
benefits partially offset by the impact of the 
divestment of the Artificial Lift business 
that refocused John Crane onto its core end 
markets and higher-margin businesses. 
John Crane continued its expansion into 
non-oil and gas industries, which now 
represent c. 45% of total revenue, with 
sales up 2%, on an underlying
1
 basis. 
This was offset by reduced oil and gas 
underlying
1
 sales, down 7% reflecting 
the challenging market conditions. These 
market conditions also impacted total 
Original Equipment (OE) underlying
1
 sales 
that fell 11% during the year. We remain 
focused on increased investment in OE 
projects and expanding the installed base 
with multiple new project agreements 
secured during the year, particularly in the 
Middle East. John Crane’s large installed 
base and market-leading service offering 
ensured it is well positioned to satisfy the 
pent-up aftermarket requirements for 
repairs, maintenance and upgrades, driving 
1% growth in underlying
1
 aftermarket 
revenue. Aftermarket represented 64% of 
total revenue during the year (2016: 59%). A 
number of significant contract wins across 
oil and gas customers, as well as smaller 
retrofit and upgrades with municipal 
water companies and power plants led to 
an increased aftermarket order book.   
Revenue from higher-growth regions 
represented 24% of sales, broadly 
in line with the prior year on an 
underlying
1
 basis, despite lower activity 
in certain parts of Latin America.  
Headline operating profit was down 4% 
on an underlying
1
 basis, as lower sales 
and strategic investments in OE projects 
were only partially offset by operational 
efficiencies. Headline operating profit 
margin increased by 110 basis points to 
23.0% benefiting from the disposal of 
Artificial Lift and continued operational 
efficiencies. The difference between 
statutory and headline operating profit 
primarily reflects £7m restructuring and 
£9m litigation costs net of the £4m gain 
on the sale of the Artificial Lift business. 
Return on capital increased 260 basis 
points to 22.9%, principally due to  
reduced assets following the disposal  
of Artificial Lift. 
The divestiture of the Artificial Lift 
business in November 2016 significantly 
reduced John Crane’s exposure to the 
commoditised aspects of upstream oil and 
gas and was margin accretive. Prior to 
the sale in November, Artificial Lift sales 
were £12m, with an operating loss of £2m, 
and net assets were £24m. The business 
performance of Artificial Lift up to the date 
of divestiture is included within the financial 
summary and results presented above.
Research and development
Research and development expenditure 
increased by 17% to £10m resulting in 
several new product launches, including:
 
• the introduction of a range of high 
performance aftermarket replacement 
filter elements;
• an innovative new pipeline seal 
engineered to withstand the harsh 
abrasive and clogging fluid properties  
of crude oil; and
• two new coupling designs that enhance 
the protection of critical rotating 
equipment assets. 
Active areas of research include: the use 
of nano-materials to enhance seal face 
performance, and investment in our dry 
gas seal development facilities enabling 
ultra-high pressure gas seal testing 
capability.  We continue to further develop 
Sense, our predictive diagnostics platform, 
with the installed base of around 30 field 
trial units, which has grown from five 
units in 2016, demonstrating excellent 
performance results and a fast growing 
customer demand for additional units.

We pioneered safety devices 
including the first safety peripheral 
IV catheter and port for delivering 
chemotherapy.
Smiths Medical’s portfolio 
incorporates established brands and 
strong positions in select segments of 
the Infusion Systems, Vascular 
Access and Vital Care markets. 
A combination of capital equipment 
and consumables, as well as growing 
software and service offerings, provides 
diversity within our portfolio, and 
continuous access to customers. 
 
Markets and trends 
The medical device industry remains very 
attractive. The global market we serve 
is estimated to be £6bn and growing 
at about 3% annually, with long-term 
trends such as a growing, ageing global 
population, increasing incidence of 
chronic diseases, a growing middle-class 
in developing countries, and increased 
access to healthcare offsetting budget 
constraints in developed markets, pricing 
pressure, provider consolidation and 
growing regulatory requirements. 
Our Infusion Systems products deliver 
medication for treating indications such as 
acute and chronic pain, cancer, pulmonary 
hypertension and Parkinson’s disease, in 
hospital and home settings. We are one of 
the market leaders in ambulatory infusion 
(CADD) and have strong positions in the 
syringe pump (Medfusion and Graseby) 
market. The rise in chronic conditions, 
and the continued advancement of digital

BREATHING MORE EASILY
Patients come in all ages, shapes and sizes, so our 
Bivona tracheostomy tubes are fully customisable, 
providing the flexibility to fit each patient’s unique 
requirements. By combining malleable, medical-grade 
silicone with spiral wire reinforcement, this innovative 
solution allows the tube to adapt to a patient’s anatomy 
while also maintaining airway diameter. 
Unique in a market of disposables, our Bivona tubes [for 
adult patients] can be cleaned and sanitised for reuse up 
to 10 times, giving a lifecycle of almost 11 months, 
a significant advantage in the homecare sector.
Performance
During the year Smiths Medical made 
progress on the ongoing repositioning 
of its portfolio, and increased targeted 
investment in its key product categories 
to address the historic underperformance 
in its product portfolio to support core-
market category leadership. Underlying
1
  
revenue was down 3%, driven by softer 
performances in Infusion Systems and 
Vascular Access, where the product 
portfolios are in the process of being 
revitalised and expanded. Reported 
revenue grew 9%, with favourable 
foreign exchange translation benefits 
partially offset by the impact of the 
divestment of the Wallace product line 
and the underlying revenue softness.
Underlying
1
 revenue declined by 3% 
in Infusion Systems due to lower sales 
in hospital infusion hardware and 
disposables, and a slower than anticipated 
transition to advanced technology 
ambulatory pumps in the home infusion 
market. Vascular Access underlying
1
 
revenue declined by 4% as growth in cardio 
thoracic was offset by declines in sharps 
safety and peripheral intravenous catheters 
(PIVC). Underlying
1
 revenue from Vital Care 
and Specialty Products was down 2%, with 
continued growth in tracheostomy and 
respiratory COPD products being offset 
by declines in temperature management 
and commoditised anaesthesia products.
Sales into higher-growth regions decreased 
12% on an underlying
1
 basis. This decrease 
was driven by a one-off regulatory situation 
in China which has now been resolved.
Headline operating profit grew 8% on 
an underlying
1
 basis with operational 
efficiencies and a medical device tax 
refund more than offsetting the impact 
of the revenue declines and downward 
pricing pressure on older products. 
The headline operating margin of 
22.0% was 60bps higher than the prior 
year. The difference between statutory 
and headline operating profit reflects 
£16m of restructuring charges, £6m 
amortisation of intangible assets, and 
a £100m gain on the sale of Wallace.
Return on capital employed increased 
100bps to 16.7%, reflecting improved 
profitability that supported greater capital 
expenditure in new product development, 
capacity and manufacturing efficiency. 
In November 2016 Smiths Medical divested 
the Wallace product line as part of an 
ongoing programme to focus the portfolio 
on scalable, technology-differentiated 
leadership positions in its chosen markets.  
Prior to the sale, Wallace revenue was 
£5m, with operating profit of £4m and 
net assets sold were £32m. The business 
performance of Wallace up to the date of 
divestiture is included within the financial 
summary and results presented above.
Research and development
During the year Smiths Medical 
increased investment in research and 
development to support future growth, 
with the development of innovative, 
commercially focused products across 
the portfolio generating a strong pipeline 
of products due to be launched in FY2018 
and beyond. Research and development 
expenditure increased to £61m (2016: 
£52m), representing 6.4% of sales (2016: 
6.0%). Specific developments included:
• within Infusion Systems, enhanced digital 
and information security capabilities, in 
particular wirelessly enabling the CADD 
line of ambulatory infusion pumps to 
connect to the PharmGuard server 
software, which received FDA clearance 
post year end;
• differentiated technology developments 
in Vascular Access including the Closed 
Blood Sampling System, the Jelco Seriva 
and ViaValve Winged Safety peripheral 
catheters and the Delta Ven Closed 
System catheter; and
• a strong pipeline of new products in Vital 
Care, particularly in the tracheostomy 
product lines.

DID YOU KNOW...
Our trace detectors can identify a 
billionth of a gram of explosives on 
a person’s hands. 
Smiths Detection is a leader in its 
sector and produces equipment for 
customers in the air transportation, 
ports and borders, urban security and 
military end-use markets.
Markets and trends
Demand for our detection equipment and 
service is forecast to continue to grow 
at mid-single digits per annum over the 
near term, driven by ongoing geopolitical 
unrest and the resulting terrorist and 
criminal threats, but there is considerable 
variation by geography and end-use 
market. The majority of customers are 
government-funded so budget constraints 
affect market revenues. Nevertheless, our 
growing installed equipment base creates 
significant opportunities for aftermarket 
(service and support) and digital revenues 
through the sale of software upgrades. 
The heavily regulated air transportation 
sector is our largest market. Rising 
passenger volumes, together with 
continuing security threats, a strong 
replacement cycle and increasing air freight 
volumes from continuing globalisation 
of trade are expected to continue to 
support market growth and new airport 
investment. Integrated, networked systems 
of screening equipment and airport 
information are being used to improve the 
efficiency and effectiveness of the security 
process, resulting in increased demand. 
In the ports and borders market, continuing 
globalisation of trade, combined with 
increasing regulatory standards, will 
drive the growth in demand for security 
screening equipment and digital 
solutions that can integrate a disparate 
installed equipment base. Powerful 
technologies are required to address 
a variety of threats as governments 
become increasingly concerned about the 
smuggling of explosives, weapons and 
radiological materials, while continuing to 
recognise the strong revenue-generating 
potential from contraband detection. 
The urban security market is large, 
but fragmented and unregulated. 
Growth in demand continues as public 
and private sector organisations seek 
to provide better protection for their 
assets and staff in response to a wide 
and ever-increasing range of threats. 
Global demand for chemical warfare 
agent detection equipment and other 
threat-specific sensors required by the 
military is forecast to grow steadily in 
our key NATO-oriented markets. 
GROWTH DRIVERS 
• Persistent and evolving terror 
threats 
• Changing security regulations 
for air cargo and passengers
• Equipment replacement cycle, 
typically 7–10 years
• Software-driven solutions 
providing functionality, 
networking and systems 
integration 
• Growth of security 
infrastructure in emerging 
markets
COMPETITIVE STRENGTHS 
• A market leader with a 
strengthened global position 
following the Morpho acquisition
• Operate in several regulated 
markets requiring product 
certification
• Technologies leveraged across 
many markets and applications
• Growing aftermarket revenues 
(39% of total)

secured orders for hold baggage screening Explosives 
Detection Systems (EDS) worth over £80 million from 
airports in the Americas, Middle East and Europe.
 
Our next-generation scanners combine high-resolution 
X-ray technology, medical quality computed tomography 
and advanced detection algorithms to deliver exceptional 
levels of security and efficiency, while the ability to 
upgrade software to combat evolving threats helps to 
future-proof our customers’ infrastructure investments.

REPORT
Performance
Smiths Detection’s market-leading 
position in growing markets drove an 
underlying
1
 revenue increase of 4%, in 
particular in the air transportation market 
and in the Asia Pacific region. Focus on 
aftermarket supported growth in revenue 
and aftermarket revenue now accounts 
for 39% of total revenue (2016: 37%). On 
a reported basis, revenue grew by 31%. 
This included £62m revenue from the 
acquisition of Morpho Detection (Morpho), 
which completed in April 2017 and is now 
being integrated, as well as favourable 
foreign exchange translation benefits.
Underlying
1
 revenue in air transportation 
increased 9%, with strong growth in EMEA 
and Asia, including deliveries to Berlin 
Brandenburg Airport and revenue from 
long-term contracts in Abu Dhabi. Contract 
wins during the year include orders for 85 
CT hold baggage scanners for Amsterdam 
Airport Schiphol, London Gatwick Airport, 
Cochin International Airport, EL AL Airlines 
and by the US Transportation Security 
Administration (TSA). Post year end we 
have also won two additional contracts 
for orders totalling 55 CT scanners for 
Frankfurt Airport and Narita International 
Airport. Future growth in air transportation 
was also underpinned by key regulatory 
certifications achieved in the period. 
Revenue from ports and borders decreased 
by 2% on an underlying
1
 basis as growth 
in EMEA, including major deliveries in 
Africa, Italy and the Middle East, was 
offset by last year’s strong comparator 
due to the completion of a number of key 
programmes. Underlying
1
 revenue in 
military decreased by 2%, as a number of 
US military programmes started to wind 
down, partly offset by stronger growth in 
EMEA. Urban security revenues were flat 
on an underlying
1
 basis with strong growth 
in Asia and sales to emergency responders 
in the US, offset by lower sales elsewhere. 
We continued to experience pressure on 
government budgets in all regions, which 
was most marked in the US due to the 
effect of the Continuing Budget Resolution.
Revenue from higher-growth regions 
represented 21% of sales, broadly in line 
with prior year on an underlying
1
 basis.
Headline operating profit grew 21% 
on an underlying
1
 basis, reflecting the 
strong sales growth, increased focus on 
aftermarket and improved business mix. 
This growth in profitability was despite 
continued competitive pricing pressure 
on large programme contracts and the 
ongoing challenge from lower-priced 
competitors in unregulated parts of 
the market. Headline operating margin 
increased by 200 basis points to 15.0%. 
Headline reported operating profit 
improved 50%, including £8m profit 
contribution from the Morpho acquisition 
and £10m of favourable foreign exchange 
translation benefit. The difference between 
statutory and headline operating profit 
includes a £4m restructuring charge, 
£8m amortisation of intangibles and the 
£18m costs of the acquisition of Morpho.
Return on capital employed improved 
70 basis points to 12.6%, with higher 
profitability offsetting the dilutive 
impact of the acquisition of Morpho.
The acquisition of Morpho completed on 
6 April 2017 and significantly enhances 
Smiths Detection’s position in attractive 
growth markets and expands the product 
portfolio. Regulatory clearance for this 
acquisition was conditional on the post-
completion divestment of Morpho’s 
explosive trace detection business, 
which completed on 7 July 2017. For the 
four months since completion Morpho 
delivered headline revenue of £62m and 
headline operating profit of £8m with 
good air transportation sales during 
the second half of the year, including 
deliveries to the US TSA. The integration 
of Morpho is progressing well and we 
are confident that we will be able to drive 
even more benefits from the combination 
than initially anticipated and expect 
the acquisition to drive future margin 
expansion for the division overall.
 
Research and development 
Smiths Detection increased its investment 
in research and development during the 
year, accounting for 7.1% of sales, or 6.0% 
excluding customer-funded R&D (2016: 
5.2% and 4.7% respectively). Specific 
highlights include:
• for the air transportation market, x-ray 
machines capable of meeting the new 
EU/ECAC Standard C3, new versions of 
our Checkpoint.Evo remote screening 
software and faster CT machines for hold 
baggage screening;
• in the military market, the development 
of the next generation of chemical 
warfare detection devices; 
• in ports and borders we launched 
CORSYS, our large-scale enterprise 
platform that connects an entire ports 
and border security operation and 
supports the need for digital expansion in 
this market; and 
• we continue to focus on software 
development, building on the strengths of 
our existing business and Morpho’s 
software expertise, as well as value 
engineering projects to deliver 
competitive products in cost-critical 
sectors, as well as country-specific 
versions of some of our most successful 
products.

Smiths Interconnect provides high-
reliability innovative connectivity 
solutions for the defence, aerospace, 
space, rail, medical and 
semiconductor test end markets.
Markets and trends
We provide a range of mission-critical 
products to the defence market, including 
microwave technology, and ruggedised 
and high-speed connector solutions. 
These are deployed in the most extreme 
environments, such as in sensors, 
communications equipment and next-
generation radar systems. Global defence 
spending has been constrained in recent 
years, as governments maintained tight 
budget control. However, the current 
economic environment and increasing 
geopolitical uncertainty represent a 
platform for growth. New investment 
is focused on system upgrades in 
critical areas such as intelligence, 
surveillance and reconnaissance, force 
protection and force multipliers. 
In aerospace, we provide connectors, 
components and satellite communications 
antenna solutions for various aircraft 
and space applications. The commercial 
aerospace market remains robust, driven 
by increasing passenger and freight 
demand, particularly in developing 
regions, and the need to upgrade aircraft 
fleets to more efficient models. 
In the rail market, our cable solutions 
provide communications connectivity, while 
our ferrite components and connectors 
are used in applications such as control-
command and signalling in autonomous 
train systems. Growth is driven by 
increasing demand for sophisticated 
digital train systems that improve safety 
and security, high data-rate connectivity 
for passengers, and the distribution 
of high levels of electrical power. Rail 
applications can be some of the harshest 
environments our products face and 
qualifying products can be challenging. 
Our medical portfolio includes high-
reliability enhanced signal integrity 
performance connectors for applications 
requiring higher bandwidth and data rates, 
including advanced imaging, augmented 
reality, and surgical robotics. A growing, 
ageing population and the rise in chronic 
diseases continue to drive growth for 
the global medical market, especially 
in China and India. Consumers demand 
improved accuracy, efficiency and cost-
effectiveness in healthcare services, 
meaning aligning our technologies 
with the cost-control mindset of this 
market is a key consideration.

REPORT
INCREASING DIGITAL RELIABILITY
As computers, mobiles and smart devices become more 
advanced, so must the integrated chips that support 
them. We’re leading the way with our Volta 
semiconductor test solutions. Used for testing the 
integrated chip packages behind everything from 
Bluetooth and power management to digital displays, 
Volta significantly outperforms the competition in both 
durability and performance. 
By developing new electrical contact technologies and 
integrating manufacturing and assembly processes, we 
opened up an attractive new market segment and 
demonstrated our commitment to continuously 
innovating to meet the changing needs of our customers.
Performance
During the year Smiths Interconnect 
completed significant strategic and 
structural change to focus on fewer, 
higher-growth end markets. This 
included the divestments of the Power 
and Microwave Telecoms businesses and 
a major reorganisation of the business 
structure. In a period of considerable 
change the business was able to deliver an 
underlying
1
 revenue increase of 1%, driven 
by growth in both the space and aerospace 
segments. On a reported basis, revenue 
declined by 3%, as favourable foreign 
exchange translation benefits were offset 
by the impact of the divestments. Isolating 
the performance of the remaining core 
business, underlying
1
 revenue grew 3%. 
Underlying
1
 revenue grew by 20% in 
the space segment, driven by increased 
spending on Low Earth Orbit constellations 
and increased content of the next-
generation high-throughput satellites using 
flexible digital payloads. In aerospace, 
underlying
1
 revenue grew by 44%, driven 
by the continued deployment of our 
SATCOM antenna products and connector 
and component solutions on military and 
commercial airframes tied to new higher-
efficiency engines. The strong, double-
digit growth in both these segments was 
offset by small declines in the defence, 
semiconductor test and rail segments. 
Underlying
1
 revenue decline in defence 
of 4% reflected a slowdown in deliveries 
on several key defence programmes 
approaching end of life that was not 
offset by revenues from new programme 
wins. The medical segment grew, with 
underlying
1
 revenue up 4% tied to increased 
volume at one of our leading customers. 
Industry consolidation impacted the buying 
patterns of several of our key customers 
in the semiconductor test segment 
with underlying
1
 revenue down 4%. 
Operating profit grew 5% on an underlying
1
 
basis and the headline operating margin 
increased 30bps to 13.4%, driven by the 
benefits of restructuring activity in the 
prior year combined with a continued 
procurement and operational efficiency 
focus. The difference between statutory and 
headline operating profit primarily reflects 
a £72m profit on business disposals.
Return on capital employed increased 
110 basis points to 11.4%, driven by the 
higher profitability during the year and the 
positive mix impact of the two disposals. 
During the course of the year Smiths 
Interconnect disposed of both its Power 
and Microwave Telecoms businesses to 
concentrate on its remaining core with 
scalable, top three leadership positions 
in its chosen markets. Prior to the sale of 
the Power business in January 2017 sales 
were £47m, with headline operating profit 
of £7m and net assets were £157m. Prior 
to the sale of the Microwave Telecoms 
business in May 2017 sales were £55m, 
headline operating profit was £1m and net 
assets were £41m. The performance of 
both the Power and Microwave Telecoms 
businesses are included within the financial 
summary and results presented above.  
Research and development
Total research and development 
expenditure of £28m was £2m higher 
than the prior year, representing 6.7% 
of revenue. During the year Smiths 
Interconnect’s engineering function 
was realigned with our strategic market 
segments of defence, aerospace, 
space, rail, medical and semiconductor 
test, with significant emphasis on 
driving improved time to market for 
new product development and an 
increased focus on developing product 
platforms over bespoke solutions. 
Product developments during the 
year included:
• for the space market, the development  
of the K2TVA Series to our Thermopad 
portfolio with an improved thick-film 
thermistor technology to enable more 
temperature compensation and mitigate 
the degradation at higher frequencies 
typical of this type of technology;   
• in semiconductor test we introduced a 
higher performance version of our 
DaVinci test socket, which can now be 
used to test the most advanced CPU and 
GPU semiconductor devices; and
• we also expanded our Outrigger resistor 
line with the CRHB 1216 product series, 
improving the power-to-size ratio of our 
resistor line, which has applications in 
most of our core markets.

DID YOU KNOW...
Our heated hoses maintain a 
constant air temperature and are 
helping sleep apnoea patients 
breathe more easily at night
Flex-Tek provides engineered 
components that heat and move fluids 
and gases for aerospace, consumer 
products, construction, medical and 
industrial applications. 
Markets and trends
Our business is structured around four 
segments: Heat Solutions, Construction 
Products, Fluid Management and Flexible 
Solutions. Key markets include US 
residential and commercial construction, 
global aerospace tubing and hoses, 
and electrical heating elements.
Our business performance generally 
follows macroeconomic indicators such as 
US GDP, US housing growth, healthcare 
spending and capital goods expenditure. 
Population growth drives residential 
construction and domestic appliance 
demand in the US, while high-growth 
markets drive commercial aerospace 
demand through increasing air passenger 
and freight volumes, and investment in 
next-generation aircraft. The diverse 
nature of our markets reduces our reliance 
on any specific technology, although we 
are primarily exposed to the US economy. 
In heating, we are one of the world’s 
largest manufacturers of open coil 
heating elements. These specialised 
elements and thermal systems provide 
consistent temperature controls to improve 
system efficiency and performance for 
heating ventilation and air conditioning 
(HVAC) equipment, tumble dryer, and 
other bespoke applications. Growth 
in Heat Solutions is largely driven by 
the US housing market, along with an 
increasing number of specialty heating 
applications in North America and 
Asia. Steady growth in US housing is 
also driving demand for our leading 
flexible gas piping and HVAC ducting in 
our Construction Products segment.
Our Heat Solutions elements are also 
used in the manufacturing of medical 
devices, and our Flexible Solutions hoses 
are used in this market too, particularly 
for respiratory care devices. Increasing 
global healthcare spend is driving growth.
In the automotive market our hoses are 
used to deliver fuel and brake fluid, and 
will play a crucial role in the delivery of gas 
and hydrogen in next-generation vehicles.  
In aerospace, we are a market-leading 
provider of specialty, high-performance 
flexible and rigid Fluid Management 
tubing assemblies that provide reliable, 
efficient delivery of hydraulic fluids and jet 
fuel for commercial and military aircraft 
globally. The market for commercial 
aircraft remains strong, with an OEM 
order book of over 13,000 aircraft.

QUICK, CONTROLLABLE COMFORT
From hospitals and office spaces to indoor sports 
arenas, our new E-series duct heater technology is 
helping to control zone temperatures across a range  
of complex environments. With improved electrical 
efficiency, a wider range of watt densities, and 
symmetrical design to ensure versatility, our  
Tutco business line is driving innovation in the  
duct heater market.
Even with a fully custom design, we have reduced our 
lead time to as little as 24 hours – significantly less  
than the competition – allowing us to reach new 
customers in the fast-moving construction and  
product replacement markets.
Performance
Flex-Tek delivered a strong performance, 
with revenue up 3% on an underlying
1
  
basis, driven by growth in all segments 
except Fluid Management. On a reported 
basis, foreign exchange translation 
benefits led to revenue growth of 19%.
Construction revenue grew 2% on an 
underlying
1
 basis, with both Gastite and 
Thermaflex benefiting from growth in 
the US housing market and Gastite’s 
increasing European presence. Heat 
Solutions revenue increased by 12% on 
an underlying
1
 basis, principally due to 
growth in its engineered solutions. Flexible 
Solutions underlying
1
 revenue growth of 
3% was driven by increased demand from 
the medical sector, partially offset by a 
decline in the floor care segment. Fluid 
Management revenue was down 2% on an 
underlying
1
 basis, primarily due to order 
timing issues associated with a specific 
customer. The aerospace market for 
components otherwise remained strong.
Headline operating profit increased 11% 
on an underlying
1
 basis to £65m and the 
headline operating margin increased 
130bps to 19.3%. Margins expanded in all 
segments with the exception of Thermaflex 
due to pricing pressure. Improvements 
in profitability were driven by positive mix 
in Heat Solutions, procurement savings 
in Gastite and Flexible Solutions, and 
continued strong operating cost control. 
The difference between statutory and 
headline operating profit is primarily due 
to the £4m release in the provision for 
Titeflex Corporation subrogation claims 
due to increasing US discount rates.
Return on capital employed increased 
420 basis points to 35.8%, driven 
by improved profitability.
Since the year end Tutco LLC, part 
of the Heat Solutions business, has 
signed an agreement to purchase the 
heating element division of Osram, 
broadening its portfolio into faster-
growing engineered heating solutions.
Research and development
Total research and development 
expenditure remained broadly consistent 
at 0.6% of sales, focused on market-
leading innovative solutions to meet 
specific customer needs. In particular:
• the continued development of 5000psi 
aerospace tubing for a broader range of 
applications;
• in Gastite, the further development of its 
technology-leading FlashShield product 
to improve ease of installation;
• heat Solutions refocused development of 
flexible heaters, with a new production 
cell for this product now operational; and  
• Flexible Solutions expanded the use of its 
heated wire hose technology in medical 
hose applications.

Non-headline items relating to continuing 
activities excluded from headline profit 
before tax
These items amounted to a gain of £73m 
compared to a charge of £105m in 2016. 
They comprised:
• £175m gain on the four disposals made  
in the year: £4m on John Crane Artificial 
Lift, £100m on Smiths Medical Wallace, 
£22m on Smiths Interconnect Power

Taxation
The principles of the Group’s approach to 
taxation remain unchanged. The Group 
seeks to manage the cost of taxation in 
a responsible manner to enhance its 
competitive position on a global basis 
while managing its relationships with tax 
authorities on the basis of full disclosure, 
co-operation and legal compliance. A 
semi-annual tax report is reviewed by the 
Audit Committee to monitor compliance 
with these principles to ensure the 
Group delivers its tax objectives.
The headline tax charge for 2017 of £140m 
(2016: £113m) represented an effective 
rate of 26.5% on the headline profit before 
taxation (2016: 25.0%). On a statutory basis, 
the tax charge on continuing activities 
was £29m (2016: £85m), representing an 
effective tax rate of 4.8% (2016: 24.6%), 
impacted by the recognition of UK deferred 
tax assets and gains on sale of businesses 
which were either non-taxable or sheltered 
by previously unrecognised losses.
The Group aims to utilise global 
manufacturing, research and 
development and other tax incentives, 
to allocate its capital in the most tax-
efficient manner where the regulatory 
environment allows, and to ensure 
the effective and timely management 
of its tax filings and compliance.
In 2017, the Group paid £82m in direct 
corporate tax on profits (2016: £62m) and 
£116m in employment and other taxes 
(2016: £105m). The Group additionally 
collected £224m on behalf of tax 
authorities, primarily from employees 
but also other indirect taxes such as VAT 
(2016: £210m). The total amount of tax 
paid over to tax authorities during the 
year totalled £422m (2016: £377m). 
A rate of between 29.5% and 30.0% is 
expected in the year ending 31 July 2018.
Earnings per share
Basic headline earnings per share from 
continuing activities were 97.6p (2016: 
85.2p). The reported 15% increase was 
driven by favourable foreign exchange 
movements and higher operating profit 
partly offset by an increase in the effective 
tax rate to 26.5% from 25.0% in 2016.

EARNINGS PER SHARE PENCE
On a statutory basis, the basic earnings 
per share from continuing activities was 
144.1p (2016: 65.6p), reflecting the profit on 
disposal of businesses of £175m and lower 
non headline costs compared to 2016.
Cash generation and net debt
Operating cash generation remained 
strong, with headline operating 
cash-flow of £695m (2016: £520m), 
representing 118% (2016: 102%) of 
headline operating profit (see note 29 
to the accounts for a reconciliation of
headline operating cash and free cash-
flow to statutory cash-flow measures).
Movement in working capital was an inflow 
of £85m (2016: inflow of £9m), reflecting a 
reduction in inventory and receivables.

operating cash generated and reduced 
pension payments. Continued strong 
cash generation is expected in FY2018.
On a statutory basis, net cash inflow from 
operations was £479m (2016: £358m).

NET DEBT £M
Net debt at 31 July 2017 was £967m, 
a decrease of £11m in the year. On an 
underlying basis, excluding the impact 
of foreign exchange movements, net 
debt reduced by £72m, reflecting 
strong operational cash generation and 
the Morpho acquisition being largely 
financed from business disposals.
At the end of the period, the Group had 
gross debt of £1,749m (2016: £1,409m) and 
cash reserves of £782m (2016: £431m). Of 
this gross debt, £151m (2016: £270m) falls 
due for repayment within one year including 
the $175m 7.37% Notes due in February 
2018. On 11 August 2017, the Group prepaid 
these Notes in full from cash resources.
The maturity profile of the major tranches 
of the debt in issue is as follows;
2018 – £133m ($175m 7.37% bond)*
2019 – £189m ($250m 7.20% bond)
2022 – £301m ($400m 3.625% bond)
2023 – £533m (€600m 1.25% bond)
2027 – £574m (€650m 2.00% bond)
* prepaid in August 2017
Dividend
The Board has a progressive dividend 
policy for future payouts, with the aim 
of increasing dividends in line with 
the long-term underlying growth in 
earnings. This policy will enable us to 
retain sufficient cash-flow to finance 
our investment in the drivers of growth 
and to meet our financial obligations.
In setting the level of dividend payments, 
the Board will take into account prevailing 
economic conditions and future investment 
plans, along with the objective to maintain 
minimum dividend cover of around 2.0.
As part of our disciplined approach to 
balance sheet management, we seek to 
maintain a strong investment-grade credit 
rating with a net debt:EBITDA ratio of two 
time, or lower over the medium term. We 
would be willing to temporarily exceed 
this upper limit in the case of acquisitions, 
provided there were clear actionable 
plans to return to the upper limit of 2.0 
within an acceptable timeframe. For more 
information see note 25 to the accounts. 
Dividends paid in the year on ordinary 
shares amounted to £167m (2016: £163m). 
The Board has recommended a final 
dividend of 29.70p per share to be paid on 
17 November 2017 to shareholders on the 
register at close of business on 20 October. 
When added to the 2017 interim dividend 
of 13.55p per share paid on 28 April 2017, 
the 2017 full year dividend of 43.25p 
represents an increase of 3.0% on the 
2016 full year dividend of 42.0p per share.
Acquisitions and disposals
On 6 April 2017 we completed our 
acquisition of Morpho Detection for final 
consideration of £590m. A condition of 
this transaction receiving regulatory 
approval, was the subsequent disposal 
of Morpho Detection’s explosive trace 
detection business. This was sold to OSI 
Systems, Inc. on 7 July 2017 for £63m.
The Group has completed the disposal  
of a number of non-core businesses: our 
Artificial Lift business in John Crane for 
£29m in November 2016; our Wallace 
business in Smiths Medical for £132m in 
November 2016; our Power business in 
Smiths Interconnect for £164m in January 
2017; and our Microwave Telecoms 
business in Smiths Interconnect for £85m 
in May 2017. Smiths Group plc  Annual Report 2017

Other financial information
Retirement benefits
As required by International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), the balance sheet 
reflects the net surplus or deficit in retirement benefit plans, taking assets at their  
market values at 31 July 2017 and evaluating liabilities at period-end AA corporate  
bond interest rates.
The tables below disclose the net status across a number of individual plans. Where any 
individual plan shows a surplus under IAS 19, this is disclosed on the balance sheet as a 
retirement benefit asset. The IAS 19 surplus of any one plan is not available to fund the 
IAS 19 deficit of another plan. The net pension position has improved to a surplus of 
£224m at 31 July 2017 from a surplus of £80m at 31 July 2016, benefitting from £105m  
of cash contributions in the year, the matching level between assets and liabilities, and 
changes in UK and US mortality assumptions.
The accounting basis under IAS 19 does not necessarily reflect the funding basis agreed 
with the Trustees and, should the schemes be wound up while they had members, they 
would need to buy out the benefits of all members. The buyouts would cost significantly 
more than the present value of scheme liabilities calculated in accordance with IAS 19.
The retirement benefit position is shown below:

Goodwill and intangibles 
Goodwill from acquisitions has been capitalised since 1998. Until 1 August 2004 it 
was amortised over a maximum 20-year period. Under IFRS goodwill is no longer 
amortised but instead is subject to annual reviews to test for impairment.
Intangible assets arising from business combinations (‘acquired intangibles’) are 
assessed at the time of acquisition in accordance with IFRS 3 (Revised) and are amortised 
over their expected useful life. This amortisation is excluded from the measure of 
headline profits. When indicators of impairments are identified, the intangible assets 
are tested and any impairment identified is charged in full. The impairment charge 
is excluded from the measure of headline profits. Other intangible assets comprise 
development costs or software which are capitalised as intangible assets as required 
by IFRS. Amortisation charged on these assets is deducted from headline profits.
Return on capital employed
The return on capital employed (ROCE) 
is calculated over a rolling 12-month 
period and is the percentage that headline 
operating profit comprises of monthly 
average capital employed. Capital 
employed comprises total equity adjusted 
for goodwill recognised directly in reserves, 
post-retirement benefit-related assets and 
liabilities net of tax, litigation provisions 
relating to exceptional items net of tax, 
and net debt. ROCE increased 90 basis 
points to 16.2% (2016: 15.3%), as a result of 
increased profitability across the Group.
Policies and judgements
Accounting policies
The accounts in this report are prepared 
under IFRS, as adopted by the European 
Union (EU). The accounting policies 
used in preparing these accounts 
are set out on pages 141 to 147.
Significant judgements, key assumptions 
and estimates
Applying accounting policies requires the 
use of certain judgements, assumptions 
and estimates. The most important of 
these are set out on pages 141 to 142.
Essential contracts
The divisional reviews describe 
our main customer and supplier 
relationships and the ‘Risks and 
uncertainties’ section outlines the risk 
management aspects of our contractual 
arrangements. Smiths Group has a 
wide range of suppliers and customers 
and, while the loss of, or disruption to, 
certain of these arrangements could 
temporarily affect the operations of an 
individual division, no single contract 
is considered essential to the Group.
Financial controls
While the Group’s decentralised 
organisation delegates day-to-day 
control to local management, the Group 
has comprehensive control systems 
in place, with regular reporting to the 
Board. The Group has comprehensive, 
formalised business risk management 
processes operating at each division.
The Internal Audit Department completes 
site-based reviews of reporting units, as 
set out in a risk-based audit plan reviewed 
and approved by the Chief Financial 
Officer and Audit Committee. Further 
information regarding the Group’s risk 
management procedures is set out in 
the Risk management section on pages 
60 to 61 and the Corporate governance 
statement on pages 82 to 102.

profile to be maintained. A report on treasury activities, financial metrics and compliance 
with the Policy is prepared monthly. This is circulated to the Chief Financial Officer each 
month and to the Audit Committee on a semi-annual basis.
The Policy maintains a treasury control framework within which counterparty risk, 
financing and debt strategy, cash and liquidity, interest rate risk and currency translation 
management are reserved for Group Treasury, while currency transaction management  
is devolved to operating divisions.
Centrally directed cash management systems exist globally to manage overall liquid 
resources efficiently across the divisions. The Group uses financial instruments to raise 
financing for its global operations, to manage related interest rate and currency financial 
risk and to hedge transaction risk within subsidiary companies.
The Group does not speculate in financial instruments. All financial instruments hedge 
existing business exposures and all are recognised on the balance sheet.
The Policy defines four treasury risk components and for each component a set of 
financial metrics to be measured and reported monthly compared against pre-agreed 
objectives.
Credit quality
The Group’s strategy is to maintain a solid investment-grade rating to ensure access to the 
widest possible sources of financing at the right time and to minimise the resulting cost 
of debt capital. The credit ratings at the end of July 2017 were BBB+ / Baa2 (both stable) 
from Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s respectively. An essential element of an investment-
grade rating is consistent and robust cash-flow metrics. The Group’s objective is to 
maintain a net debt/headline EBITDA ratio at two times or lower over the medium term.
Debt and interest rate management
Debt financing is managed centrally. At 31 July 2017 net debt was £967m (2016: £978m). 
The Group’s strategy is to finance the majority of its debt from long-term bond markets 
and at 31 July 2017 £1,730m of bonds were outstanding (2016: £1,392m). On 17 October 
2016 the Group signed a €2.5bn Euro Medium Term Note Programme and on 23 February 
2017 issued from it a €650m 2% bond with a maturity in 2027. The core backstop financing 
for the Group is provided by a $800m committed revolving credit facility provided by a 
group of ten global banking partners. This facility has a maturity in February 2021. The 
Group remains in full compliance with all covenants within its external debt agreements. 
The Group’s risk management objectives are to ensure that over time funding drawn from 
the bank market is less than 30% of net debt, the average maturity profile of gross debt is 
at or greater than four years and over 55% of gross debt is at fixed rates. At 31 July 2017, 
these measures were 0% (2016: 0%); 5.9 years (2016: 4.5 years) and 57% (2016: 47%).
Liquidity management
At 31 July 2017, the $800m committed 
bank facility was undrawn (2016: undrawn). 
The Group’s objective is to ensure that at 
any time undrawn committed facilities 
net of short-term overdraft financing are 
greater than £200m and that committed 
facilities have at least 18 months to run 
until maturity. At 31 July 2017, these 
measures were £607m (2016: £605m) and 
43 months (2016: 55 months). At 31 July 
2017, cash resources were £782m (2016: 
£431m). These resources included funds 
received from the 2017 €650m Notes 
issuance to prefund the repayment of 
the 7.37% $175m Notes in August 2017.
The Group aims to ensure that these 
resources are placed on deposit 
with highly-rated relationship bank 
counterparties at short-notice availability. 
Credit exposure to every approved bank is 
defined by the Treasury Risk Management 
Policy, with counterparty limits established 
by reference to their Standard & Poor’s 
long-term debt rating and CDS trading 
levels. At 31 July 2017, 98% (2016: 98%) 
of cash resources were on deposit with 
the ten global banking partners. Of these 
resources £82m (2016: £90m) was invested 
with counterparties rated less than A+.
Currency management
The Group has adopted hedge accounting 
for the significant majority of transaction 
hedging positions, thereby mitigating 
the impact of market value changes in 
the income statement. Material sales 
or purchases in foreign currencies are 
hedged at their inception by appropriate 
financial instruments, principally 
forward foreign exchange contracts 
and swaps. The Group’s objective is 
to reduce medium-term volatility to 
cash-flow, margins and earnings.
The Group is an international business with 
the majority of its net assets denominated 
in foreign currency. We protect our balance 
sheet and reserves from adverse foreign 
exchange movements by financing our 
foreign currency assets where appropriate 
in the same currency and targets that, 
where the value of net asset exposure is 
over £30m equivalent, over 50% of those 
assets are matched with the same currency 
liability. At 31 July 2017, 45% (2016: 50%) 
of total foreign currency assets were 
matched by related currency liabilities. Smiths Group plc  Annual Report 2017

Litigation
Smiths Group faces different types of 
litigation in different jurisdictions. The 
high level of activity in the US, for example, 
exposes the Company to the likelihood of 
various types of litigation, such as ‘mass 
tort’ and ‘class action’ litigation, legal 
challenges to the scope and validity of 
patents and product liability and insurance 
subrogation claims. These types of 
proceedings (or the threat of them) are 
also used to create pressure to encourage 
negotiated settlement of disputes.
John Crane, Inc. litigation
John Crane, Inc. (JCI), a subsidiary of 
the Group, is currently one of many 
co-defendants in litigation in the US relating 
to products previously manufactured which 
contained asbestos. This litigation began 
more than 30 years ago and, typically, 
involves claims for a number of diseases 
including asbestosis, lung cancer and 
mesothelioma. The JCI products generally 
referred to in these cases consist of 
industrial sealing products, primarily 
packing and gaskets. The asbestos was 
encapsulated within these products in such 
a manner that, according to tests conducted 
on behalf of JCI, the products were 
safe. John Crane ceased manufacturing 
products containing asbestos in 1985.
The litigation involves claims for a number 
of allegedly asbestos-related diseases, 
with awards for mesothelioma tending to 
be larger than those for the other diseases. 
JCI’s ability to defend mesothelioma cases 
successfully is, therefore, likely to have a 
significant impact on its annual aggregate 
adverse judgment and defence costs.
JCI continues to actively monitor the 
conduct and effect of its current and 
expected asbestos litigation, including the 
effective presentation of its ‘safe product’ 
defence, and intends to resist these 
asbestos cases based on this defence. 
Approximately 273,000 claims against JCI 
have been dismissed before trial over the 
last 38 years. JCI is currently a defendant 
in cases involving approximately 50,000 
claims. Despite these large numbers of 
claims, since the inception of litigation 
JCI has had final judgments against it in 
138 cases, and has had to pay awards 
amounting to approximately $160m.
At 31 July 2017, the aggregate provision 
for JCI asbestos litigation, including for 
adverse judgments and defence costs, 
amounted to £237m (2016: £252m)
expressed at the then current exchange 
rate. In deciding upon the amount of the 
provision, JCI has relied on independent 
expert advice from a specialist. The 
provision is based on past history and 
published tables of asbestos incidence 
projections and uses a 10-year time 
horizon. We consider that to forecast 
beyond ten years requires the litigation 
environment to remain largely unchanged 
with regard to estimating future asbestos 
expenditures. Historically this has not 
been the case with a significant change 
occurring more often than every ten years 
and therefore a 10-year time horizon 
has continued to be applied. Sensitivities 
around the provision time period have 
been included in note 22 to the accounts. 
In establishing this provision no account 
has been taken of any recoveries from 
insurers as their nature and timing are 
subject to pending litigation. Because 
of the significant uncertainty associated 
with the future level of asbestos claims 
and of the costs arising out of the related 
litigation, there is no guarantee that the 
assumptions used to estimate the provision 
will result in an accurate prediction of 
the actual costs that may be incurred.
Titeflex Corporation litigation
Titeflex Corporation, a subsidiary of 
the Group in the Flex-Tek division, has 
received a number of claims in recent 
years from insurance companies seeking 
recompense on a subrogated basis for 
the effects of damage allegedly caused 
by its flexible gas piping products being 
energised by lightning strikes. It has also 
received a number of product liability 
claims relating to this product, some in the 
form of purported class actions. Titeflex 
Corporation believes that its products are 
a safe and effective means of delivering 
gas when installed in accordance with 
the manufacturer’s instructions and 
local and national codes; however some 
claims have been settled on an individual 
basis without admission of liability.
At 31 July 2017, provision of £84m (2016: 
£94m) has been made for the costs which 
the Group expects to incur in respect of 
these claims. Because of the significant 
uncertainty associated with the future 
level of claims and of the costs arising 
out of the related litigation, there is 
no guarantee that the assumptions 
used to estimate the provision will 
result in an accurate prediction of the 
actual costs that may be incurred. Smiths Group plc  Annual Report 2017

REPORT
VIABILIT Y STATEMENT
In accordance with the requirements of 
the 2016 revision of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code, the directors have 
assessed the longer-term prospects 
of the Group, taking into account the 
current position of the Group and a range 
of internal and external factors, including 
the principal risks detailed on pages 
60 to 67 (the ‘viability assessment’). 
The directors have determined that a 
three-year period to 31 July 2020 is an 
appropriate time frame for the viability 
assessment. The selected period is 
considered to be appropriate as, based 
on the historic performance of the Group, 
a three-year outlook represents an 
optimum balance of long-term projection 
and acceptable forecasting accuracy. 
This time period also takes into account 
considerations such as the maturity 
of the Group’s borrowing facilities and 
the cyclicality of the performance of 
the Group’s underlying markets. 
In making this viability assessment, the 
directors have considered the current 
financial position and prospects of the 
Group, including the current year business 
performance, the detailed budget for 
2018 and the Strategic Plan. Against 
these financial projections the directors 
took into account the principal risks (as 
outlined on pages 60 to 67 to develop a 
set of plausible scenarios with potentially 
high-impact outcomes including: 
• product liability and litigation;  
• programme delivery;  
• supply chain disruption and business 
continuity;  
• fraud and corruption; and 
• compliance with laws and regulations. 
 
Consideration was then given to the 
magnitude of the gross risks and their 
potential impact, directly or indirectly, 
on the Group’s future performance 
and liquidity. The assessment included 
stress testing of the Group’s financial 
capacity to absorb the impact of such 
adverse events, either individually or 
in combination, and what mitigating 
actions the Group could take to respond 
to them in order to protect its business. 
The directors also considered the 
Group’s ability to raise additional 
liquidity. In performing this assessment 
the directors have taken comfort from 
the diversity of the Group’s businesses 
across different markets, industries, 
geographies, products and customers. 
Based on the robust assessment, 
the directors confirm that they have 
a reasonable expectation the Group 
will remain viable for the period being 
assessed and will continue to operate 
and meet its liabilities as they fall due. 
The directors have no reason to doubt 
that the Group will continue in business 
beyond the period under assessment. Smiths Group plc  Annual Report 2017

Risk governance
The Board and its committees set the ‘tone 
at the top’ and approve the strategy of the 
business. The Board ensures appropriate 
oversight and monitoring through a number 
of mechanisms including strategy reviews, 
committee meetings, management reports 
and focused reviews of selected risk areas.
On behalf of the Board, the Audit 
Committee is responsible for reviewing and 
assessing the effectiveness of the Group’s 
risk management and internal control 
systems. The review covers financial, 
operational and compliance controls, 
as well as the Group’s principal risks.
The Executive Committee is responsible 
for designing the Enterprise Risk 
Management (ERM) system and ensuring 
it is effectively deployed throughout the 
Group. The Executive Committee also 
ensures the Board’s risk appetite is 
understood by risk owners and decision-
makers in the business, and conducts an 
annual assessment of strategic risk.
Divisional and functional teams 
are responsible for the day-to-day 
management and reporting of risks. They 
identify new and emerging risks, escalate 
where appropriate and take action to 
manage risks as required. Our divisions 
also conduct an annual assessment of 
strategic risk with formal presentations 
to the Audit Committee each year.
Internal Audit provides independent and 
objective assurance to both the Audit and 
Executive Committees of the adequacy and 
effectiveness of our risk management and 
internal control processes. They facilitate 
the ERM process and provide site-based 
controls reviews and assurance reviews of 
key programmes, processes and systems.
We are very clear about the specific 
risks we face and take a proactive 
approach to risk management to 
maximise opportunities, drive better 
commercial decision-making, and 
protect our business and people.

HOW WE MANAGE RISKS
Within this governance framework, 
we operate a ‘three lines of defence 
approach’ to ensure clarity around roles 
and responsibilities and effective risk 
management. This model ensures the 
three layers – management control, 
risk and compliance, and independent 
assurance – are clearly defined and 
work effectively within our wider 
governance structures to manage the 
risks identified through our ERM.
The ERM process
Running any business involves constant 
risk management – it is an integral and 
often implicit part of day-to-day operations. 
Our ERM process is designed to ensure 
a constant feedback loop between the 
Board and Audit Committee, the Executive 
Committee, divisions, functions and sites, 
to enable us to manage and monitor the 
risks that threaten the successful execution 
of our strategy. This framework ensures 
our strategic, financial and operational 
risks are appropriately considered by the 
Executive Committee and the Board.
During 2017, a risk workshop was 
facilitated by the Director of Internal 
Audit at the Executive Committee. The 
workshop resulted in an update to the 
principal risk register which was presented 
to the Audit Committee. In addition, the 
Executive Committee selected three of 
the principal risks – a significant ethical 
breach, cyber security and quality at Smiths 
Medical – for deep dive reviews at both 
the Executive and Audit Committees.
A further 44 risk workshops were 
facilitated at key sites during the year 
to gather a ‘bottom-up’ view of risk. To 
ensure alignment, a summary of these was 
mapped to divisional risk registers and the 
Group’s principal risks and uncertainties.
The Board has reviewed the effectiveness of 
the risk management process, considering 
the principal risks and uncertainties, 
actions taken by management to manage 
those risks and the Board’s risk appetite in 
respect of each risk. The Board considers 
the risk management process to be 
effective. It recognises this is an ongoing 
process and work will continue in FY2018.

HOW WE MANAGE RISK Smiths Group plc  Annual Report 2017
62
We maintain a register of principal risks and uncertainties covering the strategic, operational, financial and compliance risks faced by 
the Group. We rate them according to likelihood of occurrence, potential impact and the likely ‘velocity’ of each risk. This measure 
reflects the expected time we would have to react were a risk to materialise. The ‘trend’ metric reflects the net position of a risk-taking 
into consideration both external factors and internal risk mitigation activities, when compared to the same time last year. We consider 
our current and target exposure to each risk, which defines our risk appetite.
We updated our register of principal risks and uncertainties following our Executive Committee workshop held during FY2017 and made 
the following adjustments to the principal risks disclosed in the 2016 Annual Report:
• ‘Financial’ risk has been removed. We consider the diversified nature of our global operations and the financial strength of the Group 
provide appropriate mitigation such that this risk does not require a standalone disclosure.
• ‘Pension Funding’ risk has been removed. We consider the increased strength of the funding level of the Group’s defined benefit 
pension arrangements and the actions agreed on 17 November 2015 and 1 March 2016 in order to address potential funding shortfalls 
in the Smiths Industries Pension Scheme and TI Group Pension Scheme.
While we continue to monitor and manage a wider range of risks, the table below summarises those we feel most likely to have the 
greatest impact on the business if they were to materialise and the key mitigating actions taken to address them.

• We identify sole-source supplier risks and dual 
source where possible 
• The Procurement Leadership Team (PLT) 
continues to identify and monitor high-risk 
sole-source suppliers and puts in place 
mitigation plans, including qualification of 
alternative sources of supply where

In the ordinary course of business we are subject 
to litigation such as product liability claims and 
lawsuits, including potential class actions, 
alleging that our products have resulted or could 
result in an unsafe condition or injury. The 
mission-critical nature of many of our solutions 
makes the potential consequences of failure 
worse than would otherwise be the case. 
Potential impact
• Manufacturing flaws, component failures and/

products, many of which are used in critical 
applications where the consequences of a 
failure could be extremely serious and, in some 
cases, potentially catastrophic
• The Group, in particular Smiths Detection and 
Smiths Medical, may potentially be exposed to 
losses in the event of a cyber security breach 
relating to the Group’s products. These include 
not only customers’ losses, but also those of a 
potentially large class of third parties
• Our businesses are active in markets and

Our Responsible Business governance 
framework
Strong governance is essential to 
embedding responsible business practices 
across the Group. Our Board of directors 
oversees our approach to responsible 
business, including our Code of Business 
Ethics (the ‘Code’). The Board sets 
our strategic and financial objectives, 
establishes high ethical standards and 
robust risk management frameworks, 
and monitors succession planning.
The Audit Committee monitors how 
we implement and comply with the 
Code. It reports to the Board on the 
effectiveness of our internal controls 
and processes to identify, evaluate and 
manage significant business risks, 
including potential violations of the Code.
The Chief Executive and Executive 
Committee are responsible for delivering 
our responsible business strategy. They 
champion the strategy within the business, 
setting and continually reinforcing the ‘tone 
from the top’. This includes ensuring the 
Code is upheld, implementing supporting 
policies, setting targets and reviewing 
performance across key areas. 
Our corporate centre helps foster our 
sustainable business culture. It sets 
governance and risk management 
frameworks, and develops tools, policies 
and programmes that help to embed a 
strong culture of responsible behaviour 
and continuous improvement across the 
Group (including the Smiths Excellence 
System). Our divisions tailor these 
programmes to reflect their specific 
business needs and local regulations. 
Identifying our responsible business 
priorities
We use our strategy, risk management 
and stakeholder engagement processes 
to identify focus areas. We engage with 
a wide range of stakeholders – including 
our employees, customers, investors, 
industry bodies and suppliers – around 
the world on an ongoing basis and use 
their insights and feedback to help shape 
our activities and communication. 
We also use a range of external sources 
to identify potential issues. These include 
regulatory guidelines and legislation; peer 
reviews; sustainability standards and 
guidelines; and experts and consultants. 
Through this process we have identified 
a number of material issues, grouped 
under our five focus areas – Ethics; 
Health, Safety and Environment; 
People; Products; and Communities.
Our responsible business strategy
Our Group-wide responsible business 
strategy sets out our approach to 
these focus areas, underpinned by 
a robust governance framework 
and management approach. 
 
We set Group performance targets across 
a number of areas of responsibility, 
and our sites and divisions regularly 
report their performance. 
At Smiths, being a responsible 
business is firmly embedded in 
the ways we think and operate.
With around 22,000 people working in 
more than 50 countries, it is important 
that we maintain the highest standards 
of corporate responsibility. Behaving 
ethically, working safely, providing 
high-quality innovative solutions, 
reducing our environmental impact, 
developing and engaging our people, 
and contributing to our communities is 
fundamental to our long-term success.
Many of our products and services deliver 
valuable benefits to society and the 
environment, helping to reduce harm, 
keep people safe, improve efficiency 
and minimise environmental impact.
As a global technology company 
operating in highly regulated sectors, 
operating responsibly also helps 
us create long-term value by:
• Enhancing our reputation with our 
people, customers, suppliers and 
investors
• Winning business from customers who 
value responsible business performance
• Improving efficiency and reducing costs
• Providing a safe and ethical work 
environment that supports health and 
productivity, and reduces the risk of an 
ethical breach

REPORT
DOING THE RIGHT THING
Integrity is one of our core values and 
‘doing the right thing’ is at the heart of 
what it means to work at Smiths – and it 
was the theme of our FY2017 Business 
and Ethics conference, which brought 
together 100 leaders from across the 
organisation to consider the ethical 
issues we face at Smiths. 
Integrity is one of our core values 
and underpins our commitment 
to doing business the right way. It 
supports our ambition to establish 
Smiths as one of the world’s 
leading technology companies.
Being ethical means applying our 
shared values to our everyday actions 
and decisions. Acting with integrity 
helps to protect our reputation, 
business and people, safeguard our 
shareholders’ investment and support 
our ambition to become one of the 
world’s leading technology companies. 
We are continuously improving our 
approach and strengthening our ethical 
culture, so that everyone knows what is 
expected of them, where they could face 
exposure to ethical risks, how to ask for 
help and where to report concerns.
The Board is ultimately responsible 
for the ethical conduct of the Group 
and our employees. On behalf of the 
Board, the Audit Committee assesses 
the ethical risks to our reputation and 
performance, monitors the implementation 
of the Code, and reviews reports and 
investigations from our Ethics Alertline. 
They are supported by our cross-
divisional Business Ethics Council 
and Ethics and Compliance team, who 
design and implement our compliance 
programme, manage our Ethics Alertline, 
investigate breach allegations and 
promote the Code across the Group. 
They are supported by internal teams 
including HR, Legal and Internal Audit.
We aim to continuously reinforce a 
strong ethical culture and enhance our 
compliance programmes to address 
evolving areas of risk. In FY2017, our 
principal compliance programmes included 
modern slavery risks; trade compliance; 
supplier conduct; anti-bribery and 
corruption; antitrust; and data protection.
Culture
Our shared values underpin a culture 
of doing the right thing, every time, 
while the Code provides more detailed 
guidance on our expectations of 
employees. Our Chief Executive and 
Executive Committee champion our 
values and the Code, and set the tone 
through communications and interactions 
with employees and stakeholders.
We give everyone a copy of the Code when 
they join us. We support it with an online 
training course and refresher training every 
two years. Both the Code and the training 
come in our top 19 operating languages.
We want everyone to feel confident about 
speaking up if they have a concern. We offer 
an independently operated, confidential 
Ethics Alertline for those who feel 
uncomfortable with raising an issue with 
their manager. In FY2017, 182 issues were 
reported via the Alertline, all of which were 
thoroughly investigated and disciplinary 
action was taken in 26 instances.
Education and compliance
We regularly review and update our 
ethics training materials in line with 
changes to risks and regulations. Our 
training programmes cover risk areas 
such as competition and antitrust, 
anti-bribery and corruption, modern 
slavery, and trade and export controls.
Throughout the year we arrange global 
forums to deepen our managers’ 
understanding of the ethical challenges 
facing the business. In FY2017, we held 
regional events in growth markets 
such as Dubai, Indonesia, Thailand and 
China, as well as our Global Business 
Ethics Forum in San Diego, California. 
During FY2017, we continued to align 
and strengthen our global compliance 
programme across the business, further 
enhancing our central policies, training 
and oversight, including establishing 
a global centre of excellence for trade 
compliance and launching a new Gifts, 
Meals and Entertainment Policy. 
We are committed to upholding all 
internationally recognised human rights 
standards wherever we operate. We do 
not tolerate any use of child or forced 
labour within our facilities or those of 
our suppliers. During FY2017, we rolled 
out a policy and risk assessment to help 
address modern slavery risks. This 
can be found on www.smiths.com.
Our Supplier Code of Business Ethics, 
informs our suppliers, contract 
manufacturers and other third parties 
exactly what we expect of them in terms 
of ethics, compliance, human rights, 
and social and environmental issues.
As a global organisation we have to comply 
with numerous local and regional laws. 
To support this, we revised our Export and 
Import Controls Policy to provide better 
corporate oversight. We also conduct 
regular site-based reviews of trade activity 
to identify and manage any areas of risk.
FY2018 priorities
• Refresh and roll out our Code of Business 
Ethics and associated training
• Upgrade the Ethics Alertline operating 
system and raise employee awareness
• Hold regional ethics conferences in India 
and Eastern Europe
• Continue to enhance our risk 
management tools to better assess 
ethical risks, site by site
• Refresh and roll out our Supplier Code of 
Business Ethics and continue to embed 
our pre-qualification questionnaire for 
new suppliers
• Oversee the ongoing implementation  
of our Anti-Modern Slavery Policy

At Smiths we are determined 
to achieve world-class health, 
safety and environmental 
(HSE) performance. Wherever 
we operate, we aim to provide 
injury-free and environmentally 
responsible workplaces.
We are committed to protecting our 
people, communities, customers and 
the environment. This commitment is 
demonstrated by our comprehensive HSE 
Policy (available at www.smiths.com) and 
our HSE governance framework. Together, 
we are creating a culture that prioritises 
the health and wellbeing of our people and 
minimises our impact on the environment.
Our Chief Executive has ultimate oversight 
of HSE across the Group. Working closely 
with the Executive Committee, he is 
responsible for executing our Group-
wide HSE strategy, implementing our 
policies and processes, and meeting our 
HSE targets. To ensure these principles 
are fully and effectively embedded, the 
president of each division sets HSE 
programmes specific to their business. 
They are supported by the HSE Technical 
Committee who track performance, 
and identify areas for improvement.
By developing a shared approach to 
HSE across the Group, we manage our 
safety and environmental risks more 
effectively and provide better protection 
for our employees, our communities, the 
environment and shareholder value.
HSE management and compliance
Our management systems help us identify 
and prioritise HSE risks across the Group. 
They drive continuous improvement and 
provide the externally verified framework 
behind a consistent, best-practice 
approach to HSE management. Our HSE 
performance against Group targets is 
tracked on a site-by-site basis using 
dedicated HSE management software, and 
is reviewed by the Executive Committee.
We use external auditors to check 
compliance at sites, often as part of their 
management system certification. Audit 
findings drive corrective action plans and 
are shared with other sites to promote  
best practice. 
Environmental performance
To ensure we are using energy and natural 
resources efficiently, we implement world-
class production processes that decrease 
waste and energy consumption. We also 
invest in low-carbon technologies and 
environmental management systems that 
drive improvement in our performance.
In FY2013 we set new five-year 
environmental targets, having exceeded 
previous targets two years early. Using 
FY2013 as the baseline, our targets are 
to achieve a reduction of energy usage, 
Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions and 
waste generation of 15%, and water 
usage of 10% by FY2018, all normalised 
to revenue. By installing more energy-
efficient equipment, implementing water 
reuse programmes and focusing on 
green energy contracts, we have made 
good progress against these objectives. 
Compared to our baseline year of FY2013, 
we have achieved good progress in 
reducing our environmental metrics, with 
GHG and non-recycled waste already 
exceeding our five-year goal and water 
consumption on target. During FY2017, 
our overall environmental performance 
continued its long-term improvement trend 
with normalised reductions in energy, water 
usage and GHG emissions, while non-
recycled waste remained broadly in line. 
Absolute environmental metrics reduced 
in 2017 with 4% energy, 9% water usage, 
7% GHG, and 2% non-recycled waste.
See our 2017 Responsible Business  
Report or our website (www.smiths.com) 
for a detailed review of environmental 
performance. 
Energy and greenhouse gas
We measure and monitor energy 
consumption at a site level using our tracking 
software, which provides a consolidated view

Our GHG emissions calculations and 
reporting follows the Greenhouse Gas 
Protocol (operational approach) and 
cover emissions from all sources under 
our control, grouped under: Scope 
1 – direct GHG emissions from owned 
assets; and Scope 2 – GHG emissions 
from supplied electricity. Emissions from 
company vehicles, production processes 
and fugitive sources are small and not 
deemed to be material and, as such, 
are not included in reported totals.
Workplace health and safety
Our people are our most important asset 
and we are committed to protecting 
their health, safety and wellbeing and 
delivering a culture of zero harm. To 
achieve this, we are rolling out a series 
of Group-wide initiatives that drive 
continual improvements in our safety 
culture and shape our behaviours, 
while reducing exposure to risks.
We monitor various leading and lagging 
measures for health and safety. Safety 
Leading Indicator Activities assess 
initiatives undertaken by sites to improve 
performance and are established as 
a company KPI. We also monitor the 
Recordable Incident Rate (RIR) and Lost 
Time Incident Rate (LTIR) across the 
Group, measured per 100 employees 
per year. Since 2004, we have cut 
our RIR from 4.6 to 0.36, achieving 
our lowest RIR in FY2017. Our LTIR 
increased slightly to 0.16 in FY2017.

TAKING OWNERSHIP OF HEALTH AND SAFETY
With service teams often working in external environments outside our direct 
control, their ability to recognise unsafe conditions and act accordingly is critical. 
Smiths Detection has launched a new online training tool and web-based/mobile 
risk assessment platform that’s giving both leadership and field service engineers a 
better understanding of how to stay safe when working off-site. We encourage 
everyone at Smiths to take ownership of both their own health and safety and that of 
their colleagues, and this tool is helping our service teams do just that.  Smiths Group plc  Annual Report 2017

People are our one truly sustainable 
source of competitive advantage and 
critical to our growth strategy. We are 
passionate about helping them fulfil 
their potential so we can reach ours.
Our people strategy is focused on 
building a learning organisation that 
attracts, retains, engages, develops 
and inspires the very best people. We 
do this by focusing on four key areas – 
culture, leadership and learning, reward 
and recognition, and infrastructure. 
Culture, engagement and communication
We are building a culture based on our 
shared values of integrity, respect, 
ownership, customer focus and passion – 
and we are doing this through the Smiths 
Way, which we launched in April 2017. As 
well as using our shared values to guide 
our decisions and behaviours, we are 
aligning globally on key initiatives and 
a shared operating model to make us a 
bigger, better, more focused Smiths. 
We use regular surveys to measure 
engagement and gather insights into our 
employees’ experience and perceptions. 
A new survey – My Say – was launched in 
FY2017 to encourage an ongoing, two-way 
dialogue across the Group, with a refreshed 
set of questions that better align with our 
new strategy and culture, more granular 
reporting, and increased frequency. We 
achieved a participation rate of 82% and 
an employee engagement score of 71 
across the Group in our latest survey. The 
data and insights gathered will be used 
to identify global priorities for FY2018.
Leadership and learning
Providing our employees with the best 
learning and development opportunities 
is a vital aspect of our people plan. 
Line managers and HR professionals 
work with employees to identify their 
skills, areas for improvement and 
development opportunities. These personal 
development plans form a key part of our 
annual performance review process.
Competition for talent is increasing so it 
is essential we can identify and engage 
with our leaders through world-class 
development programmes. In FY2017 
we launched an executive development 
programme in partnership with UCLA 
Anderson Executive Education. The 
programme currently has two streams 
– leadership and strategy, and finance – 
and has been successfully piloted with a 
cohort of our senior leaders, with three 
further cohorts set to participate in 
FY2018. These programmes challenge 
and engage our team and enhance 
their core leadership capabilities.
Reward and recognition
Recognising and rewarding our employees 
in a fair and transparent way ensures that 
our people feel incentivised to succeed, 
that strong performance is recognised, 
and that individuals are differentiated 
based on abilities and results. To 
reinforce this, a global grading project is 
being rolled-out to help identify distinct 
career paths for all employees. Initially 
focusing on our leadership population, 
the programme will be rolled out to the 
wider organisation during FY2018. 
During the year, we introduced new 
incentive plans for some of our employees 
that align individual objectives with the 
delivery of our growth strategy, such 
as Smiths Excellence System and sales 
targets. Incentive plans are adapted each 
year as specific focus areas change.
Diversity and inclusion
Respect is one of our core values and we 
aim to provide an inclusive, collaborative 
culture where respecting diversity is woven 
into everything we do. We ensure that 
equal opportunities are practiced when 
interviewing, recruiting and promoting 
employees with decisions made based on 
skills and expertise first and foremost.
In FY2017 we introduced a Group Culture 
and Diversity function to increase our 
focus on diversity and inclusiveness across 
the business. Specific diversity-focused 
questions were added to the engagement 
survey, and an online training course 
addressing unconscious bias was piloted 
across several business functions.
PE O PL E
SMITHS EXCELLENCE AWARDS 
We believe that recognition is broader than reward  
and compensation and the Smiths Excellence Awards 
recognise the highest levels of achievement across our six 
pillars of Excellence, as well as outstanding contributions 
to Health and Safety and our communities. 
This year, we expanded the programme to celebrate 
success more widely and further embed Excellence 
across the business by rolling out a tiered scheme, with 
divisional winners being rolled up into an overarching 
Group scheme. The winning teams were celebrated at

Employees (total) 13,600 8,300 21,900
* Senior managers are as defined by the Companies Act 2006 (Strategic Report and Directors’ Report) Regulations  
2013, which includes employees who have responsibility for planning, directing or controlling the activities of the  
Group or a strategically significant part of the Group (other than Board members) and/or who are directors of  
subsidiary undertakings. 
We are committed to broadening the 
diversity of our workforce and are 
developing programmes such as our 
global Women’s Leadership Network 
that increase the diversity of candidates 
for senior positions. At the end of 
FY2017, 38% of our global workforce 
and 14% of our senior managers were 
women. In addition, two of our Board 
directors are women, representing 
22% of the Board as at 31 July 2017.
It is our policy to provide equal employment 
opportunities. The Group recruits, selects 
and promotes employees on the basis 
of their qualifications, skills, aptitude 
and attitude. In employment-related 
decisions, we comply with all applicable 
antidiscrimination requirements in 
the relevant jurisdictions. People with 
disabilities are given full consideration 
for employment and subsequent training 
(including retraining, if needed, for people 
who have become disabled), career 
development and promotion on the 
basis of their aptitudes and abilities. We 
endeavour to find appropriate alternative 
jobs for those who are unable to continue 
in their existing job because of disability.
We believe all our employees should 
be treated with respect and dignity. 
Accordingly, any harassment or bullying 
is unacceptable. The Group respects 
the right of each employee to join or not 
to join a trade union or other  bona fide 
employee representative organisation.
FY2018 priorities
• Continue to embed the Smiths Way of 
working, including our shared values
• Integrate workforce planning with talent 
development to ensure we develop the 
right people to drive our strategy 
• Develop and implement our unique 
employer brand to help attract and retain 
the best talent
• Continue the roll-out of our global 
job-grading programme to support  
the creation of new job opportunities, 
career paths, and aligned remuneration 
across Smiths
IMPROVING MOTIVATION ON THE SHOP FLOOR
Recognising the key role supervisors play in employee engagement and operational 
performance, John Crane launched a Supervisor Development Programme in 
Bangalore, India. By building the knowledge and skillset of site supervisors, the 
programme has increased motivation and engagement among shop floor 
production teams, as well as creating a new passion for learning.
 
Sathishbabu Palani, Continuous Improvement Manager at John Crane said: 
“The scheme has been really successful – it’s enabling our people to become 
better coaches to their teams and ultimately improve safety, productivity and 
team engagement.” Smiths Group plc  Annual Report 2017

PROTECTING PEOPLE FROM 
DANGEROUS SUBSTANCES
The threat of fentanyl, a highly dangerous pain relief drug 
that can be absorbed through the skin, is on the rise and 
Smiths Detection has adapted its leading-edge technology 
to detect and identify it – helping protect the security and 
health professionals coming into contact with this 
dangerous substance in emergency situations. And the 
ReachBackID 24/7 hotline service has been enhanced so 
first responders using our products in the field can speak 
directly to PhD scientists to help them better analyse 
situations and reduce risk.
PROTECTING THE 
EN V IRONMEN T
John Crane’s non-contacting gas 
seal technology has been helping to 
protect the environment for nearly 
40 years. This innovation helped 
slash methane emissions from 
centrifugal compressor shaft seals 
by a factor of 10 – helping natural 
gas processing and transmission 
companies reduce their carbon 
footprint across the world. Gas Seal 
technology is now the de facto 
standard on new equipment and can 
be readily retrofit into most existing 
equipment in the field.
Many of our solutions play a mission-
critical role in our customers’ 
operations and ensuring consistently 
high standards of quality and safety 
through their manufacture, distribution 
and end use is essential to our 
reputation and long-term success. 
The Smiths Excellence System drives 
our approach to quality, both within 
Smiths operations and throughout 
our supply chain, ensuring consistent 
best practice across the business. 
We are also committed to using 
materials that are ethically and safely 
sourced. Where possible, we look for 
ways to ‘design out’ or replace less 
sustainable materials and chemicals 
used in our manufacturing processes 
with more sustainable alternatives. 
Technological differentiation is critical 
to outperforming in our chosen markets 
on a sustainable basis and innovation 
is a key part of our growth strategy. 
Our New Product Introduction process 
assesses the current and future needs of 
customers and considers health, safety, 
security and environmental outcomes 
when determining and developing the 
solutions that make up the pipeline. 
P R OD U C T S
By developing leading-edge, 
mission-critical solutions, we help 
to drive safety, security, health, 
productivity, reliability, connectivity 
and progress around the world, 
every day. Our solutions enable 
customers to operate in safe, 
efficient and environmentally-
friendly ways, and we ensure that 
our products meet the highest 
standards of quality and safety.
From Smiths Medical’s products which are 
vital to patient care globally; and Smiths 
Detection’s security scanners, which play a 
vital role in enhancing security around the 
world; to John Crane’s seals, which help 
its customers reduce their environmental 
impact – we provide innovative solutions to 
some of the world’s toughest challenges.

COMMUNITY GIVING  
IN COSTA RICA
The team at Smiths Interconnect, 
Costa Rica, ran a wide-ranging 
community programme during the 
year. The team supported projects 
ranging from sponsoring a shelter for 
at-risk teenagers and young mothers 
– providing food, clothing and baby 
supplies , as well as helping with 
building repairs and maintenance – 
through to a re-forestation project in 
the local national park. 
The team of volunteers showed real 
passion for the initiative and were 
recognised at our 2017 Smiths 
Excellence Awards as an outstanding 
example of supporting local 
communities where we operate. 
FUNDING FOR  
CLEAN WATER
Clean water is in short supply in many 
parts of the world. In the developing 
nations people have to walk around 
5km each day to collect water that’s 
often dirty and contaminated. 
To help raise funds for clean water, 
Smiths Medical organised a global 
sponsored water walk across its sites. 
In total, more than 1,800 employees 
from 26 sites took part in 5km walks. 
Together they walked 10,000km, 
donated 25,000 litres of water  
through water collection drives  
and raised money for the Red Cross 
and other charities.
Supporting the communities in which 
we operate helps drive prosperity 
locally – providing jobs, boosting 
the economy and supporting local 
initiatives – as well as enhancing 
both employee engagement and 
our reputation as an employer. 
Given the diversity of our business, we 
manage our community relationships 
and charitable programmes at a local 
level, so each business can focus on its 
own markets and communities. We also 
offer Group-level support to charities 
and organisations that can show how a 
donation will increase the wellbeing of 
people through improvements to their 
education, health, welfare or environment. 
In FY2017 the Group made charitable 
donations of £348,000. In addition, our 
employees donated and raised money for a 
number of good causes, through a range of 
fundraising initiatives across the business.
Our global footprint means we generate 
financial value for a wide range of 
communities. As well as paying 
wages and benefits to our c. 22,000 
employees worldwide, we contribute 
to local economies through taxes, 
duties, infrastructure investment, and 
purchase of local goods and services.
We encourage our people to get involved 
in their local communities as it promotes 
employee engagement and builds a 
sense of pride in our business. We 
celebrate the best of these initiatives 
through our Excellence Awards scheme. 
The ten winning teams from across our 
Excellence pillars also receive $1,000 
to donate to a charity of their choice.

C HA IR MA N’S IN T R O D U C T I O N
SIR GEORGE BUCKLEY
CHAIRMAN
During 2017 the Smiths leadership team have continued 
on the path of building our ‘new future’.
Elsewhere in this Annual Report you will read about our story – 
how we are creating a more vibrant, faster growing and innovative 
company and how this will benefit our investors, employees and 
other stakeholders alike. In this Corporate Governance Review you 
will read about the part your Smiths Board of Directors has played 
during the year and our plans for the future. 
The building blocks of any great company include ensuring there is 
a strong framework of company governance. This should never be 
done with a ‘tick box’ mindset; it needs to be engaged, thoughtful 
and effective. Boards need to take the lead to set a positive culture 
and to make sure that good governance forms a firm foundation for 
decision making throughout the company. The Smiths Way was 
launched in 2017 and this framework provides our shared set of 
values, a common approach to strategy, and a commitment to 
excellence across all our businesses. 
Our ambition for Smiths is one with innovation and growth in its 
DNA, but also where colleagues act with integrity and respect 
towards each other and keep each other safe. It is often said that the 
true test of integrity is that you do the right thing – even when no one 
is watching, and I can assure you that the Board gives a great deal of 
focus to corporate governance in its widest and deepest sense. The 
Audit Committee reviewed the Group’s ethics and compliance 
programme during the year, which has led to a number of significant 
improvements. We also strengthened our anti-slavery compliance 
programme and published an updated Smiths Modern Slavery 
Statement which affirms our commitment not to tolerate this in any 
part of our business or supply chain. 
Another fundamental and vital building block is people. The 
Nomination Committee of the Board sponsored the new Group-
wide process for talent and succession planning across Smiths 
and we continue to work to achieve an appropriate balance of 
experience, skills, domain knowledge and background in both 
the Boardroom and at senior leadership levels of the Group. 
We are mindful of the reports from Sir Philip Hampton and (the 
late) Dame Helen Alexander and from Sir John Parker in the 
areas of women in leadership positions and ethnic diversity 
respectively, and are committed to staffing diverse Board 
and senior leadership teams. We firmly believe that diversity 
improves our performance as it produces better ideas. 
Board succession and composition continues to be a priority for 
the Board and I was delighted that Noel Tata was appointed to the 
Board as an additional non-executive director in January 2017. 
Noel brings a very valuable and distinct contribution to Smiths 
with his current experience and connections in those economies 
where we are focusing on higher levels of growth. In May 2017 
Chris O’Shea stepped down as Chief Financial Officer to pursue his 
career outside the Group. I was delighted that Bill Seeger agreed 
to take on the role of Interim Chief Financial Officer whilst we 
carried out a search for a replacement. I was also delighted that 
Mark Seligman agreed to take on a key non-executive role as Audit 
Committee Chair. I am personally grateful to Bill and to Mark, and 
to Anne Quinn as Chair of the Remuneration Committee, for all the 
support they have shown to me and to Andy over recent months. As 
further detailed in its report, the Nomination Committee continues 
to keep Board composition and succession plans under regular 
review, but with an eye to maintaining a good measure of stability 
and continuity during a time of significant change for the Group.
As Chairman I am responsible for leading an effective Board 
and I am pleased to report that your Board has been effective 
during the year. Details of the annual appraisal process and 
the actions and improvements that we agreed to drive through 
2017 are set out on pages 89 and 90 of this Report. I want to 
take this opportunity to record my thanks to all members of 
the Board for their hard work and support throughout the 
year. I hope you find this report interesting and enlightening 
as it details the work the Board and its Committees have 
carried out on your behalf during the year. I strongly urge you 
to attend this year’s shareholders Annual General Meeting 
and take the opportunity to engage with us in person.

The Board of directors is collectively responsible for ensuring 
the long-term success of Smiths. This includes reviewing and 
approving strategy in order to create sustainable value for the 
shareholders, as well as setting the Company’s culture and values. 
This is underpinned by a strong framework of good governance, 
including the Board’s responsibility for setting risk appetite.
Governance structure 
In order to fulfil their collective responsibility effectively, the 
Board of directors has established the Audit, Nomination and 
Remuneration Committees. Each Committee has authority 
delegated to it by the Board, and their responsibilities, 
activities and membership are described in this corporate 
governance statement. The full terms of reference 
for each Board Committee have been approved by the 
Board and are available online at www.smiths.com. 
L E A D E R S HI P
There is a clear division of responsibilities between the Board  
and the Executive Committee and senior management, who are 
responsible for the day-to-day management of the business, 
including the execution of strategy set by the Board. 
The role of the Board
The directors are responsible for the long-term success of the Group, 
and in order to retain control over decision-making there is a formal 
schedule of matters which have been reserved for the decision of 
the Board, as opposed to those matters that are delegated to 
management. These matters include approval of the following:
• Group strategy, business plans and budgets
• half-yearly financial reports and the Annual Report and Accounts
• acquisition or divestment of significant companies or businesses
• remuneration policy for directors and other senior executives
• changes to the structure, size and composition of the Board
• the issuance of Smiths Group plc shares
* In addition to the above there are a number of functional committees which include the Environmental Health and Safety Steering Committee, i

 (Smiths innovation forum), and the 
Business Ethics Council.

Only the Board has the authority to approve any changes to the 
formal matters reserved for its decision-making. The full list was 
reviewed in July 2017 and can be found online at www.smiths.com.
To ensure that they continue to operate effectively the directors 
have at least six formal Board meetings a year. Board meeting 
agendas have been reshaped during the year to include more time 
to focus on the long term, and less on backward-looking financial 
information and performance. Board agendas include a review of 
elements of the Group strategy and its execution at each meeting, 
in addition to the meetings focused on strategy which take place in 
May each year. Regular matters for review by the Board, including 
the Group’s financial performance, divisional business plans and 
progress against them, budgets, mergers and acquisitions, 
material investments, large projects, the people plan and possible 
threats to the business, are all considered by the Board under the 
framework of the agreed strategy. The Board also assesses the 
implementation of strategy within a framework of prudent and 
effective controls; a key part of ongoing risk management is 
ensuring that the strategy in place remains fit for purpose.
The Board is responsible for steering our culture and our shared 
values of integrity, ownership, respect, customer focus and 
passion. The Board sets the tone from the top and oversees key 
programmes, including ethics and compliance, health and safety 
and our people plan. In 2017 the Board supported the launch of the 
Smiths Way, a shared way of working that includes our values, 
operating model and strategy. As part of this we celebrate the  
best examples of excellence in Smiths with our annual Excellence 
Awards, and members of the Board attended the gala dinner  
for winners in April 2017.
Division of responsibilities 
While the Board is collectively responsible for the success of 
the Group, there is a clear division of responsibilities between 
running the Board and the executive responsibility for running the 
business. The Board recognises the importance of ensuring that no 
one individual should have unfettered powers of decision-making, 
and has clearly defined roles for the Chairman and the Chief 
Executive which have been agreed by the Board. A summary of the 
responsibilities of the Board are identified in the adjacent table.
In order to fulfil his role effectively the Chief Executive is supported 
by the Executive Committee. The Committee normally meets once 
a month, and includes the five divisional Presidents, the Asia 
President and the functional heads. The Committee’s 
responsibilities include ensuring the Group’s continued financial 
performance, day-to-day management of the Company’s business 
and the implementation and delivery of the strategy set by 
the Board.

Board composition 
The Board composition as at 22 September 2017 is detailed in 
the attendance table on page 88, and the relevant skills and 
experience each director brings to the Board are described in 
their biographies on pages 78 to 81. 
In order to operate effectively the Board and its Committees must 
be comprised of a suitable balance of tenure, skills, experience, 
knowledge and independence. The Board and the Nomination 
Committee keep this under regular review, and in 2017 concluded 
that the range of experience and diversity of skills has allowed the 
Board to effectively discharge its duties and responsibilities. 
Diversity 
The directors believe that a mix of experience, interests and 
personalities ensures the effective functioning of a Board in which 
the dialogue is both challenging and constructive. The Board 
currently has no quota in place to achieve diversity. 
The diagrams below illustrate the independence of the Board 
and also its composition and balance as at 22 September 2017. 
In particular, the tenure of longer standing Board members 
and more recent appointments, ensuring both continuity and 
fresh perspectives, and the diversity in gender and nationality 
on the Board.
Time commitment 
Each of the directors must be able to allocate sufficient time to 
the work of the Board in order to discharge their responsibilities 
effectively. The current directorships in listed companies and other 
significant commitments of the Chairman and the non-executive 
directors are shown on pages 78 to 81. Ahead of his appointment 
as non-executive director in January 2017, the Board assessed 
Noel Tata’s other commitments and agreed that, as many of his 
other appointments are as part of his employment in the Tata 
Group, he is able to commit sufficient time to the work of the 
Smiths Board. 
The Board considers the external appointments of each of 
the directors twice yearly, and for 2017 it is confirmed that the 
Chairman and the non-executive directors have sufficient time to 
fulfil their commitments to Smiths, and that no executive director 
holds more than one non-executive directorship of another FTSE 
100 company.
Independence 
As identified in the table on page 88, over the financial year at 
least half of the Board members (excluding the Chairman) were 
independent non-executive directors. Sir George Buckley was 
considered to be independent on appointment as Chairman. The 
Board keeps the independence of its members under continued 
review and in July 2017 the Nomination Committee assessed the 
independence of each of the non-executive directors and concluded 
that all of them were independent. More information on the work of 
the Board regarding succession planning and director tenure can 
be found in the Report of the Nomination Committee on page 92. 
Specific points for Board consideration over the past financial year 
are set out below: 
Bill Seeger 
Following his appointment as Interim Chief Financial Officer, Bill 
Seeger is no longer considered an independent non-executive 
director. A search for a new Chief Financial Officer is underway and 
the Board expects Bill Seeger’s appointment to be for a short period. 
When a new Chief Financial Officer is appointed, Bill Seeger will 
resume his role as a non-executive director, and the Board will 
review his independence in light of the guidance in the UK Corporate 
Governance Code and criteria for independence determined by 
the Board.
Sir Kevin Tebbit
As Sir Kevin Tebbit has served on the Board for 11 years a rigorous 
review of his performance was undertaken. The Board concluded 
that Sir Kevin continues to demonstrate the qualities of objectivity 
and independence, and to contribute to constructive challenge and 
debate at meetings, and therefore should continue as Senior 
Independent Director. Through a year of significant change on the 
Board Sir Kevin fulfilled an important role, supporting the Chairman 
and making himself available to investors and the other directors. 
Conflicts of interest
Directors must avoid situations where they have a direct or indirect 
interest that conflicts or may possibly conflict with the Company’s 
interests. The Company’s Articles of Association allow the Board  
to authorise conflicts and potential conflicts where appropriate,  
and there are procedures in place for directors to report any 
potential or actual conflicts to the other members of the Board  
for their authorisation.  Smiths Group plc  Annual Report 2017
88
A Register of Conflicts and Potential Conflicts is maintained by the Company Secretary and the directors are advised of the requirement 
to seek Board approval for any new situations which may present a conflict as they arise. In September and March the Board formally 
reviews the Conflicts Register, considering the conflicts disclosed and authorisations given, including any conditions determined by the 
Board. In the past financial year there was a temporary cross-directorship when Tanya Fratto joined the Mondi Group Board on 
1 January 2017, as Anne Quinn was a serving non-executive director. The Smiths Board did not consider this cross-directorship a conflict 
of interest, or an independence issue, as neither director held an executive position on the Mondi Board. Anne Quinn retired from the 
Mondi Board on 11 May 2017. 
Board meetings and visits
The table below shows the directors attendance at Board meetings held during the financial year ended 31 July 2017. In order to 
discharge their responsibilities effectively all directors should be able to allocate sufficient time to Smiths, and the table discloses 
the number of meetings that each director attended out of those that each was eligible to attend.

The directors attend additional meetings outside the formal meeting schedule, as well as making site visits to the various global 
divisions. To ensure that the Board is kept up to date with senior management priorities and challenges, and in order to gauge the 
culture embedded within the business, invitations to Board meetings are regularly extended to divisional presidents, business 
managers, heads of functions and external advisers. During the year the Board had a number of opportunities to meet and hear from 
Smiths employees, including at Board dinners and during Board and individual director visits to sites. 
To ensure the continued effectiveness of the Board, and to allow different members to fulfil their separate responsibilities, after each 
Board meeting the Chairman meets the non-executive directors without the executive directors present. He also has separate meetings 
with the Senior Independent Director and the Chairs of the Audit and Remuneration Committees. In addition, the Senior Independent 
Director meets the other non-executive directors without the Chairman present at least annually. 
BOARD VISIT TO SMITHS 
DETECTION SITE, NEWARK, USA
In 2017 the directors travelled to Palo Alto, USA. Their 
itinerary included visiting the Smiths Detection Site 
(formerly Morpho Detection) in Newark, San Francisco, 
where they spent time with the senior management team 
and met other employees informally. 
In addition they toured the site’s operations and were 
given presentations on a number of matters including the 
integration of the legacy Morpho Detection business with 
the Smiths Detection business, the Morpho business and 
its products, customers and financial performance.

Appointments to the Board
The Nomination Committee has a formal, rigorous and transparent 
process in place for the appointment of new directors to the Board. 
Appointments are made based on the merit of the individual, 
having due regard for the benefits of diversity in its broadest 
sense, including gender, ethnicity, nationality, age and experience. 
Matters considered by the Board prior to all appointments include 
the following:
• agreed Group strategy;
• the Board skills matrix;
• satisfaction that the director is able to allocate sufficient time  
to their responsibilities to Smiths; and
• existing succession plans. 
Following their appointment to the Board directors undergo an 
induction programme to ensure that they have the necessary 
knowledge and understanding of the Group to contribute 
to Board discussion and decision-making. Each director’s 
individual experience and background is taken into account, 
and a programme is developed which is tailored to their own 
requirements. This will include meeting senior individuals in 
the business, receiving copies of previous Board papers, and 
visits to operational sites. The appointment of Noel Tata was 
approved in 2016, and he joined the Board on 1 January 2017. 
More information about his appointment process can be found 
in the Report of the Nomination Committee on page 92. 
Information and training provided to the Board
In addition to the induction programme for new directors, the 
Board recognises the importance of ongoing training, and 
directors are given the opportunity to continue to update their 
skills and knowledge on a regular basis throughout their time  
on the Board. Ongoing training includes receiving twice-yearly 
governance briefings and technical updates on regulatory 
developments. The Board is regularly presented with updates from 
each of the divisions to ensure the directors remain aware of their 
priorities and challenges, and the Board committees are provided 
with relevant material by external advisers. The suitability of 
external courses is kept under review by the Company Secretary, 
who ensures that these are sent to Board members regularly.
Following feedback from the Board evaluation in FY2016 a number 
of improvements were made to the quality and timeliness of 
information received by the directors. Clearer guidance and 
procedures have been put in place to ensure that information 
received is presented in an appropriate format and contains the 
level of detail required for directors to fulfil their responsibilities 
effectively. The Company Secretary and her team assist the 
Chairman and Chief Executive in ensuring that the Board is 
provided with all relevant information in a timely manner.
Advice and insurance
All directors have access to the advice and services of the 
Company Secretary, and a procedure is in place for them to take 
independent professional advice at the Group’s expense, should 
this be required. The directors and officers of the Smiths Group 
and its subsidiaries have the benefit of a directors’ and officers’ 
liability insurance policy.
Re-election
It is Company practice for all directors to stand for shareholder 
election at the first Annual General Meeting (AGM) following 
their appointment. In addition, the Board has resolved that all 
directors who are willing to continue in office will stand for annual 
re-election by the shareholders at each AGM. Non-executive 
directors are appointed for a specified term of three years, 
subject to annual re-election at the AGM, and re-appointment 
for a second three-year term is not automatic. At the 2017 
AGM the shareholders will be asked to approve a change to 
the Company’s Articles of Association to reflect the annual 
re-election of directors. Any term for a non-executive director 
beyond six years is subject to a particularly rigorous review. 
The Chairman has confirmed that, following the performance 
reviews undertaken in 2017, the performance of each of the 
directors standing for re-election at this year’s AGM continues 
to be effective and that they each continue to demonstrate 
commitment to their respective roles, and dedicate the time 
necessary to perform their duties.
Board performance evaluation 
The Board undertakes an annual evaluation of its own 
performance as well as that of its committees and directors.  
The appraisal process provides an opportunity for Board members 
to take a step back from the day-to-day board business and 
consider the Board’s effectiveness and to identify areas for further 
development and find any ways of working more efficiently. 
In accordance with the Code, an external evaluation is carried 
out every three years. Sheena Crane carried out an external 
review of the Board for FY2015. Sheena Crane is independent 
to the Company and to the directors. For FY2016 the Board 
conducted a review with the support of Lintstock Limited 
(Lintstock also provides the software which Smiths uses to 
manage its insider lists, however Lintstock is determined to be 
independent). Together with the Chairman and the Company 
Secretary, Lintstock designed a structured set of questionnaires. 
The questionnaires focused on areas of specific relevance to 
Smiths and also checked on progress against matters identified 
in the previous evaluation. Topics addressed included the 
composition of the Board and its committees, Board dynamics, 
time management, Board support and efficiency, the Board’s 
oversight of strategy, risk management and internal controls, 
succession planning, people issues and priorities for change. 
Using online questionnaires, Lintstock produced an anonymised 
report which was presented to the Board for discussion at its 
meeting in November 2016. Overall, the results were positive and  
a number of actions were agreed. Progress made against these 
actions was reviewed by the Board at its meetings in March and 
September 2017.  Smiths Group plc  Annual Report 2017
90
The Board evaluation for 2017 is underway and is being supported by Lintstock again in order to build on the previous evaluation. 
Questionnaires have been provided to the directors and the Company Secretary covering the previous year’s topics and providing a 
deeper dive into some key areas. In addition, a number of priorities were identified during the previous evaluation in terms of improving 
performance of the Board in FY2017 and these have also been addressed in the survey. Some of the key areas identified and actions 
taken or underway are set out below.
2017 Board evaluation actions
Evaluation topic Actions
Board composition Refreshed Board skills matrix to reflect the updated Smiths strategy
Held a Board discussion on succession for key non-executive director roles
Board support and efficiency Improvements made to length, focus and clarity of Board papers
Strategic oversight and priorities for change Redesigned Board and Board committee agendas to focus more meeting time on key areas of: 
strategy and execution, M&A and portfolio changes and innovation and technology
Culture, people and succession planning Increased Board oversight of people, talent and succession planning, and strengthened link 
between strategy and people planning processes
Increased opportunities for Board members to meet with senior managers and wider population 
of Smiths employees
Risk Introduced more regular deep dives into ethics and compliance 
Director evaluation
During the year the Chairman provided feedback on the performance of individual Board members in one-to-one meetings. In addition 
the Senior Independent Director led an evaluation of the Chairman’s performance on behalf of the non-executive directors. Details on 
executive director performance and remuneration are set out on page 113. 
Following this it is confirmed that each Director continues to make an effective and valuable contribution to the Board and to 
demonstrate the required commitment to their role.

1 Bill Seeger was not a member of the Committee from the date he stepped into the 
Interim Chief Financial Officer role (19 May 2017).
The Committee holds one scheduled meeting each year when it 
conducts its annual review of senior management talent and 
succession plans with a view to ensuring a strong and robust plan 
exists in all parts of the Group. Otherwise during the year it meets 
as and when required. 
The Chief Executive is normally invited to attend the Nomination 
Committee and has attended each of this year’s meetings. The  
HR Director and the Director of Talent have also attended some 
meetings in order to advise the Committee. 
Role and responsibilities
The Nomination Committee’s terms of reference are available on 
the website, www.smiths.com. The Committee leads the process 
for identifying candidates for appointment as directors of the 
Company and as its Company Secretary. It also leads the process 
for their removal or retirement (giving full consideration to 
succession planning and leadership needs). It makes 
recommendations to the Board on the composition of the 
Nomination Committee and the composition and chairmanship of 
the Audit and Remuneration Committees. It reviews the structure, 
size and composition of the Board, including the balance of skills, 
At the start of the financial year the Nomination 
Committee refreshed its assessment of Board capability 
against the five-year skills analysis that the Committee 
had discussed in 2016. 
We considered the future profile of the Group from the perspective 
of end markets, geographic focus and strategic priorities. It was 
clear that the Board would benefit from an additional non-
executive director who had a current executive role working in 
higher growth economies where Smiths is accelerating its growth 
agenda. I was delighted that we were able to bring Noel Tata on to 
our Board from the start of the 2017 calendar year. As Managing 
Director of Tata International Limited and a board member of 
various Tata Group companies he has brought a wealth of market 
knowledge and makes a distinct contribution to the Board.
In May we announced that Chris O’Shea was stepping down from 
the Board to pursue his career outside the Group. The Nomination 
Committee was pleased to have Bill Seeger on the Board with his 
recent experience as a Chief Financial Officer of a FTSE 100 
company, who agreed to step in as Interim Chief Financial Officer 
whilst we conducted a search for Chris O’Shea’s successor.
In view of his interim assignment Bill was no longer able to chair 
the Audit Committee, and the Nomination Committee was pleased 
that Mark Seligman agreed to take on this key non-executive role. 
Mark is well placed to do this with his finance background and 
previous experience of chairing audit committees.

knowledge and experience and the independence of the non-
executive directors, and makes recommendations to the Board with 
regard to any changes. The Committee also holds an annual review 
of the succession plans and talent pipeline for senior management 
roles. In doing this the Committee takes account of the current and 
future needs, challenges and opportunities relating to the Group 
(with knowledge of the strategic and commercial issues affecting 
Smiths and the markets in which we operate). The Committee has 
access to information and advice both from within Smiths and 
externally, at the cost of the Group. This may include the 
appointment of recruitment consultants.
The Committee conducts annual reviews of its terms of 
reference and effectiveness and recommends any changes 
to the Board. The annual review of the Committee’s terms 
of reference was conducted in July and certain changes 
were approved with effect from 1 August 2017. This included 
ensuring the Committee’s commitment to considering diverse 
candidates for appointments, including a clear reference to 
ethnic origin in addition to diversity of gender and experience. 
The Committee conducted a review of its performance to ensure 
compliance with appropriate corporate governance guidelines 
and obligations, and the performance of the Committee was 
considered as part of the wider Board evaluation process. It was 
confirmed that the Committee continues to operate effectively.
The Board continues to support Lord Davies’ aspiration for 
female board representation, but this presents a particular 
challenge for a small board. The Nomination Committee 
and the Board remain committed to ensuring diversity is 
included within the remit for appointments to the Board. 
This commitment extends to appointments at all levels 
in Smiths, as evidenced by the appointment of a senior 
leader with responsibility for culture and diversity. Further 
information on diversity is provided in the Strategic report.
 
Committee activities during 2017
The Board commenced the search for a new non-executive 
director in 2016, and following an evaluation of the skills, 
knowledge, experience and diversity on the Board, the Nomination 
Committee identified a role profile. External recruitment 
consultants were engaged to assist with the search for a candidate 
with current experience of working in higher-growth regions. Noel 
Tata was appointed as a non-executive director of the Company on 
1 January 2017 using external search firm Buchanan Harvey & Co. 
(whose only connection to Smiths is to provide recruitment 
services) and following interviews with the Chairman, the Senior 
Independent Director, the Remuneration Committee Chair and 
meetings with the Chief Executive and the Chief Financial Officer. 
Buchanan Harvey & Co. is a member of the Voluntary Code of 
Conduct for executive search firms. The Committee also 
considered Noel Tata’s experience and commitments elsewhere 
and was satisfied that he would have time available to discharge 
his responsibilities effectively. The terms of his appointment are 
set out in a formal Letter of Appointment.
Chris O’Shea stepped down from his role as Chief Financial Officer 
and as a director of the Company on 19 May 2017 and commenced 
a period of garden leave. His exit was overseen by the Nomination 
Committee. Chris O’Shea’s employment is expected to end on 
18 November 2017 but may end at an earlier date on payment in 
lieu of notice. Full details are set out in the Directors’ 
remuneration report on page 103.
The Nomination Committee considered the succession plan and 
recommended that an external search process was undertaken 
and that during this process the Board appoint Bill Seeger as 
Interim Chief Financial Officer. In making the recommendation,  
the Committee considered his skills, knowledge and experience. 
The Committee considered he had excellent credentials to step 
into this interim role, having joined Smiths in May 2014 as a 
non-executive director and having chaired the Company’s Audit 
Committee for almost three years. In addition, he was previously 
Chief Financial Officer of GKN plc. 
The Committee approved the role description for the recruitment 
of the permanent position of Chief Financial Officer, ensuring that 
the criteria were objective and would enable candidates from a 
wide range of backgrounds, having due regard for the benefits of 
diversity in its broadest sense. The Nomination Committee has 
commenced a search for the replacement Chief Financial Officer 
using Buchanan Harvey & Co. 
In July 2017 the Committee considered the appointment and 
re-appointment of certain members of the Audit, Remuneration 
and Nomination Committees and the appointment of the Chairs  
of those committees. It recommended the appointment and 
re-appointment of members and Chairs as set out in more detail in 
the relevant sections of this report. In particular, the Committee 
considered and recommended to the Board that Mark Seligman 
replace Bill Seeger as Chair of the Audit Committee. The 
Committee considered Mark Seligman as having excellent 
credentials to step into this key non-executive role with his finance 
background and experience of chairing audit committees and 
having been a member of the Board and Audit Committee for  
over 12 months. 
In July 2017 the Committee met with the Group HR Director and  
the Director of Talent to carry out its annual review of the Smiths 
Group talent pipeline and succession planning process. During 
2017 it has sponsored the creation and implementation of a 
Group-wide process for talent, succession and strategic workforce 
planning, which is now being embedded. The aim is to have a 
formal, rigorous and transparent approach to identifying and 
developing a talent pipeline with the knowledge, skills and 
potential to fill key business leadership positions in the Company. 
Succession planning increases the availability and development 
opportunities for our talent pipeline, which is prepared to assume 
these roles as they become available. 
During the year the Committee received advice from the Company 
Secretary concerning the corporate governance trends in respect 
of board evaluation and board succession planning. The 
Committee reviewed the size and composition of the Board and its 
succession plan in the light of the outcomes of the Board strategy 
reviews in May 2017 and the future profile of the Group from the 
perspective of end markets, geographic focus and strategic 
priorities. Succession planning is seen as a constant requirement. 
Over the next two years two non-executive Directors, Anne Quinn 
and Bruno Angelici, will have completed nine years on the Board 
and, in recognition of the Code’s guidance in respect of 
independence, we are looking to establish a pipeline of potential 
candidates who could succeed them. As set out on page 87, the 
independence of Sir Kevin Tebbit is kept under frequent review.  
The Committee also reviewed the composition and balance of 
skills of the Board and has drawn up a succession plan that takes 
into account the desirability of maintaining a good balance of 
director tenure and the need to ensure there is a succession for 
key non-executive director roles as well as executive positions.

Corporate reporting
The Board is responsible for promoting the long-term success  
of the Company and is accountable to the Group’s various 
stakeholders for doing so. When reporting externally the Board 
aims to present a fair, balanced and understandable assessment 
of the Company’s position and prospects, and the Board is satisfied 
that, when taken as a whole, the 2017 Annual Report is fair, 
balanced and understandable and provides the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the Company’s position  
and performance, business model and strategy. 
During the year the Group has had internal control and risk 
management arrangements in place to support the financial 
reporting process:
• requiring the divisions to certify that their reported information 
gives a true and fair view of the results for the period;
• supporting record keeping to accurately and fairly reflect 
transactions and the disposal of assets; and
• providing reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded 
to permit the preparation of financial statements in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’).
For the year ended 31 July 2017:
• the Audit Committee considered, on behalf of the Board, the 
John Crane Inc. asbestos litigation disclosure. In order to assist 
with disclosure in the financial statements the Committee

• Smiths strengthened its anti-modern slavery compliance 
programme. A new Anti-Modern Slavery Policy was introduced, 
and the Board approved the Smiths Anti-Modern Slavery 
Statement. The Ethics and Compliance team conducted a risk 
assessment to identify the three greatest modern slavery risk 
areas in the Smiths business, and has since introduced 
programmes to reduce risk in these areas. Further detail in 
relation to our anti-modern slavery activities is included in 
Smiths Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement,  
which is available on the Group website, www.smiths.com
Internal control and risk management
The Board is responsible for determining the nature and extent of 
the principal risks it is willing to take to achieve its objectives, and 
for ensuring that there are sound risk management and internal 
control systems in place to safeguard shareholders’ investments 
and the Group’s assets. 
The Board’s explanation of the basis on which the Group generates 
and preserves value over the longer term, and its strategy for 
delivering the Company’s objectives, can be found in the Strategic 
report on page 24.
The Board Statements table on page 83 of this corporate 
governance statement signpost where various director 
confirmations, statements and assessments can be found.
The internal control system is based on an assessment of risk, and 
a framework of control procedures to manage risks and monitor 
compliance with procedures. The Group’s internal control systems 
are designed to meet Smith’s particular needs and the risks to 
which it is exposed, however they can provide only reasonable, not 
absolute, assurance against material loss to the Group or material 
misstatement in the financial statements. The Executive 
Committee is responsible for designing the Enterprise Risk 
Management (‘ERM’) system and ensuring it is effectively deployed 
throughout the Group, more detail can be found on page 61.
Over the year ended 31 July 2017 the Audit Committee, on behalf of 
the Board and with the assistance of the Internal Audit function, 
monitored, reviewed and assessed the effectiveness of the Group’s 
risk management and internal control systems in the context of the 
Group’s strategy and business model. The review covered material 
financial, operational and compliance controls. In 2016 the Audit 
Committee annual calendar was updated to include an additional 
meeting in order to facilitate its increased focus on risk 
management. This meeting was maintained in the 2017 calendar 
with the May 2017 Audit Committee meeting. Each divisional 
president attended and presented their respective risk register to 
the Audit Committee which included a risk dashboard, the process 
each division uses to identify and evaluate risk, and their internal 
controls and procedures to mitigate any identified risk. In addition, 
the Executive Committee selected three principal risks for ‘deep 
dive’ reviews at the Audit Committee meeting – a significant ethical 
breach, cyber security and product quality at Smiths Medical – and 
the owner of each risk attended to discuss the risk with the Board. 
The Investment Committee assists the Board with practical risk 
management, meeting approximately 10 times a year to consider 
high-risk and high-value proposals that are either beyond the 
authority delegated to divisional presidents, or prior to Board 
approval. This can include capital and special revenue expenditure 
or asset disposals. By reviewing the details in advance the 
Investment Committee assesses the risks, and reviews investment 
papers ahead of their presentation to the Board for approval, 
thereby helping to manage the associated risk.
Principal risks 
During the year the Board carried out a robust assessment  
of the principal risks facing the Group, including those that would 
threaten its business model, future performance, solvency  
and liquidity. In 2017 the Internal Audit function ran a global 
programme of risk workshops at divisional sites in order to ensure 
that risk is being identified from the bottom up. At the workshops 
local business controls and the likelihood and potential impact  
of risks were reviewed. Following this exercise the Executive 
Committee were presented with a refreshed list of principal risks 
for the Group, and agreed a top 10 to be presented to the Board.  
On consideration of the principal risks and uncertainties facing  
the Group, and the actions taken by management to manage those 
risks, the directors then determined the Group’s risk appetite,  
and the nature and extent of the risks the Board is willing to take. 
The Executive Committee ensures the Board’s risk appetite is 
understood by risk owners and decision-makers in the business.  
A description of the principal risks facing the Company can be 
found on pages 62-67. The Board takes these into account when 
considering the Company’s viability, as set out on page 57. Smiths Group plc  Annual Report 2017

MARK SELIGMAN
CHAIR OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE
The 2017 financial year was a busy year for the Audit 
Committee and I am pleased to share with you an insight 
into some of the matters the Committee considered. 
As a member and then Chair of the Committee, I would firstly like 
to extend my thanks to Bill Seeger. Bill led the Committee through 
the majority of the year under review and has helped me settle into 
the role of Committee Chair whilst maintaining a high degree of 
professionalism throughout. I remain confident in the Finance 
function and that Bill will lead the team in an effective manner  
until a permanent Chief Financial Officer is appointed.
In addition to reviewing the financial statements and related fiscal 
matters, the Committee has focused on the risks and internal 
controls exercised throughout the Group. As the Chairman 
mentions in his report on page 82, the Committee paid particular 
attention to the Group’s ethics and compliance programme, 
reviewing the existing processes and enhancing areas where the 
Committee felt more could be done to emphasise our core value  
of integrity. The Committee also reviewed the Group’s position on 
Anti-Modern Slavery, and more information on this can be found 
on the Smiths website (www.smiths.com).
The analysis of risk forms a growing part of the Committee’s 
agenda, both in the context of examining future threats and 
opportunities to the Group and also in identifying and assessing 
the controls in place to mitigate those identified risks. The 
Committee held a dedicated meeting in May to discuss and review 
those risks identified by management. The process for determining 
those risks is set out in the Risk management section on page 60 
which formed the basis for the Viability Statement on page 57. 
Whilst discussing the deep dive on cyber security, the Committee 
agreed to amend its forward agenda to add a review of the Group’s 
cyber security measures biannually and to specifically add this 
review to the Committee’s Terms of Reference. This is a growing 
area of threat to the Group and the Committee will continue to 
monitor the Group’s response and preventative measures. 
I am pleased to be able to report that the FRC’s review of the 
Groups’ 2015 Annual Report has been closed and the Board has 
agreed to make further disclosures in respect of the asbestos 
litigation provisioning as described on page 98.
The Committee has also agreed a timetable for an audit tender 
with a view to appointing a new auditor for the 2020 audit. The 
process will begin in earnest in early 2018. The Committee has 
been fully briefed on its responsibilities and expects to approve  
the tender document setting out the Group’s requirements, having 
consulted with shareholders and other stakeholders as 
appropriate. This will form a key focus point for the Committee 
over the next 12 to 18 months. Having conducted a thorough 
evaluation of PwC’s audit in respect of the previous financial year 
and the current half year, the Committee remains satisfied that 
PwC are both effective and retain a degree of professional 
scepticism in conducting their audit. A recommendation to appoint 
PwC as auditor for the FY2018 audit will be presented to 
shareholders at the AGM to be held in November. 
As the FY2018 financial year progresses, the Committee expects  
to review the Group’s position in respect of its tax risks and 
opportunities and specifically in respect of the strategy as global 
uncertainty on tax rates continues. In addition, uncertainty  
around Brexit remains and the Board as a whole will keep  
this area under review. Smiths Group plc  Annual Report 2017

1 Bill Seeger was not a member of the Committee from the date he stepped into the 
Interim Chief Financial Officer role (19 May 2017).
2 Noel Tata was unable to attend one meeting due to a prior commitment arranged before 
he joined the Board.
The Committee met four times during the 2017 financial year, with 
three meetings timed to align with the financial reporting and audit 
cycles of the Group, namely: the approval of the Annual Report in 
September; the approval of the half-year report in March; and the 
presentation of the pre-year-end ‘early warnings’ report from the 
external auditor, PwC, in July. A meeting was also held in May 2017 
at which the Committee reviewed the risk management reports of 
the Group’s five divisions. All the members of the Committee at the 
time attended the AGM in November 2016.
All members of the Committee who served during the year are,  
in the view of the Board, independent non-executive directors  
and have recent and relevant financial, accounting and sector 
experience gained from their respective international business 
activities. In particular, Bill Seeger was Chief Financial Officer of 
GKN plc, a post he had held for over six years before his retirement 
in 2014; and Mark Seligman has a long history in corporate finance, 
as well as being a qualified accountant. Tanya Fratto, Anne Quinn 
and Bruno Angelici have extensive senior management experience 
in international oil and gas, engineering and medical devices 
industries, respectively; Sir Kevin Tebbit has substantial 
knowledge of international governmental relationships; and  
Noel Tata has had a successful career in global business, with 
extensive experience in high-growth economies.
As part of his induction programme as a director of the Company 
(which included a detailed overview of the Group’s business model, 
strategy and risk profile), Noel Tata was provided with relevant 
material on the responsibility and working of the Committee  
and copies of recent papers and presentations. Upon becoming 
Chair of the Audit Committee Mark Seligman was provided  
with a short structured induction programme, which included 
meetings with senior members of the Finance team, the external 
auditor PwC, the Internal Audit team and other senior executives  
in the business. 
Further details of the qualifications and experience of the 
members of the Committee are contained in the biographies of the 
directors on pages 78 to 81. There have been no changes to the 
membership of the Committee since the financial year end.
In order to maintain effective communications between all relevant 
parties, the following were frequent attendees at the meetings:
• the Chairman of the Board
• the Chief Executive
• the Chief Financial Officer
• the Group Financial Controller
• the Company Secretary
• the Director of Internal Audit
• the Group Director of Tax and Treasury and
• the Group audit partners of the external auditor, PwC.
In addition, annual presentations on risk management were given 
to the Committee by the divisional general manager of each of  
the Group’s five divisions and the head of Business Information 
Services (‘BIS’, the Group’s IT function). The General Counsel  
and the Senior Vice-President & General Counsel – Ethics & 
Compliance reported to the Committee on the implementation of 
the Business Ethics programme; the work of the Company’s Code 
Compliance Council; and the investigations into allegations of 
non-compliance with the Ethics Code, including issues raised 
through the Group’s whistleblowing procedures.
At the conclusion of the meetings, the representatives of the 
external auditor and the Director of Internal Audit were each given 
the opportunity to discuss matters with the Committee and without 
executive management being present. The Director of Internal 
Audit, the Senior Vice-President & General Counsel – Ethics & 
Compliance and the external auditor have direct access to the 
Committee Chair and the members of the Committee should they 
wish to raise any concerns outside formal Committee meetings.
The members of the Committee also had the opportunity to meet 
separately at each meeting to discuss any relevant matters in the 
absence of all the invitees.
The Committee receives briefing notes from the Group and PwC  
on all relevant developments in company law, governance 
standards, and international and domestic financial accounting 
practices and regulations.
Outside of the formal meetings schedule, the Chairs of the  
Audit Committee met separately with senior management 
representatives of PwC to discuss the Group’s financial  
reporting, internal control and governance. Smiths Group plc  Annual Report 2017

Role and responsibilities
The primary role of the Audit Committee is to ensure the integrity 
of the financial reporting and audit processes and the maintenance 
of sound internal control and risk management systems. This 
includes responsibility for monitoring and reviewing:
• the integrity of the Group’s financial statements; the significant 
reporting issues and judgements contained therein; and the 
reports of the external and internal auditors;
• the bases for the Board’s statement on the adoption of the ‘going 
concern’ basis of accounting; its assessment of the long-term 
viability of the Company; and its description of the information 
contained in the Annual Report as enabling a ‘fair, balanced and 
understandable’ assessment of the Group;
• the consistency of the Annual Report and the annual financial 
statements;
• financial announcements released by the Company and any 
reports or returns made by the Group to financial regulators;
• the appropriateness of the Group’s relationship with the external 
auditor, including auditor independence and objectivity; auditor 
compliance with relevant ethical and professional standards and 
guidance; audit fees; and provision of non-audit services;
• the terms of engagement of the external auditor;
• the scope of the annual external audit plan and the quality and 
experience of the external audit team assigned to its execution;
• the reports of the external auditor, including any major issues  
or reservations and significant accounting and audit judgements 
highlighted therein;
• the effectiveness of the external audit process, making 
recommendations to the Board on the appointment or  
re-appointment or the removal of the external auditor;
• the remit and effectiveness of the Internal Audit function and the 
appropriateness of the resources available thereto;
• the effectiveness of the Group’s policies on internal control and 
risk management systems in the evaluation and management  
of significant business risk;
• statements on the assessment and management of risks and  
on internal controls;
• the Group’s implementation of its Code of Business Ethics and 
Business Ethics programme, including the Group’s 
arrangements for its employees to raise any issues of concern 
(whistleblowing) and the process for the investigation and 
resolution of any such issues; 
• the Group’s procedures for detecting fraud and systems and 
controls for preventing bribery; and
• the Group’s risks associated with the internal and external threats 
to, and the resilience of, the Smiths IT enterprise, information, 
operations and products relating to ‘cyber security’.
The Chair of the Audit Committee reports formally to the full Board 
on the activities of the Committee after each Committee meeting.
Financial and narrative reporting
During the financial year, the Committee has:
• considered information presented by management on key 
matters of accounting judgements and policies, adopted in 
respect of the 2016 Annual Report and 2017 half-year report,  
and relevant changes to accounting standards and agreed their 
appropriateness;
• discussed with PwC the firm’s audit reports and noted the key 
accounting matters and significant judgements highlighted by 
PwC in respect of each set of financial statements;
• reviewed documentation prepared to support the statement on 
internal control in the 2016 Annual Report and was satisfied that 
the Company was operating an effective system of internal 
controls to manage risk;
• reviewed documentation prepared to support the going concern 
judgement in the 2016 Annual Report and concluded that the 
accounts had been properly prepared on a going concern basis;
• assessed the processes and activities undertaken by the Group 
in order to ensure that the 2016 Annual Report, taken as a whole, 
would be ‘fair, balanced and understandable’ and concluded that 
the quality and range of information provided in the Annual 
Report was sufficient to enable shareholders to assess properly 
the Group’s position, performance, business model and strategy;
• examined key points of disclosure and presentation to ensure 
the adequacy, clarity and completeness of the 2016 Annual 
Report and 2017 half-year report and the preliminary 
announcement of the annual results;
• reported to the Board its views on significant financial reporting 
issues and judgements applied to the 2016 Annual Report, the 
2017 half-year report and the associated information releases 
(including matters communicated to the Committee by the 
external auditor);
• evaluated the bases for and the content of the Strategic report, 
the operational review and the corporate governance statement 
contained in the 2016 Annual Report;
• satisfied itself that the 2016 Annual Report was consistent within 
itself and that the ‘front half’ and the ‘back half’ of the 
publication were thoughtfully cohesive;
• reviewed documentation prepared to support the going concern 
judgement in the 2017 half-year report, including the review of 
the principal risks for the second half of the financial year, and 
concluded that the accounts had been properly prepared on a 
going concern basis;
• in addition to the press releases for the preliminary annual 
results for 2016 and the 2017 half-year results, reviewed the 
Company’s press releases and announcements containing 
price-sensitive material and reports made to financial 
regulators during the year; and
• analysed the methodology and processes presented by the 
management for the assessment in the 2017 Annual Report of 
the prospects of the Company over the longer term (‘long-term 
viability assessment’) and agreed that a three-year period is 
appropriate for this purpose, taking into consideration the 
Company’s various business cycles and forecasting models.  
The Committee considered scenario-based stress testing 
models, prepared by the Company, to assess the impact on 
Group cash and finances if one or more of the Group’s principal 
risks occurred. The Committee concurred with the conclusion 
that the Group’s balance sheet and ability to raise cash were 
more than sufficient to withstand such occurrences comfortably 
for at least the three-year period under review.

GO VERNANCE
Subsequent to the end of FY2017, the Committee has also reviewed 
and reported to the Board on the reports and information supplied 
by management and by PwC on the judgements and policies 
adopted for the 2017 Annual Report and the content of that 
document. The Committee considered that the quality and range of 
the material included within the 2017 Annual Report was sufficient 
to provide shareholders with the necessary information for them  
to assess properly the Group’s position, performance, business 
model and strategy and that the report was presented in such  
a way as could be considered ’fair, balanced and understandable’. 
The Committee reviewed the statement on risk management and 
internal controls; the going concern statement; the assessment  
of the long-term viability of the Group; and the content of the 
announcement of the financial results for 2017.
In assessing the fairness, balance and understandability of the 
2017 Annual Report, the Committee considered:
• the accuracy and integrity of the messages conveyed in the 
report; the appropriateness of the level of detail in the narrative 
reporting; the correlation between the judgements and issues 
and the disclosures and estimation uncertainties;
• the consistency between the narrative reporting in the front half 
and the financial reporting in the back half of the report; the 
explanations of the differences between statutory and headline 
reported results; and
• the overall design and layout of the information and data; the 
clarity of the messages and the reporting; and the holistic 
nature of the report.
Following its review of the 2017 Annual Report, the Committee was 
of the opinion that it is representative of the year and presents a 
fair, balanced and understandable overview, providing the 
necessary information for shareholders to assess the Group’s 
position, performance, business model and strategy.
Significant judgements and issues
An important responsibility of the Audit Committee is to review and 
agree the most significant management judgements and issues. To 
satisfy this responsibility, the Committee requests a written formal 
update from the Chief Financial Officer three times a year; the 
Group Director of Tax and Treasury twice a year; and reports from 
the external auditor at each Committee meeting. The Committee 
carefully considers the content of these reports and the most 
significant issues and areas of judgement raised. The key areas  
of judgement in the year were as follows:
Revenue recognition
The Committee reviewed the key judgements on revenue 
recognition. Attention was given to large, multi-faceted and 
non-standard contracts in Smiths Detection and to contracts 
where ‘percentage of completion’ accounting was used in Smiths 
Detection and Smiths Interconnect. The Committee reviewed the 
accounting treatment of three programmes in Smiths Detection 
where management assessed the portion of revenue to be 
attributed and the anticipated profit margin and concluded that the 
revenue judgements made were appropriate. The Committee also 
reviewed ‘bill and hold’ transactions in Smiths Detection and were 
satisfied with the adopted accounting treatment.
Impairment
The Committee considered the Group’s intangible assets and the 
assumptions used to justify the carrying values of these assets, 
including ‘fair value less costs to sell’. Particular attention was 
given to Morpho Detection which was tested on a fair value less 
cost to sell basis. A sensitivity is included in note 11 of the financial 
statements. The Committee reviewed the carrying value of Medical 
capitalised development and was satisfied that the treatment was 
reasonable due to the new product launches planned for FY2018 
and FY2019. The Committee agreed that the projected future 
cash-flows from these assets supported the carrying value. The 
Committee reviewed the disclosures contained in the financial 
statements and agreed that they appropriately reflect the 
sensitivity of the judgements made. Details of impairment testing 
and sensitivities are included in note 11 of the financial statements.
Acquisitions and divestments
The Committee reviewed the judgement and accounting treatment 
of the acquisition of Morpho Detection. Particular attention was 
paid to the opening balance sheet judgements concerning the 
valuation of acquired assets and the resulting calculation of 
goodwill. The Committee also considered the treatment of costs 
between headline and non-headline. The Committee agreed that 
the judgements made and the accounting treatment were 
appropriate. The Committee also reviewed the judgements and 
accounting treatment relating to the divestments of Smiths 
Interconnect Power, John Crane Artificial Lift, Smiths Interconnect 
Telecoms and the Smiths Medical Wallace and Morpho Trace 
businesses, and the gains (losses) on disposal. The Committee 
was satisfied that these disposals have been appropriately 
reflected in the Annual Report and Accounts 2017, and the 
treatment of Morpho Trace as a discontinued operation in the 
income statement. 
Working capital
The Committee considered the key judgements within working 
capital and, in particular, the level of provisions and overdue 
receivables in emerging markets. The Committee determined that 
the judgements made were appropriate to justify the working 
capital provision levels at 31 July 2017.
Provisions for liabilities and charges
The Committee continued to monitor carefully the expert 
assessments of the financial exposure of the Group to the John 
Crane, Inc. asbestos litigation and to the Titeflex Corp. CSST 
claims. In particular, the Committee considered the treatment of 
potential liabilities and the changes to the assumptions made in 
calculating the provisions, including the re-assessment of the time 
period for the Titeflex Corp. CSST provision and the continued 
appropriateness of the ten-year time period for John Crane, Inc. 
asbestos litigation. In the case of the John Crane, Inc. asbestos 
litigation, the Committee also agreed the judgement that litigation 
is extremely rare such that a sufficiently reliable estimate cannot 
be made to cover the full period over which it is expected that costs 
will be incurred. In both these cases, it was determined that the 
assumptions fairly reflect the position at 31 July 2017. Further 
details of the assumptions used are included in note 22 of the 
financial statements.
  Smiths Group plc  Annual Report 2017

Taxation
The Committee assessed the appropriateness of the Group’s 
assumptions and judgements in relation to the estimates of the 
assets and liabilities to be recognised in income and deferred tax, 
as well as the treatment of losses in the UK. Particular focus was 
given to the recognition of UK deferred tax assets which we now 
judge to be recoverable (see note 6); deferred tax assets relating  
to the John Crane, Inc. asbestos provision; and the Titeflex Corp. 
CSST provision. In reviewing projected profit streams the 
Committee was satisfied that, where appropriate, the relevant 
entities will generate sufficient future taxable profits to utilise the 
assets recognised. Further details on movements in tax balances 
are set out in note 6 of the financial statements.
Post-retirement benefits
The Committee reviewed and agreed the methods, assumptions 
and benchmarks used by the actuaries to calculate the position of 
the UK and US schemes at 31 July 2017, which have now moved to 
a net surplus position. The Committee agreed the treatment and 
the corresponding disclosures on these matters. More detail on 
post-retirement benefits is contained in note 8 of the financial 
statements.
FRC Corporate Reporting Review
In August 2017 the FRC Conduct Committee closed its enquiry into 
the Company’s 2015 Annual Report. During 2017 the Committee 
continued to monitor the dialogue between the Company and the 
FRC and discuss the matters raised with the external auditor.  
As a result of the enquiry, the Annual Report 2017 includes 
enhanced disclosures for the John Crane, Inc. litigation provision. 
Disclosures have been amended to explain why the Company 
judged that the circumstances of this provision are “extremely 
rare”, to provide more context on the judgement to use a ten-year 
time horizon to calculate the provision, and to include additional 
sensitivities around an extended time horizon. To support the 
provision time period and recommended judgement the 
Committee received advice from Bates White LLC, Economic 
Consultants. The enhanced disclosures can be found in note 22 on 
pages 180 to 183 . Expanded disclosures in respect of provisions, 
revenue, tax, inventory provisioning and post-retirement benefits 
arising from the enquiry were included in the Annual Report 2016.
The Committee, after receiving the reports on the significant 
issues and areas of judgement, was content that the judgements 
made were appropriate and are correctly reflected in the Annual 
Report 2017.
Corporate governance
During the year, the Audit Committee has reviewed the Company’s 
compliance with its governance obligations. In particular, the 
Committee has:
• monitored the changes introduced by the Company to ensure  
full compliance with the requirements of the 2016 edition of the 
UK Corporate Governance Code (the ‘Code’); and The Large & 
Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) 
(Amendment) Regulations;
• considered the amendments to and developments in the 
International Financial Reporting Standards that affected the 
2017 and 2018 financial years, including the adoption of IFRS 9, 
15 and 16;
• taken account of the Competition & Markets Authority’s 
Statutory Audit Services for Large Companies Market 
Investigation (Mandatory Use of Competitive Tender Processes 
and Audit Committee Responsibilities) Order 2014 (the ‘CMA 
Order’); and
• reviewed the changes in the Financial Reporting Council’s 2016 
Guidance to Audit Committees and Ethical Standards for 
Auditors, reflecting the implementation in the UK of the EU Audit 
Directive and Regulation.
The CMA Order first applied to the Company’s 2016 financial year 
and the Group has complied with it during the 2017 financial year. 
Under the transitional provisions of the order, the competitive audit 
tendering regulations require the Company to put the external 
auditor role out to tender by 2023. The Committee decided not to 
recommend a competitive tender this year given the change to 
Chief Financial Officer. The Committee’s proposal for a competitive 
audit tender and auditor rotation is described in the External 
Auditor effectiveness and reappointment section below. 
External audit
In relation to the activities of the external auditor, during the 
financial year, the Committee:
• considered PwC’s audit report on the 2016 Annual Report;  
its review of the 2017 half-year results; and its ‘Early Warning’ 
report on the 2017 audit;
• monitored PwC’s execution of the audit plans for 2016 and 2017;
• discussed all major issues identified by PwC during the course 
of the audits, including the key accounting and audit judgements 
taken by management and management’s responses to the audit 
findings;
• agreed materiality and de minimis levels with PwC;
• considered the draft letter of representation from the Company 
to PwC in connection with the audit of the 2016 financial 
statements;
• reviewed the non-audit fees paid to PwC and found them to have 
been incurred in accordance with the policy on the provision of 
non-audit services;
• conducted the annual review of the independence and objectivity 
of PwC and was satisfied that PwC’s behaviour had been 
professional in both respects;
• conducted an internal survey on the effectiveness of PwC as 
external auditor; and determined that PwC remained effective  
in its role as external auditor; and
• recommended to the Board that PwC be proposed for  
re- appointment as external auditor at the 2016 AGM  
for a further year.
 
Subsequent to the financial year end, the Committee has 
considered and approved the same items in respect of the 2017 
audit and the preparation of the 2017 Annual Report. Subsequently, 
the Committee has also recommended that PwC be proposed for 
reappointment as external auditor at the 2017 AGM.  
The Committee considered that each of the directors had taken all 
necessary steps to ensure that he or she was aware of all pertinent 
audit information and that such information had been properly 
communicated to PwC in a timely manner.
External audit plan
PwC presented its Group Audit Plan for the financial year ending 
31 July 2017. The Committee discussed with PwC:
• its risk matrix and the factors affecting the various audit risk 
assessments; the proposed audit scope, taking into 
consideration statutory audit requirements, financially 
significant components and significant risk components and 
central programme testing;
• materiality levels;
A U D IT C O M M IT TE E
C O N T I N U E D Smiths Group plc  Annual Report 2017

GO VERNANCE
• the accounting for the acquisition of Morpho Detection Inc and 
the sale of the Morpho Trace Detection business;
• the movement in working capital relating to aged inventory and 
receivables; and
• the impact of senior management changes within the business.
The Committee noted the focus on the audit risks associated with 
revenue recognition; certain litigation risks; impairment of 
goodwill; and management override of controls. PwC’s proposal  
to increase the overall materiality level to £20m (approximately 
3.5% of headline operating profit) (2016: £17m) and a de-minimis 
reporting threshold of £1m (2016: £0.5m) was accepted as prudent 
and appropriate. The Committee considered the resources 
proposed by PwC, including the qualities, seniorities and 
experience of the audit team members, to be consistent with the 
scope of the audit. It was noted that the Audit Plan had been 
discussed and co-ordinated with Internal Audit. Through a 
combination of full-scope audits, specified audit procedures and 
local GAAP statutory audits, business units producing 78% (2016: 
79%) of the Group’s forecast headline operating profit for 2017 
would be audited by PwC under the 2017 Audit Plan.
The fee structure and terms of the audit engagement letter, which 
had been agreed with management, and PwC’s assessment of its 
independence were considered appropriate for the work proposed 
and were approved.
Non-audit services
In order to safeguard auditor independence, the Committee has 
monitored compliance with the Group policy on the engagement  
of external audit firms for non-audit work. Non-audit services 
were divided into three categories in relation to the incumbent 
external auditor:
• Pre-approved (but subject to the Chief Financial Officer’s 
approval for projects likely to exceed £10,000) – where the threat 
to auditor objectivity and independence is considered low, such 
as regulatory compliance work; limited tax advisory work; and 
low-level acquisition work;
• Permitted (but subject to the approval of the Audit Committee  
for projects over £10,000 and competitive tendering for projects 
over £100,000) – such as larger acquisitions; corporate 
reorganisation; and IT risk and security; and
• Not permitted – such as book keeping; financial system design; 
actuarial services; management functions; and internal audit.
The Committee recognises that non-audit services falling in the 
Pre-approved category can be purchased more cost-effectively 
from and completed more efficiently by the incumbent auditor due 
to the audit firm’s existing knowledge of the Group and its systems. 
The Committee is satisfied that the non-audit work performed by 
PwC during the financial year had been properly assessed and 
authorised in accordance with the Group policy.
On 17 June 2016, the EU Audit Directive and Regulation came into 
force and the FRC published a revised Ethical Standard for 
Auditors in respect of audits of financial years beginning on or after 
that date. As a consequence of the new regulation and standard, 
the Committee reviewed and approved changes to the Group policy 
on the engagement of audit firms for non-audit work in order to 
take account of the prohibited list of non-audit services that an 
incumbent auditor is not permitted to provide in the EU under the 
regulation and the cap on the level of permitted non-audit services 
that can be billed.
External auditor independence
The Committee is responsible for the development, implementation 
and monitoring of the Group’s policies on external audit, which are 
designed to maintain the objectivity and independence of the 
external auditor. These policies also regulate the appointment by the 
Group of former employees of PwC and set out the approach to be 
taken when using the external auditor for non-audit work.
The external auditor is not permitted to provide services which 
could result in:
• the external auditor auditing its own firm’s work;
• the external auditor making management decisions for the Group;
• a mutuality of interests being created; or
• the external auditor being put in the role of advocate for  
the Group.
The Committee’s review of the independence of the external 
auditor included:
• examining written confirmation from PwC that they remained 
independent and objective within the context of applicable 
professional standards;
• considering the tenure of the audit engagement partner, who is 
required to rotate every five years in line with ethical standards;
• monitoring the ratio between the fees for audit work and 
non-audit services; and
• checking that management confirmed compliance with the 
Group’s policies on the employment of former employees of PwC 
and the use of PwC for non-audit work.
As a result of this review, the Committee concluded that PwC 
remained appropriately independent in the role of external auditor.
Details of the fees paid to PwC for the year ended 31 July 2017 can 
be found in note 2 on page 152. Non-audit fees incurred during this 
period amounted to £0.3m ,which related principally to work on 
cyber security and audit-related assurance services in connection 
with the interim report. Non-audit fees as a percentage of audit 
fees totalled 7%. All such activities remained within the policy 
approved by the Board.
External auditor effectiveness and reappointment
The Committee’s review of the performance of PwC and the 
effectiveness of the external audit process included conducting 
a survey to take into consideration the views of the executive 
directors, senior management and the divisional finance teams, 
views and opinions of PwC’s effectiveness in a number of 
areas. The survey included questions on PwC’s independence 
and objectivity, audit strategy and planning, conduct and 
communication, audit findings and feedback, and expertise and 
resourcing. The results were positive and confirmed that both 
PwC and its audit process were appropriate and effective; and 
that the relationships between the audit teams and the Company’s 
businesses continued to provide effective and objective challenge. 
The Committee recognised the challenges in ensuring consistency 
in the audit process across the whole Group and the need to 
continue to improve communication at local and divisional levels.
Independence Letters, sent by PwC in September 2016 in respect 
of its 2016 audit and September 2017 in respect of the 2017 audit, 
were also considered and the Committee concurred with PwC’s 
opinion that it had complied with all relevant regulatory and 
professional requirements and that the firm’s objectivity had not 
been compromised. Smiths Group plc  Annual Report 2017
100
The Committee noted the findings in the FRC’s June 2017 Audit 
Quality Inspection report on PwC. It evaluated a summary of PwC’s 
internal quality control procedures and noted that the lead 
engagement partner, Andy Kemp, is accountable directly to the 
Committee for the execution of the audit. The Committee satisfied 
itself that the quality of the work exhibited by the firm and its 
commitment to improvements were of a high standard.
PwC has been the Company’s external auditor since its formation 
in 1998, although a predecessor organisation of PwC held office as 
sole auditor in 1997. There has been no external audit tender since 
PwC’s appointment. In determining whether to recommend PwC 
for re-appointment as auditor in 2017, the Audit Committee took 
into consideration the following factors:
• the length of PwC’s appointment and the guidance on the audit 
firm rotation regulations and proposals;
• the results of the effectiveness review detailed above;
• the qualities and experience of the audit partner, and
• the changes in the executive management team during 2017,  
in particular the appointment of Bill Seeger as Interim Chief 
Financial Officer, who took up his post on 19 May 2017.
Taking these elements into account and acknowledging that it 
would take some time to stage a competitive audit tender from 
initial planning to final selection, the Committee concluded that it 
would not be practical to put the auditor appointment for 2018 out 
to competitive tender, and that it was appropriate to recommend  
to the Board that the re-appointment of PwC as the Company’s 
auditor for a further year be proposed to shareholders at the  
2017 AGM.
 
Recognising the various requirements in the Code, the CMA Order 
and the Statutory Auditors and Third Country Auditors Regulations 
2016 (implementing the EU’s June 2014 Audit Directive and 
Regulation), the Committee reviewed its decision and concluded 
that it would remain in the best interests of the Company to plan 
for a competitive audit tender for the rotation of the external 
auditor for the 2020 audit. This would coincide with the end of the 
current PwC audit partner’s five-year term. The Committee has 
reviewed and agreed a timetable for placing a competitive audit 
tender and will be starting the process during 2018. PwC will not 
be invited to participate in the tender. However, the Committee will 
keep the performance of the incumbent audit firm under annual 
review. The Board has considered and adopted the Committee’s 
recommendations to propose the re-appointment of PwC as 
auditor in 2017 and to plan for a competitive audit tender and 
auditor rotation for the 2020 audit. There are no contractual 
obligations restricting the Group’s choice of external auditor.
Internal control and risk management
In fulfilling its responsibilities, the Committee:
• reported to the Board on its evaluation of the Group’s risk 
assurance framework and embedded risk management 
processes, based on consideration of the reports by PwC on the 
Group‘s control environment and ERP systems and on fraud risk; 
the audits undertaken by Internal Audit; and the risk 
management reports presented by and discussed with each of 
the divisions and BIS; and
• reviewed management’s plans to mitigate and remedy the 
failings and weaknesses in the Company’s internal financial and 
risk controls that were identified by PwC and Internal Audit and 
has monitored their effectiveness. The Committee did not view 
any of the issues that had been identified and addressed as 
significant.
The Committee has reviewed the effectiveness of the identification 
and management of risk at the Group level. Each division also 
presents an analysis of its own business strategic risks to the 
Committee on an annual basis.
Further information on the Group’s systems of internal control and 
risk management is given on page 60.
Internal Audit
Internal Audit is independent of the business, and as such has no 
responsibility for operational business management. This ensures 
the integrity and objectivity of its annual Audit Plan work, which is 
approved by the Committee. The authority of the Internal Audit 
function is derived from the Committee. The Director of Internal 
Audit is accountable to the Board of Directors through the 
Chairman of the Committee. Administratively, the Director of 
Internal Audit reports to the Chief Financial Officer. In order to 
carry out the responsibilities, as set out in a charter approved  
by the Committee, the Internal Audit function has:
• full and unrestricted access to all Smiths records, property  
and personnel;
• independent access to the Chairman and members of the 
Committee;
• the right to request meetings with the Committee; and
• the authority and obligation to report significant findings  
or other concerns to the Committee.
The Committee oversees the performance of the Internal Audit 
function through the Director of Internal Audit’s attendance at 
Committee meetings and a review of agreed KPIs which are 
reported to the Committee three times per year. In addition,  
during 2018 an independent third party review of the function’s 
effectiveness will be undertaken. The review will be overseen  
by the Committee. 
During the financial year the Committee:
• received progress reports on the execution of the 2017 Internal 
Audit Plan;
• discussed the recommendations made by the internal auditors;
• noted the progress being made by management in reducing the 
numbers of aged outstanding recommendations;
• reviewed the effectiveness of Internal Audit as a part of the 
Company’s risk management process;
• considered the remit of Internal Audit, its budget and resources 
and the nature and extent of the outsourcing to KPMG; and
• approved the 2018 Internal Audit Plan, including the proposed 
audit scope, approach, coverage and allocation of resources.
Treasury and tax
During the financial year, the Committee reviewed the report 
of the Treasury department of the Group on financial risk 
and treasury management, noting the Group’s borrowing 
position and debt capacity. The Committee also received 
status reports on tax risk from the Group’s Tax department, 
noting the assessments of compliance, tax audit risk, 
tax provisions and international tax rates. The Group’s 
assessment of its appetite for tax risk was also reviewed.

Ethics
During the financial year, the Committee reviewed the annual 
report of the Group’s Business Ethics Council on the Group-wide 
Ethics programme. The report included details of the investigations 
into allegations of non-compliance with the Code of Business Ethics 
and whistleblowing events, including bribery and corruption, and 
the Council’s work programme to support the initiatives of the 
businesses and monitor compliance with both the Group’s Code of 
Business Ethics and the various applicable national regulations. 
The Committee received a report on the first phase of an external 
review of compliance with Group and divisional ethical policies  
and procedures. The Committee considered that the Company’s 
processes and arrangements for staff to report concerns about  
any improprieties were both appropriate and effective. The 
Committee also considered that the Company’s investigation of 
such reports and consequential actions (where required) were 
timely and effective. No issues were raised that required the 
Committee’s action.
Constitution
The Committee conducts an annual review of its terms of 
reference and effectiveness and recommends any changes to the 
Board. During 2017 the Board approved changes to the Committee’s 
terms of reference to include cyber security and the revised terms  
of reference are available on our website at www.smiths.com. 
Performance evaluation
An annual evaluation of the performance of the Committee is 
conducted as part of the annual evaluation of the performance  
of the Board. Following the conclusion of the evaluation it was 
determined that the Committee continues to operate effectively.
Discharge of responsibilities
During the year, the Committee has monitored its discharge of 
responsibilities. In addition to the actions reported in the sections 
above, the Committee has:
• observed the induction and on-boarding of the new Committee 
Chairman and Interim Chief Financial Officer; and 
• welcomed Noel Tata as a new member.
The Committee has enjoyed a positive relationship with the Board 
throughout the year and has no contentious or unresolved issues 
to report. 
In light of its work, the Audit Committee was content with the 
effectiveness of the Group’s processes governing financial and 
regulatory reporting and controls, its culture, ethical standards 
and its relationships with stakeholders. The Committee was also 
satisfied with the appropriateness and adequacy of the Group’s 
risk management arrangements, as well as supporting risk 
management systems including the risk monitoring processes, 
internal controls framework and three lines of defence model.
Advice
The Committee has independent access to the services of  
Internal Audit and to the external auditor and may obtain outside 
professional advice, at the expense of the Group, as it sees fit,  
in the performance of its duties.

Relations with shareholders and other capital providers
During financial year 2017, senior management and the investor 
relations team had contact with over 200 investors and analysts.
Contact with investors/analysts
United Kingdom  50% 
US and Canada  30% 
Rest of Europe  15% 
Rest of World  5%
Dialogue with shareholders
During 2017 the Chief Executive, the Chief Financial Officer 
and the Investor Relations Director communicated with 
institutional investors through analysts’ briefings and extensive 
investor roadshows in the UK, US and Europe. The executive 
directors regularly met with shareholders to maintain a two-
way communication on business performance and long-term 
strategy, and the Chairman and non-executive directors were 
available to meet with investors to discuss issues as and 
when they arose, for example to hear views around strategy 
and management change. The investor relations programme 
for the past year is detailed in the activities timeline, and a 
programme for the FY2018 financial year is being developed.
Members of the Board, and in particular non-executive 
directors, are kept informed of investors’ views, mainly through 
distribution of analysts’ and brokers’ briefings and the Chief 
Executive’s written updates. At least twice a year a detailed 
written report is provided to the Board on the number and types 
of meetings between Smiths and institutional shareholders. 
The Board is confident that this process enables the non-
executive directors to maintain a balanced understanding 
of the views and concerns of major shareholders.
In 2017 an investor perception study was carried out by Makinson 
Cowell, the results of which were presented to the Board at their 
September 2017 meeting. Some key messages in the report 
include that investors believe that the Group comprises some 
high-quality, high-margin and high-returns businesses, with a 
strong senior management team. Smiths is generally rated as a 
strong communicator with investors, who believe that they have 
sufficient access to senior management and that there is a clear 
articulation of the near-term strategy. The report also identifies 
some development points, including that a deeper understanding 
of the business could be facilitated by greater access to divisional 
management and a Capital Markets Day. A Capital Markets 
Day for FY2018 is being held in London in December 2017.
Dialogue with other capital providers
The Company values the contribution of its committed lending 
banks and bond holders to the achievement of its strategic 
aims. The Chief Financial Officer and the Group Director, 
Tax and Treasury meet with and communicate proactively 
with this investor base and the rating agencies, Standard & 
Poor’s and Moody’s, on a regular basis. There is also a formal, 
annual meeting with the rating agencies. Communication 
with debt markets is generally via investor roadshows at the 
time of financing activity. Committed banks are invited to 
the biannual presentations of the Group’s trading results to 
enable them to keep informed of business strategy and meet 
both senior corporate and divisional management. Members 
of the Board are kept informed of the current credit views 
of debt investors and the rating agencies through regular 
commentary and financial metric reporting to meetings.

Annual General Meeting (AGM) 
All directors normally attend the AGM and shareholders are invited 
to ask questions during the meeting and to meet directors before 
and after the formal proceedings. The Board values the AGM as an 
opportunity to meet with those shareholders who are able to 
attend and to take their questions.
At the 2016 AGM all directors in post, including the Senior 
Independent Director and the Chairs of the Audit, Nomination 
and Remuneration Committees, were available to answer 
shareholders’ questions. The directors were also available after 
the meeting for informal discussion with shareholders. The notice 
of the AGM and related papers were sent to shareholders at least 
20 working days before the meeting.
The 2017 AGM will be held on 14 November 2017 and is an 
opportunity for shareholders to vote on certain aspects of Group 
business in person. It is intended that there will be a poll vote on 
each resolution at the 2017 AGM. The audited, final results of the 
poll votes will be released to the market and published on the 
Company’s website, www.smiths.com, as soon as is practicable 
after the conclusion of the AGM. Smiths Group plc  Annual Report 2017

CHAIR OF THE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
Performance highlights
• Increased profit performance
• Strong cash conversion performance
• Group wide operating margin improvement 
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present  
the report of the Remuneration Committee for  
the year to 31 July 2017.
 This report is split into three parts:
• the Annual Statement;
• the policy report, which presents the Group’s forward-looking 
Directors’ remuneration policy; and 
• the Annual Report on Remuneration, which details how our 
remuneration policy was implemented during the year to  
31 July 2017 and how we intend to apply our policy in the  
year to 31 July 2018.
Following the approval of the Policy at the 2015 AGM, there are no 
proposed changes to the Policy this year.
As highlighted by the Chairman and Chief Executive in their annual 
statements on pages 10 to 17 of this Annual Report, the operating 
environment continued to be challenging in the year to 31 July 2017. 
However, four of the five divisions reported growth in headline 
operating profit. As expected, John Crane continued to face tough 
global energy market conditions, leading to an anticipated decline in 
operating profit. However, the Board was encouraged that, along 
with the other four divisions, John Crane reported improved margin 
performance. Group performance in cash conversion was strong at 
118%. Taking into consideration EPS performance and each 
director’s performance against their personal objectives, the annual 
bonus outcome was just below maximum. ROCE, at 16.2%, remains 
well ahead of the Group’s weighted average cost of capital and 
resulted in the maximum matching under the final CIP award cycle 
in which Andy Reynolds Smith and Chris O’Shea did not participate. 
3-year EPS growth, relative TSR performance and average cash 
conversion warranted vesting of 62.6% of the 2014 LTIP awards that 
will vest later this year following the end of the performance period 
on 31 July 2017. Andy Reynolds Smith and Chris O’Shea did not 
participate in this LTIP cycle as it pre-dates their appointment. The 
Committee recognises the importance of close alignment of 
remuneration with Group performance and we consider the 
incentive outcomes for this year to demonstrate this link  
(further details of which are disclosed in this year’s Annual  
Report on Remuneration).
During the year, the Committee also considered and agreed 
the implications on the remuneration of Chris O’Shea stepping 
down from the Board of Directors in May 2017. He will leave the 
Company in November 2017. As set out in the RNS of 23 May 2017, 
the Committee operated within the provisions of its Policy to 
determine that, in addition to contractual payments, Chris O’Shea 
would remain eligible for a pro-rated annual bonus payment in 
relation to the financial year ended 31 July 2017, and retain a pro-
rated interest in outstanding LTIP awards. His retained interests 
in the LTIP will vest on the normal vesting date to the extent 
warranted by performance at the end of the normal performance 
period. Any awards vesting to Chris O’Shea before 18 November 
2017 are unaffected by his stepping down from the Board.
In addition, the Committee determined the package for Bill 
Seeger on his appointment as Interim Chief Financial Officer. 
The arrangements for Bill Seeger (further details of which 
are set out in the Annual Report on Remuneration) reflect 
the short term interim nature of his appointment, and are 
in line with the Remuneration Policy currently in force.
On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank shareholders for their 
continued support.

The Chief Executive is normally invited to attend Remuneration 
Committee meetings, except when his own remuneration is under 
discussion. The Group HR Director, the Director of Reward, and 
external remuneration advisers Mercer | Kepler have also attended 
meetings in order to advise the Committee, as and when required.
The Committee’s activities and focus during the year are described in 
the following Directors’ Remuneration Report. The Committee reviews 
its terms of reference annually and recommends to the Board any 
changes required as a result. The latest annual review of the 
Committee’s terms of reference was conducted in July 2017, when they 
were updated to reflect current Committee practice regarding the 
annual review of the remuneration policy and ongoing contact with 
principal shareholders. The terms of reference can be found on the

Remuneration policy report
This section of the report sets out our remuneration policy for directors, which shareholders approved at the AGM on 16 November 2015 
and is effective for a period of three years from the date of the 2015 AGM. The only amendments to this policy report from the version 
approved by shareholders in 2015 are to update the data used in the pay-for-performance scenarios and to add page references.
Remuneration policy for the executive directors
The remuneration policy for the executive directors at Smiths is summarised in the table below:
Element and link to strategy Operation Opportunity Performance measures
Base salary
To attract, motivate and retain 
executive directors with the 
required skills and expertise to 
deliver the Group’s objectives. 
Salaries are reviewed (but not 
necessarily increased) annually 
and benchmarked against 
comparable roles at companies 
of similar market capitalisation, 
revenues and complexity. 
The review also takes into 
account individual performance 
and experience, the relative 
performance of the Company and 
the remuneration policy operated 
across the Company as a whole.
Salary increases are typically 
effective 1 August.
Base salaries are adjusted 
according to the outcome of 
the annual review and will be 
disclosed in the Annual Report on 
Remuneration. 
Salary increases for the 
executive directors will normally 
be in line with those awarded 
to Smiths wider employee 
population. Where increases 
are awarded in excess of this, 
for example if there is a material 
change in the responsibility, size 
or complexity of the role, or a 
significant change in the market 
competitiveness of salary, the 
Committee will provide the 
rationale in the relevant year’s 
Annual Report on Remuneration.
Not applicable
Pension
Enables executive directors to 
save for their retirement in a 
cost-efficient manner.
Executives may choose either 
to participate in the Company’s 
defined contribution pension plan 
or to receive a pension allowance 
in lieu thereof (and thus arrange 
their own pension provision).
Pension allowances are reviewed 
periodically to ensure market 
competitiveness.
Salary is the only element of 
remuneration that is taken 
into account when determining 
pension contributions  
or allowances.
Pension contributions (or cash 
allowances in lieu thereof) are 
set at a level that the Committee 
considers appropriate having 
regard to prevailing market 
practice at other FTSE 100 
companies of similar market 
capitalisation, revenues  
and complexity. 
Pension arrangements for 
current executive directors are 
set out in the Annual Report on 
Remuneration.
The maximum level of pension 
contribution (or allowance in  
lieu thereof) is 30% of annual 
base salary.
Not applicable
The Directors’ remuneration report is presented to shareholders by the Board. The report complies with Regulation 11 and Schedule 
8 of the Large and Medium-Sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 (the ‘Regulations’). As required by 
the Regulations, the Annual Report on Remuneration will be put to an advisory shareholder vote at the Annual General Meeting on 
14 November 2017. The Committee also continues to comply with the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code relating to 
directors’ remuneration, except as disclosed in the Corporate governance statement on page 82. Smiths Group plc  Annual Report 2017

Element and link to strategy Operation Opportunity Performance measures
Annual bonus
Incentivises short-term cash 
management and profit growth, 
as well as annually defined non-
financial goals.
Annual bonus payments 
are determined based upon 
performance against measures 
and targets set by the Committee 
at the start of each financial year.
After the end of the financial 
year, to the extent that the 
performance criteria have been 
met, up to 67% of the earned 
annual bonus is paid in cash. The 
balance is deferred into shares 
and released after a further 
period of three years, subject to 
continued employment only.
The Committee may use its 
discretion to adjust payout of 
the annual bonus to executive 
directors, within the range 
of the minimum to maximum 
opportunity. Such discretion 
will only be used where the 
Committee believes that 
performance against the

Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)
Incentivises long-term value 
creation for shareholders, 
sustainable profit growth and 
effective management of the 
balance sheet.
Awards of conditional shares 
are granted annually and vest 
after a performance period of 
at least three years, subject to 
the achievement of performance 
targets set by the Committee 
at the start of each cycle. For 
awards made in 2016 onwards, 
vested shares may also be 
subject to a post vesting 
holding period. Details of any 
such holding period will be 
disclosed in the Annual Report 
on Remuneration for the year in 
which the relevant award  
is made.
To the extent that the 
performance targets are not met 
over the performance period, 
awards will lapse. No retesting of 
awards under any performance 
condition is permitted.
Dividends accrue and are paid 
in cash at the end of the vesting 
period, on shares that vest.
The Committee may use its 
discretion to adjust payout of 
the LTIP to executive directors, 
within the limits of the Plan rules. 
Such discretion will only be used 
where the Committee believes 
that performance against the 
prescribed targets does not 
accurately reflect the Company’s 
underlying performance.
Awards are also subject to 
clawback for a period of five 
years from the date of grant in 
case of misconduct or material 
misstatement in the published 
results of the Group.
The maximum LTIP award 
opportunity for executive 
directors is up to 400% of salary.
LTIP award sizes for the year 
under review and the coming 
year are disclosed in the Annual 
Report on Remuneration.
At threshold performance 
against each measure, up to 
25% of the award subject to that 
measure vests, increasing on a 
straight-line basis to 100% for 
achieving stretch targets.
 
Based on measures of performance 
that are aligned with the Group’s 
strategy.
To ensure continued alignment 
with the Company’s strategic 
priorities, the Committee may, at 
its discretion, vary the measures 
and their weightings from time to 
time (but will consult shareholders 
before making significant changes 
to the performance measures).  Smiths Group plc  Annual Report 2017

Benefits
To provide market-competitive 
benefits to executive directors.
Benefits comprise car allowance, 
life assurance and private 
healthcare insurance, and other 
such benefits as the Committee 
may from time to time determine 
are appropriate. These include, 
but are not limited to, relocation 
allowances, as well as any other 
future benefits made available 
either to all employees globally 
or all employees in the region  
in which the executive director  
is employed.
Benefits vary by role and 
individual circumstances. 
Benefits in respect of the year 
under review are disclosed in the 
Annual Report on Remuneration.
It is not anticipated that the 
costs of benefits provided will 
increase significantly in the 
financial years over which this 
policy will apply, although the 
Committee retains discretion 
to approve a higher cost in 
exceptional circumstances 
(eg to facilitate recruitment, 
relocation, expatriation, etc) or 
in circumstances where factors 
outside the Group’s control have 
changed materially (eg market 
increases in insurance costs).

Sharesave
Encourages ownership of 
shares in the Company and 
alignment with shareholder 
interests.
All UK employees (including executive directors) may save up to a 
maximum monthly savings limit (as determined by UK legislation, 
or other such lower limit as the Committee may determine at its 
discretion) for three or five years. At the end of the savings period, 
participants may use their savings to exercise options to acquire 
shares, which may be granted at a discount of up to 20% to the 
market price on grant. The Company intends to look into introducing 
all-employee share schemes to some non-UK countries on a basis 
consistent with local laws and market practice.
Not applicable
Shareholding guidelines
Encourages ownership of shares 
in the company and alignment 
with shareholder interests.
Executive directors must build a minimum shareholding of two times 
base salary within five years of appointment to the Board. 50% of any 
net vested share awards (after sales to meet tax liabilities) must be 
retained until the minimum shareholding requirements are met.
Not applicable
Existing grants or entitlements
It is the Company’s intention to honour all pre-existing commitments at the date of this report and to honour all future obligations 
entered into, consistent with the approved remuneration Policy in force at that time. In the case of internal promotion to the Board, the 
Committee intends to honour any pre-existing commitments made prior to becoming a member of the Board, including where these 
differ from the approved remuneration Policy. Smiths Group plc  Annual Report 2017

Performance measure selection and approach to target setting
Annual bonus measures are selected to reflect the Company’s short-term financial and non-financial priorities. At its discretion, the 
Committee may vary these measures at the start of each financial year to maintain close alignment between executive incentives and 
the annual business plan. 
The measures used in the Long-Term Incentive Plan are selected to reflect Smiths prevailing strategy and to reinforce the key drivers  
of value creation highlighted elsewhere in this Annual Report: operating margin, cash conversion and delivering sustainable return on 
capital. 
Annual bonus and LTIP targets are reviewed annually, and take into account the Company’s strategic plan, analyst forecasts for Smiths 
and its sector comparators and external expectations for Smiths key markets. The Committee sets targets that it considers to be 
challenging but attainable and aligned to the Company’s business objectives over the short term, as reflected in the annual business 
plan, and longer term, consistent with the strategic plan. On top of aligning strategy with incentives, targets are designed to ensure that 
participants are aligned with the interests of shareholders.
Difference in policy between executive directors and other employees
The reward policy for other senior employees is broadly consistent with that for executive directors, and the Company does not currently 
operate any incentive plans in which only executive directors participate. The Committee reviews each year the all-employee pay and 
incentive trends and takes these into account in setting executive director pay levels. The principles of remuneration packages being 
market related, performance sensitive and driven by business needs are applied at all levels and geographies in the Group.
Pay scenarios

elements of remuneration under three different performance scenarios; ‘Minimum’, ‘On-Target’ and ‘Maximum’.

Chairman and non-executive directors
The policy for the remuneration of the Chairman and non-executive directors at Smiths is summarised in the table below:
Element and link to strategy Operation Opportunity Performance measures
Annual fee
To attract, motivate and retain 
non-executive directors with the 
required skills and expertise.
Fees may be paid in cash or a 
combination of cash and shares 
and are reviewed annually (but 
not necessarily increased) 
to ensure they compare 
appropriately to fees payable at 
companies of similar size and 
complexity to Smiths.
Additional fees are paid to the 
chairs of the Remuneration, 
Nomination and Audit 
Committees and to the Senior 
Independent Director to reflect 
the additional time commitment 
of these roles.
The additional fee paid to the 
Chairman of the Board is 
determined by the Committee, 
absent the Chairman, while 
the fees for all non-executive 
directors are agreed by the 
Chairman and executive 
directors.
Fees are adjusted according 
to the outcome of the annual 
reviews. The basic fee for non-
executive directors is subject  
to the maximum aggregate 
annual fee of £750,000, as 
approved by shareholders in 
2006 in the Company’s Articles  
of Association.
Not applicable.
Other
The Chairman and non-executive directors are not eligible for benefits. The Chairman and the non-executive directors are not eligible 
for bonuses or participation in share schemes or any pension provision. They are paid an attendance allowance for each overseas 
meeting attended in addition to the annual fee and are reimbursed for actual expenses incurred (transportation, hotels etc.).
Approach to recruitment remuneration
External appointments
The Committee approves the remuneration of each executive director on their appointment. In setting the remuneration during the 
recruitment of external appointments, the Committee will apply the following policy:
External appointments
Pay element Policy on recruitment
Salary Salary on recruitment is determined based on the same principles as the annual salary review, as outlined 
in the policy table.
Pension As described in the policy table.
Benefits As described in the policy table.
Annual Bonus As described in the policy table and typically pro-rated for the proportion of year served.
Maximum annual award opportunity: 180% of salary with mandatory deferral of 33% into shares.
LTIP May be considered for an award under the LTIP on similar terms to other executives.
Maximum annual award opportunity: 400% of salary.
Other The Committee may make an award in recognition of incentive arrangements forfeited on leaving a previous 
employer. Any such award will take account of relevant factors including the fair value of awards forfeited, 
any performance conditions attached, the likelihood of those conditions being met and the proportion of the 
vesting period remaining. For the purposes of making such awards, but for no other reason, the Committee 
may avail itself of Listing Rule 9.4.2R. The Committee may also make payments to cover reasonable 
expenses in recruitment and relocation, and any other miscellaneous expenses including but not limited  
to housing, tax and immigration support.  Smiths Group plc  Annual Report 2017
111
GO VERNANCE
Internal promotions
In cases of appointing a new executive director by way of internal promotion, the policy will be consistent with that for external 
appointees, as detailed above. Any commitments made prior to an individual’s promotion will continue to be honoured even if they would 
not otherwise be consistent with the policy prevailing when the commitment is fulfilled, although the Company may, where appropriate, 
seek to revise an individual’s existing service contract on promotion to ensure it aligns with other executive directors and prevailing 
market best practice.
Disclosure on the remuneration structure of any new executive director (external or internal), including details of any exceptional 
payments, will be disclosed in the RNS notification made at the time of appointment and in the Annual Report on Remuneration for  
the year in which the recruitment occurred.
Non-executive directors
In recruiting a new non-executive director, the Committee will use the policy as set out in the table on page 110.
Service contracts
The Company’s policy is that executive directors are normally employed on terms which include a one-year rolling period of notice and 
provision for the payment of a predetermined sum in the event of termination of employment in certain circumstances (but excluding 
circumstances where the Company is entitled to dismiss without compensation). In addition to payment of basic salary, pension 
allowance and benefits in respect of the unexpired portion of the one-year notice period, the predetermined sum would include annual 
bonus and share awards only in respect of the period they have served, payable following the end of the relevant performance period 
and subject to the normal performance conditions. Existing service contracts or other applicable agreements are available for viewing 
at the Company’s Registered Office. 
Andy Reynolds Smith
Andy Reynolds Smith is employed under a service contract with the Company dated 6 July 2015 and effective from 25 September 2015.  
It may be terminated by 12 months’ notice given by the Company or six months’ notice given by Andy Reynolds Smith. The Company may 
elect to terminate the contract by making a payment in lieu of notice equal to Andy Reynolds Smith’s base salary and benefits (including 
pension allowance) in respect of any unserved period of notice. The service contract contains specific provisions enabling a reduction in 
any phased payments in lieu of notice, in the event that Andy Reynolds Smith finds alternative employment during the notice period. 
Chris O’Shea
Chris O’Shea is employed under a service contract with the Company dated 30 April 2015 and effective from 18 September 2015. It may 
be terminated by 12 months’ notice given by the Company or six months’ notice given by Chris O’Shea. The service contract contains 
specific provisions enabling a reduction in any phased payments in lieu of notice, in the event that Chris O’Shea finds alternative 
employment during the notice period. Chris O’Shea ceased to be a director on 19 May 2017 and will cease to be employed by the 
Company on 18 November 2017. Up to that date he will continue to be entitled to base salary (£507,375 per annum), benefits and  
pension allowance in accordance with terms of existing employment contract. 
Bill Seeger
Bill Seeger is employed under an extended letter of agreement with the Company dated 22 June 2017 and effective from 19 May 2017 in 
the role of Chief Financial Officer for an interim period. It is anticipated that Bill Seeger will return to his Non-Executive Director position 
at the earlier of the appointment of a new Chief Financial Officer, or 1 January 2018. The agreement can be terminated on one month’s 
notice by the Company or by Bill Seeger. 
Chairman and non-executive directors
The Chairman and the non-executive directors serve the Company under letters of appointment and do not have contracts of service  
or contracts for services. Except where appointed at a general meeting, directors stand for election by shareholders at the first AGM 
following appointment. Although the Articles of Association only require directors to stand for re-election at every third AGM (or such 
earlier AGM as the Board may determine) thereafter (under Article 49), the Board has resolved that all directors who are willing to 
continue in office will stand for re-election by the shareholders each year at the AGM. Either party can terminate the appointment on  
one month’s written notice and no compensation is payable in the event of an appointment being terminated early.

Leaving and change-of-control provisions
For those individuals regarded as ’bad leavers’ (eg voluntary 
resignation or dismissals for cause), annual bonus awards are 
forfeited, and outstanding matching awards under the CIP and 
outstanding awards under the LTIP automatically lapse.
A ‘good leaver’ will typically remain eligible for a pro-rated annual 
bonus award to be paid after the end of the financial year and LTIP 
awards will typically vest at the normal vesting date to the extent 
that the associated performance conditions are met, but will 
normally be pro-rated on the basis of actual service within the 
performance period. In cases of death or disability, individuals are 
automatically deemed to be good leavers under the plan rules of 
the LTIP. All other good leavers will be defined at the discretion of 
the Committee on a case-by-case basis. 
In the event of a change of control, LTIP awards will vest to the 
extent that each of the performance conditions is met based on the 
Committee’s assessment of performance over the performance 
period to the date of change of control. For internal performance 
measures, the Committee may exercise its judgment in 
determining the outcome based on its assessment of whether or 
not the performance conditions would have been met to a greater 
or lesser extent at the end of the full performance period. Awards 
will also normally be pro-rated to reflect the time that has elapsed 
between the grant of the award and the date of change of control.
The Committee retains discretion to vary these provisions on a 
case-by-case basis.
In connection with the termination of an executive director’s 
contract, the Company may make a payment on account of accrued 
but untaken leave and may pay outplacement and legal fees for 
support provided to the individual.
External appointments
Subject to the overriding requirements of the Company, the Committee 
allows executive directors to accept external appointments where it 
considers that such appointments will contribute to the director’s 
breadth of knowledge and experience. Directors are permitted to 
retain fees associated with such appointments.
Consideration of employment conditions
The Committee always takes into account pay and employment 
conditions elsewhere in the Company. We do not consult directly 
with employees regarding executive director pay. Each year the 
Committee is provided with information on pay trends and ratios of 
the wider employee population across the Group.
Consideration of shareholder views
The Committee has actively consulted with major shareholders 
whenever there have been changes to the remuneration policy in  
a manner that is receptive to and respectful of shareholder views.
Annual Report on Remuneration
This section of the remuneration report details how our Policy was 
implemented in the year ended 31 July 2017.
Committee members and meeting attendance in 2017
The members of the Committee are Anne Quinn (Chair of the 
Committee), Sir George Buckley, Sir Kevin Tebbit, Bruno Angelici, 
Tanya Fratto, Bill Seeger (until he resigned following his 
appointment as Chief Financial Officer on an interim basis on 
19 May 2017), Mark Seligman and Noel Tata (from his appointment 
on 1 January 2017). Their attendance at meetings held during the 
year is set out on page 104.
Sir George Buckley is absent when his own remuneration as 
Chairman of the Company is under consideration. The Chief 
Executive attends meetings of the Committee by invitation but  
he is not involved in the determination of his own remuneration. 
Advisers to the Committee
During the year, the Committee received material assistance and 
advice from the Chief Executive, the HR Director, the Group 
Director of Reward, Mercer | Kepler (the Committee’s appointed 
independent remuneration adviser) and Freshfields Bruckhaus 
Deringer LLP. The Company Secretary has been secretary to the 
Committee since May 2016.
The Company paid a total annual fee of £49,950 to Mercer | Kepler 
in relation to remuneration advice to the Committee during the 
year. Fees were determined on the basis of time and expenses. 
During 2017, Mercer | Kepler provided the Committee with 
benchmarking analysis of executive and non-executive directors’ 
pay, information on market trends, drafting support for this and 
last year’s Directors’ remuneration report, and other relevant 
assistance on determining directors’ remuneration. Kepler was 
reappointed by the Committee via competitive tender in 2013. 
Mercer | Kepler is a founding member of the Remuneration 
Consultants Group and a signatory to its Code of Conduct. Kepler’s 
parent company, Mercer, provides unrelated services to the Group 
in the areas of all-employee reward and retirement benefits. 
However, the Committee is satisfied that the advice provided by 
Mercer | Kepler is objective and independent and that they do not 
have connections with the company that may impair their 
independence. Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLP was appointed 
by the Company to advise the Group on various legal matters 
during the year.
Main activities during the year
During the year under review, the Committee’s main activities 
included:
• further aligning remuneration arrangements to the new 
business strategy;
• consideration of market trends and pay levels for the executive 
directors and the Chairman;
• the exit arrangements of the Chief Financial Officer
• review of all senior executive salary and bonus payments;
• target setting for both the Annual Incentive Plan and Long-Term 
Incentive Plan;
• performance review of the executive directors against the 
targets for the financial year; and
• other activities including the appointment terms of key senior 
executive roles.  Smiths Group plc  Annual Report 2017

Personal Objectives 
Challenging personal objectives are set for each Executive Director to reinforce the Company’s annual and strategic plans. For 2017, 
these targets included: focus on the Group’s portfolio shape, building organisation and leadership excellence, and several targeted 
financial priorities. 
In determining the outcomes of this element of the AIP, the Committee took into consideration the following achievements:
• Strong execution of strategic initiatives, including portfolio reshaping. The successful acquisition of Morpho provides global strength 
in our Detection business and was an important step in growing Smiths, and the portfolio has been reshaped further by focussing on 
attractive market segments and divesting four businesses. The Group has also successfully introduced a new product innovation

commercially sensitive. In line with this commitment, the table below summarises the financial targets and the Company’s actual 
performance against these for the 2016 annual bonus. Andy Reynolds Smith and Chris O’Shea both achieved 92% of their personal

Statement of implementation of remuneration policy in 2018
Base salary and benefits
Salaries are reviewed (but not necessarily increased) annually and benchmarked against comparable roles at other FTSE 100 
companies of similar market capitalisation, revenues and complexity. Having considered a number of important factors including 
individuals’ performance and experience, the relative performance of the Company and the remuneration policy within the Company,  
the Committee has determined the following annualised salaries for executive directors for 2018: 
Executive director 2016/17 2017/18
Andy Reynolds Smith £780,000 £800,000
Bill Seeger was appointed Chief Financial Officer on an interim basis on 19 May 2017 after it was announced that Chris O’Shea would  
be stepping down. In this role, Bill Seeger is paid a monthly salary of £83,333. Bill Seeger does not receive any pension contribution (or 
allowance in lieu), and he is not eligible to participate in the annual bonus or the LTIP.
Pension and benefits
Andy Reynolds Smith will continue to receive a cash allowance in lieu of pension of 25% of his base salary and Chris O’Shea will also 
continue to do so until he leaves the Company on 18 November 2017. The executive directors do not have a prospective entitlement  
to a defined benefit pension.
Annual bonus
For 2018, Andy Reynolds Smith will continue to have a maximum bonus opportunity of 180% of salary. Annual bonus measures (and their 
weightings) will remain unchanged from 2017. 33% of any bonus earned will be deferred into shares for three years. Specific targets 
cannot be disclosed at this time due to the commercially sensitive nature of these objectives, but they will be disclosed at such a time  
as the Committee deems them to no longer affect the commerciality of the Company, likely to be within two years of the end of the 
performance period. 
Long-Term Incentive Plan
The LTIP is a conventional share plan under which an award over a capped number of shares will vest if demanding performance 
conditions are met. LTIP awards of conditional shares are granted to selected senior executives (including the executive directors) with 
face values of up to 400% of salary. Under the LTIP, the normal annual grants are 300% of salary for the Chief Executive and 250% of 
salary for the Finance Director.
The LTIP award granted to Andy Reynolds Smith in 2017/18 (at the normal annual grant level of 300% of salary) will vest on the 
achievement of the following performance conditions:
Performance measure Weighting
Threshold 
performance 
target 
Maximum 
performance 
target (full 
vesting of 
element)
3-year EPS growth 35% 3% p.a. 12% p.a.
3-year average return on capital employed 35% 15% 18%
3-year average annual cash conversion 30% 90% 105%
This represents no change to the LTIP for the 2017/18 cycle. The Committee believes that the current structure provides an appropriate 
balance between earnings growth, returns and cash. The Committee recognises that this balance of Group’s performance measures 
remains very important for many of our largest shareholders. As previously stated, the scorecard will be reviewed at the start of each 
future LTIP cycle to ensure it continues to reflect the Group’s strategic priorities.
For performance between ‘threshold’ and ‘maximum’, awards vest on a straight-line sliding scale. Smiths Group plc  Annual Report 2017

Share ownership guidelines
Executive directors are required, over time, to acquire a shareholding with a value equal to at least two years’ base salary. Executive 
directors are required to retain at least 50% of any net vested share awards (after sales to meet tax liabilities) until those guidelines  
are achieved. Bill Seeger is not subject to this requirement, reflecting the interim nature of his appointment as CFO. 
There is no shareholding policy for non-executive directors.

on a quarterly basis using a fixed proportion (20%) of the after-tax fees he receives from the Company, Sir George Buckley acquired  
431 Ordinary Shares on 1 August 2017. There have been no other changes in the interests of the directors and their connected persons 
between 31 July 2017 and the date of this report.
Share scheme dilution limits
The Company complies with the guidelines laid down by the Investment Association. These restrict the issue of new shares under all  
the Company’s share schemes in any 10-year period to 10% of the issued ordinary share capital and under the Company’s discretionary 
schemes to 5% in any 10-year period. As at 31 July 2017, the headroom available under these limits was 7.69% and 3.22%, respectively.

Share capital 
As at 31 July 2017, the Company’s issued share capital was 
395,476,662 ordinary shares, with a nominal value of £148,303,748. 
The ordinary shares are listed and admitted to trading on the Main 
Market of the London Stock Exchange. The Company has an 
American Depositary Receipt (ADR) programme for which J.P. 
Morgan acts as Depositary and transfer agent. One ADR equates to 
one ordinary share, and the programme trades ‘over-the-counter’ 
as a level 1 ADR programme. As at 31 July 2017, 7,059,489 ordinary 
shares were held by the nominee of the programme depositary in 
respect of the same number of ADRs in issue at that time.
The holders of ordinary shares are entitled to receive the 
Company’s reports and accounts, to attend and speak at general 
meetings of the Company, to appoint proxies and to exercise 
voting rights.
There are no restrictions on transfer, or limitations on the holding, 
of any class of shares. There are no requirements for prior 
approval of any transfers. None of the shares carry any special 
rights with regards to control of the Company. There are no 
restrictions on the voting rights attaching to the ordinary shares 
(other than a 48 hour cut-off for the casting of proxy votes prior  
to a general meeting). There are no arrangements of which the 
directors are aware under which financial rights are held by  
a person other than the holder of the shares, and no known 
agreements relating to, or restrictions on, share transfers  
or voting rights. 
Shares acquired through Company share schemes and plans rank 
pari passu with the shares in issue and have no special rights. The 
Company operates an employee benefit trust, with an independent 
trustee, to hold shares pending employees becoming entitled to 
them under the Company’s share schemes and plans. On 31 July 
2017 the trust held 766 ordinary shares in the Company. The trust 
waived its dividend entitlement on its holding during the year, and 
the trust abstains from voting the shares at general meetings.
Powers of the directors 
The powers of the directors are determined by the Act and the 
Articles of Association of the Company. The directors have been 
authorised to issue and allot shares, and to buy back shares. 
These powers are subject to annual shareholder approval at the 
Annual General Meeting (AGM), and at the 2017 AGM shareholders 
will be asked to renew and extend the authority, given to the 
directors at the last AGM, to allot shares in the Company, or grant 
rights to subscribe for, or to convert any security into, shares  
in the Company for the purposes of section 551 of the Act (the 
‘Allotment Resolution’).
The authority in the first part of the Allotment Resolution will 
allow the directors to allot new shares in the Company, or to 
grant rights to subscribe for, or convert any security into, shares 
in the Company up to a nominal value which is equivalent to 
approximately one-third of the total issued ordinary share capital 
of the Company.
The authority in the second part of the Allotment Resolution will 
allow the directors to allot new shares in the Company, or to grant 
rights to subscribe for, or convert any security into, shares in the 
Company, only in connection with a rights issue, up to a nominal 
value which is equivalent to approximately an additional third of the 
total issued ordinary share capital of the Company. This is in line 
with corporate governance guidelines. 
There are no present plans to undertake a rights issue or to allot 
new shares other than in connection with the Company’s share 
schemes and plans. The directors intend to take note of relevant 
corporate governance guidelines on the use of such powers in the 
event that the authority is exercised.
The Company did not repurchase any shares during the financial 
year ended 31 July 2017. As at 15 September 2017 the Company 
had an unexpired authority to repurchase ordinary shares up to a 
maximum of 39,540,648. As at 15 September 2017, the Company 
did not hold any shares in treasury. Any ordinary shares purchased 
may be cancelled or held in treasury.
Change of control
The Company has in place credit facility agreements under which 
a change in control would trigger prepayment clauses. The 
Company also has bonds in issue, the terms of which would allow 
bondholders to exercise put options and require the Company to 
buy back the bonds at their principal amount plus interest if a 
rating downgrade occurs at the same time as a change of control 
takes effect. The Company’s share plans (including the buy-out 
awards granted to the executive directors on their appointments) 
contain clauses which may cause options and awards to vest on 
a change in control, in some cases subject to the satisfaction of 
performance conditions at that time. The Company is not party to 
any other significant agreements that would take effect, alter or 
terminate upon a change of control following a takeover.
No director or employee is contractually entitled to compensation 
for loss of office or employment as a result of a change in control, 
except that provisions in the Company’s share schemes may cause 
options and awards granted to employees under such schemes to 
vest on a change in control, in some cases subject to the 
satisfaction of performance conditions at that time.
Remuneration policy
Details of the Directors’ remuneration policy, as approved at 
the AGM in 2015, is shown on pages 105 to 108 of the Directors’ 
remuneration report. Under the regulations which now form part 
of the Act, the remuneration policy must be put to a binding 
shareholder vote at least once every three years. All payments  
to former and current directors must comply with the terms  
of the policy, unless specifically approved by shareholders in 
general meeting.  Smiths Group plc  Annual Report 2017

Political donations
The Group made contributions to non-EU political parties totaling 
$58,500 (£46,000) during the year. The political contributions were 
made on a bi-partisan basis in the US, in accordance with US state 
and federal election laws, in order to raise awareness and to 
promote the interests of the Company. The Group has a number 
of key manufacturing sites and approximately 8,100 employees  
in the US.
Going concern
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to 
affect its future development, performance and position are set 
out in the Strategic report on pages 1 to 75. The financial position 
of the Company, its cash-flows, liquidity position and borrowing 
facilities are described in the Financial review on pages 52 to 57. 
In addition, the notes to the accounts include the Company’s 
objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital, 
financial risk management objectives, details of its financial 
instruments and hedging activities, and its exposures to credit 
risk and liquidity risk.
In October 2016, the Company established a €2.5bn Euro Medium 
Term Note Programme (the ‘Programme’). In February 2017, 
pursuant to the Programme, the Company issued €650m of new 
long-term public debt securities with a maturity in 2027. On 5 May 
2017 the Group repaid €300m debt under long-term public debt 
securities issued in 2010. The new issuance and repayment 
resulted in an increase in the average maturity of gross debt  
to 5.9 years (from 4.5 years at 31 July 2016).
At 31 July 2017 the net debt of the Group was £967m, a £11m 
decrease from 31 July 2016. At the end of July the Group had 
available cash and short-term deposits of £782m. These liquid 
resources are immediately available with 98% invested with the 
Group’s global banking partners. 
The Group maintains a core US$800m committed revolving credit 
facility from these banks which was undrawn at 31 July 2017. 
This committed facility matures in February 2021. This facility 
has certain financial covenants however these are not expected 
to prevent utilisation at the Group’s discretion if required. 
This financial position and debt maturity profile provides 
confidence that the Group has sufficient financial resources for 
the foreseeable future. As a consequence, the directors believe 
that the Company is well placed to manage its business and 
its liabilities as they fall due. In coming to this conclusion, the 
directors have taken account of the Group’s risk management 
process described on pages 60 to 61, and have paid particular 
attention to the financial and pension funding risks and their 
mitigation (see page 62).
The directors, having made appropriate enquiries, have a 
reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have 
adequate resources to continue in operation for the foreseeable 
future and for a period of at least 12 months from the date of this 
report. Thus they continue to adopt the going concern basis of 
accounting in preparing the annual accounts of the Company  
and the Group.
Long term Viability Statement
The directors have assessed the longer-term prospects of the 
Group, taking into account the current position of the Group and 
a range of internal and external factors. The assessment is 
described in the Strategic report on page 57.
Disclosure of information to the auditor
As at the date of this report, as far as each director is aware, there 
is no relevant audit information of which the Company’s auditor is 
unaware. Each director has taken all the steps he or she should 
have taken as a director in order to make himself or herself aware 
of any relevant audit information and to establish that the 
Company’s auditors are aware of that information.
Annual General Meeting (AGM)
The 2017 AGM will be held on Tuesday, 14 November 2017 at 11:00 am. 
The Notice of the AGM will be published on the Company’s website, 
www.smiths.com, on or around Tuesday, 10 October 2017. Electronic 
copies of the Annual Report 2017 and the Notice of AGM will be

The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the Group and Parent Company financial statements in accordance 
with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare accounts for each financial year. Under company law the directors must not approve the 
accounts unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and the Company and of the profit 
or loss of the Group for that period. In preparing these accounts, the directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
• state whether the consolidated accounts comply with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”), and the Parent Company 
accounts comply with applicable UK Accounting Standards, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the 
accounts; and
• prepare the accounts on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the Company will continue 
in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Group’s and the 
Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Group and the Company and 
enable them to ensure that the accounts and the Directors’ remuneration report comply with the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards 
the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Group and 
the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
Directors’ responsibility statement
The directors consider that the Annual Report, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s position and performance, business model and strategy.
Each of the directors (who are listed on pages 78 to 81) confirms that to the best of his or her knowledge: 
• the Group’s financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union and give a true and 
fair view of the Group’s assets, liabilities and financial position as at 31 July 2017 and of its profit for the financial year then ended; and
• the Group directors’ report and Strategic report include a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the 
position and performance of the Group, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that the Group faces.

Report on the audit of the financial statements
Opinion
In our opinion:
• Smiths Group plc’s Group financial statements and Company financial statements (the “financial statements”) give a true and fair 
view of the state of the Group’s and of the Company’s affairs as at 31 July 2017 and of the Group’s profit and cash flows for the year 
then ended;
• the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union;
• the Company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting 
Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards, comprising FRS 101 “Reduced Disclosure Framework”, and applicable law); and
• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the 
Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
We have audited the financial statements, included within the Annual Report, which comprise: the consolidated balance sheet and 
Company balance sheet as at 31 July 2017; the consolidated income statement and consolidated statement of comprehensive income for 
the year then ended; the consolidated cash-flow statement for the year then ended; the consolidated statement of changes in equity and 
the Company statement of changes in equity for the year then ended; and the notes to the financial statements, which include a 
description of the significant accounting policies.
Our opinion is consistent with our reporting to the Audit Committee.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (“ISAs (UK)”) and applicable law. Our responsibilities 
under ISAs (UK) are further described in the Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. We 
believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Independence
We remained independent of the Group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial 
statements in the UK, which includes the FRC’s Ethical Standard as applicable to listed public interest entities, and we have fulfilled our 
other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.
 
To the best of our knowledge and belief, we declare that non-audit services prohibited by the FRC’s Ethical Standard were not provided 
to the Group or the Company.
Other than those disclosed in note 2 to the financial statements, we have provided no non-audit services to the Group or the Company  
in the period from 1 August 2016 to 31 July 2017.

The scope of our audit
As part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements. 
In particular, we looked at where the directors made subjective judgements, for example in respect of significant accounting estimates 
that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain. As in all of our audits we also addressed 
the risk of management override of internal controls, including evaluating whether there was evidence of bias by the directors that 
represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud. 
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in the auditors’ professional judgement, were of most significance in the audit of the financial 
statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) 
identified by the auditors, including those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the allocation of resources in the 
audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters, and any comments we make on the results of our procedures 
thereon, were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we  
do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. This is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit. 
Key audit matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter
Revenue recognition (occurrence), together with accounting for complex 
programmes and contract accounting in the Smiths Detection and Smiths 
Interconnect Divisions (Group)
Refer also to Accounting Policies
We focused on revenue recognition for all divisions in the Group to 
check that revenue has been appropriately recognised upon fulfilment 
of obligations.
In the Smiths Detection and Smiths Interconnect divisions we focused 
on the accounting for complex programmes and contract accounting. 
The recognition of revenue is largely dependent on the terms of 
the underlying contract with the customer, including the nature of 
separate deliverables within the contract, achieving milestones within 
those contracts and the mechanisms in the contract by which risks 
and rewards of goods and services are transferred to the customer. 
These contracts are usually long term in nature, sometimes spanning 
a number of reporting periods. This means that the final profitability 
of a contract, which will be based upon forecast revenues and costs 
to complete, can be uncertain during the earlier phases. Judgement 
must therefore be applied in order to estimate the profit margins to 
recognise the revenue that is recorded.
Changes in conditions and circumstances over time can result in 
variations to the original contract terms or to the overall profitability 
of the contract. This can include cost overruns which require further 
negotiation and settlements resulting in the need for provisions.
For all the divisions we assessed whether the Group’s revenue 
recognition policies complied with IFRSs as adopted by the EU 
and tested the implementation of those policies. Specifically we 
considered whether revenue was recognised based on the transfer 
of the risks and rewards of ownership of goods to the customer or 
the accounting period in which services were rendered by testing a 
sample of revenue items to contract and shipping documents, with a 
specific focus, particularly on major programmes where revenue was 
recorded close to the year-end.
Where appropriate we evaluated the relevant IT systems and tested 
the operating effectiveness of the internal controls over the recording 
of revenue in the correct period.
We also tested journal entries posted to revenue accounts to identify 
any unusual or irregular items, and the reconciliations between the 
systems used by the Group and its financial ledgers.
In the case of the Smiths Detection and Smiths Interconnect divisions, 
for a sample of contracts, we read extracts of the relevant customer 
agreements and tested the accounting for separate deliverables and 
contractual milestones. This testing included evaluating customer 
acceptance of the work done to establish whether contractual 
milestones had been achieved, assessing the impact of any ongoing 
disputes, and assessing the reasonableness of the directors’ 
estimates of costs to complete the contract by comparing them to 
actual historical costs incurred on comparable contracts.
We did not identify any material exceptions from the audit work 
performed and we found estimates to be in line with our expectations.
Acquisition accounting (Group)
Refer also to note 26 and 27
The Group completed its acquisition of Morpho Detection from Safran 
SA on the 6th April 2017, resulting in the recognition of £240m of 
acquired intangibles, £210m of goodwill and £140m of net assets. A 
key condition of the acquisition was the disposal of Morpho Detection’s 
explosive trace detection business (“Trace”), which resulted in this 
business being classified as a discontinued business. 
Judgement was required in identifying and valuing these acquired 
intangibles and goodwill, determining the valuation of the other 
assets and liabilities acquired and the classification of the Trace 
business. In addition, the disclosure requirements in respect of 
acquisitions are extensive. 
Due to the quantum and complexity of the judgements, we focussed on 
this area. 
We obtained and read the Morpho Sale and Purchase Agreement 
(SPA) to gain an understanding of the key terms of the acquisition. 
In testing this acquisition and related Trace disposal, we considered 
whether the identified intangible assets were appropriate by reference 
to the SPA, due diligence reports and other supporting documentation. 
We obtained the calculation of the fair value of intangible assets 
acquired, and where material, assessed the methodology employed, 
involving experts and corroborated the inputs and assumptions to 
supporting evidence. We noted no exceptions through performing 
these procedures.
We also checked that the material fair value adjustments to the net 
assets were consistent with the accounting standard requirements. 
Based on the evidence obtained, we did not identify any indications 
that the fair value adjustments identified by management were 
inappropriate. 
We read the disclosures in the financial statements to satisfy 
ourselves that they are in line with the requirements of the relevant 
accounting standards. Smiths Group plc  Annual Report 2017

Key audit matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter
Accounting for disposals (Group) 
Refer also to note 28
We focussed on this area as the Group recorded significant profit 
on disposals (£175m) following the divestment of its Artificial lift, 
Interconnect Power and Microwave Telecoms businesses during the 
year, along with its Wallace product line (disclosed in note 28 to the 
financial statements)
Judgement arose in determining the value of goodwill allocated to 
the Wallace product line. In addition the calculation of the disposal 
gains was complex, particularly around the recycling of accumulated 
currency translation reserves.
We obtained and read the relevant clauses within all the related sale 
and purchase agreements (SPAs) to obtain an understanding of the 
perimeter and requirements of the disposal. 
We assessed the recycling of the currency reserve, tested the 
allocation of Wallace assets, including goodwill, and verified the 
mathematical accuracy of the disposal calculation. We also tested  
the consideration received to supporting evidence 
Finally, we read the disclosures within the financial statements to 
ensure these met the presentation requirements of the relevant 
accounting standards.
We noted no exceptions through performing these procedures.
Product litigation provisions for asbestos in John Crane, Inc. and flexible 
gas piping product in Titeflex Corporation (Group)
Refer also to note 22
John Crane, Inc., a US based subsidiary of the Group, is currently one 
of many co-defendants in litigation relating to products previously 
manufactured which contained asbestos.
A provision of £237m has been made for the future defence costs 
which the Group is expected to incur and the expected costs of future 
adverse judgments against John Crane, Inc.
Titeflex Corporation, another US based subsidiary of the Group, has 
received a number of claims from insurance companies seeking 
recompense on a subrogated basis for the effects of damage allegedly 
caused by lightning strikes in relation to its flexible gas piping product.
It has also received a number of product liability claims regarding 
this product, some in the form of purported class actions. A provision 
of £84m has been made for the costs which the Group is expected to 
incur in respect of these claims.
We focused on these areas because there is significant judgement 
involved in the assumptions used to estimate the provisions, in 
particular those relating to the US litigation environment such as the 
future level of claims and the cost of defence. As a result the provision 
may be subject to potentially material revisions from time to time.
In John Crane, Inc. we used our own internal experts to challenge 
management’s assumptions underlying the adverse judgment and 
defence cost provisions. This included an examination of the model 
maintained by management’s valuation expert and evaluation of 
the work of the expert, by considering the appropriateness of the 
methodology used, the reasonableness of assumptions (including the 
use of a rolling 10 year horizon) and considering alternative outcomes, 
particularly the sensitivity calculations performed. In addition we 
tested the mathematical accuracy of the underlying calculations and 
agreed input data to source documents.
We challenged management’s underlying assumptions supporting its 
Titeflex provision. This included an evaluation of the valuation model, 
by testing the mathematical accuracy of the underlying calculations 
and the input data such as the average amount of settlements, the 
number of future settlements and the period over which expenditure 
can be reasonably estimated by testing them to historic claims.
We also discussed these matters with the Company’s internal 
legal counsel, obtained letters from external counsel and evaluated 
the appropriateness of the disclosures made in the Group 
financial statements.
We found the assumptions to be consistent and in line with historical 
claims. We read the disclosures and found them to be consistent with 
the information we have obtained during the course of our audit.
Working capital and associated provisions (Group)
Refer also to notes 13 and 14
We focused on this area because inventory provisions include 
subjective estimates and are influenced by assumptions concerning 
future selling prices and the level of sales activity, and the Group 
also has material levels of trade receivables that are overdue and not 
impaired (as disclosed in note 14 to the financial statements).
We focused in particular on inventory levels in those parts of the 
business experiencing challenging trading environments. We also 
focused on divisions with inherent judgements associated with large 
programmes and complex contractual terms.
The key associated risks were recoverability of billed and unbilled 
trade receivables and the valuation of inventory.
Where appropriate, we evaluated the directors’ forecasted sales for 
each significant category of slow moving inventory by comparing them 
to historical sales and orders for future sales.
We compared the historical provision for bad debts to the actual 
amounts written off, to determine whether the directors’ estimation 
techniques were reasonable and considered the adequacy of 
provisions for bad debts for significant customers at reporting unit 
level, taking into account specific credit risk assessments.
We did not identify any material exceptions from our audit work. Smiths Group plc  Annual Report 2017

Key audit matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter
Taxation provisions and the recognition of deferred tax assets (Group)
Refer also to note 6
The Group has recognised £272m deferred tax assets on the balance 
sheet, the recognition of which involves judgement by management 
as to the likelihood of the realisation of these deferred tax assets. 
The expectation that the benefit of these assets will be realised is 
dependent on a number of factors, including appropriate taxable 
temporary timing differences, and whether there will be sufficient 
taxable profits in future periods to support recognition. In the current 
year the Group recognised a £69 million deferred tax asset in the 
UK in respect of past losses following a reassessment of the future 
profitability of the Group’s activities in the UK. 
The Group has recognised provisions against uncertain tax positions, 
the valuation of which is an inherently judgemental area. The Group 
has a wide geographic footprint and is subject to tax laws in a number 
of jurisdictions.
We evaluated the directors’ assessment as to whether there will be 
sufficient taxable profits in future periods to support the recognition 
of deferred tax assets by evaluating the directors’ future cash flow 
forecasts, and the process by which they were drawn up, including 
testing the underlying calculations and comparing the forecasts to 
historical performance. 
We also used our tax specialists to assess management’s 
assumptions underlying the provisions for uncertain tax positions.  
We discussed with management the known uncertain tax positions 
and read communications from taxation authorities to identify 
uncertain tax positions.
We did not identify any material exceptions from our audit work.
Goodwill and intangible asset impairment assessments (Group)
Refer also to notes 10 and 11
The Group holds significant amounts of goodwill and intangible assets 
on the balance sheet, as detailed in note 10 to the financial statements. 
The risk is that these balances are overstated.
Goodwill must be tested for impairment on at least an annual basis. 
The determination of recoverable amount, being the higher of value-
in-use and fair value less costs to dispose, requires judgement in both 
identifying and then valuing the relevant cash generating units (CGUs).
The impairment assessment for these assets involves subjective 
judgements about future business performance, with key 
assumptions including cash flows, the overall long-term growth rates, 
discount rates used and to the extent relevant, the fair value less costs 
to dispose.
The Group also holds capitalised development costs, where the 
risk of inappropriate capitalisation or impairment may arise. The 
key judgements relate to the commercial viability of the products 
under development and related assumptions used within the related 
impairment assessments.
We evaluated the directors’ future cash flow forecasts, and the 
process by which they were drawn up, including testing the underlying 
calculations and comparing them to the latest Board approved 
divisional budgets.
We challenged:
• the directors’ key assumptions for long term growth rates in the 
forecasts by comparing them to historical results, and economic 
and industry forecasts; and
• the discount rate by assessing the cost of capital for the Group.
We evaluated the reasonableness of the directors’ forecast 
performance by performing a sensitivity analysis around the key 
drivers of the cash flow forecasts. We found the assumptions to be 
consistent and in line with our expectations. 
We also tested the directors’ assessment of the fair value less costs  
of disposal by comparing it to external analyst valuations.
We evaluated the appropriateness of the related disclosures in note 
11 of the financial statements, including sensitivities provided with 
respect to the Morpho Detection CGU.
To address the risks around capitalised development costs we 
assessed the business cases supporting commercial viability, tested 
key assumptions within the impairment assessments, and performed 
sensitivity analysis. 
We did not identify any material exceptions from our audit work.
Defined benefit pension plan net assets and liabilities (Group and Company)
Refer also to note 8
The Group has defined benefit pension plans with net post-retirement 
assets of £390m and net post-retirement liabilities of £166m, which 
are significant in the context of the overall balance sheet of the Group 
and Company.
The valuation of the pension liabilities requires some judgement and 
technical expertise in choosing appropriate assumptions. A number 
of the key assumptions (including salary increases, inflation, discount 
rates and mortality) can have a material impact on the calculation of 
the liability.
The pension assets include significant pension asset investments  
and the fair value measurement of which includes judgement.
The recognition of post-retirement plan net assets for accounting 
purposes is dependent on the rights of the employers to recover  
the surplus at the end of the life of the scheme.
We evaluated the directors’ assessment of the assumptions made in 
relation to the valuations of the liabilities and assets in the pension 
plans and the assumptions around salary increases and mortality 
rates by comparing them to national and industry averages. We also 
focussed on the valuation of pension plan liabilities and the pension 
assets as follows:
• We agreed the discount and inflation rates used in the valuation  
of the pension liability to our internally developed benchmarks.
• We obtained third party confirmations on ownership and valuation 
of pension assets.
• We checked that the recognition of post retirement plan net assets 
complies with the Group’s investment principles.
• Where there was no new census data in the year we assessed the 
assumptions used by the actuaries.
• We tested the basis of recognition of the UK pension surplus 
through the reading of scheme rules.
We did not identify any material exceptions from our audit work.

How we tailored the audit scope
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements as 
a whole, taking into account the structure of the Group and the Company, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in 
which they operate.
The Group is organised into five divisions: John Crane, Smiths Medical, Smiths Detection, Smiths Interconnect and Flex-Tek and is a 
consolidation of over 250 units.
In establishing the overall approach to the Group audit, we determined the type of work that needed to be performed at the reporting 
units by us, as the Group Engagement team, or component auditors within PwC UK and from other PwC network firms operating under 
our instruction. Where the work was performed by component auditors, we determined the level of involvement we needed to have in the 
audit work at those reporting units to be able to conclude whether sufficient appropriate audit evidence had been obtained as a basis for 
our opinion on the financial statements as a whole.
The Group’s operating reporting units vary significantly in size and we identified 22 reporting units that, in our view, required an audit  
of their complete financial information, due to their size or risk characteristics. Specific audit procedures over certain balances and 
transactions were performed at a further 18 reporting units, to give appropriate coverage of material balances at both divisional and 
Group levels. Of these, one reporting unit has been determined to be financially significant based on its contribution to Group revenue or 
headline operating profit. We conducted work in 12 countries and the Group engagement team visited reporting sites in North America 
and Europe, and participated in each of the divisional audit clearance meetings. Together, the reporting units subject to audit procedures 
accounted for 75% (2016: 75%) of the Group’s revenues and 78% (2016: 79%) of the Group’s headline operating profit.
Further specific audit procedures over IT controls, central functions such as treasury and areas of judgement, including the accounting 
for acquisitions and disposals, taxation, goodwill, post-retirement benefits and material litigation, were performed at the local 
headquarters of each of the divisions and at the Group’s Head Office.
Materiality
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality. These, 
together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit 
procedures on the individual financial statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating the effect of misstatements, both 
individually and in aggregate on the financial statements as a whole. 
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:
Group financial statements Company financial statements
Overall materiality £20 million (2016: £17 million). £18 million (2016: £15 million).
How we determined it 3.5% of headline operating profit. 0.5% of total assets.
Rationale for benchmark 
applied
Consistent with last year, we applied this benchmark 
because, in our view, this is the metric against which the 
performance of the Group is most commonly measured
Consistent with last year, we applied this benchmark 
because, in our view, we consider a net asset measure 
to reflect the nature of the Company, which primarily 
acts as a holding company for the Group’s investments 
and holds certain liabilities on the balance sheet.
For each component in the scope of our Group audit, we allocated a materiality that is less than our overall Group materiality. The range 
of materiality allocated across components was between £0.5 million and £18 million. Certain components were audited to a local 
statutory audit materiality that was also less than our overall Group materiality.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above £1 million (Group 
audit) (2016: £0.5 million) and £1 million (Company audit) (2016: £0.5 million) as well as misstatements below those amounts that,  
in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.
Going concern
In accordance with ISAs (UK) we report as follows:
Reporting obligation Outcome
We are required to report if we have anything material to add or draw attention to in respect of 
the directors’ statement in the financial statements about whether the directors considered it 
appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements 
and the directors’ identification of any material uncertainties to the Group’s and the Company’s 
ability to continue as a going concern over a period of at least twelve months from the date of 
approval of the financial statements.
We are required to report if the directors’ statement relating to Going Concern in accordance with 
Listing Rule 9.8.6R(3) is materially inconsistent with our knowledge obtained in the audit.
We have nothing material to add or to draw 
attention to. However, because not all future 
events or conditions can be predicted, 
this statement is not a guarantee as to the 
Group’s and Company’s ability to continue 
as a going concern.
We have nothing to report.
Reporting on other information 
The other information comprises all of the information in the Annual Report other than the financial statements and our auditors’  
report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover  
the other information and, accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion or, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in  
this report, any form of assurance thereon.  Smiths Group plc  Annual Report 2017
134
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider 
whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or 
otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify an apparent material inconsistency or material misstatement, we are 
required to perform procedures to conclude whether there is a material misstatement of the financial statements or a material 
misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement  
of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report based on these responsibilities.
With respect to the Strategic Report and Group directors’ report, we also considered whether the disclosures required by the UK 
Companies Act 2006 have been included. 
Based on the responsibilities described above and our work undertaken in the course of the audit, the Companies Act 2006, (CA06), ISAs 
(UK) and the Listing Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) require us also to report certain opinions and matters as described 
below (required by ISAs (UK) unless otherwise stated).
Strategic Report and Group directors’ report
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit, the information given in the Strategic Report and Group 
directors’ report for the year ended 31 July 2017 is consistent with the financial statements and has been prepared in accordance with 
applicable legal requirements. (CA06)
In light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and Company and their environment obtained in the course of the audit,  
we did not identify any material misstatements in the Strategic Report and Group directors’ report. (CA06)
The directors’ assessment of the prospects of the Group and of the principal risks that would threaten the solvency or liquidity of 
the Group
We have nothing material to add or draw attention to regarding:
• The directors’ confirmation on page 61 of the Annual Report that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks 
facing the Group, including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity.
• The disclosures in the Annual Report that describe those risks and explain how they are being managed or mitigated.
• The directors’ explanation on page 57 of the Annual Report as to how they have assessed the prospects of the Group, over what period 
they have done so and why they consider that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have a reasonable 
expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their 
assessment, including any related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.
We have nothing to report having performed a review of the directors’ statement that they have carried out a robust assessment of the 
principal risks facing the Group and the statement in relation to the longer-term viability of the Group. Our review was substantially less 
in scope than an audit and only consisted of making inquiries and considering the directors’ process supporting their statements; 
checking that the statements are in alignment with the relevant provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code (the “Code”); and 
considering whether the statements are consistent with the knowledge and understanding of the Group and Company and their 
environment obtained in the course of the audit. (Listing Rules)
Other Code Provisions
We have nothing to report in respect of our responsibility to report when: 
• The statement given by the directors, on page 97, that they consider the Annual Report taken as a whole to be fair, balanced and 
understandable, and provides the information necessary for the members to assess the Group’s and Company’s position and 
performance, business model and strategy is materially inconsistent with our knowledge of the Group and Company obtained in the 
course of performing our audit.
• The section of the Annual Report on pages 97 and 98 describing the work of the Audit Committee does not appropriately address 
matters communicated by us to the Audit Committee.
• The directors’ statement relating to the Company’s compliance with the Code does not properly disclose a departure from a relevant 
provision of the Code specified, under the Listing Rules, for review by the auditors.
Directors’ Remuneration
In our opinion, the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies 
Act 2006. (CA06)
Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit
Responsibilities of the directors for the financial statements
As explained more fully in the Statement of directors’ responsibilities set out on page 128, the directors are responsible for the 
preparation of the financial statements in accordance with the applicable framework and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair 
view. The directors are also responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial 
statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s and the Company’s ability to continue as a 
going concern, disclosing as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the 
directors either intend to liquidate the Group or the Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high 
level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement 
when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could 
reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. 
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the FRC’s website at: www.frc.org.uk/
auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditors’ report.
Use of this report
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the Company’s members as a body in accordance with Chapter 3 
of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for 
any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed  
by our prior consent in writing.
Other required reporting
Companies Act 2006 exception reporting
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from 
branches not visited by us; or
• certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
• the Company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement with the 
accounting records and returns. 
We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility. 
Appointment
Following the recommendation of the Audit Committee, we were appointed by the members on 19 November 1996 to audit the financial 
statements for the year ended 31 July 1997 and subsequent financial periods. The period of total uninterrupted engagement is 21 years, 
covering the years ended 31 July 1997 to 31 July 2017.

FINANCIALS
ACCO U N T I N G P O L I C I E S
Basis of preparation
The accounts have been prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRS IC) interpretations, as 
adopted by the European Union, on a going concern basis and under the historical cost convention modified to include revaluation of 
certain financial instruments, share options and pension assets and liabilities, held at fair value as described below. 
The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial year.
Significant judgements, key assumptions and estimates
The preparation of the accounts in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates 
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date 
of the accounts and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from these 
estimates. The key estimates and assumptions used in these consolidated financial statements are set out below.
Revenue recognition
The timing of revenue recognition on contracts depends on the assessed stage of completion of contract activity at the balance sheet 
date. This assessment requires the expected total contract revenues and costs to be estimated based on the current progress of the 
contract. Revenue of £24m (2016: £42m) has been recognised in the period in respect of contracts in progress at the period end with  
a total expected value of £48m (2016: £175m) and cumulative revenue recognised to date of £36m (2016: £137m). A 5% reduction in  
the proportion of the contract activity recognised in the current period would have reduced operating profit by less than £1m for both 
Smiths Detection and Smiths Interconnect (2016: less than £1m).
Smiths Detection also has multi-year contractual arrangements for the sale of goods and services. Where these contracts have 
separately identifiable components with distinct patterns of delivery and customer acceptance, revenue is accounted for separately for 
each identifiable component. Judgement is applied in the identification of the components of the contract, and the allocation of contract 
revenue to each component.
Smiths Medical has rebate arrangements in place with some distributors in respect of sales to end customers where sales prices have 
been negotiated by Smiths Medical. Rebates are estimated based on the level of discount derived from sales data from distributors, the 
amount of inventory held by distributors and the time lag between the initial sale to the distributor and the rebate being claimed. The 
rebate accrual at 31 July 2017 was £27m (2016: £28m).
Contract profitability
Smiths Detection has multi-year contractual arrangements for the sale of goods and services. Margins achieved on these contracts  
can reflect the impact of commercial decisions made in different economic circumstances. In addition, contract delivery is subject to 
commercial and technical risks which can affect the outcome of the contract. At 31 July 2017 there was £nil (2016: £4m) balance sheet 
liability in respect of ongoing onerous contracts and no other contracts had been assessed as at significant risk of becoming onerous.
Taxation
The Group has recognised deferred tax assets of £129m (2016: £87m) relating to losses and £112m (2016: £120m) relating to the John 
Crane, Inc. and Titeflex Corporation litigation provisions. The recognition of assets pertaining to these items involves judgement by 
management as to the likelihood of realisation of these deferred tax assets. This is based on a number of factors, which seek to assess 
the expectation that the benefit of these assets will be realised, including expected future levels of operating profit, expenditure on 
litigation, pension contributions and the timing of the unwind of other tax positions. It has been concluded that there are sufficient 
taxable profits in future periods to support recognition. A 5% reduction in expected future operating profits would reduce the level of 
deferred tax recognised by £8m (2016: £9m), and a 5% increase in expected future operating profits would increase the level of deferred 
tax recognised by £11m (2016: £11m). Further detail on the Group’s deferred taxation position is included in note 6.
Retirement benefits
The consolidated financial statements include costs in relation to, and provision for, retirement benefit obligations. The costs and the 
present value of any related pension assets and liabilities depend on such factors as life expectancy of the members, the returns that 
plan assets generate and the discount rate used to calculate the present value of the liabilities. The Group uses previous experience and 
independent actuarial advice to select the values of critical estimates. The estimates, and the effect of variances in key estimates, are 
disclosed in note 8.
At 31 July 2017 there is a retirement benefit asset of £390m (2016: £328m), principally relating to UK schemes, which arises from the 
rights of the employers to recover the surplus at the end of the life of the scheme. If the pension schemes were wound up while they still 
had members, the schemes would need to buy out the benefits of all members. The buyouts would cost significantly more than the 
present value of the scheme liabilities calculated in accordance with IAS 19: Employee benefits. 
Receivables provisions
If the carrying value of any receivable is higher than the fair value, the Group makes provisions writing down the balance to its fair value. 
The fair value of receivables is considered individually for each customer and incorporates past experience and progress with 
collecting receivables. 
At 31 July 2017 the gross value of receivables partly provided for or more than three months overdue was £73m (2016: £83m) and there 
were provisions of £33m (2016: £31m) against these receivables. Consequently, these receivables were carried at a net value of £40m 
(2016: £52m). See note 14 for disclosures on credit risk and ageing of trade receivables.  Smiths Group plc  Annual Report 2017
142
Inventory provisions
The calculation of inventory provisions requires judgement by management of the expected value of future sales. If the carrying value of 
inventory is higher than the expected recoverable value, the Group makes provisions writing inventory down to its net recoverable value. 
Inventory is initially assessed for impairment by comparing inventory levels to recent utilisation rates and carrying values to historical 
selling prices. A detailed review is completed for inventory lines identified in the initial assessment considering sales activity, order flow, 
customer contracts and current selling prices. 
At 31 July 2017, there were provisions of £55m (2016: £70m) against gross inventory of £507m (2016: £548m). See note 13 for a 
breakdown of inventory. 
A 10% increase in the proportion of raw materials provided for would increase the provision by £17m (2016: £20m) and a 10% increase  
in the proportion of finished goods provided for would increase the provision by £22m (2016: £23m). 
Impairment
Goodwill is tested at least annually for impairment and other assets, including intangible assets acquired in business combinations,  
are tested if there are any indications of impairment, in accordance with the accounting policy set out below. The recoverable amounts  
of cash generating units and assets are determined based on value in use calculations unless future trading projections cannot be 
adjusted to eliminate the impact of a major restructuring. The value in use calculations require the use of estimates including projected 
future cash-flows and other future events. 
See note 11 for details of the critical assumptions made, including the forecast earnings and valuation multiples for Morpho Detection 
and disclosures on the sensitivity of the impairment testing to these key assumptions, including details of the changes in assumptions 
which would be required to trigger an impairment in Morpho Detection. 
Provisions for liabilities and charges
As previously reported, John Crane, Inc. (“JCI”), a subsidiary of the Group, is currently one of many co-defendants in litigation relating to 
products previously manufactured which contained asbestos. Provision of £237m (2016: £252m) has been made for the future defence 
costs which the Group is expected to incur and the expected costs of future adverse judgments against JCI. Whilst well-established 
incidence curves can be used to estimate the likely future pattern of asbestos related disease, JCI’s claims experience is significantly 
impacted by other factors which influence the US litigation environment. These can include: changing approaches on the part of the 
plaintiffs’ bar; changing attitudes amongst the judiciary at both trial and appellate levels; and legislative and procedural changes in both 
the state and federal court systems. Therefore, because of the significant uncertainty associated with the future level of asbestos claims 
and of the costs arising out of the related litigation, there can be no guarantee that the assumptions used to estimate the provision will 
result in an accurate prediction of the actual costs that may be incurred. 
JCI takes account of the advice of an expert in asbestos liability estimation in quantifying the expected costs. The following judgements 
were made in preparing the provision calculation: 
• the period over which the expenditure can be reliably estimated is judged to be ten years, based on past experience regarding 
significant changes in the litigation environment that have occurred every few years and on the amount of time taken in the past for 
some of those changes to impact the broader asbestos litigation environment. See note 22 for a sensitivity showing the impact on the 
provision of reducing or increasing this time horizon;
• the future trend of legal costs; the rate of future claims filed; the rate of successful resolution of claims; and the average amount of 
judgments awarded have been projected based on the past history of JCI claims and well-established tables of asbestos incidence 
projections, since this is the best available evidence. Claims history from other defendants is not used to calculate the provision 
because JCI’s defence strategy generates a significantly different pattern of legal costs and settlement expenses. See note 22 for  
a sensitivity showing the range of expected future spend. 
As previously reported, Titeflex Corporation, a subsidiary of the Group in the Flex-Tek division, has received a number of claims from 
insurance companies seeking recompense on a subrogated basis for the effects of damage allegedly caused by lightning strikes in 
relation to its flexible gas piping product. It has also received a number of product liability claims regarding this product, some in the 
form of purported class actions. Titeflex Corporation believes that its products are a safe and effective means of delivering gas when 
installed in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions and local and national codes; however some claims have been settled on 
an individual basis without admission of liability. Provision of £84m (2016: £94m) has been made for the costs which the Group is 
expected to incur in respect of these claims. In preparing the provision calculation, judgements were made about the impact of safe 
installation initiatives on the level of future claims. See note 22 for a sensitivity showing the impact on the provision of reducing or 
increasing the expected impact. However, because of the significant uncertainty associated with the future level of claims, there can  
be no guarantee that the assumptions used to estimate the provision will result in an accurate prediction of the actual costs that may  
be incurred. 
The Group has on occasion been required to take legal action to protect its intellectual property and other rights against infringement.  
It has also had to defend itself against proceedings brought by other parties, including product liability and insurance subrogation 
claims. Provision is made for any expected costs and liabilities in relation to these proceedings where appropriate, though there can be 
no guarantee that such provisions (which may be subject to potentially material revision from time to time) will accurately predict the 
actual costs and liabilities that may be incurred.
All provisions may be subject to potentially material revisions from time to time if new information becomes available as a result of 
future events.

Presentation of results
Non-statutory performance measures, described as ‘headline’, are presented to give a clear and consistent presentation of the 
performance of the Group’s ongoing trading activity. These measures are used by management to measure and monitor performance. 
Headline measures exclude amounts relating to costs of acquisitions and disposals, amortisation of acquisition fair value adjustments, 
including the recognition of acquired intangibles, impairments, legacy liabilities, significant restructuring, material one-off items  
and certain re-measurements. Smiths Group plc presents its results in the income statements with items excluded from headline 
measures in a separate column. See note 1 for divisional headline operating profit, note 3 for a breakdown of the items excluded from 
headline operating profit and headline finance costs and note 30 for information on the calculation of return on capital employed and 
credit metrics. 
In addition, the Group reports underlying growth rates for sales and profit measures, which exclude the impact of acquisitions and 
divestments and the effects of foreign exchange translation, by making the following adjustments: 
• Retranslate the comparative to current year exchange rates before calculating growth measures 
• Exclude acquisitions from the current period for the first 12 months of ownership; and
• Exclude the divested businesses performance after the date of disposal from comparative period. 
For the convenience of users, supplementary primary financial statements translated into US dollars have been presented after the 
Group financial record. Assets and liabilities have been translated into US dollars at the exchange rate at the date of that balance sheet 
and income, expenses and cash-flows are translated at average exchange rates for the period.
Accounting policies
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated accounts incorporate the financial statements of Smiths Group plc (the ‘Company’) and its subsidiary undertakings, together 
with the Group’s share of the results of its associates. A list of the subsidiaries of Smiths Group plc is provided on pages 207 to 214. 
Subsidiaries are all entities controlled by the Company. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is obtained  
by the Company to the date that control ceases.
Associates are entities over which the Group has significant influence but does not control, generally accompanied by a share of between 
20% and 50% of the voting rights. Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method.
Foreign currencies
The Company’s presentational currency is sterling. The financial position of all subsidiaries and associates that have a functional 
currency different from sterling are translated into sterling at the rate of exchange at the date of that balance sheet, and the income  
and expenses are translated at average exchange rates for the period. All resulting exchange differences are recognised as a separate 
component of equity.
On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign entities, and of borrowings and other 
currency instruments designated as hedges of such investments, are taken to shareholders’ equity. When a foreign operation is sold, 
the cumulative amount of such exchange differences is recognised in the income statement as part of the gain or loss on sale.
Exchange differences arising on transactions are recognised in the income statement. Those arising on trading are taken to operating 
profit; those arising on borrowings are classified as finance income or cost. 
Revenue
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received, net of trade discounts (including distributor rebates) and sales 
taxes. Revenue is discounted only where the impact of discounting is material. 
When the Group enters into complex contracts with multiple, separately identifiable components, the terms of the contract are reviewed 
to determine whether or not the elements of the contract should be accounted for separately. If a contract is being split into multiple 
components, the contract revenue is allocated to the different components at the start of the contract. The basis of allocation depends 
on the substance of the contract. The Group considers relative stand-alone selling prices, contractual prices and relative cost when 
allocating revenue. 
Sale of goods
Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the customer, the 
amount of revenue can be measured reliably and recovery of the consideration is probable. For established products with simple 
installation requirements, revenue is recognised when the product is delivered to the customer in accordance with the agreed delivery 
terms. For products which are technically innovative, highly customised or require complex installation, revenue is recognised when the 
customer has completed its acceptance procedures. 
Services
Revenue from services is recognised in accounting periods in which the services are rendered, by reference to completion of the specific 
transaction, assessed on the basis of the actual service provided as a proportion of the total services to be provided. Depending on the 
nature of the contract, revenue will be recognised on the basis of the proportion of the contract term completed, the proportion of the 
contract costs incurred or the specific services provided to date. 
Construction contracts
Contracts for the construction of substantial assets are accounted for as construction contracts if the customer specifies major 
structural elements of the design, including the ability to amend the design during the construction process. These projects normally 
involve installing customised systems with site-specific integration requirements. 
Where the outcome of a construction contract can be estimated reliably, revenue and costs are recognised by reference to the stage  
of completion of the contract activity at the balance sheet date. The Group uses the ‘percentage of completion method’ to determine  
the appropriate amount to recognise in a given period. The assessment of the stage of completion is dependent on the nature of the 
contract, but will generally be based on the estimated proportion of the total contract costs which have been incurred to date. If a 
contract is expected to be loss-making, a provision is recognised for the entire loss. Smiths Group plc  Annual Report 2017
144
Leases
Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases. 
Payments made under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
Taxation
The charge for taxation is based on profits for the year and takes into account taxation deferred because of temporary differences 
between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes. 
Current income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to taxation authorities.  
Tax benefits are not recognised unless it is likely that the tax positions are sustainable. Once considered to be likely, tax benefits are 
reviewed to assess whether a provision should be made based on prevailing circumstances. Tax provisions are included in current  
tax liabilities, including any anticipated interest & penalties. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are 
enacted or substantively enacted, at the reporting date in the countries where the Group operates and generates taxable income.
Deferred tax is provided in full using the balance sheet liability method. A deferred tax asset is recognised where it is probable that 
future taxable income will be sufficient to utilise the available relief. Tax is charged or credited to the income statement except when  
it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, except where the timing of  
the reversal of the temporary differences is controlled by the Company and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse 
in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax liabilities and assets are not discounted. 
Employee benefits 
Share-based compensation
The fair value of the shares or share options granted is recognised as an expense over the vesting period to reflect the value of the 
employee services received. The fair value of options granted, excluding the impact of any non-market vesting conditions, is calculated 
using established option pricing models, principally binomial models. The probability of meeting non-market vesting conditions, which 
include profitability targets, is used to estimate the number of share options which are likely to vest. 
For cash-settled share-based payment, a liability is recognised based on the fair value of the payment earned by the balance sheet date. 
For equity-settled share-based payment, the corresponding credit is recognised directly in reserves.
Pension obligations and post-retirement benefits
The Group has defined benefit plans, defined contribution plans and post-retirement healthcare schemes.
For defined benefit plans and post-retirement healthcare schemes the liability for each scheme recognised in the balance sheet is the 
present value of the obligation at the balance sheet date less the fair value of any plan assets. The obligation is calculated annually by 
independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method. The present value is determined by discounting the estimated future cash 
outflows using interest rates of AA-rated corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and 
that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related liability. Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience 
adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised in full in the period in which they occur, outside of the income 
statement, and are presented in the statement of comprehensive income. Past service costs are recognised immediately in the 
income statement.
For defined contribution plans, the Group pays contributions to publicly or privately administered pension insurance plans on a 
mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis. Contributions are expensed as incurred. 
Intangible assets
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of the identifiable net assets of the 
acquired subsidiary at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill arising from acquisitions of subsidiaries after 1 August 1998 is included in intangible assets, tested annually for impairment 
and carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of 
goodwill relating to the entity sold. Goodwill arising from acquisitions of subsidiaries before 1 August 1998 was set against reserves in 
the year of acquisition.
Goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually. Any impairment is recognised immediately in the income statement. Subsequent 
reversals of impairment losses for goodwill are not recognised.
Research and development
Expenditure on research and development is charged to the income statement in the year in which it is incurred with the exception of:
• amounts recoverable from third parties; and
• expenditure incurred in respect of the development of major new products where the outcome of those projects is assessed as being 
reasonably certain as regards viability and technical feasibility. Such expenditure is capitalised and amortised over the estimated 
period of sale for each product, commencing in the year that sales of the product are first made. Amortisation is charged straight 
line or based on the units produced, depending on the nature of the product and the availability of reliable estimates of 
production volumes. 
The cost of development projects which are expected to take a substantial period of time to complete includes attributable 
borrowing costs.

Intangible assets acquired in business combinations
The identifiable net assets acquired as a result of a business combination may include intangible assets other than goodwill. Any such 
intangible assets are amortised straight line over their expected useful lives as follows:
Patents, licences and trademarks up to 20 years
Technology up to 13 years
Customer relationships up to 11 years
The assets’ useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance sheet date.
Software, patents and intellectual property
The estimated useful lives are as follows:
Software up to 7 years
Patents and intellectual property shorter of the economic life and the period the right is legally enforceable
The assets’ useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance sheet date.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment losses. 
Land is not depreciated. Depreciation is provided on other assets estimated to write off the depreciable amount of relevant assets by 
equal annual instalments over their estimated useful lives. In general, the rates used are: Freehold and long leasehold buildings – 2%; 
Short leasehold property – over the period of the lease; Plant, machinery, etc. – 10% to 20%; Fixtures, fittings, tools and other equipment 
– 10% to 33%. 
The cost of any assets which are expected to take a substantial period of time to complete includes attributable borrowing costs. 
The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance sheet date. An asset’s carrying 
amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset’s carrying amount is greater than its estimated 
recoverable amount.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. The 
cost of finished goods and work in progress comprises raw materials, direct labour, other direct costs and related production overheads 
(based on normal operating capacity). The cost of items of inventory which take a substantial period of time to complete includes 
attributable borrowing costs. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less applicable 
variable selling expenses.
Trade and other receivables
Trade receivables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost, less any appropriate provision for 
estimated irrecoverable amounts. A provision is established for irrecoverable amounts when there is objective evidence that amounts 
due under the original payment terms will not be collected.
Provisions
Provisions for warranties and product liability, disposal indemnities, restructuring costs, vacant leasehold property and legal claims  
are recognised when: the Company has a legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event; it is probable that an outflow of 
resources will be required to settle the obligation; and the amount has been reliably estimated. Provisions are not recognised for  
future operating losses.
Provisions are discounted where the time value of money is material.
Where there are a number of similar obligations, for example where a warranty has been given, the likelihood that an outflow will be 
required in settlement is determined by considering the class of obligations as a whole. A provision is recognised even if the likelihood  
of an outflow with respect to any one item included in the same class of obligations may be small.
Assets and businesses held for sale
Assets and businesses classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. 
Impairment losses on initial classification as held for sale and gains or losses on subsequent remeasurements are included in the 
income statement. No depreciation is charged on assets and businesses classified as held for sale. 
Assets and businesses are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered or settled principally through a sale 
transaction rather than through continuing use. The asset or business must be available for immediate sale and the sale must be highly 
probable within one year.
Discontinued operations
A discontinued operation is either: 
• a component of the Group’s business that represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations that has 
been disposed of, has been abandoned or meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale; or 
• a business acquired solely for the purpose of selling it.
Discontinued operations are presented on the income statement as a separate line and are shown net of tax. Smiths Group plc  Annual Report 2017
146
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash at bank and in hand and highly liquid interest-bearing securities with maturities of three months 
or less.
In the cash-flow statement, cash and cash equivalents are shown net of bank overdrafts, which are included as current borrowings in 
liabilities on the balance sheet. 
Financial assets
The classification of financial assets depends on the purpose for which the assets were acquired. Management determines the 
classification of an asset at initial recognition and re-evaluates the designation at each reporting date. Financial assets are classified as: 
loans and receivables, available for sale financial assets or financial assets where changes in fair value are charged (or credited) to the 
income statement.
Financial assets are initially recognised at transaction price when the Group becomes party to contractual obligations. The transaction 
price used includes transaction costs unless the asset is being fair valued through the income statement.
The subsequent measurement of financial assets depends on their classification. Loans and receivables are measured at amortised 
cost using the effective interest rate method. Available for sale financial assets are subsequently measured at fair value, with unrealised 
gains and losses being recognised in other comprehensive income. Financial assets where changes in fair value are charged (or 
credited) to the income statement are subsequently measured at fair value. Realised and unrealised gains and losses arising from 
changes in the fair value of the ‘financial assets at fair value through the income statement’ category are included in the income 
statement in the period in which they arise. 
Financial assets are derecognised when the right to receive cash-flows from the assets has expired, or has been transferred, and the 
Company has transferred substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership. When securities classified as available for sale are 
sold or impaired, the accumulated fair value adjustments previously taken to reserves are included in the income statement. 
Financial assets are classified as current if they are expected to be realised within 12 months of the balance sheet date.
Financial liabilities
Borrowings are initially recognised at the fair value of the proceeds, net of related transaction costs. These transaction costs, and any 
discount or premium on issue, are subsequently amortised under the effective interest rate method through the income statement as 
interest over the life of the loan, and added to the liability disclosed in the balance sheet. Related accrued interest is included in the 
borrowings figure.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 
one year after the balance sheet date.
Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at 
their fair value. The method of recognising any resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging 
instrument and, if so, the nature of the item being hedged.
Changes in the fair value of any derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised immediately in the 
income statement.
Fair value hedge
Changes in the fair values of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in the income statement, 
together with any changes in the fair values of the hedged assets or liabilities that are attributable to the hedged risk.
Net investment hedge
Hedges of net investments in foreign operations are accounted for similarly to cash-flow hedges. Any gain or loss on the hedging 
instrument relating to the effective portion of the hedge is recognised in other comprehensive income; the gain or loss relating to  
any ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
When a foreign operation is disposed of, gains and losses accumulated in equity related to that operation are included in the 
income statement. 
Cash-flow hedge
The effective portions of changes in the fair values of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash-flow hedges are recognised  
in equity. The gain or loss relating to any ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement. 
Amounts accumulated in the hedge reserve are recycled in the income statement in the periods when the hedged items will affect profit 
or loss (for instance when the forecast sale that is hedged takes place). If a forecast transaction that is hedged results in the recognition 
of a non-financial asset (for example, inventory) or a liability, the gains and losses previously deferred in the hedge reserve are 
transferred from the reserve and included in the initial measurement of the cost of the asset or liability.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain 
or loss existing in the hedge reserve at that time remains in the reserve and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately 
recognised in the income statement. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was 
reported in other comprehensive income is immediately transferred to the income statement.

FINANCIALS
Fair value of financial assets and liabilities
The fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities are the amounts at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current 
transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale. 
‘IFRS 13: Fair value measurement’ requires fair value measurements to be classified according to the following hierarchy:
• level 1 – quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
• level 2 – valuations in which all inputs are observable either directly (ie as prices) or indirectly (ie derived from prices); and
• level 3 – valuations in which one or more inputs that are significant to the resulting value are not based on observable market data.
See note 20 for information on the methods the Group uses to estimate the fair values of its financial instruments. 
Dividends
Dividends are recognised as a liability in the period in which they are authorised. The interim dividend is recognised when it is paid and 
the final dividend is recognised when it has been approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting.
Recent accounting developments
The following standards and interpretations have been issued by the IASB and will affect future annual reports and accounts.
• ‘IFRS 9: Financial instruments’ 
• ‘IFRS 15: Revenue from contracts with customers’
• ‘IFRS 16: Leases’
A review of the impact of these standards and interpretations is being undertaken, and the impact of adopting them will be determined 
once this review has been completed. Smiths will adopt IFRS 9 and IFRS 15 on 1 August 2018 and IFRS 16 on 1 August 2019 unless 
developments in the relationship between the UK and the EU change the reporting requirements for UK companies.
IFRS 9: Financial instruments
Adopting IFRS 9 will impact hedge accounting and receivables provisioning. The basis of documentation and effectiveness testing of 
hedges under the new standard will be linked more closely to the risk management objectives, which may generate different levels of 
ineffectiveness than the current testing under IAS 39. Receivables provisioning will move from an incurred to an expected loss model. 
The Group’s largest exposure is trade receivables, which had a gross value of £716m at 31 July 2017. No impact is anticipated for high 
credit quality balances settled on agreed terms. However, the new model will impact the timing and value of provision recognition on 
higher risk balances. Under the current methodology, provisions of £33m have been recognised on £73m of receivables which are more 
than three months overdue or considered to be high risk. 
IFRS 15: Revenue from contracts with customers
The review of the impact of ‘IFRS 15: Revenue from contracts with customers’ requires an assessment at contract level to confirm the 
full impact of adopting this standard. 
Based on the analysis completed to date, we consider that the new standard is unlikely to have a material impact on revenue recognition 
for the following business activities, which had revenue of circa £1.7bn this year:
• Smiths branded products sold under basic PO terms;
• Customer specific products where the Group is manufacturing at risk with no contractual rights to recovery; 
• Smiths Interconnect military contracts accounted for on a percentage of completion basis using proportion of costs incurred;
• Smiths Detection programmes currently accounted for as multi-element contracts with consideration allocated on the relative  
fair value of the components; and
• Spares and ad hoc service callouts to repair or replace equipment. 
The basis of revenue recognition may change for the following revenue streams: 
• Customer specific products where the contractual terms include rights to payment for work performed to date. Revenue for  
most of these contracts is expected to be recognised rateably over the manufacturing period, depending on the specific rights  
in the contract; 
• Product development contracts where revenue is recognised on reaching development milestones. Revenue for recognition for some 
of these contracts is expected to move to a percentage of completion basis using proportion of costs incurred; and
• John Crane has service contracts, which include bonuses and penalties based on the performance of the asset being maintained. 
Depending on the evidence available to estimate the levels of performance achieved, bonuses may be recognised earlier under 
IFRS 15. 
IFRS 16: Leases
The review of this standard is at an early stage. This standard will require a lease liability and corresponding asset to be recognised  
on the balance sheet for leases currently classified as operating leases and not recognised on the balance sheet. IFRS 16 can require 
changes to the valuation of lease liabilities. However, preliminary work has not identified any material leases with contingent rentals. 
The total value of operating lease commitments at 31 July 2017 was £140m (2016: £146m). 
Parent Company
The ultimate parent company of the Group is Smiths Group plc, a company incorporated in England and Wales and listed on the London 
Stock Exchange.
The accounts of the Parent Company, Smiths Group plc, have been prepared in accordance with UK GAAP, applying Financial Reporting 
Standard 101, “Reduced Disclosure Framework”. The Company accounts are presented in separate financial statements on pages 196  
to 206. The principal subsidiaries of the Parent Company are listed in the above accounts. Smiths Group plc  Annual Report 2017

3 Non-statutory profit measures
Headline profit measures
The Company seeks to present a measure of trading performance which is not impacted by material non-recurring items or items 
considered non-operational in nature. This measure is described as ‘headline’ and used by management to measure and monitor 
performance. See the disclosures on presentation of results in accounting policies for an explanation of the excluded items, which  
are referred to as ‘non-headline’.
Headline revenue
The agreement to sell Smiths Medical’s Wallace product line included an obligation to continue manufacturing products for the acquirer 
for 12 months after the date of disposal. In the Interim results to 31 January 2017, revenue arising from this activity was treated as 
non-headline because it was not expected to contribute to Smiths Medical’s ongoing business. This treatment was reviewed in response 
to developments in the commercial relationship with CooperSurgical, Inc. and the activity is now being reported within headline activity. 
Headline operating profit
The non-headline items included in statutory operating profit are as follows:

Items for the year ended 31 July 2017
Restructuring costs include £33m in respect of Fuel for Growth. This programme, which involves redundancy, relocation and 
consolidation of manufacturing, is considered a material non-recurring item by virtue of its size. No further costs are expected in 
respect of this program. In addition, there are £4m of initial costs in respect of the integration of Morpho Detection and the existing 
Smiths Detection business. The integration is expected to take two years. The total costs over the two years are projected to be material 
and non-recurring. 
Acquisition costs have been treated as non-headline because they depend on the level of acquisition activity in the year. Only incremental 
costs directly linked to the transaction are reported as non-headline. They do not include the costs of the employees working on 
transactions. 
See note 22 for details of the costs, and cost recoveries relating to Titeflex Corporation subrogation claims and John Crane, Inc asbestos 
litigation. These costs and recoveries have been treated as non-headline because the provision were treated as non-headline when they 
were originally recognised and the subrogation claims and litigation relate to products that the Group no longer sells in these markets. 
Post-retirement benefit changes and costs relate to closed schemes, so the costs are a legacy of previous employee pension arrangements. 
The impacts of business combination fair value adjustments, including amortisation of intangible assets, impairment or unwinding, have 
been excluded from headline measures on the basis that these charges result from acquisition accounting and do not relate to current 
trading activity. 
See note 28 for a breakdown of the profit by transaction. It is non-headline since the profit and cash impact is material and non-recurring. 
Items for the year ended 31 July 2016
Restructuring costs comprise £37m in respect of Fuel for Growth. This programme, which involves redundancy, relocation and 
consolidation of manufacturing, is considered a material non-recurring item by virtue of its size. 
The £9m charge relating to post-retirement benefits comprises the £10m settlement cost for the buy-out of retiree liabilities completed 
by the US pension scheme on 14 August 2015, net of a £1m settlement gain on closing a small scheme in Holland. 
Impairments comprise £23m goodwill write-downs (see note 11), £6m on property plant and equipment and £2m on trade investments.  Smiths Group plc  Annual Report 2017

The unwind of discounting on provisions has been excluded from headline finance costs because these provisions were originally 
recognised as non-headline and this treatment has been maintained for ongoing costs and credits. 
The fair value gain realised on contributing government bonds to Smiths Industries Pension Scheme was excluded from headline 
finance costs because it was a large, one-off item relating to funding previous employee pension arrangements. 
Other financing gains and losses represent the potentially volatile gains and losses on derivatives, loans inside the group and other 
financial instruments which are not hedge accounted under IAS 39. They have been excluded from headline finance costs because they 
do not accurately reflect the aggregate risks of the group, since offsetting gains have been recognised in reserves or deferred in assets 
and liabilities which are not held at fair value. 
Financing credits relating to retirement benefits are excluded from headline finance costs because the ongoing costs and credits are  
a legacy of previous employee pension arrangements.

6 Taxation
The Group’s approach to taxation is set out in the Financial review. This note only provides information about corporate income taxes 
under IFRS. Smiths companies operate in over 50 countries across the world. They pay and collect many different taxes in addition to 
corporate income taxes including: payroll taxes; value added and sales taxes; property taxes; product-specific taxes and environmental 
taxes. The costs associated with these other taxes are included in profit before tax.

The head office of Smiths Group is domiciled in the UK, so the tax charge has been reconciled to UK tax rates. 
In recent years, Smiths has made substantial payments to its UK defined benefit pension plans, which generated significant UK tax 
losses. This resulted in the non-recognition of deferred tax on UK losses and other temporary differences. The current position of the 
UK pension schemes has significantly improved and the pension contributions envisaged going forwards are significantly reduced. 
Reduced pension contributions and increased trading and investing profits have made the UK tax group structurally profitable, resulting 
in the recognition of all UK deferred tax assets and generating a non-headline credit of £69m in the current year. 
Included in other adjustments to unrecognised deferred tax is recognition of £17m deferred tax following the reorganisation of a US business. 
As a result of changes in tax legislation and the reorganisation of finance activities, the credit for closed financing arrangements will not 
be repeated in future years.

Provisions included in current tax liabilities are established based on reasonable estimates for the possible consequences of tax 
authority audits in the various countries in which the Group operates. Management judgement is used to determine the amount of such 
provisions based on an understanding of the relevant local tax law, taking into account the differences of interpretation that can arise on 
a wide variety of issues, depending on the prevailing circumstances, including the nature of current tax audits and the experience of 
previous enquiries. Smiths Group plc  Annual Report 2017

The deferred tax asset relating to losses carried forward has been recognised on the basis that evidence demonstrates a consistent 
pattern of improving results and the Group has implemented plans to support continuing improvements or the losses relate to specific, 
identified non-recurring events. 
In 2012 UK deferred tax was written off as a deteriorating position in legacy pension plans made UK activities structurally loss making. 
As a result of an improvement in the UK pension position and restructuring financing activities, the UK is now expected to earn taxable 
profits and a £69m deferred tax asset has been recognised as a non-headline gain in the period. The closing deferred tax balance related 
to UK activities at 31 July 2017, including the benefit of losses brought forward and deferred tax liabilities on UK pension schemes, 
amounted to £64m.
Deferred tax relating to provisions includes £79m (2016: £84m) relating to the John Crane, Inc. litigation provision, and £33m (2016: £36m) 
relating to Titeflex Corporation. See note 22 for additional information on provisions; and
Included in other deferred tax balances above is a deferred tax asset of £14m (2016: £25m) relating to inventory where current tax relief 
is only available when the inventory is sold. 
The Group has unrecognised deferred tax relating to deductible temporary differences in the UK amounting to £nil (2016: £402m) and 
non-UK losses amounting to £68m (2016: £93m). 
The expiry date of operating losses carried forward is dependent upon the law of the various territories in which the losses arise.

Franked Investment Income Group Litigation Order 
Smiths Group is one of the companies enrolled in the FII GLO litigation against HMRC. The court cases and appeals are nearing the end 
and some claimants, with different fact patterns, have received payments. Smiths claims amount to around £30m (after deducting 45% 
withholding tax). However, there are further relevant legal actions that could impact the claims. The benefit of this claim has not been

8 Post-retirement benefits
Smiths provides post-retirement benefits to employees in a number of countries. This includes defined benefit and defined contribution 
plans and, mainly in the United Kingdom (UK) and United States of America (US), post-retirement healthcare. 
Defined contribution plans
The Group operates a number of defined contribution plans across many countries. In the UK a defined contribution plan has been 
offered since the closure of the UK defined benefit pension plans. In the US a 401k defined contribution plan operates. The total expense 
recognised in the consolidated income statement in respect of all these plans was £33m (2016: £30m).
Defined benefit and post-retirement healthcare plans
The principal defined benefit pension plans are in the UK and in the US and these have been closed so that no future benefits are accrued. 
For all schemes, pension costs are assessed in accordance with the advice of independent, professionally qualified actuaries. These 
valuations have been updated by independent qualified actuaries in order to assess the liabilities of the schemes as at 31 July 2017. 
Scheme assets are stated at their market values. Contributions to the schemes are made on the advice of the actuaries, in accordance 
with local funding requirements.

UK pension schemes
Smiths funded UK pension schemes are subject to a statutory funding objective, as set out in UK pension legislation. Scheme trustees 
need to obtain regular actuarial valuations to assess the scheme against this funding objective. The trustees and sponsoring companies 
need to agree funding plans to improve the position of a scheme, when it is below the acceptable funding level. 
The UK Pensions Regulator has extensive powers to protect the benefits of members, promote good administration and reduce the 
risk of situations arising which may require compensation to be paid from the Pension Protection Fund. These powers include 
imposing a schedule of contributions or the calculation of the technical provisions, where a trustee and company fail to agree 
appropriate calculations. 
Smiths Industries Pension Scheme (“SIPS”)
This scheme was closed to future accrual effective 1 November 2009. SIPS provides index-linked pension benefits based on final 
earnings at date of closure. SIPS is governed by a corporate trustee (SI Trustee Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of Smiths Group plc). 
The board of trustee directors comprises five company-nominated trustees and four member-nominated trustees, with an independent 
chairman selected by Smiths Group plc. Trustee Directors are responsible for the management, administration, funding and investment 
strategy of the scheme. 
The most recent actuarial valuation of this scheme has been performed using the Projected Unit Method as at 31 March 2015, and 
experience gains and losses identified during this valuation have been incorporated into the IAS 19 valuation. Under the funding plan for 
SIPS agreed in November 2015 Smiths pays cash contributions of £2m a month until June 2020. As part of this agreement, Smiths 
contributed the index-linked gilts previously held in an escrow account. Under the governing documentation of the SIPS, any future 
surplus would be returnable to Smiths Group plc by refund, assuming gradual settlement of the liabilities over the lifetime of 
the scheme.
SIPS will implement Guaranteed Minimum Pensions equalisation in respect of members contracted out of the State Earnings Related 
Pensions Scheme prior to 6 April 1997, once the government has completed its consultations and confirmed an approach. It is not yet 
possible to reliably quantify the impact of this adjustment. 
The duration of the SIPS liabilities is around 23 years (2016: 23 years) for active deferred members, 22 years (2016: 24 years) for deferred 
members and 11 years (2016: 12 years) for pensioners and dependants. Smiths Group plc  Annual Report 2017

TI Group Pension Scheme (“TIGPS”)
This scheme was closed to future accrual effective 1 November 2009. TIGPS provides index-linked pension benefits based on final 
earnings at the date of closure. TIGPS is governed by a corporate trustee (TI Pension Trustee Limited, an independent company). The 
board of trustee directors comprises five company-nominated trustees and four member-nominated trustees, with an independent 
trustee director selected by the Trustee. The Trustee is responsible for the management, administration, funding and investment 
strategy of the scheme.
The most recent actuarial valuation of this scheme has been performed using the Projected Unit Method as at 5 April 2015. Under  
the funding plan for TIGPS agreed in March 2016 Smiths pays cash contributions of £3m a year until April 2018. Under the governing 
documentation of the TIGPS, any future surplus would be returnable to Smiths Group plc by refund, assuming gradual settlement  
of the liabilities over the lifetime of the scheme. 
TIGPS will implement Guaranteed Minimum Pensions equalisation in respect of members contracted out of the State Earnings Related 
Pensions Scheme prior to 6 April 1997, once the government has completed its consultations and confirmed an approach. It is not yet 
possible to reliably quantify the impact of this adjustment.
The duration of the TIGPS liabilities is around 24 years (2016: 25 years) for active deferred members, 22 years (2016: 24 years) for 
deferred members and 11 years (2016: 11 years) for pensioners and dependants. 
US pension plans
The most recent valuations of the principal US pension and post-retirement healthcare plans were performed at 1 January 2017. 
The pension plans were closed with effect from 30 April 2009 and benefits were calculated as at that date and are not revalued. 
Governance of the US pension plans is managed by a Settlor Committee appointed by Smiths Group Services Corp, a wholly 
owned subsidiary. 
The duration of the liabilities for the largest US plan is around 19 years (2016: 20 years) for active deferred members, 19 years 
(2016: 20 years) for deferred members and 12 years (2016: 12 years) for pensioners and dependants.
Last year the US funded plans completed a buy-out of retiree liabilities for $527m, transferring the obligation to pay pensions  
to Voya Retirement Insurance and Annuity Company. A settlement loss of £10m was recognised on this transaction (see note 3). 
Risk management
The pensions schemes are exposed to risks that: 
• investment returns are below expectations, leaving the scheme with insufficient assets in future to pay all its pension obligations; 
• members and dependants live longer than expected, increasing the value of the pensions the scheme has to pay; 
• inflation rates are higher than expected, so amounts payable under index-linked pensions are higher than expected; and 
• increased contributions may be required to meet regulatory funding targets if lower interest rates increase the current value 
of liabilities. 
These risks are managed separately for each pension scheme. However Smiths has adopted a common approach of closing defined 
benefit schemes to cap members’ entitlements and supporting trustees in adopting investment strategies which match assets to future 
obligations, after allowing for the funding position of the scheme. 
TI Group Pension Scheme (“TIGPS”)
TIGPS with a mature member profile, and a strong funding position, has been able to progress its matching strategy to the point where 
roughly 50% of liabilities are covered by matching annuities, eliminating investment return, longevity, inflation and funding risks. 
Smiths Industries Pension Scheme (“SIPS”)
In August 2014 SIPS adjusted the scheme investment strategy. The scheme has investments in diversified growth funds and a portfolio 
of exchange traded equity index futures managed by BlackRock. The risk and return characteristics of equity index futures are similar  
to physical equities, but provide the scheme with improved liquidity. As at 31 July 2017 the SIPS portfolio of exchange traded equity index 
futures generated a £73m (2016: £163m) exposure to equities.
Following the company contribution of £152m UK government bonds to SIPS in December 2015 and the resulting improvement in the 
funding position, the trustees have adopted a leveraged liability matching strategy. The scheme uses repurchase arrangements, total 
return swaps, inflation swaps and interest rate swaps to hedge the interest and inflation risks of the scheme liabilities. Repurchase 
agreements exchange government bonds held by the scheme for cash with an obligation to buy back the asset at a fixed future date and 
price. The cash is invested in liability matching assets, reducing funding risk. A total return swap exchanges the return on a specified 
asset (for example an index-linked bond) and an interest payment (fixed or floating). Contracts are spread across a panel of banks. To 
minimise the risk that counterparties fail to settle obligations, positions are collateralised. For repurchase agreements, collateral is the 
difference between the present value of the repurchase obligation and the value of the asset exchanged. For swaps, collateral is based 
on market values. At 31 July 2017 scheme assets were net of £773m (2016: £720m) repurchase obligations, and nominal exposure from 
interest rate swaps of £340m (2016: £293m), inflation swaps of £293m (2016: £263m) and total return swaps of £14m (2016: £14m).  Smiths Group plc  Annual Report 2017

The assumptions used in calculating the costs and obligations of the Group’s defined benefit pension plans are set by Smiths after 
consultation with independent professionally qualified actuaries. The assumptions used are estimates chosen from a range of possible 
actuarial assumptions which, due to the timescale covered, may not necessarily occur in practice. For countries outside the UK and USA 
assumptions are disclosed as a weighted average. 
Discount rate assumptions
The UK schemes use a discount rate based on the yield on the iBOXX over 15-year AA-rated corporate bond index, adjusted if necessary 
to better reflect the shape of the yield curve considering the Aon Hewitt GBP Select AA curve. For the USA, the discount rate is based on 
the Towers Watson cash-flow matching models and set with reference to Moody’s Aa annualised yield, the Citigroup High Grade Index 
and the Merrill Lynch 15+ years High Quality Index. 
Mortality assumptions
The mortality assumptions used in the principal UK schemes are based on the new “SAPS S2” All Birth year tables with relevant scaling 
factors based on the recent experience of the schemes. The assumption allows for future improvements in life expectancy in line with 
the 2016 CMI projections, blended to a long-term rate of 1.25%. The mortality assumptions used in the principal US schemes are based 
on the RP-2014 table adjusted backward to 2006 with MP-2014 and projected forward using MP-2016 as of 31 July 2017. The table 
selected allows for future mortality improvements and applies an adjustment for job classification (blue collar versus white collar).

Sensitivity 
Sensitivities in respect of the key assumptions used to measure the principal pension schemes as at 31 July 2017 are set out below. 
These sensitivities show the hypothetical impact of a change in each of the listed assumptions in isolation, with the exception of the 
sensitivity to inflation which incorporates the impact of certain correlating assumptions. In practice, such assumptions rarely change 
in isolation.

The effect on profit before tax reflects the impact of current service cost and net interest cost. The value of the scheme assets is 
affected by changes in mortality rates, inflation and discounting because they affect the carrying value of the insurance assets.
Asset valuation 
Liquidity funds, equities and bonds are valued using quoted market prices in active markets. Exchange traded equity index futures are 
valued at market prices.
Total return, interest and inflation swaps are bilateral agreements between counterparties and do not have observable market prices. 
These derivative contracts are valued using observable market inputs.
Insured liabilities comprise annuity policies matching the scheme obligation to identified groups of pensioners. These assets are valued 
at the actuarial valuation of the corresponding liability, reflecting this matching relationship. Property is valued by specialists applying 
recognised property valuation methods incorporating current market data on rental yields and transaction prices. Smiths Group plc  Annual Report 2017

SIPS has a portfolio of exchange traded equity index futures, which are valued at market prices. These futures increase “leverage” in 
SIPS, creating additional asset exposure. At 31 July 2017, the gross equity exposure generated by these exchange traded futures was 
£73m (2016: £163m). At 31 July 2017 the aggregate value of this strategy, including cash received as collateral, was £3m (2016: £9m).  
The scheme was holding £10m (2016: £44m) in liquidity funds to meet potential future obligations to collateralise equity index futures.
UK other investments at 31 July 2017 included £70m (2016: £162m) of investments in diversified growth funds held by SIPS, £184m 
(2016: £107m) of investments in leveraged index linked UK government bond funds held by TIGPS and £12m (2016: £9m) SIPS interest 
and inflation swaps. 
At 31 July 2017 SIPS assets were net of £773m (2016: £720m) repurchase obligations, and included £4m (2016: £11m) gains on interest 
rate swaps, £8m gains (2016: £2m losses) on inflation swaps and £1m gains (2016: £nil) on total return swaps. See risk management 
disclosures on page 160 for information on how the scheme is using repurchase arrangements and swap contracts to match the interest 
rate and inflation exposures of its assets to the interest rate and inflation exposures of the scheme liabilities. The scheme was holding 
£1m (2016: £45m) in liquidity funds to meet potential future obligations to collateralise repurchase arrangements or swap agreements. 
The scheme assets do not include any property occupied by, or other assets used by, the Group. Equities include investments in 
broad-based equity indices, some of which hold ordinary equity shares in Smiths Group plc.

Where any individual scheme shows a recoverable surplus under IAS 19, this is disclosed on the balance sheet as a retirement benefit 
asset. The IAS 19 surplus of any one scheme is not available to fund the IAS 19 deficit of another scheme. The retirement benefit asset 
disclosed arises from the rights of the employers to recover the surplus at the end of the life of the scheme.

Company contributions to the defined benefit pension plans and post-retirement healthcare plans for 2017 totalled £105m (2016: £275m). 
This comprised regular contributions to funded schemes of £24m (2016: £32m) to SIPS, £3m (2016: £11m) to TIGPS, £67m (2016: £34m) 
to funded US Schemes, £2m to other schemes and additional contributions of £3m to fund the closure of a scheme in Canada. In 
addition, £6m (2016: £6m) was spent on providing benefits under unfunded defined benefit pension and post-retirement 
healthcare plans. 
In 2018 the cash contributions to the Group’s principal funded defined benefit schemes are expected to total about £50m, including £24m 
to SIPS and £3m to TIGPS, with the balance relating mainly to the US scheme. Group contributions in respect of the unfunded schemes 
and post-retirement healthcare are expected to be in line with 2017.  Smiths Group plc  Annual Report 2017

9 Employee share schemes
The Group operates share schemes and plans for the benefit of employees. The nature of the principal schemes and plans, including 
general conditions, is set out below:
Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)
The LTIP is a share plan under which an award over a capped number of shares will vest after the end of the three-year performance 
period if performance conditions are met. LTIP awards are made to selected senior executives, including the executive directors. 
Awards made prior to 2016 were made with different targets for corporate executives and divisional executives. Since 2016 all LTIP 
awards have had one set of targets. 
LTIP performance conditions
Each performance condition has a threshold below which no shares vest and a maximum performance target at or above which the 
award vests in full. For performance between ‘threshold’ and ‘maximum’, awards vest on a straight-line sliding scale. The performance 
conditions are assessed separately, so performance on one condition does not affect the vesting of the other elements of the award. 
To the extent that the performance targets are not met over the three-year performance period, awards will lapse. There is no re-testing 
of the performance conditions.
Group LTIP awards have performance conditions relating to underlying revenue growth, growth in headline EPS adjusted to exclude tax, 
ROCE, cash conversion and, for awards made before 2015, TSR relative to the FTSE 100 (excluding financial services companies). 
Divisional LTIP awards have performance conditions relating to divisional performance against headline KPIs, including underlying 
revenue and operating profit growth, operating margins, ROCE, operating cash conversion, employee engagement and quality metrics. 
Smiths Group Co-Investment Plan (CIP) and Smiths Share Matching Plan (SMP)
In 2015 the CIP was replaced by the SMP. Under the CIP and SMP participants are required to invest between 25% and 50% of their 
post-tax bonus purchasing the Company’s shares at the prevailing market price. At the end of a three-year period, if the executive is still 
in office and provided the performance test is passed, matching shares will be awarded in respect of any invested shares retained for 
that period. The number of matching shares to be awarded is determined by the Remuneration Committee at the end of the year in which 
the bonus is earned by reference to annual bonus, and other corporate financial criteria. The maximum award will not exceed the value, 
before tax, of the bonus or salary invested in shares by the executive. 
For the CIP, vesting of matching shares will occur, and the matching shares will be released, at the end of the three-year period if the 
Group’s Return on Capital Employed (‘ROCE’) over the performance period exceeds the Group’s weighted average cost of capital 
(‘WACC’) over the performance period by an average margin of at least 1% per annum. If ROCE exceeds WACC by an average margin of 
3% per annum, the enhanced performance condition is met, and a second matching share will be issued for every purchased share. For 
the SMP, vesting of matching shares will occur, and the matching shares will be released, at the end of the three-year period depending 
on the performance of the Group LTIP issued for the same performance period. The first matching share is awarded if the Group LTIP 
vests under any performance condition. 
No future awards will be made under the CIP or SMP. 
Smiths Excellence Plan (SEP)
In September 2016 the Smiths Excellence plan (SEP) was introduced. The SEP is designed to reinforce value creation over the medium 
term by focusing on specific objectives in key areas of operational performance. Awards vest after two years, depending on performance 
on the operational objectives during the first year and continued employment with the Group. There is no retesting of performance. 
However the Remuneration Committee has discretion to adjust vesting rates if material misstatements in reported performance are 
subsequently identified and awards are subject to clawback provisions in the event of mis-conduct. 
Directors are not eligible to participate in the SEP. 
Restricted stock 
The restricted stock is used by the Remuneration Committee, as a part of the recruitment strategy, to make awards in recognition of 
incentive arrangements forfeited on leaving a previous employer. If an award is considered appropriate, the award will take account of 
relevant factors including the fair value of awards forfeited, any performance conditions attached, the likelihood of those conditions 
being met and the proportion of the vesting period remaining.

For the purposes of valuing options to arrive at the share-based payment charge, the Binomial option-pricing model has been used  
for most schemes and the Monte Carlo method is used for schemes with total shareholder return performance targets. The key 
assumptions used in the models for 2017 and 2016 are volatility of 20% to 25% (2016: 25% to 30%) and dividend yield of 3.50% 
(2016: 3.75%), based on historical data, for the period corresponding with the vesting period of the option. These generated a weighted 
average fair value for SEP of £12.86p (2016: no grant), LTIP of £12.68 (2016: £10.33), and restricted stock of £12.59 (2016: £10.03). 
Included within staff costs is an expense arising from share-based payment transactions of £15m (2016: £10m), of which £14m 
(2016: £9m) relates to equity-settled share-based payment.

11 Impairment testing
Goodwill
Goodwill is not amortised but is tested for impairment at least annually. Value in use or fair value less cost to sell calculations are used 
to determine the recoverable amount of goodwill held allocated to each group of cash generating units (CGU). Value in use is calculated 
as the net present value of the projected risk-adjusted cash-flows of the CGU. These forecast cash-flows are based on the 2018 budget, 
the five-year strategic plan approved by the Board and detailed divisional strategic projections, where these have been prepared and 
approved by the Board. Fair value less cost to sell is calculated using available information on past and expected future profitability, 
valuation multiples for comparable quoted companies and similar transactions (adjusted as required for significant differences) and 
information on costs of similar transactions. Fair value less costs to sell models are used when trading projections in the strategic plan 
cannot be adjusted to eliminate the impact of a major restructuring.
Goodwill is allocated by division as follows:

Following the disposal of the John Crane Artificial Lift business (see note 28) and a restructuring to integrate China into the global  
John Crane management structure, John Crane is now a single CGU. Impairment testing has been completed on this basis for 2017. 
Morpho Detection was acquired in April 2017 (see note 26). At 31 July 2017 a single management team was in place covering Continuing Smiths 
Detection and Morpho Detection. However, the integration of the two businesses was not sufficiently advanced to support treating them as a single 
CGU for impairment testing. Based on the current integration plan, it is anticipated that there will be a single CGU in 2018. 
Following the disposal of Smiths Interconnect Power and Smiths Interconnect Microwave Telecoms (see note 28) and the integration  
of Smiths Interconnect Connectors and Smiths Interconnect Microwave Components, Smiths Interconnect now has two CGUs, Smiths 
Interconnect Connectors and Components and Smiths Interconnect Microwave Subsystems.  Smiths Group plc  Annual Report 2017

Goodwill continued
Impairment testing assumptions
John Crane and Smiths Medical have strong aftermarket and consumables businesses, with consistent sales trends. Smiths Detection 
and Smiths Interconnect have greater sales and margin volatility due to lower levels of recurring revenue and involvement in 
government-funded programmes, particularly defence, and customer-led technology innovation. The key assumptions used in value  
in use calculations are: 
• Sales: projected sales are built up with reference to markets and product categories. They incorporate past performance, historical 
growth rates and projections of developments in key markets. 
• Margins: projected margins reflect historical performance and the impact of all completed projects to improve operational efficiency 
and leverage scale. The projections do not include the impact of future restructuring projects to which the Group is not yet committed. 
• Discount rate: the discount rates have been calculated based on the Group’s weighted average cost of capital and risks specific to the 
CGU being tested. The discount rates disclosed incorporate risk adjustments where the projected sales and margins are affected by 
significant delivery risks. Pre-tax rates of 12.2% to 16.9% (2016: 11.0% to 14.3%) have been used for the impairment testing. 
• Long-term growth rates: as required by IAS 36, growth rates for the period after the detailed forecasts are based on the long-term 
GDP projections of the primary market for the CGU. The average growth rate used in the testing was 2.1% (2016: 2.2%). These rates  
do not reflect the long-term assumptions used by the Group for investment planning. 
The assumptions used in the impairment testing of significant CGUs are as follows:

Sensitivity analysis
Morpho Detection explosive detection business
Morpho Detection’s fair value less costs to sell exceeds its carrying value by £38m. Fair value was calculated using a level 3 valuation 
model. Sensitivity analysis performed around the base case assumptions has indicated that for Morpho Detection, the following changes 
in assumptions (in isolation), would cause the fair value less costs to sell to fall below the carrying value. The business was acquired in 
the year, so there are no comparatives. 
Year ended 31 July 2017 
Change required to trigger impairment
Forecast earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation 8% reduction in EBITDA
Valuation multiple 0.9 reduction in multiple
Forecast earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation have been projected using: 
• expected future sales, based on orders, projected sales under framework agreements, sales opportunities and current contract 
win rates; 
• current cost structure and production capacity; and 
• adjustments to profit which a market participant would normally make in assessing a business of this nature, including market 
participant synergies. 
The valuation multiple has been estimated using current share prices for similar listed companies, multiples paid in recent transactions 
and advice on current market pricing.  Smiths Group plc  Annual Report 2017

FINANCIALS
Other CGUs
For the other CGUs, sensitivity analysis performed around the base case assumptions has indicated that no reasonable changes in key 
assumptions would cause the carrying amount of any of the CGUs to exceed their respective recoverable amounts.
Goodwill impairment 
No impairment charges have been incurred (2016: £23m). In 2016 the following goodwill impairments were recognised: £5m for  
John Crane Production Solutions, £7m for Smiths Interconnect Microwave Components and £11m for Smiths Interconnect Microwave 
Telecoms. All three of these businesses were sold in the current year, see note 28. 
Other intangible assets
The Group has no indefinite life intangible assets other than goodwill. During the year impairment tests were carried out for 
development projects which have not yet started to be amortised and acquired intangibles where there were indications of impairment. 
Value in use calculations were used to determine the recoverable values of these assets.
No impairment charges have been incurred (2016: £nil). 
Property, plant and equipment
Impairment charges of £5m for John Crane Production Solutions, principally relating to property, and £1m for sites affected by the  
Fuel for Growth restructuring were recognised in 2016.

Trade receivables include balances not yet due of £75m (2016: £47m) relating to multi-year Smiths Detection contracts, where revenue 
recognition does not align with the agreed payment schedule. The Group also has cash received of £78m (2016: £41m) deferred in trade 
and other payables relating to Smiths Detection contracts. 
Trade receivables do not carry interest. Management considers that the carrying value of trade and other receivables approximates  
to the fair value. Trade and other receivables, including prepayments, accrued income and other receivables qualifying as financial 
instruments are classified as ‘loans and receivables’. The maximum credit exposure arising from these financial assets is £720m 
(2016: £745m).
Trade receivables are disclosed net of provisions for bad and doubtful debts. The provisions for bad and doubtful debts are based on 
specific risk assessment and reference to past default experience.
Credit risk is managed separately for each customer and, where appropriate, a credit limit is set for the customer based on previous 
experience of the customer and third party credit ratings. The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure 
spread over a large number of customers. The largest single customer is the US Federal Government, representing less than 5% 
(2016: less than 5%) of Group revenue.

Netting
Cash and overdraft balances in interest compensation cash pooling systems are reported gross on the balance sheet. The cash pooling 
agreements incorporate a legally enforceable right of net settlement. However, there is no intention to settle the balances net, so these 
arrangements do not qualify for net presentation. At 31 July 2017 the total value of overdrafts on accounts in interest compensation cash 
pooling systems was £nil (2016: less than £1m). The balances held in zero balancing cash pooling arrangements have daily settlement of 
balances, so netting is not relevant.

18 Financial risk management
The Group’s international operations and debt financing expose it to financial risks which include the effects of changes in foreign 
exchange rates, changes in debt market prices, interest rates, credit risks and liquidity risks. 
Treasury and risk management policies are set by the Board. The policy sets out specific guidelines to manage foreign exchange risk, 
interest rate risk, credit risk and the use of financial instruments to manage risk. The instruments and techniques used to manage 
exposures include foreign currency derivatives, debt and other interest rate derivatives. The central treasury function monitors financial 
risks and compliance with risk management policies. The management of operational credit risk is discussed in note 14.
(a) Foreign exchange risk
Transactional currency exposure
The Group is exposed to foreign currency risks arising from sales or purchases by businesses in currencies other than their functional 
currency. It is Group policy that, when the net foreign exchange exposure to known future sales and purchases is material, this exposure 
is hedged using forward foreign exchange contracts. The net exposure is calculated by adjusting the expected cash-flow for payments  
or receipts in the same currency linked to the sale or purchase. This policy minimises the risk that the profits generated from the 
transaction will be affected by foreign exchange movements which occur after the price has been determined. Hedge accounting 
documentation and effectiveness testing are only undertaken if it is cost effective.

Cash-flow hedging
The Group uses foreign currency contracts to hedge future foreign currency sales and purchases. At 31 July 2017 contracts with a 
nominal value of £407m (2016: £393m) were designated as hedging instruments. In addition, the Group had outstanding foreign currency 
contracts with a nominal value of £243m (2016: £529m) which were being used to manage transactional foreign exchange exposures, but 
were not accounted for as cash-flow hedges. The fair value of the contracts is disclosed in note 19.
The majority of hedged transactions will be recognised in the consolidated income statement in the same period that the cash flows are 
expected to occur, with the only differences arising because of normal commercial credit terms on sales and purchases. Of the foreign 
exchange contracts designated as hedging instruments 86% are for periods of 12 months or less (2016: 91%).
The movements in the cash-flow hedge reserve during the period are summarised in the table below:

Translational currency exposure
The Group has significant investments in overseas operations, particularly in the United States and Europe. As a result, the sterling 
value of the Group’s balance sheet can be significantly affected by movements in exchange rates. The Group seeks to mitigate the effect 
of these translational currency exposures by matching the net investment in overseas operations with borrowings denominated in their 
functional currencies, except where significant adverse interest differentials or other factors would render the cost of such hedging 
activity uneconomic. This is achieved by borrowing primarily in the relevant currency or in some cases indirectly using forward foreign 
exchange contracts and cross-currency swaps.

(b) Interest rate risk
The Group operates an interest rate policy designed to optimise interest cost and reduce volatility in reported earnings. The Group’s 
current policy is to require interest rates to be fixed for greater than 70% of the level of gross debt. This is achieved through fixed rate 
borrowings and interest rate swaps. At 31 July 2017 57% (2016: 59%) of the Group’s gross borrowings were at fixed interest rates, after 
adjusting for interest rate swaps and the impact of short maturity derivatives designated as net investment hedges. The Group monitors 
its fixed rate risk profile against both gross and net debt. For medium-term planning, it now focuses on gross debt to eliminate the 
fluctuations of variable cash levels over the cycle.
The weighted average interest rate on borrowings and cross-currency swaps at 31 July 2017, after interest rate swaps, is 3.52% 
(2016: 3.68%).
Interest rate profile of financial assets and liabilities and the fair value of borrowings
The following table shows the interest rate risk exposure of investments, cash and borrowings, with the borrowings adjusted for the 
impact of interest rate hedging. The other financial assets and liabilities do not earn or bear interest and for all financial instruments 
except for borrowings the carrying value is not materially different from their fair value.

Interest rate hedging
At 31 July 2017 and 31 July 2016 the Group has designated the following hedges against variability in the fair value of borrowings arising 
from fluctuations in base rates: 
• US$150m interest rate swap which matures on 12 October 2022 partially hedging the US$ 2022 Guaranteed notes; and
• the fixed/floating element of €400m of €/US$ interest rate swaps which mature on 28 April 2023 partially hedging the 
€ 2023 Eurobond. 
At 31 July 2017 the Group has designated the following hedge against variability in the fair value of borrowings arising from fluctuations 
in base rates and exchange rates: 
• the fixed/floating and € exchange exposure of €300m of €/US$ interest rate swaps which mature on 23 February 2027 partially 
hedging the € 2027 Eurobond. 
The fair values of the hedging instruments are disclosed in note 19. The effect of the swaps is to convert £741m (2016: £552m) debt from 
fixed rate to floating rate. 
Sensitivity of interest charges to interest rate movements
The Group has exposure to sterling, US dollar and euro interest rates. However the Group does not have a significant exposure to 
interest rate movements for any individual currency. Based on the composition of net debt and investments at 31 July 2017, and taking 
into consideration all fixed rate borrowings and interest rate swaps in place, a one percentage point (100 basis points) change in average 
floating interest rates for all three currencies would have less than £1m impact (2016: impact of £2m) on the Group’s profit before tax. Smiths Group plc  Annual Report 2017

18 Financial risk management continued
(c) Financial credit risk
The Group is exposed to credit-related losses in the event of non-performance by counterparties to financial instruments, but does not currently 
expect any counterparties to fail to meet their obligations. Credit risk is mitigated by the Board-approved policy of only placing cash deposits with 
highly rated relationship bank counterparties within counterparty limits established by reference to their Standard & Poor’s long-term debt rating. 
In the normal course of business, the Group operates cash pooling systems, where a legal right of set-off applies.
The maximum credit risk exposure in the event of other parties failing to perform their obligations under financial assets, excluding 
trade and other receivables and derivatives, totals £803m at 31 July 2017 (2016: £440m).

Borrowing facilities
The Board policy specifies the maintenance of unused committed credit facilities of at least £200m at all times to ensure it has sufficient 
available funds for operations and planned development, which is provided by a multi-currency revolving credit facility. 
Smiths has a $800m Revolving Credit Facility that matures on 19 February 2021. At the balance sheet date, the Group had the following

These contracts comprise derivatives which were previously part of the net investment hedging programme and matching contracts  
to eliminate this exposure. There is no further net exposure arising from these contracts. 
Accounting for other derivative contracts
Any foreign exchange contracts which are not formally designated as hedges and tested are classified as ‘held for trading’ and not 
hedge accounted. 
Netting
International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) master netting agreements are in place with derivative counterparties except  
for contracts traded on a dedicated international electronic trading platform used for operational foreign exchange hedging. Under 
these agreements if a credit event occurs, all outstanding transactions under the ISDA are terminated and only a single net amount  
per counterparty is payable in settlement of all transactions. The ISDA agreements do not meet the criteria for offsetting, since the 
offsetting is enforceable only if specific events occur in the future, and there is no intention to settle the contracts on a net basis.

Investments in bank deposits are valued at the bank balance, adjusted for accrued interest. 
Derivatives, including forward exchange contracts, currency swaps, interest rate instruments, and embedded derivatives, are valued  
at the net present value of the future cash-flows calculated using market data at the balance sheet date (principally exchange rates  
and yield curves). 
Borrowings are valued at the net present value of the future cash-flows using credit spreads and yield curves derived from market data. 
Borrowings are carried on the balance sheet at amortised cost adjusted for fair value interest rate hedging. The fair value of fixed rate 
borrowings is only used for supplementary disclosures.
Cash, trade receivables and trade payables are excluded from this table because carrying value is a reasonable approximation to fair 
value for all these assets and liabilities.

Trading
Warranty provision and product liability
At 31 July 2017 there are warranty and product liability provisions of £28m (2016: £29m). Warranties over the Group’s products typically 
cover periods of between one and three years. Provision is made for the likely cost of after-sales support based on the recent past 
experience of individual businesses.
Commercial disputes and litigation in respect of ongoing business activities
The Group has on occasion been required to take legal action to protect its intellectual property and other rights against infringement.  
It has also had to defend itself against proceedings brought by other parties, including product liability and insurance subrogation 
claims. Provision is made for any expected costs and liabilities in relation to these proceedings where appropriate, though there can be 
no guarantee that such provisions (which may be subject to potentially material revision from time to time) will accurately predict the 
actual costs and liabilities that may be incurred. 
Contingent liabilities
In the ordinary course of its business, the Group is subject to commercial disputes and litigation such as government price audits, 
product liability claims, employee disputes and other kinds of lawsuits, and faces different types of legal issues in different jurisdictions. 
The high level of activity in the US, for example, exposes the Group to the likelihood of various types of litigation commonplace in that 
country, such as ‘mass tort’ and ‘class action’ litigation, legal challenges to the scope and validity of patents, and product liability and 
insurance subrogation claims. These types of proceedings (or the threat of them) are also used to create pressure to encourage 
negotiated settlement of disputes. Any claim brought against the Group (with or without merit), could be costly to defend. These matters 
are inherently difficult to quantify. In appropriate cases a provision is recognised based on best estimates and management judgement 
but there can be no guarantee that these provisions (which may be subject to potentially material revision from time to time) will result in 
an accurate prediction of the actual costs and liabilities that may be incurred. There are also contingent liabilities in respect of litigation 
for which no provisions are made.
The Group operates in some markets where the risk of unethical or corrupt behaviour is material and has procedures, including an 
employee ‘Ethics Alertline’, to help it identify potential issues. Such procedures will, from time to time, give rise to internal investigations, 
sometimes conducted with external support, to ensure that Smiths Group properly understands risks and concerns and can take steps 
both to manage immediate issues and to improve its practices and procedures for the future. The Group also co-operates with relevant 
authorities in investigating business conduct issues whenever requested to. The Group is not aware of any issues which are expected to 
generate material financial exposures. 
Non-headline and legacy
John Crane, Inc.
John Crane, Inc. (“JCI”) is one of many co-defendants in numerous lawsuits pending in the United States in which plaintiffs are claiming 
damages arising from alleged exposure to, or use of, products previously manufactured which contained asbestos. Until 2006, the 
awards, the related interest and all material defence costs were met directly by insurers. In 2007, JCI secured the commutation of 
certain insurance policies in respect of product liability. Provision is made in respect of the expected costs of defending known and 
predicted future claims and of adverse judgments in relation thereto, to the extent that such costs can be reliably estimated. 
The JCI products generally referred to in these cases consist of industrial sealing product, primarily packing and gaskets. The asbestos 
was encapsulated within these products in such a manner that causes JCI to believe, based on tests conducted on its behalf, that the 
products were safe. JCI ceased manufacturing products containing asbestos in 1985.  Smiths Group plc  Annual Report 2017

FINANCIALS
JCI continues to actively monitor the conduct and effect of its current and expected asbestos litigation, including the most efficacious 
presentation of its ‘safe product’ defence, and intends to continue to resist these asbestos claims based upon this defence. The table 
below summarises the JCI claims experience over the last 38 years since the start of this litigation:

The number of claims outstanding at 31 July 2017 reflects the benefit of 26,000 claims being dismissed in the year.
JCI has also incurred significant additional defence costs. The litigation involves claims for a number of allegedly asbestos related 
diseases, with awards, when made, for mesothelioma tending to be larger than those for the other diseases. JCI’s ability to defend 
mesothelioma cases successfully is, therefore, likely to have a significant impact on its annual aggregate adverse judgment and 
defence costs.
John Crane, Inc. litigation provision
The provision is based on past history of JCI claims and well-established tables of asbestos-related disease incidence projections.  
The provision is determined using advice from asbestos valuation experts, Bates White LLC. The assumptions made in assessing the 
appropriate level of provision include: the period over which the expenditure can be reliably estimated; the future trend of legal costs; 
the rate of future claims filed; the rate of successful resolution of claims; and the average amount of judgments awarded.
Established incidence curves can be used to estimate the likely future pattern of asbestos related disease. However, JCI’s claims 
experience is also significantly impacted by other factors which influence the US litigation environment. These can include: changing 
approaches on the part of the plaintiffs’ bar; changing attitudes amongst the judiciary at both trial and appellate levels in specific 
jurisdictions which move the balance of risk and opportunity for claimants; and legislative and procedural changes in both the state and 
federal court systems. The build-up of assets in trusts established by asbestos defendants in Chapter 11 restructuring (“524(g) trusts”) 
will increase the influence of these trusts on the behaviour of claimants. Developments in the Garlock Sealing Technologies LLC Chapter 
11 proceedings have provided additional data on plaintiff claims to 524 (g) trusts. Given the evidence that emerged of inconsistent 
duplicate claims, there is a significant likelihood that this will lead to changes in the pattern of claims made in the future, and the costs 
arising from claims. 
The projections use a limited time horizon on the basis that Bates White LLC consider that there is substantial uncertainty in the 
asbestos litigation environment so probable expenditures are not reasonably estimable beyond this time horizon. Asbestos is the 
longest running mass tort litigation in American history which is constantly evolving in ways that cannot be anticipated. JCIs defence 
strategy also generates a significantly different pattern of legal costs and settlement expenses from other defendants, so JCI is in an 
extremely rare position, and evidence from other litigation cannot be used to improve the reliability of the projections. A ten year (2016: 
ten years) time horizon has been used based on past experience regarding significant changes in the litigation environment that have 
occurred every few years and on the amount of time taken in the past for some of those changes to impact the broader asbestos 
litigation environment, and recent events, like the Garlock Sealing Technologies LLC Chapter 11 proceedings, which may lead to further 
major changes. 
The rate of future claims filed has been estimated using well-established tables of asbestos incidence projections to determine the likely 
population of potential claimants, and JCI’s past experience to determine what proportion of this population will make a claim against 
JCI. The JCI products generally referred to in claims had industrial and marine applications. As a result, the incidence curve used for 
JCI projections excludes construction workers, and is a composite of the curves that predict asbestos exposure-related disease from 
shipyards and other occupations. This is consistent with JCI’s litigation history. 
The rate of successful resolution of claims and the average amount of any judgments awarded are projected based on the past history  
of JCI claims, since this is the best available evidence, given JCI’s unusual strategy of defending all claims. 
The future trend of legal costs is estimated based on JCI’s past experience, adjusted to reflect the assumed levels of claims and trial 
activity, since the number of trials is a key driver of legal costs. 
John Crane, Inc. litigation insurance recoveries
While JCI has excess liability insurance, the availability of such insurance and scope of the cover are currently the subject of litigation  
in the United States. Pending the outcome of that litigation, JCI has met defence costs directly. The calculation of the provision does not 
take account of any potential recoveries from insurers. Smiths Group plc  Annual Report 2017

John Crane, Inc. litigation spend 32 32 27 25 29
The reduction in 2017 is due to increasing US dollar discount rates, with no material movement in the gross provision. 
The significant increase in the provision in 2016 is primarily due to the weakening of Smiths reporting currency against the US dollar 
(£39m increase in the provision) and lower US discount rates (£7m charge to the income statement). 
The operating charge for John Crane, Inc. litigation comprises: 
• a charge of £17m (2016: £8m) in respect of the net increased provision for adverse judgments and legal defence costs, 
• a credit of £13m arising from an increase in US risk free rates (2016: charge of £7m), and 
• £11m (2016: £8m) costs for litigation management, defence strategy and legal fees in connection with litigation against insurers. 
In the year ended 31 July 2016 JCI recognised the recovery of £16m through a settlement with an insurer. This agreement does not 
provide any cover for future costs, so there is no material impact on the closing litigation provision. A further settlement was agreed in 
the current year. 
John Crane, Inc. litigation provision sensitivities 
The provision may be subject to potentially material revision from time to time if new information becomes available as a result of future 
events. There can be no guarantee that the assumptions used to estimate the provision will result in an accurate prediction of the actual 
costs that may be incurred because of the significant uncertainty associated with the future level of asbestos claims and of the costs 
arising out of related litigation. 
Statistical reliability of projections over the ten year time horizon
In order to evaluate the statistical reliability of the projections, a population of outcomes is modelled using randomised verdict 
outcomes. This generated a distribution of outcomes with future spend at the 5th percentile of £231m and future spend at the 95th 
percentile of £304m (2016: £236m and £311m, respectively). Statistical analysis of the distribution of these outcomes indicates that there 
is a 50% probability that the total future spend will fall between £243m and £272m (2016: between £250m and £280m), compared to the 
gross provision value of £260m (2016: £267m).
Sensitivity of the projections to changes in the time horizon used
If the asbestos litigation environment becomes more volatile and uncertain, for example if defendants are successful in legal cases 
against plaintiff law firms and this impacts the nature of claims filed, the time horizon over which the provision can be calculated may 
reduce. Conversely, if the environment became more stable, or JCI changed approach and committed to long term settlement 
arrangements, the time period covered by the provision might be extended. 
The projections use a 10 year time horizon. Reducing the time horizon by one year would reduce the provision by £17m (2016: £18m) and 
reducing it by five years would reduce the provision by £98m (2016: £107m).
We consider, after obtaining advice from Bates White LLC, that to forecast beyond ten years requires that the litigation environment 
remains largely unchanged with respect to the historical experience used for estimating future asbestos expenditures. Historically, the 
asbestos litigation environment has undergone significant changes more often than every ten years. If one assumed that the asbestos 
litigation environment would remain unchanged for longer and extended the time horizon by one year it would increase the provision by 
£14m (2016: £16m) and extending it by five years would increase the provision by £58m (2016: £67m). However, there are also reasonable 
scenarios that, given certain recent events in the US asbestos litigation environment, would result in no additional asbestos litigation for 
JCI beyond ten years.  At this time, how the asbestos litigation environment may evolve beyond 10 years is not reasonably estimable. Smiths Group plc  Annual Report 2017

FINANCIALS
John Crane, Inc. contingent liabilities
Provision has been made for future defence costs and the cost of adverse judgments expected to occur. JCI’s claims experience is 
significantly impacted by other factors which influence the US litigation environment. These can include: changing approaches on the 
part of the plaintiffs’ bar; changing attitudes amongst the judiciary at both trial and appellate levels; and legislative and procedural 
changes in both the state and federal court systems. As a result, whilst the Group anticipates that asbestos litigation will continue 
beyond the period covered by the provision, the uncertainty surrounding the US litigation environment beyond this point is such that  
the costs cannot be reliably estimated.
Although the methodology used to calculate the JCI litigation provision can in theory be applied to show claims and costs for longer 
periods, the Directors consider, based on advice from Bates White LLC, that the level of uncertainty regarding the factors used in 
estimating future costs is too great to provide for reasonable estimation of the numbers of future claims, the nature of such claims  
or the cost to resolve them for years beyond the 10 year time horizon.
Titeflex Corporation
In recent years Titeflex Corporation, a subsidiary of the Group in the Flex-Tek division, has received a number of claims from insurance 
companies seeking recompense on a subrogated basis for the effects of damage allegedly caused by lightning strikes in relation to its 
flexible gas piping product. It has also received a number of product liability claims regarding this product, some in the form of 
purported class actions. Titeflex Corporation believes that its products are a safe and effective means of delivering gas when installed in 
accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions and local and national codes; however some claims have been settled on an individual 
basis without admission of liability. Equivalent third-party products in the US marketplace face similar challenges. 
Titeflex Corporation litigation provision
The continuing progress of claims and the pattern of settlement, together with the recent market place activity, provide sufficient 
evidence to recognise a liability in the accounts. Therefore provision has been made for the costs which the Group is expected to incur  
in respect of future claims to the extent that such costs can be reliably estimated. Titeflex Corporation sells flexible gas piping with 
extensive installation and safety guidance (revised in 2008) designed to assure the safety of the product and minimise the risk of damage 
associated with lightning strikes. 
The assumptions made in assessing the appropriate level of provision, which are based on past experience, include: the period over 
which expenditure can be reliably estimated; the number of future settlements; the average amount of settlements; and the impact of 
statutes of repose and safe installation initiatives on the expected number of future claims. 
The provision of £84m (2016: £94m) is a discounted pre-tax provision using discount rates, being the risk-free rate on US debt 
instruments for the appropriate period. The deferred tax asset related to this provision is shown within the deferred tax balance (note 6).

Titeflex Corporation litigation provision history
An additional provision of £8m (2016: £12m) has been recognised by Titeflex Corporation in respect of changes to the estimated cost of 
future claims from insurance companies seeking recompense for damage allegedly caused by lightning strikes. The offsetting provision 
release of £13m is principally due to increasing discount rates. 
In 2016, a £1m overprovision for the costs of settling claims was released, generating a net charge for the year of £11m.
Titeflex Corporation litigation provision sensitivities
However, because of the significant uncertainty associated with the future level of claims and of the costs arising out of related litigation, 
there can be no guarantee that the assumptions used to estimate the provision will result in an accurate prediction of the actual costs 
that may be incurred and, as a result, the provision may be subject to potentially material revision from time to time if new information 
becomes available as a result of future events.
The projections incorporate a long-term assumption about the impact of safe installation initiatives on the level of future claims. If the 
assumed annual benefit of bonding and grounding initiatives was 0.5% higher the provision would be £5m (2016: £6m) lower, and if the 
benefit was 0.5% lower, the provision would increase by £5m (2016: £7m).  Smiths Group plc  Annual Report 2017

22 Provisions and contingent liabilities continued
Non-headline and legacy continued
Other non-headline and legacy
Legacy provisions comprise provisions relating to former business activities and properties no longer used by Smiths. Non-headline 
provisions comprise all provisions that were disclosed as non-headline items when they were charged to the consolidated 
income statement. 
These provisions cover non-headline reorganisation, vacant properties, disposal indemnities and litigation in respect of old products 
and discontinued business activities. 
Reorganisation and property
At 31 July 2017 there were provisions of £8m (2016: £11m) related to Fuel for Growth, £3m (2016: £3m) related to onerous leases and 
dilapidations provisions, and £2m (2016: £2m) related to actual and potential environmental issues for sites which were no longer 
occupied by Smiths operations. The Fuel for Growth provisions are expected to be utilised in 2018. 
Disposal
Other provisions include disposal provisions of £3m (2016: £3m) relating to warranties and other obligations in respect of the disposal  
of the Marine Systems and Aerospace businesses. Most of the balance is expected to be utilised within the next five years.

paid to shareholders on 17 November 2017, subject to approval by the shareholders. This dividend has not been included as a liability in 
these accounts and is payable to all shareholders on the register of Members at close of business on 20 October 2017.
25 Reserves
Retained earnings include the value of Smiths Group plc shares held by the Smiths Industries Employee Benefit Trust. In the year the 
Company issued nil (2016: nil) shares to the Trust, and the Trust purchased 658,217 shares (2016: 760,218 shares) in the market for a 
consideration of £10m (2016: £8m). At 31 July 2017 the Trust held 766 (2016: 852) ordinary shares.
The capital redemption reserve, revaluation reserve and merger reserve arose from: share repurchases; revaluations of property, plant 
and equipment; and merger accounting for business combinations before the adoption of IFRS, respectively. 
Capital management
Capital employed comprises total equity adjusted for goodwill recognised directly in reserves, net post-retirement benefit related 
assets and liabilities, net litigation provisions relating to non-headline items and net debt. The efficiency of the allocation of the capital to 
the divisions is monitored through the return on capital employed (ROCE). This ratio is calculated over a rolling 12-month period and is 
the percentage that headline operating profit comprises of monthly average capital employed. The ROCE was 16.2% (2016: 15.3%), see 
note 30.
The capital structure is based on the directors’ judgement of the balance required to maintain flexibility while achieving an efficient cost 
of capital. 
The ratio of net debt to headline EBITDA of 1.4 (2016: 1.6) is within the Group’s stated policy of 2.0 or less over the medium term. The 
Group’s robust balance sheet and record of strong cash generation is more than able to fund the immediate investment needs and other 
legacy obligations. See note 30 for the definition of headline EBITDA and the calculation of this ratio.  Smiths Group plc  Annual Report 2017

FINANCIALS
As part of its capital management the Group strategy is to maintain a solid investment grade credit rating to ensure access to the widest 
possible sources of financing and to minimise the resulting cost of capital. At 31 July 2017 the Group had a credit rating of BBB+/Baa2 
(2016: BBB+/Baa2) with Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s respectively. 
The Board has a progressive dividend policy for future payouts, with the aim of increasing dividends in line with the long-term underlying 
growth in earnings. In setting the level of dividend payments, the Board will take into account prevailing economic conditions and future 
investment plans, along with the objective to maintain minimum dividend cover of around 2.0.

26 Acquisitions
The Group acquired the Morpho Detection business from Safran S. A. on 6 April 2017. The terms of the competition clearance for this 
transaction required the Group to sell the Morpho Detection explosive trace detection business. Consequently, the Morpho Detection 
explosive trace detection business was treated as a business acquired for resale, and the trading result during the period of ownership 
and the loss on disposal have been reported in discontinued operations, see note 27.
The intangible assets recognised on this acquisition comprise technology, in process research and development, customer and service 
relationships and the order book on acquisition. Goodwill represents the potential future technology developments and the cost savings 
that can be realised by integrating Morpho Detection with the continuing Smiths Detection business. The goodwill recognised is 
expected to be deductible for tax purposes. 
From the date of acquisition to 31 July 2017, Morpho Detection, excluding its explosive trace detection business, contributed £62m to 
revenue, £5m to headline profit before taxation and a loss of £24m to profit before taxation due to the unwind of inventory fair value 
adjustments £3m, the amortisation of acquired intangible assets £8m and integration and acquisition costs £18m. If Smiths had acquired 
Morpho Detection at the beginning of the financial period, the acquisition, excluding its explosive trace detection business, would have 
contributed £184m to revenue, £19m to headline profit before taxation and a loss of £22m to profit before taxation.

27 Discontinued operations and businesses held for sale
The Group acquired the Morpho Detection explosive trace detection business on 6 April 2017 after making commitments to the European 
Commission and the US Department of Justice to sell this business to an approved purchaser. The Group began marketing this business 
for sale once the terms of the competition clearance were known. Consequently, this business was treated as a business acquired for 
resale, and the assets and liabilities were classified as held for sale during the period the business was owned by the Group. The sale 
was completed on 7 July 2017 for a cash consideration of £63m. 
A loss after tax of £8m (2016: £nil) was generated by discontinued operations, giving a loss per share from discontinued operations,  
basic and diluted, of 2.0p (2016: nil). Cash invested in financial assets includes £7m (2016: £nil) relating to discontinued operations. 
There were no assets or businesses held for sale at 31 July 2017. At 31 July 2016 the assets and liabilities of the John Crane Artificial lift 
business were disclosed as held for sale. No impairment loss was recognised on writing these assets down to fair value less disposal 
costs although impairments were recognised earlier in the year relating to this business, see note 11.

Assets and liabilities have been translated into US dollars at the exchange rate at the date of that balance sheet and income, expenses 
and cash-flows are translated at average exchange rates for the period. This reflects the accounting approach that Smiths Group plc 
would use if the Group moved to reporting in US dollars without making any changes to its Group structure or financing arrangements.

Significant judgements, key assumptions and estimates
The preparation of the accounts in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates 
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date 
of the accounts and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from these 
estimates. The key estimates and assumptions used in these parent company financial statements are set out below.
Taxation
The Company has recognised deferred tax assets of £55m (2016: £44m) relating to revenue losses brought forward. The recognition of 
these assets is dependent on the ability to recover them against the unwind of other tax positions and forecast UK taxable profits of the 
tax group. The treatment of these assets is reviewed regularly. Further detail on the Company’s deferred taxation position is included  
in note 6.
Retirement benefits
The financial statements include costs in relation to, and provision for, retirement benefit obligations. The costs and the present value  
of any related pension assets and liabilities depend on such factors as life expectancy of the members, the returns that plan assets 
generate and the discount rate used to calculate the present value of the liabilities. The Company uses previous experience and 
independent actuarial advice to select the values of critical estimates. The estimates, and the effect of variances in key estimates,  
are disclosed in note 8 to the consolidated accounts.
At 31 July 2017 there is a retirement benefit asset of £390m (2016: £327m) which arises from the rights of the employers to recover the 
surplus at the end of the life of the scheme. If the pension schemes were wound up while they still had members, the schemes would 
need to buy out the benefits of all members. The buyouts would cost significantly more than the present value of the scheme liabilities 
calculated in accordance with IAS 19: Employee benefits. 
Investment carrying value
Investments in subsidiary undertakings and loans due from subsidiaries are reviewed regularly, and tested if there are any indications 
of impairment, or problems with recoverability. The recoverable amounts of investments are determined based on valuations of the 
underlying trading operations. The recoverability of loans is assessed by looking at the credit quality of the subsidiary and any 
support available to the subsidiary. These calculations require the use of estimates including projected future cash-flows and other 
future events. 
Foreign currencies
Foreign currency transactions are recorded at the exchange rate ruling on the date of transaction. Foreign exchange gains and losses 
resulting from the settlement of such transactions, and from the retranslation at year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and 
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, are recognised in the profit and loss account.
Operating leases
Payments made under operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account as incurred over the term of the lease.
Where a leasehold property is vacant, or sub-let under terms such that the rental income is insufficient to meet all outgoings, provision 
is made for the anticipated future shortfall up to termination of the lease.
Property, plant and equipment
Depreciation is provided at rates estimated to write off the relevant assets by equal annual amounts over their expected useful lives.  
In general, the rates used are: Freehold and long leasehold property – 2%; Short leasehold property – over the period of the lease; 
Plant, machinery, etc. – 10% to 20%; Fixtures, fittings, tools and other equipment – 10% to 33%. 
Investments in shares in Group companies
The Company’s investments in shares in Group companies are stated at cost less provision for impairment. Any impairment is charged 
to the profit and loss account as it arises.
Financial instruments
The policies disclosed in the Group accounting policies on pages 143 to 147 for recognition, measurement and presentation of financial 
instruments are applied in the Company accounts. Smiths Group plc  Annual Report 2017
200
Taxation
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method. A deferred tax asset is recognised where it is probable that future 
taxable income will be sufficient to utilise the available relief. 
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, except where the timing of the reversal  
of the temporary difference is controlled by the Company and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the 
foreseeable future.
Provisions
Provisions for disposal indemnities, restructuring costs, vacant leasehold property and legal claims are recognised when: the Company 
has a legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event; it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the 
obligation; and the amount has been reliably estimated. Provisions are not recognised for future operating losses.
Provisions are discounted where the time value of money is material.
Post-retirement benefits
The Company has both defined benefit and defined contribution plans.
For defined benefit plans the liability for each scheme recognised in the balance sheet is the present value of the defined benefit 
obligation at the balance sheet date less the fair value of plan assets. The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by 
independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by 
discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of AA corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which 
the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension liability. Actuarial gains and 
losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised in full when they occur and presented 
in the statement of other comprehensive income. 
For defined contribution plans, the Company pays contributions to publicly or privately administered pension insurance plans on  
a mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis. Contributions are expensed as incurred. 
The Company also has post-retirement healthcare schemes that are accounted for on a similar basis to the defined benefit plans.
Share-based payment
The Company operates a number of equity-settled and cash-settled share-based compensation plans. 
The fair value of the shares or share options granted is recognised over the vesting period to reflect the value of the employee services 
received. The charge relating to grants to employees of the Company is recognised as an expense in the profit and loss account and the 
charge for grants to employees of other group companies is recognised as an investment in the relevant subsidiary. 
The fair value of options granted, excluding the impact of any non-market vesting conditions, is calculated using established option 
pricing models, principally binomial models. The probability of meeting non-market vesting conditions, which include profitability 
targets, is used to estimate the number of share options that are likely to vest. 
For cash-settled share-based payment schemes, a liability is recognised based on the fair value of the payment earned by the balance 
sheet date. For equity-settled share-based payment schemes, the corresponding credit is recognised directly in reserves. 
Dividends
Dividends are recognised as a liability in the period in which they are authorised. The interim dividend is recognised when it is paid and 
the final dividend is recognised when it has been approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting.

Loans due to subsidiaries are offset against loans due from subsidiaries to the extent that there is a legal right of set off and an intention 
to settle the balances net. At 31 July 2017 £2,088m of loans payable are offset against loans receivable (2016: £1,372m). The Company 
has large offsetting loan balances because it uses loans to reduce its foreign currency exposures and separately monitor net cash 
generated from trading activities.

The Company is part of a UK tax group including all its UK-based subsidiaries. The Company has recognised deferred tax assets of 
£55m (2016: £44m) relating to revenue losses brought forward. The recognition of these assets is dependent on the ability to recover 
them against the unwind of other tax positions and forecast UK taxable profits of the tax group. The timing of the unwind of other tax 
positions depends on the impact of pension contributions on the UK tax base. The treatment of these assets is reviewed regularly.
At 31 July 2017 the Company has unrecognised deferred tax assets of £nil (2016: £19m relating to retirement benefit obligations).
