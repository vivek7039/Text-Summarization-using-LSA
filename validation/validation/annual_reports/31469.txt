Highlights and contents
Front cover:
G4S provides technology and physical security services for the three consortia building the 
Thames Tideway tunnel. G4S is securing the project as a fully-integrated partner for security 
across all 21 construction worksites.
The Thames Tideway tunnel is a £4.2 billion construction project, designed to stop London’s 
iconic River Thames from being polluted. A cleaner Thames and a more attractive riverside will 
help underpin London’s economic prosperity, attracting more tourists, and boosting the use of 
river transport. It is also expected to help revitalise small local businesses and the commercial 
fishing industry, by encouraging healthy marine life.
KPI
Strategic report
Integrated Report and Accounts 2017 G4S plc 1 SECURITY SERVICES AND TECHNOLOGY (77%)
Market
G4S operates an integrated security business in more 
than 90 countries across the globe. The global security 
market has structural growth qualities (see page 8 for  
a description of the growth drivers) and is highly 
fragmented; there are few international suppliers and 
our competitors are typically smaller local and regional 
companies. The security industry is seeing growing 
demand for technology-enabled and integrated security 
solutions (which combine people and technology)  
to deliver cost-effective security, especially in  
developed markets.
Our approach
Against the backdrop of growing demand, we design, 
market and deliver a wide range of security and related 
services and our global footprint provides valuable 
access to a highly-diversified customer base in markets 
around the world. Some traditional security markets are 
commoditised and significant price competition exists 
– we aim to differentiate G4S by providing industry-
leading security solutions that are innovative, reliable and 
efficient. Our scale and focus on productivity support, 
our cost competitiveness and our sustained investment 
in professional staff, technology, software and systems 
enable us to provide innovative and reliable solutions  
for our customers on a stand-alone or integrated basis.

G4S at a glance
SECURING YOUR WORLD
G4S is the world’s leading global, integrated security 
company specialising in the delivery of security and 
related services across six continents.
We offer a broad range of security products and 
services on a single, multi‑service and integrated basis. 
We have been investing in technology, software and 
systems. The Group’s technology‑related security 
revenues were £2.45 billion* in 2017 (2016: £2.2 billion).  
OUR BUSINESSES
Market
G4S Care & Justice Services are concentrated in the  
UK and Australia. The market for the private provision 
of care and justice services is fairly consolidated with a 
small number of large providers. Larger companies are 
usually better equipped to deliver the highly specialised 
services in this sector, working with a diverse supply 
chain including the voluntary sector. In the UK the 
market environment is mature with limited growth 
opportunities. In the short to medium term we expect 
the environment to be more positive in Australia.
Our approach
We aim to achieve positive outcomes for those in the 
care and justice system. G4S will only offer custody, 
detention, rehabilitation and care services where we  
can access a qualified talent pool and where the  
political, legal, human rights and regulatory framework 
is consistent with our Group values and results in 
acceptable operational, commercial and reputational risk. 
Market
G4S Cash Solutions is one of a small number of large, 
global cash businesses and is the market leader or 
number two in 40 of its 42 markets. Each market is 
highly regulated, often by central banks, and the business 
requires significant infrastructure and expertise. G4S 
competes with local, national and a small number  
of international competitors. Cash volumes in most 
developed markets are flat or gradually declining at an 
aggregate market level. Cash usage continues to increase 
in emerging markets (see page 8 for cash usage trends). 
The Group sees significant revenue-growth opportunities 
in providing technology solutions to reduce the cost and 
increase the ease of using cash for banks and retailers.
Our approach
We transport, process, recycle, store securely and 
manage cash, and provide secure international logistics 
for cash and valuables. Our strategy is designed to 
enable us to aggregate cash-handling volumes through 
cost leadership and product and service differentiation.
We invest in technology and sell proprietary  
cash-management systems which combine skilled 
professionals with software, hardware and operational 
support in an integrated, managed service. To support 
cost leadership we strive for a consistent operating 
model and use shared services to maximise efficiency.
We operate around the globe, focusing on markets 
where we are able to build and sustain a material 
market share in our key service offerings. Outside  
the traditional cash market, there remains significant 
opportunity for retail cash and bank branch automation 
– services that have mainly remained in-house until now.

2017 Results highlights – core businesses
Revenues rose by 3.2% to £7.4 billion. The combination 
of growing revenues and improved productivity saw the 
Group’s adjusted earnings per share rise by 5.9% to 
17.9 pence per share. The Group generated operating 
cash flow of £527 million, equivalent to 106% of 
Adjusted PBITA in line with our guidance of a 
normalised rate of over 100%.
Since 2013, revenues from core businesses 
have grown by 17% and Adjusted EPS by  
48% while generating operating cash flow  
of £2.5 billion.
The Group’s strong cash generation has enabled 
us to invest in growth, pay dividends of more 
than £700 million and at the same time 
strengthen the Group’s financial position, 
reducing net debt/Adjusted EBITDA to 2.4x  
at the end of 2017.
Over the same period we have created 
innovative new products and services for our 
customers and we greatly improved safety 
performance for our employees.
We are continuing to invest in growth, 
technology and productivity in order to 
capitalise on our strong positions and to 
support our aim of delivering sustainable, 
profitable growth.
FOCUSED GROWTH
Chief Executive’s review
4 G4S plc Integrated Report and Accounts 2017 PEOPLE AND VALUES
Organisation
Over the past four years we  
have invested in sales, business 
development, technology and 
our support and control systems, 
processes and resources. We now have sufficient 
strength and depth in these areas to enable us to 
implement the next, critical phase of our organisational 
development and with effect from1 January 2018 we 
have reorganised the Group-wide management of our 
core business. The principal features of this change are:
• Creation of a Global Cash Solutions division
• Consolidation of our Secure Solutions businesses 
into four regions: Americas, Europe & Middle East, 
Africa and Asia
Our new organisation will enable us to strengthen 
further our strategic, commercial and operational focus 
in each of our core service lines. We will continue to 
build and utilise shared services for the provision of 
efficient and fit-for-purpose support functions to all 
businesses and this element of our organisational 
development has significant unrealised potential.
The biographies of the leaders of our principal 
businesses are set out on pages 70 and 71.
As outlined in the market growth section on pages 8 
and 9, technology is a growing part of our Secure 
Solutions and Cash Solutions services.
In Secure Solutions, we continue to build our 
capabilities to design and deliver integrated security 
solutions – combining people and technology to offer 
our customers more efficient and valuable security 
solutions (see pages 24 to 27). Today we have more 
than £2.45 billion technology-related security revenues.
Our integrated approach to designing and delivering 
security solutions helps us to differentiate our value 
proposition in order to win, retain and grow contracts 
with key customers.
Our new Secure Solutions organisation will enable us to 
increase collaboration and co-ordination across all of our 
markets which, in turn, will enable us to rationalise and 
target our product and business development, improve 
global account development, harmonise marketing and 
transfer operational best practices more rapidly.
Our Care & Justice Services are concentrated in the  
UK & Australia where we have significant resource  
and capability to win and deliver complex public 
services. Our focus is on rigorous pre-bid evaluation  
of contracts and operational delivery. We expect the 
overall cash generation of these services to improve as 
certain legacy contracts expire over the next 18 to 24 
months.
In our Global Cash Solutions division we have proven 
expertise in providing technology-enabled cash solutions 
and services that improve the control, ease of use and 
efficiency of our customers’ cash management. In the 
United States we have established a market-leading 
position in the provision of cash management 
technology for large format retail stores. We believe 
that our proven cash management technology and our 
people provide G4S with a substantial opportunity to 
extend and grow new products and services across  
our global markets. At the end of 2017 G4S cash 
management technology was deployed at over 19,500 
locations in North America, Europe, Asia Pacific and 
Africa, an increase of more than 30% over the prior 
year. We also made progress in improving productivity 
in a number of markets and we now have plans to  
apply these improvements across all of our cash 
solutions businesses.
I am confident that our new organisation will enable 
G4S to take full advantage of the exciting growth 
opportunities in our markets and to successfully  
execute our strategy.
Our CSR approach and contribution 
to society
As a global leader in security and related services, 
corporate social responsibility is very important to G4S 
and it forms a key part of our strategy. We are trusted  
to care for some of the world’s most valuable assets  
and to ensure the safety, protection and welfare  
of people around the world, often in complex and 
demanding operating environments.
Conducting our business in a way which is ethically 
responsible, safe and consistent with the company’s 
values and standards, is an essential element of our 
business model.
The Group is committed to sustainability and the core 
principles of the UN Global Compact are reflected in  
our policies, values and business activities today.
We recognise that business has an important role in the 
achievement of the UN Sustainable Development Goals. 
On page 18 of this report we highlight where G4S is 
helping to advance these goals and make a positive 
difference to society and communities around the world. 
We expect all colleagues to uphold G4S’ values in 
whatever role they play. In return, our commitment  
is to provide meaningful work, fair reward and the 
opportunity to develop. Our employees often work  
in inherently hazardous environments and we equip  
and train our employees to ensure they are as safe  
as possible.
We regularly ask stakeholders from inside and outside 
the company to provide input into an analysis of our 
material CSR issues to help set priorities. See page 83 
for more information on the CSR materiality review  
that was undertaken in 2017.
Our CSR approach covers a broad range of areas,  
with three material priorities: health and safety, human 
rights and anti-bribery and corruption.
In June 2017, G4S was selected as a constituent 
company of the FTSE4Good Index, recognising our 
strong commitment to social responsibility and 
sustainable business practices.

Culture – Embedding our values
Underpinning our culture are the Group’s values which 
govern and guide the conduct of everyone at G4S.
Employee‑communication programme
Following the launch of our values in March 2016 we 
conducted an extensive employee engagement 
programme to raise awareness and deepen understanding 
of G4S’ corporate values. We have developed a training 
programme for managers and our values are an essential 
part of induction and training for new employees. We are 
embedding our values into existing processes, governing 
all aspects of our business including sales, operations and 
performance management. Where actions are required 
– for example, an improvement in the safety performance 
of a particular business – leaders and managers will have 
specific objectives in order to make sure the actions are 
prioritised appropriately (see Key Performance Indicators 
page 32).
Speak Out
We continue to encourage colleagues to “Speak Out” if 
they are aware of behaviour which is not consistent with 
our values or policies. There are many ways in which 
colleagues can raise concerns, with supervisors or 
managers, with their local HR team or through the 
global, independent whistleblowing systems. Our case 
management system provides improved visibility of 
whistleblowing cases from across the Group, and 
provides vital information to our Group Ethics  
Steering Committee.
I believe that the conduct of the vast majority of our 
employees is consistent with our values and that this has 
been – and remains – the cornerstone of our customer 
service and commercial success. We know, however, 
that even isolated instances of poor conduct are 
unacceptable and can be very damaging. It is therefore 
important that we continue to promote good conduct 
and the use of Speak Out.
Health & Safety
The wellbeing and safety of our employees and those in  
our care remains a key priority for the Group executive 
and global leadership teams. We work in an inherently 
hazardous industry: we travel extensively and many of 
our colleagues are trained and deployed to protect our 
customers and their property. As a result, road-traffic 
accidents and criminal attacks are inherent risks we face 
in delivering some of our services. We have therefore 
invested in a sustained programme to strengthen our 
health and safety policies, practices and training 
performance across the Group with the aim of 
improving safety.
The number of road-traffic fatalities has decreased  
by 48% since 2013 when the first G4S road-safety 
programme was launched. There has also been a 
reduction in attack-related fatalities in our Cash 
Solutions businesses. However, the number of armed 
attacks has not changed and so we continue to work 
with the relevant authorities to mitigate the elevated  
risk in some of our services. Sadly, during 2017, 25 of 
our colleagues lost their lives in work-related accidents 
and attacks, compared with 47 fatalities in 2016.
Chief Executive’s review continued
Although we are pleased that there are clear signs of an 
overall cultural shift within G4S in our approach to safety we 
also know that there is more to do and our plans reflect this. 
We are firmly committed to improving our health and safety 
performance and our goal remains zero harm.
CUSTOMERS AND SERVICE 
EXCELLENCE
In both Secure Solutions and Cash 
Solutions we have been investing  
in innovative products and service 
excellence, to grow the business 
with new contracts for new and 
existing customers, and to improve customer retention, 
which averages around 90%, reflecting our exit from some 
low-margin contracts and retaining some of the Group’s 
largest contracts in 2017 – as discussed in this report.
TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION
Increasingly our customer offering 
includes technology in the form  
of systems and software. 
Technology-related security 
revenues were £2.45 billion 
(2016: £2.2 billion) in 2017.
Overall we won new business with an annual contract 
value of £1.4 billion and total contract value of £2.5 
billion in 2017.
OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE 
AND PRODUCTIVITY
In 2017, our operational 
excellence and productivity 
programmes delivered further 
benefits, providing the Group 
with the financial flexibility to 
invest in service and product 
development as well as improving the Group’s adjusted 
profit before interest, tax and amortisation (Adjusted 
PBITA) from core businesses by 4.2% to £496 million.
With our more focused business designed around 
service delivery, there is further opportunity to 
streamline general and administrative processes and 
share resources to generate greater efficiency. The 
Secure Solutions, Global Cash Solutions and Care & 
Justice Services segments will share facilities, 
infrastructure and functional services. Our detailed  
plans will enable us to begin implementing changes  
and to realise the first phase of these benefits  
during 2018 and 2019.
One example of where we are introducing more 
streamlined processes is in our manned security business 
with a new lean-business process called “Javelin” (see 
page 29), which combines HR, operations, finance and 
back-office functions, and should ensure we schedule our 
people more efficiently and are able to reduce the time 
between when we do the work and when we bill for it, 
and provide accurate and timely management information 
to customers. Javelin was launched in Ireland in 
November 2017 and we will be commencing 
implementation in the UK during 2018.

See page 44 for the basis of results of core 
businesses and an explanation of Alternative 
Performance measures is on page 35.
FINANCIAL AND COMMERCIAL 
DISCIPLINE
The new capital and contract 
processes we introduced in 2013 
are helping us to apply capital  
with greater consistency and 
rigour. Strengthening our working 
capital management was also a priority for our finance 
and line management in 2017 and we have maintained 
the increased weighting of operating cash flow in our  
annual incentive plans. I am pleased to report that at  
31 December 2017, our net debt to Adjusted EBITDA 
had reduced to 2.4x, down from 2.8x at the end of 2016.
Portfolio programme
The portfolio programme we announced in 2013 
has materially improved our strategic focus and the 
programme is substantially complete. Since 2013 we 
have divested 41 businesses (with annual revenues  
of c.£1.3 billion and Adjusted PBITA of £46 million), 
realising gross proceeds of approximately £520 million. 
In 2017 we closed four businesses and sold a further 
nine, realising gross proceeds of £166 million.
Performance
Statutory results
Revenue growth was 3.1% and earnings per share rose 
by 18.8%. A more detailed review of the statutory 
results can be found on page 38, and a reconciliation  
to results from core businesses is provided on page 44.
Core business performance
Supported by the continuous investment in sales and 
business development resource and new technology-
enabled services, revenues rose by 3.2% to £7.4 billion. 
Consistent with the commercial practice we adopted 
several years ago, we have continued to be very 
disciplined on contract bidding and, whilst this 
constrained revenue growth in some markets, it 
underpins sustained profitable growth. The combination 
of growing revenues and improved productivity saw the 
Group’s adjusted earnings per share rise by 5.9% to 17.9 
pence per share. In 2017 the Group generated operating 
cashflow of 106% of Adjusted PBITA (2016: 133%).
Net debt
Growth in profits and robust cash flow generation, 
together with net disposal proceeds of £156 million, 
helped reduce the Group’s net debt to Adjusted 
EBITDA to 2.4x (2016: 2.8x) in line with our plans.
Market Environment
The global demand outlook for security services remains 
positive as we outline in more detail on pages 8 and 9. 
We expect this positive demand to continue around the 
world in 2018 with the possible exception of the Middle 
East where the effect of prevailing fiscal and macro-
economic conditions remains uncertain.
In the UK & Ireland region, the Brexit negotiations have 
created some uncertainty around UK GDP growth, but, 
in this market, we believe G4S is a defensive business, 
with a number of long-term contracts. We continue to 
invest in innovative products and services for customers 
to drive growth in the region.
Outlook
The outlook for the Group is positive. G4S’ strong 
market positions, growing technology-enabled revenues, 
positive cash generation, commercial discipline and 
on-going productivity programmes provide substantial 
confidence that the Group is very well positioned to 
deliver a strong performance over the next three years. 
To realise this potential G4S is investing in:
• Sales, technology and new products, services  
and solutions to support our aim of growing 
revenues from core businesses by an average of 
4-6% per annum
• Restructuring and efficiency programmes to deliver 
recurring operating gains of £70 million to 
£80 million by 2020, through efficient organisation 
design and leaner processes. Additional refinancing 
gains of around £20 million are also anticipated by 
2020. A portion of these gains will be re-invested in 
growth, with the majority expected to benefit the 
bottom line
We intend to remain soundly financed with average 
operating cash flow conversion of more than 100% of 
Adjusted PBITA and a net debt to Adjusted EBITDA 
ratio of less than 2.5x. Priorities for excess cash will be 
investment, dividends and, in the near term, further 
leverage reduction.
Following the achievement of the Group’s leverage-
reduction target, the directors propose a 5% increase in 
the final dividend to 6.11p (DKK 0.5097) reflecting the 
board’s confidence in the Group’s performance and 
prospects. Our policy is to increase the dividend in line 
with the long-term growth in earnings.
Our customers and our colleagues are at the core of

Strategic report
Integrated Report and Accounts 2017 G4S plc 7 The world continues to face a series 
of divergent and emerging threats. 
Governments and companies require 
holistic approaches to ensure the 
security of their people and assets 
both at home and abroad.
Third-party commentators such as Freedonia expect 
the global security industry to grow 5-6% per annum 
from 2015 to 2025 (see chart on page 9). With our 
global footprint and attractive array of products and 
services we are well positioned to meet this increased 
demand.
Demand for security is increasing 
across the globe
The evolving nature of terrorism, 
which continues to threaten 
societies, has elevated security  
risks and concerns in many parts  
of the world.
Intense price‑based competition 
in basic manned security and basic 
equipment installations
Barriers to entry in basic manned 
security and basic equipment 
installations are low, which can 
result in intense competition in 
some markets.
Companies like G4S are therefore 
looking for ways to increase 
differentiation such as global breadth 
or technology and productivity 
improvement to offset price 
pressure.
Customers buying processes 
increasingly complex
The increasing use of technology, 
globalisation and the growing threat 
of cyber security breaches mean that 
the procurement of security services 
has moved away from operations to 
a more strategic role in an increasing 
number of customers’ organisations. 
The global market for security 
systems integration is estimated  
to be $80bn by 2021
a
.
Technology reshaping security 
industry
Whilst labour costs have increased 
or are increasing, particularly in 
developed markets, the cost of 
sophisticated security technology  
is reducing. Combined with the 
additional data and assurance that 
comes with technology, it is starting 
to reshape the security industry.
MARKET-GROWTH 
DRIVERS
Market‑growth drivers
MEETING THE DEMAND
Global cash‑usage trends
According to third party research 
firm RBR London, cash withdrawn 
from automated teller machines 
(ATMs) between 2016 and 2021 is 
expected to grow by more than 6% 
per annum in emerging markets and 
between 0 to 1% per annum in 
developed markets.
Network consolidation
With lower cash volumes in some 
markets together with new higher 
value added services partly 
cannibalising traditional cash-in-
transit services, it is likely that some, 
if not all cash markets will 
experience network consolidation. 
A number of industry participants 
have publicly stated that they are 
looking to make acquisitions, and we 
have sold some cash businesses to 
focus on our key markets with 
stronger growth potential. We 
believe this market consolidation will 
help network efficiency and lower 
the cost of cash handling.
Retail opportunities
In many markets, retailers operate in 
very competitive environments and 
are looking to reduce costs including 
cash handling and to free up idle 
cash sitting in tills, safes, vehicles and 
cash-processing centres.
G4S software and service enhanced 
smart safes and cash recycling 
services can reduce shrinkage costs 
for retailers, and eliminate or reduce 
the space required for a cash back 
office and cash reconciliation teams.
Through recycling the majority of 
cash takings in store, the number  
of cash-in-transit journeys can be 
reduced by 40% to 60% – with  
both cost-saving and environmental 
benefits.
As more cash is recycled in store, 
less cash is being processed by the 
banks so the retailers achieve a 
reduction in banking fees.

Supplier consolidation 
In certain markets (both Manned 
Services and Systems) we have seen 
some market consolidation and 
trends whereby large competitors 
aim to provide multi-service 
bundled and integrated solutions. 
Some competitors have followed 
this trend to differentiate away from 
the commoditised manned security 
market. We believe this may be 
helping customers move to more 
technology-focused solutions. 
Technology-enabled solutions is  
a less commoditised market than 
traditional manned security  
markets with a lower number  
of capable suppliers. 
HOW G4S RESPONDS
Our new products are being 
adopted by banks and some of the 
world’s leading retailers and we 
expect this market will continue to 
grow strongly. Industry research 
data indicates that our addressable 
market for smart safes and recycling 
solutions is around £20bn-25bn  
per annum
b
.
Automated processes inside bank 
branches
Banks and financial institutions are 
also under pressure to be more 
efficient, lower the cost of handling 
cash, reduce their branch network 
whilst maintaining customer access 
and service. 
We have been developing 
integrated technology to address  
these areas. They combine 
hardware, proprietary cash-
management software, real-time 
banking integration, same day credit 
and customer service and support.
• We assist customers in evaluating 
and understanding security 
trends and their risks through 
experience in the market and the 
provision of software tools such 
as Risk360 and TravelAware. Key 
trends are featured in G4S Risk 
Consulting publications.
• G4S has been investing in 
productivity programmes to  
be more efficient and cost 
competitive (see page 29).
• G4S designs, builds, operates and 
maintains integrated security 
solutions. We invest in 
technology and innovation which 
is changing our sales mix, helping 
deliver service excellence to 
customers (see pages 24 to 28).
• We provide cash solutions and 
services that materially improve 
the control and efficiency of our 
customers’ cash handling. We 
continue to invest in innovative 
products and services such as 
CASH360, Deposita and 
bank-branch automation.
• With the significant progress 
made in some areas of the 
business, we have an enormous 
opportunity to extend and grow 
our new technology and services 
right across our global markets.
• At the end of December 2017 
we had over 19,500 (2016: 
14,600) cash technology 
installations deployed in North 
America, Europe, Asia Pacific  
and Africa.
• We have also made great 
progress in improving 
productivity in a number  
of markets and we now have  
the opportunity to apply these 
improvements across all of  
our cash businesses.

Attracting and retaining the best people
Attracting and retaining the best people continues to 
give G4S a competitive advantage as well as ensuring  
we deliver the best results for our customers. For our 
senior population, we know from our management 
survey that the most important factor influencing their 
decision to join and then to stay at G4S is the nature  
of the roles and the responsibilities on offer. Our global 
footprint and operations across a range of product and 
service lines helps make the business attractive to the 
best candidates. Once appointed, the responsibility, 
complexity and opportunities for innovation help retain 
our senior people and keep them motivated.
For other levels in the organisation, we have developed 
two toolkits which help us attract and retain colleagues 
by utilising our expertise and sharing resources across 
the Group. The first relates to recruitment and is 
designed to ensure potential candidates for jobs with 
G4S have a positive recruitment experience while going 
through an efficient and effective hiring process. The 
second provides guidance on good retention practices. 
Both toolkits are online and contain templates that are 
easy to follow and adopt. They emphasise the 
importance of ensuring applicants know what will be 
expected before they apply, and if they do join G4S 
there are robust processes in place to welcome, induct, 
train and support them. Feedback from our most recent 
global employee survey suggests that our employees 
feel well equipped to perform their role, with over 90% 
of respondents stating they understand their job 
procedures. Often employee turnover is at its highest  
in the initial months after appointment, which suggests 
there is still more to do to retain our newest colleagues.
In order to build our reputation as a good employer and 
attract candidates from the widest talent pools, 
With around 570,000 people, G4S is one of 
the world’s largest private sector employers.  
Our employees and services touch the lives of 
others every day, providing crucial services to  
keep them safe and secure. Our success is 
therefore underpinned by the way we attract, 
develop and engage with our people, as well  
as the culture and values that shape the way 
we work and how our colleagues carry out 
their roles.
2017 ACHIEVEMENTS
Our strategy continued
CREATING THE RIGHT CULTURE
 
The G4S values are embedded in the standards, 
policies and guidance which we set out to help 
employees and managers perform.
To help our front-line operational employees understand the 
behaviours we expect, and the decisions they should take in 
line with our values, we have launched a range of learning 
and awareness materials. These materials include an 
animated video, scenario-based flashcards, presentations and 
an online exercise. The materials draw on over 90 scenarios 
from all product and service lines and are designed to 
promote discussion and to guide behaviour in line with our 
values. They address topics like harassment, bribery and 
corruption, the care and treatment of others, breaches of 
health and safety rules and inappropriate use of social media. 
To ensure these materials remain relevant we will continue 
to add different scenarios whenever new values-based 
operational situations are identified which can help guide  
our employees.
Work is now underway on values training materials for our 
managers, using our newly revised competency framework. 
In line with our values, this refreshed framework defines 
leadership and management behaviours in terms of how 
managers should act today, plan for tomorrow, and build 
relationships. The framework is used in our selection 
processes as well as our 360 degree review process to  
assess performance and future potential. It enables us  
16 G4S plc Integrated Report and Accounts 2017 to gather insight into what colleagues have achieved as well  
as whether they have done so in a way which is consistent 
with our values.
While having a common set of values helps set G4S apart 
from the competition, as a global employer we also 
appreciate that having a diverse workforce enables us to 
better understand our differing customer needs, and 
harnessing this diversity is critical to driving innovation. 
Feedback from our latest global employee survey indicates 
that 84% of employees who responded believe that the 
company values people from different backgrounds, and in 
2018 we will continue our focus on diversity to ensure we 
maximise the benefits it brings.
Integrity and Respect
Our business activities and relationships 
are built on trust, honesty and 
openness. We deliver on the promises 
we make and treat our colleagues, 
customers and those in our care with 
the utmost respect.
Safety, Security and Service Excellence
We work in a safe way and take  
great care to protect our colleagues 
and customers from harm. We are 
experts in security and use that 
knowledge to protect our customers’ 
most valuable assets. We are 
passionate about delivering high  
levels of customer service.
Innovation and Teamwork
We invest in technology and best 
practice to improve continually  
our service offering. We challenge 
ourselves to find new ways of helping 
our customers.
We work together as a team to achieve 
the best results for our customers and 
our business. Everyone has a valid 
opinion and their contribution  
is valued.
Our values are the standards we set for ourselves and they are 
reflected in the culture of our organisation through our 
behaviours and actions.
OUR VALUES
countries and regions adopt different approaches to 
diversity, reaching out to recruit from under-represented 
groups in their businesses. In North America, the 
recruitment of veterans who bring relevant skills and an 
inherent understanding of security risks continues, whilst 
in the UK our businesses are some of the few in the 
security sector to have been awarded Disability 
Confident level 2 status as a result of their commitment 
to identify and remove barriers which impact on the 
employment of people with disabilities.
Overall employee retention continues to improve with 
voluntary employee turnover reducing to 25.3% (2016: 
27.6%) as closer scrutiny and the implementation of 
good retention practices help us improve performance 
even in tight labour markets. This is good for service to 
our customers, who appreciate working with staff who 
know them better and have more experience. While 
our employee headcount has reduced from 585,000  
to 570,000 as a result of our portfolio management 
programme and our drive to improve organisational 
efficiency, wherever possible we redeploy people and 
retain their skills and knowledge. For our front-line 
employees, the launch of a new values related global 
recognition programme will add a further opportunity  
to showcase the amazing work they do for our 
customers each and every day. Ensuring we celebrate 
success, and share information about the ways in which 
our employees behave in line with our values, not only 
helps to bring our values to life but also promotes the 
expertise and capabilities of our people.
In March 2018, we published our UK Gender Pay  
Gap Report for the relevant UK businesses. As well  
as explaining the reasons for any gaps, the report also 
sets out the actions we are taking to achieve the 
progress required as part of our wider diversity and 
inclusion strategy.

Building capability
Building industry-leading capability is at the heart of our 
people strategy. We want employees at G4S to have 
the opportunity to flourish and grow so that they can 
contribute to the future success of the organisation.  
There are many examples of local development 
programmes which enhance the security and technology 
expertise in our organisation.
For example, in 2017 the G4S Academy was launched 
in Denmark and has provided a structured approach  
to skills development and accreditation in line with 
industry standards.
Wage inflation
In a number of markets, especially developed regions 
such as North America and the UK, economic indicators 
have highlighted an increase in wage inflation – as a 
result of tightening labour markets in some areas and 
as a result of increases in minimum or living wages. 
As a long-established global employer, G4S has many 
years of experience of managing periods of wage 
inflation. We have to be prepared to negotiate price 
increases with customers and to look for ways to 
continue to be more productive and cost effective. For 
example, we believe this trend is helping to drive more 
revenue towards integrated solutions, where G4S has a 
competitive advantage and barriers to entry are higher.

DEFINING OUR SOCIETAL IMPACT
We play an important role in society. Through 
its services and organisation, G4S delivers a 
broad range of significant and far‑reaching social 
and economic benefits to the communities in 
which we work, many of which are helping to 
realise the United Nations Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDGs).
• We create employment opportunities, and invest in and 
develop our employees. We directly benefit them and 
our suppliers through the salaries, benefits and payments 
we make for goods and services.
• In our Care & Justice operations, we develop innovative 
programmes to rehabilitate offenders and provide them 
with the encouragement and skills needed to help them 
rebuild their lives once released.
• We deliver a wide range of specialist security services 
that mitigate the risk or impact of criminal behaviour  
and help to create safer and more stable communities.
• Our colleagues work with governments and non-
governmental organisations in high-risk environments 
such as former conflict areas, to support humanitarian, 
stabilisation and economic-reconstruction efforts.
• Our focus on safety has helped reduce the risk of injury 
and fatality.
• We encourage industry standards to be raised. By 
embedding our policies and practices into less developed 
regions, as well as by supporting new approaches such as 
the Ethical Employment Partnership or the International 
Code of Conduct for Private Security Providers, we have 
helped to improve industry standards around the world.
The SDGs call upon businesses to advance sustainable 
development through the investments they make, the 
solutions they develop, and the practices they adopt. In this 
report, we have mapped case studies against the SDGs to 
highlight where G4S is helping to advance the SDGs through 
our programmes and operations.

Our strategy continued Regional Leadership Programme
On a Group-wide basis, our efforts are focused on 
developing the next generation of leaders, primarily 
through our flagship Regional Leadership Programme, 
which is devised centrally but delivered locally so that it 
is tailored to meet our diverse needs. The Programme 
offers high-potential individuals, in a range of line, 
functional and business-development roles, the 
opportunity to enhance their knowledge and strengthen 
their leadership skills. So far 90 employees have 
graduated from the programme, and a further 59 are 
already on course to do so in 2018.
Talent reviews
Annual talent reviews and quarterly talent exchange 
discussions are helping to identify potential candidates 
for future regional programmes early and are ensuring 
career opportunities are more widely available to 
employees across the Group.
Broadening use of training and development materials
Whilst our investment in training and development has 
to be highly focused, we are doing more to promote 
the use of materials we already have available to build 
wider capability across the entire management 
population. For example, in 2017 we launched a 
16-week development programme containing relevant 
materials such as articles, assessments, online exercises 
and e-books relating to a number of specific topics such 
as change management, delegation and coaching skills. 
The programme is currently running, with thousands of 
employees subscribing. As learning technology evolves, 
our ability to provide access to materials in a more 
flexible and bite-sized way, to suit our busy managers, is 
increasing. For example, for specific functions like Sales 
and Business Development, we are establishing on-line 
academies which will help employees identify their own 
development gaps and navigate the materials available 
to find those best suited to meet their needs.
Recruiting and developing women
Recruiting and developing women into line-management 
roles for our operations remains a challenge across the 
Group as well as the security industry as a whole. We 
actively monitor our gender balance and were pleased 
that in 2017 an independent business-led review 
supported by UK Government (the Hampton-Alexander 
Review) showed G4S as the top performing company  
in the business services sector in the FTSE 100. There is 
more to do in this area and as part of our wider diversity 
and inclusion strategy we have identified a number of 
actions to help us to continue to make progress.
Engaging for success
We are in no doubt that having well-trained, engaged 
and motivated employees helps us to deliver for our 
customers and make G4S a success. Consequently,  
we invest a lot of time and effort in listening to our 
employees’ views and responding to their feedback.  
We do this in a variety of ways including direct dialogue, 
consultation forums and our employee survey.  
To ensure the survey is accessible to all employees,  
it is offered in over 40 languages and three formats 
(paper, online and mobile). Engagement levels for senior 
managers were also tested in a separate survey targeted 
at the leadership team. Response rates for both surveys 
remained high in 2017. In the case of the global 
engagement survey in 2017 the response rate at 73% 
was at the same level as 2015 and for the leadership 
survey was higher at 87%, compared with 85% in 2015. 
Feedback from the global survey helps identify what 
businesses need to stop doing, start doing and continue 
to do to improve levels of employee engagement.  
The feedback from the management survey showed 
improvements in almost every area, suggesting high 
levels of confidence and support for the business 
strategy, our values and the executive team.

Safety, Security and Service Excellence
SDGs: 
Every G4S employee has a responsibility to ensure that we 
uphold our core values, adhere to the law and deliver against 
the important commitments set out in our business ethics 
policy and ethics code.
Speak Out, our global whistleblowing system, is a key 
method of ensuring that we maintain a high standard of 
ethics, respect and integrity.
Speak Out is hosted by an independent specialist hotline  
and case management provider. It enables every employee 
to report concerns that they may have about the behaviour 
of individuals, or the business operations, which they feel 
contravene the ethics code or our core values. We 
encourage any employee who wishes to raise a matter of 
ethical concern to contact the free telephone hotline or 
make a report online. Both channels are available 24 hours  
a day, seven days a week, and are completely confidential.

Union representation
Our union and employee representative forums at global 
level are via the global union UNI, and the GMB, with 
whom we signed an Ethical Employment Partnership in 
2008. At a European level we have a well-established 
European Works Council and at a local level there are  
a number of union recognition agreements in place. 
Working together with our recognised unions helps us 
raise standards both internally and, where appropriate, 
across the wider industry and identify potential problems 
early and address them constructively.
Promoting the right organisational culture
During 2017, 300 cases were raised by colleagues via 
Speak Out, our global whistleblowing system. This was 
25% fewer than the previous year, but detailed analysis 
shows that employee grievances are being reported and 
handled more effectively via other channels. We believe 
it is very important that employees feel confident to 
speak out confidentially to ensure standards are met  
to protect people. All cases reported to Speak Out  
are reviewed and are directed to the most appropriate 
channel for action.
The majority of matters raised via Speak Out are 
grievances which are transferred to the relevant HR 
department, as they are best placed to investigate and 
resolve the matter promptly. Concerns regarding 
operational procedures are investigated by local 
management to ensure that relevant standards are 
being followed.
Anti-bribery and corruption 
Investigations relating to other matters, such as  
bribery, ethical or financial issues, are conducted  
by our internal network of investigators or by 
independent experts.
Matters of a serious nature are investigated at a senior 
and independent level, with 59 investigations completed 
during 2017.
The Group Ethics Steering committee has continued  
to oversee implementation of our whistleblowing policy, 
case management of whistleblowing reports, and to 
conduct regular reviews of serious cases, the 
investigations’ progress and the resulting actions.

PEOPLE AND VALUES
20 G4S plc Integrated Report and Accounts 2017
Our strategy continued Improving health and safety
The safety of our employees and those in our care is 
one of our key priorities.
To enable us to keep our customers and the 
communities we serve safe, we must prioritise the 
safety as well as the health and wellbeing of our 
employees. It is our responsibility to ensure that our 
colleagues return home from work safely every day.
The nature of our work and the environments we 
operate in mean that safety and security present a 
strategic risk to our business. We believe that setting the 
highest standards for health and safety across our 
industry helps keep our colleagues safe and builds loyalty 
and commitment to G4S among our employees. 
Leading by example and having expertise in health and 
safety gives employees, customers and stakeholders 
confidence that we will work in a safe way.
We recognise that our businesses operate in different 
contexts and face varying levels of risk. All businesses 
within the Group are required to meet a set of core 
health and safety standards. We must make sure that 
we are constantly learning and continuously enhancing 
our processes, in order to continue to keep colleagues 
safe despite a changing environment.
Compliance is monitored via audits and reviews of 
performance at regional, group and board level via the 
CSR committee. Health and safety is included in Group 
Internal Audit’s scope as part of non-financial risks.
During 2017 we have:
• Continued to improve the performance of 
businesses which have had multiple fatalities. Serious 
incidents have reduced by 37% in these businesses 
since 2015
• Introduced a reporting and tracking process for those 
incidents which have the potential to result in a 
fatality, and increased the coverage of our injury 
reporting to 98% of businesses
• Reviewed our front-line health and safety induction 
training and drafted a mandatory syllabus
• Revised the G4S Golden Rules of Safety
Sadly, during 2017, 25 of our colleagues lost their lives 
in work-related accidents. On a comparative basis this is 
a reduction from 47 fatalities in 2016. The number of 
road-traffic fatalities has decreased by 48% since 2013, 
when the first road-safety programme was launched.
While the number of attack-related fatalities decreased 
in our Cash Solutions businesses, this has not been due 
to a reduction in the number of armed attacks. The 
businesses continue to work with the relevant authorities 
to introduce new procedures and improved controls.
During 2017 the Group’s lost time injury incidence rate 
was 6.7 per 1,000 employees (98% of businesses 
reporting). This compares with a rate of 7.7 in 2016 
(96% of business reporting).
There were three non-natural deaths in custody in 
2017. All deaths in custody are investigated by the 
relevant authorities to determine the cause of death. 
One of the incidents was due to self harm. 
Pronouncements will be made by the relevant coroner 
on the two remaining incidents following their 
investigations. In 2016, we disclosed a death in custody 
which was later pronounced as due to unintentional 
drug overdose by the coroner.
Respecting human rights
We are proud of our role in society and of the positive 
contribution we make to the realisation of human rights 
through the range of services we offer and the standards 
which we apply.
However, we also recognise that we have a duty to 
ensure that we are not at risk of violating human rights 
through the services we provide, the customers we 
work with, the suppliers we use, or through the 
treatment of our own employees and others who  
are in our care.
G4S’ human rights policy and its related framework  
are based upon the UN Guiding Principles on Business 
and Human Rights. Alongside our values of Integrity  
and Respect, the framework reinforces the continued 
development of a business model which aids the 
realisation of the Sustainable Development Goals 
through the improvement of industry standards, 
employment opportunities and helping to create  
secure and stable communities.
By having clear values and standards, and educating  
and training colleagues to uphold them, we are creating 
a positive culture which means our colleagues can be 
trusted to do the right thing and behave in a way which 
meets our standards. In cases where colleagues are 
deemed not to have upheld those standards, we 
undertake swift, thorough and impartial investigations 
into the causes of such behaviour and take appropriate 
action to remedy them. In addition to this resulting in 
consequences for the individual or individuals concerned, 
we learn from such instances and enhance our 
safeguards to prevent similar issues arising in the future.

Strategic report
Integrated Report and Accounts 2017 G4S plc 21 The standards set by our human rights policy have 
been embedded into our business policies and 
processes, such as our ethics policy, HR core 
standards, and the group risk and compliance systems. 
For example, investment proposals are assessed on 
whether they can be achieved in line with our 
company values and standards, as well as on the basis 
of appropriate operational delivery, commercial risk 
and financial return.
During 2017, we have:
• Developed and implemented a human rights 
awareness programme for senior managers, 
beginning with the Group Internal Audit department.
• Conducted 65 human rights control self-assessments 
of businesses operating in high-risk countries.
• Commenced a programme of internal audits of 
human rights controls of businesses in high-risk 
countries, carrying out audits in 2017.
• Assessed operational and other business issues 
against our ‘risk universe’, such as human rights  
and other CSR risks.
• Published our first slavery and human-trafficking 
statement, setting out the actions we have taken 
to help prevent modern slavery within our 
business and supply chain, including the 
development and implementation of our Supplier 
Code of Conduct and our migrant worker policy 
(g4s.com/modernslavery).
• Updated our Supplier Code of Conduct
• Commissioned an independent review of Brook

of detainees by employees (see page 82).

G4S has operated Mount Gambier Prison since 1995 and 
in September 2017 was awarded a new five-year contract 
which includes an option of a further term of up to five years. 
Mount Gambier Prison, the only privately-run prison in 
South Australia, is a medium-security men’s prison with 
a capacity of 493 beds. Taking over as general manager at 
the prison is the previous deputy director for G4S-managed 
HM Prison Rye Hill in the UK.
As the new contract begins, the team will be developing 
new partnerships with the local community. These will 
include support services and technology partners. 
Rehabilitation and reintegration services will be provided, 
as well as programmes aiming to reduce prisoners’ risks of 
reoffending, thus supporting the Government’s policy to 
achieve a 10% reduction by 2020 and aiding reintegration 
back into the community. The prison’s management team 
will also continue to work alongside the State on the planned 
expansion of the facility, engaging with the community 
and providing significant employment opportunities 
in the region.

Positive demand for security services
We believe that the long-term demand for our services 
remains positive, and we expect to grow revenues on 
average by around 4% to 6% per annum over the 
medium term. We continue to sustain contract retention 
rates of around 90%, have won substantial new business, 
and more than replenished our sales pipeline together 
with an improved quality of opportunities.
Large diversified customer base and sales pipeline
One of the strengths of the Group is the diversified 
nature of its contracts and sales pipeline. Our pipeline  
is diversified by service, geography and customer. Our 
150,000 customers are spread across many different 
types and customer segment. At the end of December 
2017, we had won new business with an annual 
contract value of £1.4 billion and total contract value  
of £2.5 billion.
Our sales pipeline has grown despite an increased 
emphasis on pipeline qualification, ensuring we focus on 
the best opportunities and improve our win rate. As the 
Group has invested in innovative products and services, 
we also see an improvement in the quality of the sales 
pipeline in terms of more technology-related, longer-

2017 ACHIEVEMENTS
Using G4S-owned AMAG technology, Yale University, one  
of the world’s best-known and oldest Ivy League institutions, 
has carried out, almost unnoticed, a full scale upgrade of its 
access-control and site security system across 350 main 
campus buildings.
Securing a prestigious university in a busy urban area 
presents particular challenges. High expectations by 
students, parents and staff, combined with modern security 
and environmental factors, demanded an exceptional 
security solution.
The innovative AMAG approach was to use their Symmetry 
SR Retrofit System, which is designed so that the customer 
can use their existing wiring and card readers to avoid a 
disruptive, prolonged, expensive and complex upgrade and 
without damage to the historic Yale buildings. This unique 
“plug and play” design allowed Yale to replace old 
controllers with Symmetry SR Controllers, and provides 
Yale with a range of advanced integration options so  
that additional security measures can be added if and  
when required.

management
Since 2013, we have invested in sales leadership, sales 
and service training, customer relationships, account 
management and a mandatory sales management 
system. Our understanding of customer requirements 
has increasingly resulted in opportunities to sell more 
technology-enabled solutions. This is particularly the 
case in developed markets, where higher wages and 
lower hardware costs have made technology solutions 
more cost-effective.
We have also invested in capturing global customer 
opportunities, which has delivered success by winning 
new work or new customers such as Bank of America 
(see case study overleaf).
Net promoter score and contract retention
Since 2016, we have embarked on a group-wide Net 
Promoter Score (NPS) survey process with existing 
customers. In 2017, using automated survey tools, we 
doubled the number of surveys conducted, with over 
24,000 surveys, including our top 20 customers in most 
countries, conducted successfully in 29 languages and 
we improved NPS scores in most countries compared 
with 2016. 
Since 2016, G4S has been providing detailed risk and threat 
assessment as well as an integrated solution and unified

26 G4S plc Integrated Report and Accounts 2017 Investing in world‑leading proprietary products  
and services
In our Secure Solutions segment, we continue to invest 
in product and service innovation combined with sales 
and operational support in the following areas:
• Software tools including evidence-based risk 
assessment, incident management and travel advisory 
systems such as RISK360. For example, a global 
financial organisation used RISK360 to reduce 
incident reporting time by 50%.
• Proprietary security systems such as Symmetry 
Connect access control systems (see Yale case study 
on page 24) and visitor management systems.
Technology-related security revenues are now  
£2.45 billion.
Cash solutions – Retail Solutions, bank‑branch 
automation
For our financial and retail customers, we have 
developed a number of innovative and efficient services. 
We have over 19,500 cash technology installations, 
often combined with our software and managed service 
and have a strong and growing pipeline:
• Automated cash solutions for retailers – this 
bespoke solution covers smart safes and cash 
recyclers, including our own Deposita equipment  
in emerging markets through to full cash 
management automation solutions for some  
of the world’s largest retailers.
• Automated bulk-teller solution for banks – the 
Deposita solution of hardware, proprietary  
software and managed service is also being used  
in bank branches.
• Mobile banking service – due to the increase in 
electronic payments and internet banking, traditional 
bank branch usage has declined in some markets, 
resulting in bank branch closures. However, the 
banks recognise the value of personal interaction 
with customers and so in some developed and 
emerging markets G4S has launched a mobile 
banking service using the skills and fleet of our 
traditional cash-in-transit business in a more 
integrated and innovative way.
ACTIONS FOR 2018
• Improve cross-market innovation and growth
• Continue to drive market penetration of 
integrated security solutions
• Build on our market leadership in cash 
automation services with more customers  
in more markets
• Continue to invest in innovative and efficient 
services for customers
• Cross-selling and up-selling within and  
across markets
• Continued investment in people, technology, 
software and systems

Strategic report
Integrated Report and Accounts 2017 G4S plc 27 Our strategy continued
OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE AND PRODUCTIVITY
More focused business – cultural change
Historically a significant part of the Group’s strategy  
and development was growth through bolt-on 
acquisitions and, in many cases, these acquisitions were 
not fully integrated into the Group. With the Group 
offering many services in a large number of countries, 
this resulted in an inefficient organisation, with many 
management layers built up over time, resulting in 
inefficiency and lack of accountability.
The Group is now more focused, on two core business 
segments, and we are implementing programmes to 
ensure our organisation and operational costs are just  
as focused – with support functions as shared-service 
centres. This requires a substantial cultural change in  
the organisation and has to be done methodically  
and properly.
Reinvesting for growth
A significant proportion of the gains we have made  
from our efficiency programmes have been reinvested 
in the business to improve governance, increase the 
opportunities for growth as well as in processes to drive 
further efficiency. We have increasing confidence in 
being able to deliver further efficiencies as outlined  
in the “programme progress table opposite” and we 
expect the majority of these will increasingly flow 
through to the bottom line.
Efficient organisation design and management 
de‑layering
Following benchmarking in 130 business units across 
90 countries in 2017, we have begun delayering the 
management frameworks in the business and are now 
working to have more efficient regional, functional and 
operational frameworks as follows:
Procurement and property
The Group procurement team has continued driving its 
activities throughout the different regions with a category-
focused and regionally-deployed strategic approach.
Key areas of improvement included supplier base 
rationalisation, standardisation of procurement 
processes and demand management, renegotiation  
of payment terms and the delivery of savings across all 
categories. Globally, in 2017, the team delivered over 
1,300
re‑negotiations  
with suppliers

annum by 2020

2017 ACHIEVEMENTS
Hinkley Point C will be the first nuclear plant to be built in 
the UK in over 20 years. The build project will last ten years 
and involves a high level of complexity and risk, with over 
5,600 workers on site. G4S will be providing an integrated-
security solution covering physical security and facilities 
management, access control, CCTV, RISK360, control room, 
vetting, incident response – command & control, contractor 
on-boarding, risk audits and protester management.

New procurement tools were implemented to provide 
more efficient and controlled procurement, such as the 
tool rolled out in the UK to manage the procurement  
of contingent labour. This will be progressively rolled out 
to other regions.
In 2018 focus will remain on consolidating the supplier 
base, standardisation of procurement processes, 
demand management and delivering savings.
Operational excellence
We have a number of initiatives in place to introduce 
standardised operational and functional processes.  
We are also using IT-enabled automation and shared-
service centres to improve productivity. One example 
of this is Javelin.
Lean‑process design – Javelin
Project Javelin is a new operating model for our business 
which takes the best working practices and processes 
from across G4S. Javelin replaces our previous systems 
and processes for recruitment, core HR, talent 
management, procurement, finance, contract 
management, payroll, billing, scheduling, tele-contact,  
IVR platform and operational control systems with a 
single Cloud based platform.
The pilot for Javelin was launched in Ireland in 
November 2017. The purpose of the pilot programme 
was to learn how to best deliver this complex change 
programme within our business, identify areas  
of our combined processes that work well and capture 
areas for improvement before further roll-out. The 
enhanced version of Javelin encompassing all of the 
lessons learned will be deployed into Ireland before 
implementation commences in the UK later this year.
Automating our core processes for HR (screening, 
payroll), operations (scheduling, holidays and leave)  
and finance (billing) will reduce the amount of time 
between the work we do for customers and billing  
for those services.

FINANCIAL AND COMMERCIAL DISCIPLINE
Operating cash flow
Operating cash flow from core businesses in 2017 was 
£527 million, down from £633 million in 2016 as 
expected. Operating cash flow in 2016 was particularly 
strong, reflecting the beneficial impact of better terms 
and conditions with a large number of suppliers and the 
recovery of weak cash flow performance at the end of 
2015. Our 2017 cash flow conversion performance of 
106% of Adjusted PBITA (2016: 133%) was in line with 
our guidance that average operating cash flow 
conversion will be more than 100% of Adjusted PBITA.
We continue to focus on improved working capital 
management through strengthening bid evaluation 
frameworks to increase focus on frequency of invoicing 
and shorter payment terms.
Reducing the time between event to billing
• Improving processes and automating event billing 
information such as hours worked (for example 
Project Javelin on page 29), milestones met, collections 
and deliveries in the cash solutions business.
• Centralising of billing events of global and strategic 
accounts in some countries.
• Automation of invoices removing the resource and 
delay of a manual process.
• Seeking to distribute invoices electronically, at lower 
cost and quicker than via post.
Contract risk management
Our contract risk management model was implemented 
in 2014, and aims to ensure we sign contracts that we 
can deliver efficiently and effectively and is shown in the 
pie chart below:
Through a strong focus on cash management 
and portfolio management, net debt/Adjusted 
EBITDA reduced to 2.4x at the end of 2017 
from 2.8x at the end of 2016, in line with our 
target set in 2015.

FINANCIAL AND COMMERCIAL DISCIPLINE - FULL OUTLINE
30 G4S plc Integrated Report and Accounts 2017 Strengthening collections performance
• Changed incentive plans in 2016 with greater 
emphasis on cash-flow generation.
• Improved management information to increase 
accountability and influence behaviour.
• Weekly calls with finance and operations to drive 
cash collection.
Managing accounts payable
• The Group’s days’ payable outstanding is 42 days 
(2016: 35 days) which is still shorter than days’  
sales outstanding of 52 days (2016: 46 days), but  
the gap is reducing. This shows that, despite the 
progress made, there is still an opportunity  
to improve further.
• Ensuring that supplier contracts are linked with 
customer contracts.
• Re-negotiating improved terms through  
procurement teams.
Capital allocation – on‑going priorities for use of cash
All investment is reviewed to ensure that the Group’s 
return on investment targets are met, and all major 
capital investment projects are approved by the 
appropriate authority in line with delegation limits. 
Other measures, such as whether we are able to 
achieve the benefits of the project in line with the 
Group values and whether the commercial risks are 
acceptable, are also considered.
We intend to remain soundly financed with average 
operating cash flow conversion of more than100% of 
Adjusted PBITA and a net debt to Adjusted EBITDA 
ratio of less than 2.5x. Priorities for excess cash will  
be investment, dividends and, in the near term, further 
leverage reduction.
Changing behaviours
Cash-flow generation is an important part of 
management incentive plans.
Portfolio management
The Group made further progress with its portfolio 
management programme in 2017. The programme has 
greatly improved the Group’s strategic focus and has 
also realised over £500 million in disposal proceeds in 
relation to the 41 businesses sold to date. This includes 
gross proceeds of £166 million in 2017 relating to the 
disposal of the Group’s businesses in Israel and Bulgaria, 
the Group’s cash businesses in Peru and Paraguay, the 
US Youth Services business and the UK children’s 
homes business.
The proceeds from these disposals have reduced the 
Group’s leverage and have been reinvested in an organic 
growth and productivity programme from which we 
expect to see good returns.
Pension deficit repair plan
G4S had a net defined pension deficit for accounting 
purposes of £318 million (2016: £368 million) net of 
applicable tax as at 31 December 2017. For more details 
see page 173. The lower deficit reflects a small increase 
in the discount rate assumption used and the payment 
of deficit repair contributions of £40 million during the 
year under the current deficit repair plan. The triennial 
review of the scheme and pension contributions will 
begin in 2018 and is expected to be completed in 2019.
Debt refinancing
G4S had gross debt of £2.5 billion (2016: £2.6 billion)  
and net debt of £1.5 billion at the end of 2017 (2016: 
£1.7 billion). Around £548 million of the £1 billion debt 
which matures in 2018/2019 incurs post-hedging average 
interest rates of between 6.90% and 7.75% (see page 41). 
The Group has good access to capital markets and a 
diverse range of finance providers and as a result began 
to refinance its debt at much lower rates in 2017 and 
early 2018 which should result in a material reduction  
in the Group’s interest charge from 2019 onwards.
FINANCIAL OUTLOOK
• Average organic revenue growth of 4-6%  
per annum
• Restructuring and efficiency programmes to 
deliver £70m-80m annual costs savings from 
2020 and around £20m of refinancing cost 
reduction per annum by 2020
• Compounding benefit of investment,  
growth and productivity to deliver strong 
earnings growth
• Operating cash flow from core businesses  
of over 100% of Adjusted PBITA
• Continued focus on cash management and 
working capital
• Continued disciplined approach to capital 
investment – expect to invest £100m-£150m 
per annum
• Maintain net debt/Adjusted EBITDA below 2.5x
• Dividends increasing in line with long-term 
growth in earnings
CAPITAL ALLOCATION
• Net debt/Adjusted EBITDA of below 2.5x
• Priority uses of any surplus cash flow:
• Investment in growth and productivity
• Dividend growth
• Leverage reduction

In 2017, revenues grew 3.2% to £7.4bn (2016: 
£7.2bn), with developed markets growing 4.3%, 
reflecting strong growth in North America and 
modest growth in Europe and the UK.
Emerging markets grew 1.5% with good growth 
across Africa, Asia Pacific and Latin America offset  
by a decline in the Middle East & India region.
In 2017, Adjusted PBITA grew 4.2% to £496m  
(2016: £476m) as a result of revenue growth of  
3.2% and our productivity initiatives having tangible 
compounding benefits. Adjusted PBITA in emerging 
markets was down 4.8% due to the challenging 
environment in Middle East & India whilst in developed 
markets Adjusted PBITA increased by 9.1%.

34 G4S plc Integrated Report and Accounts 2017 The Group applies the basis of preparation for its 
statutory results shown on page 136. As explained 
below, the Group makes use of Alternative 
Performance Measures (APMs) in the management of 
its operations and as a key component of its internal and 
external reporting. Whilst broadly consistent with the 
treatment adopted by both the Group’s business sector 
peers and by other businesses outside of the Group’s 
business sector, these APMs are not necessarily directly 
comparable with those used by other companies.
Business reporting structure
Since 2016, the Group has reported its results across 
three distinct components, in line with its strategy for 
managing the business:
• Core businesses (formerly referred to as 
“Continuing businesses”), which comprise the 
Group’s on-going activities;
• Onerous contracts, which are being managed 
effectively to completion:
The onerous contracts component largely comprises 
a small number of material legacy onerous contracts 
that were identified by management as loss-making 
and are being run to completion. The results of these 
contracts are presented separately so that 
stakeholders can clearly assess their financial impact 
on the Group as well as consider them separately 
when assessing the financial performance which the 
Group is likely to deliver into the future; and
• Portfolio businesses, which are being managed  
for sale or closure, as part of the portfolio 
rationalisation programme announced by the  
Group in November 2013.
Businesses are classified as portfolio businesses when 
the Group Executive Committee, having considered 
their performance, market conditions, competitive 
environment etc., considers that shareholder value  
is most likely to be maximised through a sale 
transaction rather than through continuing use. These 
businesses are available for immediate sale in their 
present condition, but do not represent a major line 
of business or geographical area of operation and 
hence do not meet the definition of a discontinued 
operation under IFRS 5.
Due to the scale and breadth of the Group, together 
with the complex changing environment in the 
different countries where the Group operates, the 
portfolio businesses programme is dynamic. Changes 
in performance and market conditions subsequent  
to the original launch of the portfolio businesses 
programme have led the Group Executive 
Committee to consider that some additional 
businesses should be sold or closed. In certain cases, 
changes in market conditions or business 
performance have provided sufficient evidence for 
the Group Executive Committee to conclude that 
shareholder value will best be maximised through 
retention of some businesses previously categorised 
as portfolio businesses, and hence such businesses 
have been re-classified as core businesses.
Since 30 June 2017 there have been no changes to the 
portfolio businesses other than the completion of some 
minor disposals. The portfolio programme is considered 
to be substantially complete at 31 December 2017. 
Going forwards no further transfers into or out of the 
portfolio businesses will occur.
When presenting these three components separately, 
the objective is to provide additional information and 
analysis to enable a fuller understanding of the Group, 
the way it is managed, and to identify easily the 
performance of those businesses that are expected to 
form part of the Group in the long term. These three 
components, together with the impact of restructuring 
costs, specific items and other items disclosed separately 
from Adjusted PBITA (see below) on the face of the 
Consolidated income statement, constitute “continuing 
operations” under IFRS.
Discontinued operations, in accordance with IFRS 5, 
represent areas of the business which are being 
managed for sale or closure but which represent 
material business segments or entities. The Group now 
has minimal operations that meet the IFRS 5 definition 
of discontinued operations.
The comparative results for each component of 
continuing operations, and for discontinued operations, 
are re-presented for consistency to reflect the impact  
of businesses re-classified between components or sold 
during the current period.

measuring progress against strategic objectives are set 
out below, and are reconciled for the current and prior 
year to the Group’s statutory results on page 44.
a. Revenue
Statutory revenue arising in each of the three 
business components. Revenue from core businesses  
is a Key Performance Indicator (“KPI”).
b. Adjusted profit before interest, tax and   
 amortisation (“Adjusted PBITA”)
The Group uses Adjusted PBITA as a consistent 
internal and external reporting measure of its 
performance, as management views it as being more 
representative of financial performance from the 
normal course of business and more comparable 
period to period. Adjusted PBITA excludes strategic 
restructuring costs, goodwill impairment and 
amortisation of acquisition-related intangible assets 
and specific and other separately disclosed items, 
which the Group believes should be disclosed 
separately by virtue of their size, nature or incidence, 
as explained on page 36.
Restructuring costs:
These costs relate to the wider strategic transformation 
of the Group and are excluded from Group and 
regional Adjusted PBITA since they reflect Group 
decisions and are not considered to be reflective of the 
underlying financial performance of the individual 
businesses. This programme is of a strategic nature and, 
as such, is monitored and approved by the Group 
Executive Committee. During 2016 and 2017 activities 
under the programme have focused primarily on 
ALTERNATIVE PERFORMANCE MEASURES (APMS)
Strategic report
Integrated Report and Accounts 2017 G4S plc 35
Alternative Performance Measures (APMs) transforming the operating model in the regions of UK 
& Ireland and Europe. Going forwards, the Group has 
announced a three-year plan to 2020 to implement 
efficient organisational design and leaner processes, 
which is likely to require further restructuring 
investment. Local, non-strategic restructuring costs in 
the businesses continue to be included within Adjusted 
PBITA, consistent with prior years.
Goodwill impairment and Amortisation of acquisition-
related intangible assets:
The goodwill and acquisition-related intangible assets 
(mainly related to the capitalised value of customer lists), 
which resulted in these charges, arose when the Group 
acquired a number of its current businesses. As a 
contrast, organically-developed businesses in the Group, 
whilst clearly benefiting from intangible assets such as 
talent and customer relationships, do not have any 
associated goodwill or acquisition-related intangible 
assets recognised in the Group’s Consolidated 
statement of financial position.
Impairment and amortisation of goodwill and 
acquisition-related intangible assets are excluded from 
Adjusted PBITA as they relate to historical acquisitions 
activity rather than the underlying trading performance 
of the business, and this presentation enables effective 
comparison of business performance across the Group, 
regardless of whether businesses were acquired or 
developed organically. This approach provides 
management with comparable information for day-to-
day decision making. The income and trading profits 
earned from previously-acquired businesses are, 
however, included within Adjusted PBITA, and this 
treatment may differ from how other groups present 
profits and amortisation of intangible assets relating 
to businesses acquired.
The Group reports amortisation of all non-acquisition-
related intangible assets, which are mainly related to 
development costs and software, as a charge within 
Adjusted PBITA, to reflect the amortisation of capital 
expenditure invested in these assets to deliver the 
day-to-day operations, consistent with the treatment 
of depreciation of capital expenditure invested in 
property, plant and equipment.
Specific items:
These items are those that, based on management’s 
judgment, need to be disclosed separately in arriving 
at operating profit by virtue of their size, nature or 
incidence. They are excluded from the Group’s adjusted 
performance measures since they are not considered 
to be representative of the underlying financial 
performance of the business. In determining whether 
an event or transaction is specific, management 
considers quantitative as well as qualitative factors 
such as the frequency or predictability of occurrence.
All items that are reported as specific items are 
evaluated and approved by the Group’s Audit 
Committee prior to being separately disclosed. The 
Group seeks to be balanced when reporting specific 
items for both debits and credits, and any reversal of 
excess provisions previously created as specific items is 
recognised consistently as a specific item. The associated 
tax impact of specific items is recorded within the 
specific items tax charge. In addition, tax-specific charges 
or credits, such as those arising from changes in tax 
legislation which have a material impact, and which are 
unrelated to net specific items, are also included within 
the specific items tax charge. Consistent with the 
treatment of pre-tax specific items, significant tax 
charges or credits that occur, which are not related 
to core businesses but which would have a significant 
impact on the Group’s tax charge, would also be 
classified as tax-specific items.
Profits and losses on disposal or closure of subsidiaries  
and losses from discontinued operations:
These items are excluded from the Group’s adjusted 
performance measures since they are not reflective of 
the underlying financial performance of the Group.
Further details regarding these excluded items can be 
found in note 8 on page 148.
Adjusted PBITA from core businesses is a KPI.
c. Operating cash flow
Net cash flow from operating activities of continuing 
operations, adjusted to exclude strategic 
restructuring spend and cash flows from portfolio 
operations and onerous contracts. Operating cash 
flow from core businesses is a KPI.
d. Earnings
Profit attributable to equity shareholders of G4S plc. 
Adjusted earnings from core businesses excludes specific 
and separately disclosed items and is a KPI.
e. Earnings per share (“EPS”)
Profit attributable to equity shareholders of G4S plc, 
per share, from continuing operations. Adjusted EPS 
from core businesses excludes specific and separately 
disclosed items, and is a KPI.
f. Net debt to Adjusted EBITDA
The ratio of total net debt, including investments, 
finance lease liabilities and cash and overdrafts within 
net assets of disposal groups held for sale, to 
adjusted earnings attributable to equity shareholders 
before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation. 
This ratio is a determinant factor in the board’s 
assessment of the financial strength of the Group, 
and is a key measure of compliance with covenants 
in respect of the Group’s borrowing facilities.
Certain of these financial performance indicators in 
respect of core businesses also form a significant 
element of performance measurement used in the 
determination of performance-related remuneration 
and incentives, as follows:
• Adjusted PBITA – annual bonus plans for senior 
managers in regional management;
• Operating cash flow – annual bonus plans and 
long-term incentive plan for all senior management 
including executive directors;
• Adjusted earnings – annual bonus plans for executive 
directors and functional directors who are members 
of the Group Executive Committee; and
• Adjusted EPS growth – long-term incentive plan for  
all senior management including executive directors

Alternative Performance Measures (APMs) continued “We made good progress in 2017 
and our core businesses delivered 
revenue growth of 3.2% and 
adjusted earnings growth of 5.7%.”

Revenue
Revenue increased by 3.1% compared with the prior year statutory reported results presented at historical exchange rates. On a 
constant-currency basis, revenue decreased by 1.2%, reflecting a reduction in revenue from businesses identified for sale or closure of 
£335m primarily due to businesses disposals in the current and prior years including the Group’s US Youth Services business and its 
business in Israel (see page 39 and note 17) in 2017. Revenue from onerous contracts was slightly higher than the prior year at £119m 
(2016: £115m). Excluding revenue from onerous contracts and from businesses identified for sale or closure, revenue grew by 3.2% at 
constant exchange rates.
Business performance is discussed in more detail by region on page 51.
Adjusted PBITA
Adjusted PBITA of £491m (2016: £461m) was up 6.5% including the benefits of exchange rate movements in the year. On a constant-
currency basis, Adjusted PBITA increased 1.9% reflecting the strong performance of the Group in developed markets, improved product 
mix and the results of our on-going productivity programmes, partially offset by the weakness in the Middle East & India and a reduction 
in Adjusted PBITA from businesses held for sale or closure of £11m primarily due to business disposals in the current and prior years 
(see page 44). Excluding Adjusted PBITA from onerous contracts and businesses identified for sale or closure, Adjusted PBITA increased 
by 4.2% at constant exchange rates.
38 G4S plc Integrated Report and Accounts 2017
Chief Financial Officer’s review continued Net specific items
Specific items resulted in a net charge of £34m (2016: £13m), of which £19m (2016: £4m) primarily relates to the anticipated total 
losses over the next 15 to 20 years in respect of certain UK contracts. The net specific item charge also includes £6m relating to the 
estimated cost of settlement of subcontractor claims from commercial disputes in respect of prior years, and £9m relating mainly to the 
settlement of labour-related disputes in respect of prior years, in North America and Latin America. Specific items in 2016 included a 
£10m charge due to the revision of estimates relating to legacy acquisitions and labour claims in Latin America, £7m relating to 
commercial restructuring in Middle East & India, and a net £4m supplementary onerous contract provision primarily in respect of the 
Compass asylum seekers contract, all offset by an £8m credit relating mainly to the recovery of a legal claim in Europe and of certain 
disputed debtor balances in the UK.
Restructuring costs
The Group invested £20m (2016: £12m) in restructuring programmes during the year, mainly in the UK & Ireland and Europe regions 
as part of the multi-year strategic productivity programme being implemented across the Group, which is now drawing to a close. In 
addition, the Group incurred non-strategic severance costs of £10m (2016: £9m) which are included within Adjusted PBITA. Going 
forwards the Group has announced a three-year plan to 2020 to implement efficient organisational design and leaner processes, which 
is likely to require further restructuring investment.
Profit on disposal and closure of subsidiaries and goodwill impairment
As part of the portfolio programme, the Group realised a net profit of £74m (2016: £7m) relating to the disposal of a number of its 
operations including the businesses in Israel and Bulgaria, the US Youth Services business, the UK children’s homes business and the 
Group’s cash businesses in Peru and Paraguay. In 2016, the Group recorded a goodwill impairment charge of £9m in relation to 
businesses identified for sale or closure.
Acquisition‑related amortisation
Acquisition-related amortisation of £10m (2016: £32m) is lower than the prior year as certain intangible assets recognised on a number 
of legacy acquisitions became fully amortised in 2016.
Net interest costs
Net interest payable on net debt was £92m (2016: £90m). The increase in 2017 was primarily due to a temporary increase in gross 
borrowings (matched by an increase in cash balances) following the issuance of a €500m Public Bond in November 2016 and a €500m 
Public Bond in June 2017 that were used mainly to re-finance the March and May 2017 debt maturities in addition to drawings under 
the Revolving Credit Facility. Net other finance costs of £12m (2016: £6m) increased compared with the prior year due to an additional 
£2m relating to discount unwound on provisions, a £2m charge in relation to overseas tax settlements, and a £2m indebtedness-related 
foreign exchange gain recognised in 2016.
The pension interest charge, related to the unwinding of discount in relation to long-term pension liabilities, was £11m (2016: £10m), 
resulting in a total net interest cost of £115m (2016: £106m).
Strategic report
Integrated Report and Accounts 2017 G4S plc 39 Chief Financial Officer’s review continued
Tax
The statutory tax charge of £128m (2016: £76m) for 2017 includes a tax charge of £92m (2016: £85m) on the adjusted profits of core 
businesses, as explained on page 46, a tax credit on onerous contracts of £4m (2016: £nil), a tax charge of £7m (2016: £2m) in respect 
of portfolio businesses, a net tax charge of £18m (2016: tax credit of £9m) in respect of acquisition-related amortisation and other 
separately disclosed items, and a tax charge of £19m (2016: £nil) in respect of the tax impact of the US tax reform (see page 49).
The Group’s statutory tax charge represents an effective rate of 33% (2016: 26%) on profit before tax of £386m (2016: £296m). The 
effective tax rate is a function of a variety of factors, with the most predominant being the geographic mix of the Group’s taxable profits 
and the respective country tax rates, profits arising on the disposal of certain subsidiaries being taxed at a higher rate, the recognition of, 
and changes in the value of, deferred tax assets and liabilities, permanent differences such as expenses disallowable for tax purposes, and 
irrecoverable withholding taxes.
The higher effective tax rate compared with the prior year is primarily driven by a one-off charge relating to the re-measurement and 
impairment of US deferred tax assets arising as a result of US tax reform (as explained on page 49), together with profits arising on the 
disposal of certain subsidiaries being taxed at a higher tax rate.
The effective tax rate on the Group’s statutory profits was also significantly higher than the effective tax rate on the adjusted profits of 
core businesses (explained on page 46), primarily due to two non-core factors. Firstly, the impact of US tax reform, which is excluded 
from the tax charge on adjusted profits from core businesses, and secondly, as a result of profits arising on the disposal of certain 
subsidiaries being taxed at a higher rate.
Non‑controlling interests
Profit attributable to non-controlling interests was £16m in 2017, a decrease from £19m for 2016. The decrease compared with the prior 
year reflects the non-controlling partners’ share in the lower level of profitability of certain businesses in the Middle East & India region.
Profit for the year
The Group reported profit for the year attributable to equity holders of the parent (“statutory earnings”) of £236m (2016: £198m), an 
increase of 19.2% compared with the prior year including the benefits of improved Adjusted PBITA, the profit on disposal of subsidiaries 
and the impact of foreign exchange movements. On a constant-currency basis, earnings increased by 14.0%.
Earnings per share
Statutory earnings per share increased to 15.2p (2016: 12.8p), based on the weighted average of 1,548m (2016: 1,546m) shares in issue.

Review of the Group’s consolidated statement of financial position
Significant movements in the consolidated statement of financial position
Non-current loan notes were £1,486m (2016: £1,715m), reflecting the re-classification of certain US Private Placement notes repayable 
in July 2018 and the €500m Public Bond repayable in December 2018 as current liabilities, offset by the addition of the new €500m 
Public Bond issued in June 2017 and repayable in 2024.
The following movements in the Group’s consolidated statement of financial position are set out elsewhere in this report, as follows:
• cash, cash equivalents and overdrafts are explained on page 41;
• net debt is analysed on page 50;
• provisions are analysed in note 33 on page 179; and
• retirement benefit obligations are explained on page 43.
40 G4S plc Integrated Report and Accounts 2017 Total equity
Total equity at 31 December 2017 was £854m (2016: £863m). The main movements during the year were: profit for the year of 
£252m (2016: £217m), other comprehensive losses of £47m (2016: income of £109m) which included a re-measurement gain on 
deferred retirement benefit schemes of £26m (2016: loss of £169m) as explained on page 43, an exchange loss on translation of 
foreign operations of £125m (2016: gain of £429m) and a gain from changes in the fair value of cash flow hedging financial instruments 
of £56m (2016: loss of £197m) and dividends paid in the year of £179m (2016: £162m).
The significant foreign currency gain of £228m (net of changes in fair value of cash flow hedging financial instruments) recognised in the 
consolidated statement of comprehensive income in the prior year was mainly as a result of the weakening of Sterling compared with 
the US dollar and Euro following the UK referendum result in June 2016. In 2017, Sterling strengthened compared with the US dollar, 
partially offset by a further weakening against the Euro, resulting in a net foreign exchange loss of £69m recognised in the Consolidated 
statement of comprehensive income for the year.
Review of the Group’s cash flow and financing
Consolidated statement of cash flow
Net cash flow from operating activities of continuing operations was £488m (2016: £615m), a decrease compared with the prior year 
as the Group reverted to a more customary level of operating cash generation following the particularly strong performance in the prior 
year, net cash inflow from total operating activities was £402m (2016: £522m), net cash generated by investing activities was £81m 
(2016: net cash outflow of £18m), including £156m (2016: £82m) of net business disposal proceeds and net cash outflow from 
financing activities was £570m (2016: £307m). Cash, cash equivalents and overdrafts at 31 December 2017 were £571m (2016: 
£672m), a net decrease including the impact of exchange rate movements of £101m (2016: net increase of £284m). The Group’s 
statutory cash flow is presented in full on page 135.
Net debt
The Group’s net debt as at 31 December 2017 was £1,487m (December 2016: £1,670m). The Group’s net debt to Adjusted EBITDA 
ratio improved to 2.4x (2016: 2.8x). A detailed reconciliation of movements in net debt is provided on page 50.
Net debt maturity
In May 2017, the Group’s credit rating was affirmed by Standard & Poor’s as BBB- (negative). As of 31 December 2017 the Group had 
liquidity of £1,571m (2016: £1,692m) comprising cash, cash equivalents and bank overdrafts of £571m (2016: £672m) and unutilised 
but committed facilities of £1bn (2016: £1bn). The Group issued a €500m Public Bond in June 2017 which matures in June 2024 and 
pays an annual coupon of 1.5%.
The next debt maturities are £44m and $224m US Private Placement notes due in July 2018 and a €500m Public Bond due in 
December 2018. The Group has good access to capital markets and a diverse range of finance providers. Borrowings are principally  
in Sterling, US dollars and Euros, reflecting the geographies of significant operational assets and profits.

Strategic report
Integrated Report and Accounts 2017 G4S plc 41 Chief Financial Officer’s review continued
The Group’s average cost of gross borrowings in 2017, net of interest hedging, was 4.1% (2016: 4.1%).
Financing and treasury activities
The Group’s treasury function is responsible for ensuring the availability of cost-effective finance and for managing the Group’s financial 
risk arising from currency and interest rate volatility and counterparty credit. Group Treasury is not a profit centre and is not permitted 
to speculate in financial instruments. The treasury department’s policies are set by the board. Treasury is subject to the controls 
appropriate to the risks it manages, which are discussed in note 31 on pages 168 to 172.
To assist the efficient management of the Group’s interest costs, the Group operates a multi-currency notional pooling cash 
management system with a wholly-owned subsidiary of an A-rated bank. The Group presents pooled cash and overdrafts gross in the 
Consolidated statement of financial position.

Applying December 2017 closing rates to the Group’s statutory results for the year to 31 December 2017 would result in a decrease in 
revenue of 1.9% to £7,680m (for the year ended 31 December 2016: increase of 2.5% to £7,782m) and a decrease in Adjusted PBITA 
of 1.9% to £482m (for the year ended 31 December 2016: increase by 2.5% to £473m).
The weakening of average Sterling exchange rates compared with the prior year led to an increase in revenue of 4.5% and an increase 
in Adjusted PBITA of 4.7% as explained above. The impact of exchange rate movements reduced the Group’s net debt by £21m 
compared with the prior year.
Dividend
In assessing the dividend, the board considers:
• future investment requirements;
• the Group’s pension obligations;
• net debt to Adjusted EBITDA;
• the availability of distributable reserves in the parent company; and
• reward to shareholders.
Following the achievement of the Group’s leverage-reduction target, the directors propose a 5% increase in the final dividend to 6.11p 
(DKK 0.5097) per share (2016: 5.82p per share; DKK 0.5029) reflecting the board’s confidence in the Group’s performance and prospects. 
Our dividend policy is to increase the dividend in line with the long-term growth in earnings. The interim dividend was 3.59p (DKK 0.2948) 
per share and the total dividend, if approved, will be 9.70p (DKK 0.8045) per share, an increase of 3.1% compared with 2016 (for the year 
ended 31 December 2016, the interim dividend was 3.59p; DKK 0.3143 and the total dividend was 9.41p; DKK 0.8172).
The proposed dividend cover is 1.8x (2016: 1.8x) on adjusted earnings from core businesses.
42 G4S plc Integrated Report and Accounts 2017 Pensions
As at 31 December 2017 the net defined benefit pension obligation in the Consolidated statement of financial position was £381m 
(2016: £437m) of which £283m (2016: £341m) related to material funded defined benefit schemes. Net of related deferred tax 
balances, the Group’s net pension obligation was £318m (2016: £368m).
The most significant of the Group’s pension schemes is in the UK and accounts for over 88% (2016: 94%) of the Group’s total material 
scheme obligations. The scheme has approximately 30,000 members and further details of the make-up of the scheme are given in note 
32 on page 174.

Scheme assets 2,345 2,339
Obligations (2,595) (2,659)
Net UK obligations (250) (320)
The reduction in the UK scheme net obligations reflected a decrease in the scheme obligations of £64m partially offset by an increase of 
£6m in the value of scheme assets. The decrease in the obligations is a result of the discount rate used for valuation purposes increasing 
to 2.55% (2016: 2.50%), the projected pension inflation rates decreasing to 3.2% (2016: 3.3%), and the payment of scheduled deficit 
repair contributions of £40m (2016: £39m) during the year. The Group will pay pension deficit repair contributions of £41m in 2018  
in line with the agreed contribution schedule. The next funding valuation is due in 2018, following which future contributions will be 
subject to review and potential renegotiation.
Interest-rate risk and interest-rate swaps
The Group’s investments and borrowings at 31 December 2017 were a mix of fixed rates of interest and floating rates of interest 
linked to LIBOR and EURIBOR.
The March 2007 and July 2008 private placement notes and the May 2009, December 2012, November 2016 and June 2017 public 
notes were all issued at fixed rates, whilst the Group’s investments and bank borrowings were all at variable rates of interest linked to 
LIBOR and EURIBOR.
The Group’s interest-risk policy requires Treasury to fix a proportion of its interest exposure on a sliding scale in US dollars, Sterling and 
Euro, using the natural mix of fixed and floating interest rates emanating from the bond and bank markets and by utilising interest-rate 
and cross-currency swaps. Part of the proceeds of the private placement and public notes have been swapped to floating interest rates, 
and accounted for as fair-value hedges, with a net gain in the hedges at 31 December 2017 of £14m (2016: net gain £27m). The 
market value of the pay-fixed receive-variable swaps and the pay-fixed receive-fixed cross-currency swaps outstanding at 31 December 
2017, accounted for as cash-flow hedges and net-investment hedges, was a net asset of £59m (2016: net asset of £31m).
Foreign currency
The Group has many overseas subsidiaries and joint ventures, denominated in various different currencies. Treasury policy is to manage 
significant translation risks in respect of net operating assets and its consolidated net debt/Adjusted EBITDA ratio by holding foreign-
currency denominated loans, cross-currency swaps and to a lesser extent forward-currency contracts.
At 31 December 2017, the Group’s US dollar and Euro net assets were approximately 91% and 90% respectively, hedged by foreign 
currency debt. As at 31 December 2017, net debt held in US dollars and Euros, and in those currencies officially pegged to these two 
currencies, equated broadly to a ratio of 2.3x Adjusted EBITDA generated from these currencies (2016: 2.2x Adjusted EBITDA).

a. Results from core businesses, presented at constant exchange rates other than for operating cash flow, exclude results from portfolio businesses identified  
for sale or closure and from onerous contracts. For the Group’s 2017 results, continuing businesses have been renamed ‘core’ businesses to provide a clear 
distinction from the Group’s statutory results from continuing operations. In addition, PBITA has been renamed ‘Adjusted PBITA’ to reflect the exclusion  
of specific and separately disclosed items set out on page 35. Core businesses and Adjusted PBITA are defined and calculated in exactly the same way as 
continuing businesses and PBITA were previously defined and calculated. The basis of preparation of results of core businesses and an explanation of 
Alternative Performance Measures, including Adjusted PBITA, are provided on page 35.
b. Portfolio businesses that remain part of the Group, having not yet been sold or closed, contributed £158m revenue (2016: £167m at 2017 average exchange 
rates; £155m at 2016 average exchange rates) and a loss of £9m to Adjusted PBITA (2016: loss of £21m at 2017 average exchange rates; £20m at 2016 
average exchange rates).
c. Other includes net specific items (other than those presented within onerous contracts), net profit on disposal/closure of subsidiaries/businesses, the results  
of discontinued operations and, in 2016, goodwill impairment. The associated tax impact of these net specific items is recorded within the tax charge within 
“other”. In addition, tax-specific charges or credits, such as those arising from changes in tax legislation which have a material impact, and which are unrelated  
to net specific items, are also included within the tax charge within “other”. The full accounting policy regarding specific and other separately disclosed items  
is provided on page 36.
d. Earnings is defined as profit attributable to equity shareholders of G4S plc. Adjusted Earnings and Adjusted Earnings per share (“EPS”) from core businesses 
exclude specific and other separately disclosed items, and likewise the tax impact of those specific and other separately disclosed items and the impact of 
tax-specific charges or credits unrelated to those specific and other separately disclosed items, as explained on page 36. Adjusted Earnings and Adjusted EPS 
from core businesses are reconciled to statutory earnings and statutory EPS above.
e. Operating cash flow is defined on page 36 and is stated after pension deficit contributions of £40m (2016: £39m) and for the year ended 31 December 2016 
is presented at 2016 average exchange rates. Operating cash flow from core businesses is reconciled to the Group’s movements in net debt on page 50. 
Statutory operating cash flow is net cash flow from operating activities of continuing operations.
f. The ‘adjusted statutory’ figures represent the comparative 2016 statutory results translated at 2017 average exchange rates (other than for operating cash flow) 
but should not be considered as or used in place of the Group’s statutory results.

Revenue
At £2.7bn, emerging markets' revenues increased 1.5% on the prior year, with growth in all regions except for Middle East & India, and 
represented 37% of Group revenue (2016: 37%). Developed markets’ revenues were 4.3% higher than the prior year with 6.0% growth 
in North America, 3.9% in Europe and 2.1% in UK & Ireland. Revenue from Cash Solutions was up 2.3% on 2016 and from Secure 
Solutions was up 3.4% on 2016.
Adjusted PBITA
Adjusted PBITA of core businesses of £496m (2016: £476m) was up 4.2%. This growth reflects the strong performance of the Group 
in developed markets, improved product mix and the results of our on-going productivity programmes, partially offset by the weaker 
trading in the Middle East & India. Overall, the Adjusted PBITA margin increased to 6.7% (2016: 6.6%) with improvements delivered in 
six out of the seven regions.
Interest
Net interest payable on net debt from core businesses was £90m (2016: £85m). The increase in 2017 was primarily due to a 
temporary increase in gross borrowings (matched by an increase in cash balances) following the issuance of a €500m Public Bond in 
November 2016 and a €500m Public Bond in June 2017 that were used mainly to re-finance the March and May 2017 debt maturities 
in addition to drawings on the Revolving Credit Facility. Net other finance costs of £12m (2016: £6m) increased compared with the 
prior year due to an additional £2m relating to discount unwound on provisions, a £2m charge in respect of overseas tax settlements, 
and a £2m indebtedness-related foreign exchange gain recognised in 2016.
The pension interest charge, related to the unwinding of the discount in relation to long-term pension liabilities, was £11m (2016: 10m), 
resulting in a total net interest cost of £113m (2016: £101m).
Tax
A tax charge of £92m (2016: £90m) was incurred on the adjusted profits of core businesses of £383m (2016: £375m) which 
represents an effective tax rate of 24% (2016: 24%). The effective tax rate is a function of a variety of factors, with the most 
predominant being the geographic mix of the Group’s taxable profits and the respective country tax rates, the recognition of, and 
changes in the value of, deferred tax assets and liabilities, permanent differences such as expenses disallowable for tax purposes, and 
irrecoverable withholding taxes.
At any point in time, the Group is typically subject to tax audits in a number of different countries. In situations where a difference of 
opinion arises between the Group and a local tax authority in respect of its tax filings, the Group will debate the contentious areas and, 
where necessary, resolve them through negotiation or litigation. The Group relies upon advice and opinions from the Group tax 
department, local finance teams and external advisors, to ensure that the appropriate judgments are arrived at in establishing 
appropriate accounting provisions in relation to such disputes.

Integrated Report and Accounts 2017 G4S plc 45 Chief Financial Officer’s review continued
Non‑controlling interests
Profit from core businesses attributable to non-controlling interests was £14m in 2017, a decrease from £23m for 2016, reflecting the 
non-controlling partners’ share of the lower level of profitability of certain businesses in the Middle East & India region.
Adjusted profit for the year (“adjusted earnings”) – core businesses
The Group generated adjusted profit from core businesses attributable to equity holders (“adjusted earnings”) of £277m (2016: 
£262m), an increase of 5.7% for the year ended 31 December 2017.
Adjusted earnings per share
Adjusted earnings per share from core businesses increased to 17.9p (2016: 16.9p), based on the weighted average of 1,548m 
(2016: 1,546m) shares in issue. A reconciliation of adjusted profit for the year from core businesses to Adjusted EPS is provided below:

Onerous contracts
The Group’s onerous contracts generated revenues of £119m (2016: £115m) for the year ended 31 December 2017. The Group 
recognised additional provisions of £19m (2016: £4m), classified as specific items, primarily related to the anticipated total losses over 
the next 15 to 20 years in respect of certain UK contracts. It is expected that around 60% of the Group’s total provision for onerous 
customer contracts of £62m will be utilised by the end of 2020.
Portfolio operations
The Group made further progress with its portfolio management programme in the year. This programme has greatly improved the 
Group’s strategic focus and has also generated approximately £510m in disposal proceeds in relation to the 38 businesses sold up to  
31 December 2017. Disposals in the year include the Group’s businesses in Israel and Bulgaria, its cash businesses in Peru and Paraguay, 
the US Youth Services business and the UK children’s homes business, generating total gross proceeds of £166m. Since the year end, 
and up to the date of this report, a further three businesses have been sold, generating additional gross proceeds of £9m. The portfolio 
programme is considered to be substantially complete at 31 December 2017. Since 30 June 2017 there have been no changes to the 
portfolio businesses other than the completion of some minor disposals. Going forwards no further transfers into or out of the portfolio 
businesses will occur.

48 G4S plc Integrated Report and Accounts 2017 Restructuring
The Group invested £20m (2016: £13m) in restructuring programmes during the year, mainly in the UK & Ireland and Europe regions, 
relating to the multi-year strategic productivity programme being implemented across the Group which is now drawing to an end. In 
addition, the Group incurred non-strategic severance costs of £10m (2016: £9m) which are included within Adjusted PBITA from core 
businesses. Going forwards the Group has announced a three-year plan to 2020 to implement efficient organisational design and leaner 
processes, which is likely to require further restructuring investment.

subcontractor claims from commercial disputes in respect of prior years, and £9m related mainly to the settlement of labour-related 
disputes in respect of prior years in North America and Latin America. Specific items in 2016 included an £11m charge due to the 
revision of estimates relating to legacy acquisitions and labour claims in Latin America, £7m relating to commercial restructuring in 
Middle East & India, and a net £4m supplementary onerous contract provision primarily in respect of the Compass asylum seekers 
contract, all offset by an £8m credit relating mainly to the recovery of a legal claim in Europe and of certain disputed debtor balances  
in the UK.
Profit on disposal and closure of subsidiaries/businesses and goodwill impairment
As part of the portfolio programme, the Group realised a net profit of £74m (2016: £5m) relating to the disposal of a number of the 
Group’s operations including the Group’s businesses in Israel and Bulgaria, the US Youth Services business, the UK children’s homes 
business and the Group’s cash businesses in Peru and Paraguay. The Group recorded a goodwill impairment charge in the prior year  
of £9m in relation to businesses to be sold or closed.
Acquisition‑related amortisation
Acquisition-related amortisation of £10m (2016: £34m) is lower than the prior year as certain intangible assets recognised on a number 
of legacy acquisitions became fully amortised in 2016.
Tax charges arising on acquisition‑related amortisation, specific and other separately disclosed items
Tax charges arising on acquisition-related amortisation, specific and other separately disclosed items of £18m (2016: tax credit of £9m) 
relate primarily to the disposal of subsidiaries in the United States, Peru and Paraguay.
Tax impact of US Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“US tax reform”)
On 22 December 2017, the US tax legislation known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was signed into law by the US President and 
introduced significant changes in US tax laws with effect from 1 January 2018. As this legislation is considered to be substantively 
enacted as at 31 December 2017, any tax effects of the legislation arising in 2017 have been taken into account.
For 2017, the changes in legislation resulted in a separately disclosed one-off charge to the income statement of £19m arising from the 
re-measurement and impairment of deferred tax assets due to the reduction in the US Federal tax rate, and from the impairment of 
foreign tax credits which are no longer expected to be recovered in future periods against foreign source income.
On the basis of information currently available and from analysis completed since the legislation was enacted, the above are likely to  
be the most significant impacts for the Group. However, as more detailed analysis and future legislative guidance become available, it  
is possible that the Group may be further impacted in the current and subsequent years by the legislative changes.

Secure Solutions support in more than 20 countries for SCB. 
In 2017 SCB embarked on a group project with G4S to 
address the bank’s strategic goal of digitising the cash 
collection process for its corporate customers using the 
CASH360 solution. 
The programme will launch in Q1 2018 in Indonesia  
where there is a significant appetite from their large 
corporate clients to deploy cash depositary machines in 
client premises, with plans to roll-out the model in a 
structured manner across other SCB franchise markets.
Where appropriate the Deposita hardware, software and the 
G4S managed service solution enables SCB to provide same 
day credit for the customer cash deposited in the CASH360

In North America, our revenues grew by 6.0%, with 
good growth rates in both our Cash Solutions and 
Secure Solutions businesses. 
In Cash Solutions, G4S technology-enabled cash 
management services are now delivered to over 6,900 
retail locations across the United States, including over 
5,000 in large store formats where G4S has established 
a market-leading position. We believe that our retail 
cash solution offers unique customer value and this  
is reflected in a substantial pipeline and active  
pilot programmes. 
Our Secure Solutions business produced revenue 
growth of around 5% as our integrated security 
solutions continued to find traction in the market place. 
This rate of revenue growth was constrained as we 
continued to apply commercial discipline in those 
market locations facing tight labour conditions. In  
North America we continue to monitor and manage 
wage inflation, particularly in Canada following recent 
minimum-wage increases. 
Overall in the United States we are managing wage 
inflation pressure through productivity improvements 
and commercial discipline, and we believe that increased 
unit labour costs are encouraging customers to move to 
our integrated security solutions combining G4S security 
professional personnel with technology. We continue to 
see good demand for our products and services across 
the US and Canada.
Adjusted PBITA increased by 7.0%, helped by a 
favourable revenue mix and efficiency gains, partially 
offset by the cost of investing in capacity to support  
our growing integrated secure solutions and retail 
solutions businesses.

In 2017, G4S UK&I won the integrated security contract for 
the job centres in the UK for the Department of Work & 
Pensions (DWP). G4S previously had the manned security 
contract through Telereal Trillium and managed the access 
control system across most of the estate.
The DWP’s objective was to procure a security service

The DWP transformation programme aims to reduce

We have modernised the way in which security is provided

members of the public at DWP sites, reducing the likelihood 
of incidents occurring.

G4S is the leading provider of Cash and Secure 
Solutions in the region, with a broad range of 
expertise covering specialist‑event security, 
provision of services to the UK Government 
including Care & Justice services, and  
Cash Solutions.
Revenue in the UK & Ireland increased by 2.1%, with a 
solid performance in our core businesses, including 
double-digit growth in our security technology business. 
The deployment of integrated security solutions, 
combining technology and manned security, was 
instrumental in retaining and expanding a number of our 
existing contracts and is increasingly relevant in winning 
new business. We are able to draw on substantial 
expertise in our UK & Ireland security systems business, 
supported by product research and development at our 
UK technology centre.
Revenue from our Care & Justice services and FM 
businesses was broadly flat as we maintained a disciplined 
and selective approach to new contract bidding.
Adjusted PBITA increased by 7.1%, reflecting the 
combination of revenue growth and the benefit of our 
on-going productivity programmes. 
The roll-out of our lean process design for the back-
office operations of our manned security business 
commenced in Ireland in the third quarter of 2017 and 
we expect it to be implemented in the UK during 2018.

Our services range from conventional manned security offerings to risk consulting, highly sophisticated security 
technology, security systems and integrated solutions. We are investing in the resources and capabilities which 
enable us to innovate and apply technology in the design and delivery of integrated solutions for our customers, and 
this is reflected in the increasing share of revenue from these solutions. Our technology-related security revenues 
for the Group grew by 11.4% to £2.45 billion (2016: £2.2bn). 
Our Secure Solutions business segment also includes our Care & Justice and FM services. Our Care & Justice 
business is concentrated in the UK and Australia and provides custody, detention, rehabilitation, education and 
transport services, typically in complex operating environments. 
As previously reported, our Secure Solutions businesses faced challenging trading conditions in the Middle East & 
India region and this partially offset the good rates of profitable growth in our other markets. Overall, the Secure 
Solutions businesses delivered 3.4% growth in revenue and 2.9% growth in Adjusted PBITA.

Revenues in Cash Solutions grew 2.3% and Adjusted PBITA rose by 5.3%.
The overall growth in revenue and profit was driven by strong volume growth, particularly in our Retail Cash 
Solutions business in North America, CASH360 in Europe and Deposita in Africa and Asia. At the end of January 
2018, we had an installed base of over 19,500 cash automation solutions at retail and banking customers, around a 
30% increase compared with 14,600 in 2016. The strong growth in Adjusted PBITA in our developed markets 
reflects the benefits of our systematic restructuring and productivity programmes which have been implemented 
over the past three years, partially offset by investment in sales and business development. 
The robust growth in developed markets was partially offset by the effect of weak trading in our Middle East & India 
region, where our businesses have been adjusting to the challenging trading environment and where we expect 
trading to begin to stabilise during 2018.
 
Corporate costs comprise the costs of the G4S plc board and the central costs of running the Group including 
executive, governance and central support functions, and were slightly lower compared with the prior year.

CORPORATE COSTS
Strategic report
Integrated Report and Accounts 2017 G4S plc 59 Our aim is to identify material risks that could 
impact us, and to focus management attention 
on effective mitigation of the significant risks  
to achievement of our strategic objectives and 
safeguard our reputation.
An evolving risk landscape
During 2017 we continued to see challenges from 
uncertainty and changes in political leadership, terrorist 
events, weak economic recovery, geopolitical shifts, 
general migration and the on-going instability in the 
Middle East. These have created risks and opportunities 
for the security industry. G4S continues to face 
operational and health and safety risks often particular 
to the security industry, along with financial and 
commercial risks common to all multinational 
companies. Regulations on data privacy continue to be 
tightened with high fines for non-compliance. Our drive 
for increased growth through delivering significant cost 
savings and innovative service excellence to customers 
may lead to a changed risk profile.
We continue to assess that the risk to G4S from the 
vote for the UK to leave the EU is not significant as we 
mainly operate within national boundaries with around 
83% of total Group revenues outside the UK and 
minimal cross-border trading. However, depending on 
the terms of the UK’s exit from the EU there might be  
a range of business factors that could affect us including 
the availability of labour, regulations and taxation. It is 
also possible that continuing uncertainty during the 
negotiation period reduces economic growth in the UK 
and Europe, further affecting both our customers and 
our competitors. We continue to monitor developments 
through our risk and governance framework.
What we did in 2017
Progress continues to be made on increasing risk 
awareness and ensuring accountability for risk 
management rests with business management teams. 
The Group’s mandated control standards have been 
further enhanced to ensure they address our key risks, 
with appropriate training and challenge to facilitate their 
effective performance. Control self-assessments were 
completed by all businesses. These are reviewed, 
challenged and best practice shared by region and group 
functional experts, and compliance has been tested 
through internal audits. Our quarterly Regional Audit 
Committees continued to focus on financial judgments 
and to address internal and external audit findings, 
which has enabled further improvement in financial 
control awareness and effective performance.
What we will do in 2018
We will continue to refine our key standards and 
controls, and through support and training we will help 
all businesses operate them effectively. Functional teams 
will use the results of control self-assessments to assist 
countries with full compliance. In addition, internal audits 
will continue to test the operational effectiveness of our 
standards and controls. Regional Audit Committees will 
continue to review, challenge and direct improvements  
in the performance of control standards, financial 
judgments and reporting. Through continued 
engagement and review by country, region and  
Group management, we will enhance the quality and 
timeliness of the identification of risks and the delivery  
of mitigating actions.
During the year we will further improve the reporting  
of risks and use metrics to assist with risk identification.
Risk Management and Appetite
As in prior years we have undertaken a bottom-up 
review, with businesses completing an assessment of 
their major risks and developing mitigating actions to 
reduce the likelihood of those risks crystallising. These 
reviews require management teams to identify the 
essential controls needed to mitigate high inherent risks 
to acceptable residual risk levels, in line with the group’s 
risk appetite, further encouraging effective compliance 
with the Group’s core standards and controls. These risk 
assessments are reviewed, challenged and amended as 
necessary by regional teams, who are also responsible 
for monitoring delivery of required improvements. This 
is combined with a top-down review from group 
functional leaders, to ensure that the risks captured are 
complete and appropriately assessed. The risks are then 
summarised and presented to the Risk Committee for 
consideration before being presented to the board for 
review. The resulting principal residual risks, with any 
identified changes and mitigating actions, are outlined in 
the following pages 62 to 65. The residual risk level has 
not changed significantly compared to the prior year.
G4S operates in high-risk areas of business, in which  
our core competence and value-add to customers is 
managing those risks effectively. We have a higher risk 
appetite for growing and transforming businesses in 
which we have the expertise to deliver and to achieve  
a good commercial return for the risk we are accepting.
We have a low to very low risk appetite for non-
compliance with laws and regulations, appropriate 
culture and values, health and safety and people risks,  
as these are priority areas for our stakeholders and 
failure in these key risk areas could have a material 
impact on our business.

HEALTH AND SAFETY (H&S)
CULTURE AND VALUES
Risk
The provision of security services to protect valuable assets, often 
in hostile or dangerous circumstances, presents health and safety 
challenges. In addition to the significant impact on individuals, a 
serious breach of health and safety could disrupt the Group’s 
business, have a negative impact on our reputation and lead to 
financial and regulatory costs. In 2017, 25 (2016: 47) employees 
lost their lives in work-related incidents, of which eight (2016: 20) 
were as a result of armed attacks and 11 (2016: 17) were 
road-traffic incidents as the year-on-year improvement in road 
safety continued. There were three (2016: 9) non-natural deaths 
of people in our custody.
Risk mitigation
We are committed to protecting the health, safety and well-being 
of our staff, people in our care or custody and third parties. The 
Group’s mandatory H&S standards target the critical safety risks  
in the Group including road and firearm safety and are 
supplemented by training for front-line staff through to business 
leaders. During 2017 the annual self-assessment by countries of 
compliance with our standards was supported by site reviews 
from local, regional and Group H&S managers and was included  
in the scope of country internal audit visits. Reporting was 
enhanced to include high potential incidents which are investigated 
thoroughly. Controls are reviewed in light of lessons learned from 
serious incidents.
We reviewed the appropriateness of our ‘Golden Rules’ which 
reflect critical safety risks and are mandatory for all G4S businesses, 
and failure to adhere to them is linked to our disciplinary 
procedures. Good practice and progress in delivering H&S 
improvements are recognised and rewarded, while poor practice 
and insufficient progress lead to close executive scrutiny, and can 
impact performance-related pay for business leaders if appropriate.
Mitigation priorities for 2018
We will continue to refine our standards, policies and controls 
where we see an opportunity to reduce H&S risks further. The 
compliance with these group requirements will again be self 
assessed during 2018 and reviewed by H&S and internal audit 
teams. A revised H&S training programme for our front-line 
employees is under development which supplements existing 
training provided by businesses on key H&S risks. Safety 
improvement plans are required for all businesses. Business 
leaders take responsibility for leading safety performance and 
putting H&S at the forefront of their day-to-day activities.
Risk
G4S provides security for people, premises and valuable assets. 
The Care & Justice services business provides services to 
detainees, victims of crime, people needing assistance, and other 
members of the public. We operate in many different countries 
with a diversity of local and national cultures. Having an 
appropriate set of values strongly embedded as our corporate 
culture is very important to ensure staff meet our high 
expectations including compliance with our ethical business 
conduct standards. Failure to do so risks not delivering on our 
commitment to our colleagues, customers and other stakeholders 
and may fail to comply with legislation and international standards.
Risk mitigation
We have a set of values, detailed on page 17, which are continually 
reinforced to all employees through a variety of key processes 
including recruitment, induction training, and recognition schemes 
as well as communications materials. Nominated values 
ambassadors in businesses are helping to cascade values-related 
communications. HR and learning and development leaders have 
assisted in the production of materials for increasing awareness and 
understanding of our values. In everything we do, no matter how 
challenging the circumstances, we require our people to behave in 
line with our values and to be prepared to use our whistleblowing 
facility, Speak Out, if they become aware that others are not doing 
so. Ethics steering committees at a Group level and in each region 
oversee the whistleblowing investigation process and provide 
constructive guidance to countries on ethical matters. We continue 
to focus on building awareness of the importance of our corporate 
values and whistleblowing, particularly in places where we work 
with people who may be more vulnerable and have less 
opportunity to raise concerns themselves. In 2017, our 
whistleblowing hotline and case-management system received  
a total of 300 reports from our employees (2016: 402). Matters  
of a serious nature were investigated at a senior and independent 
level, with 59 investigations completed during 2017 (2016: 55).
Mitigation priorities for 2018
For our front-line employees, we will extend the values-based 
training materials already developed to reflect common 
experiences or particular challenges which come to light from 
whistleblowing cases, internal grievances or feedback from the 
global employee-engagement survey conducted in 2017. 
For managers, the newly-revised competency framework has 
helped guide the development of on-line training, which is due to 
be launched in 2018. The training uses realistic scenarios in which 
participants are required to make value-based decisions from a 
range of options in order to achieve the right outcomes. The 
training will be mandatory, and cascaded to all managers to 
complete before the end of 2018.
Our reward and recognition schemes will continue to be aligned 
to the values, to ensure they are promoted in everything we do. 
A new group-wide scheme will supplement local efforts and 
enable us to showcase the types of behaviour which exemplify  
the values and reflect the great work that our employees do.

62 G4S plc Integrated Report and Accounts 2017 PEOPLE
MAJOR CONTRACTS
Risk
In a global and diverse security business such as ours, there are 
risks associated with recruiting, training, engaging, rewarding and 
managing people, as well as ensuring we retain critical talent to 
deliver increasingly sophisticated services through our 570,000 
employees. Screening and vetting is a particular challenge in some 
territories which lack supporting infrastructure from the relevant 
authorities. Any incident where our people fail to meet 
expectations of customers and other stakeholders could lead to 
financial and reputational damage to the Group’s business. Whilst 
our controls are robust we still face the risk of an employee not 
behaving in line with our values.
Risk mitigation
The Group’s mandatory human resource standards cover core 
requirements for delivering the HR strategy, such as ensuring 
there are effective organisational structures in place, that 
employees are screened, inducted and trained to perform their 
jobs, and that there are appropriate mechanisms in place for 
managing on-going performance and recognising great 
performance. During 2017 the annual self-assessment by countries 
of compliance with our standards was supported by site reviews 
from local and regional teams, and included in the scope of 
country internal audit visits.
We review in detail the performance and potential of managers 
across the Group to help identify development needs and build 
succession plans. We also deliver regional leadership programmes 
to nurture talented individuals early in their careers, and help 
develop them into more senior roles as they move through the 
organisation. Staff turnover is a key indicator to us of employee 
satisfaction, and reducing it improves service excellence and 
reduces recruitment costs. During the year staff turnover reduced 
from 27.6% in 2016 to 25.3% in 2017 (see page 17).
Mitigation priorities for 2018
We will use the information from our fifth global employee survey 
to help develop initiatives to enhance standards further and ways 
in which to ensure the standards are embedded. Compliance with 
our Core HR Standards will again be self-assessed during 2018 
and reviewed by local, regional and group teams as well as tested 
by internal audit. Direct support will be provided as necessary to 
enhance compliance with our standards.
Risk
The Group operates a number of long-term, complex, high-value 
contracts with multinational companies, governments or strategic 
partners. Key risks include; accepting onerous contractual terms; 
poor mobilisation of contracts; not transitioning effectively from 
mobilisation to on-going contract management; not delivering 
contractual requirements; inaccurate billing for complex contracts; 
ineffective contract-change management; and not managing 
sub-contractors appropriately.
Risk mitigation
During 2017 we updated our strict thresholds for the approval  
of major bids, involving detailed legal review and senior 
management oversight. For a selection of our most significant 
contracts in the UK, we perform 360° reviews of all aspects  
of contract management and performance. We also perform a 
quarterly financial review of the top 25 and low-margin contracts 
in each region.
For our large multinational customers, account managers oversee 
performance of these contracts across relevant countries and have 
regular updates with customers to ensure we deliver against 
contractual terms.
Mitigation priorities for 2018
While great improvements have been made in reducing the risk  
of taking on onerous contracts, as the impact can be significant, 
we will continue to enhance the quality of the analysis used in 
the bidding process and ensure that lessons are learned from 
underperforming contracts. We will also embed into the 
SalesForce opportunity management tool our updated approval 
requirements to make compliance and monitoring effective.

Strategic report
Integrated Report and Accounts 2017 G4S plc 63 LAWS AND REGULATIONS
GROWTH STRATEGY
Risk
G4S operates under many complex and diverse regulatory 
frameworks, some of which have extraterritorial reach and many 
where regulations change regularly. Risks include: new or changed 
restrictions on foreign ownership; difficulties obtaining all relevant 
licences to operate; complying with employment legislation 
covering a wide range of requirements; complying with often 
complex and broad ranging local tax regulations; increasing 
litigation and class actions; bribery and corruption and complying 
with human rights legislation. Failure to meet the required 
standards can lead to higher costs from claims and litigation; 
inability to operate in certain jurisdictions, through either direct 
ownership or joint ventures; loss of management control; damage 
to our reputation; and loss of customer confidence.
Risk mitigation
Our policies and procedures clearly set out the requirement for 
local management teams to comply with all relevant laws and 
regulations. Group and regional leadership, together with our 
Ethics Committees at Group and regional level provide oversight 
and support our businesses to mitigate the risks. Group legal and 
regional leadership closely monitor changes in foreign ownership 
laws and make appropriate plans to respond. G4S continues to 
liaise with relevant governments and authorities to influence 
positively the regulatory environments in which we work.
Mitigation priorities for 2018
We will continue to focus on seeking full compliance with laws 
and regulations across all jurisdictions we operate in and ensure 
that concerns are addressed appropriately by local management 
with support and guidance from Group and regional leaders.
Risk
Our focus is on investing in the development and marketing of 
innovative and integrated products and services and improving 
business efficiency to strengthen service excellence and support 
improved margins over time. There are risks with adopting such  
a strategy: that we fail to create higher-value solutions that 
differentiate us from local commoditised competitors; that we  
fail to deliver our core services effectively and consistently; that we 
lose contracts or growth opportunities through price competition 
and market changes; that we fail to enter target markets 
successfully; that we become over-reliant on large customers;  
and that our business transformation initiatives do not deliver  
as expected.
Risk mitigation
We continue to focus on delivering excellent service through the 
best-practice service delivery guidelines in place for both Secure 
Solutions and Cash Solutions service lines. Our newly developed 
information systems supporting the end-to-end order-to-cash 
process in our Secure Solutions service line, including finance, 
human resources and operational delivery, was launched in Ireland 
in 2017. We use our centres of excellence to develop innovative 
solutions for customers, particularly in electronic security and  
CASH360 in Cash Solutions. We leverage our global network to 
offer integrated solutions internationally and our global accounts 
programme supports and promotes our multinational accounts 
initiatives. Our consistent focus on delivering excellent service to 
customers has led to an increase in our Net Promoter Scores.
We are able to mitigate local reduction in growth opportunities 
through the diversity of industries and markets we serve, and by 
leveraging our portfolio of products to offer alternative cost-
efficient solutions. All our product development initiatives and 
business transformation projects are closely monitored by Group 
and regional teams, with appropriate challenge and approval to 
maximise the opportunity and minimise the risks.
Mitigation priorities for 2018
In 2018, we will focus our investments in innovative product 
development and in transforming the efficiency of our business and 
the capabilities of our people and systems. Customer satisfaction 
reviews will guide how we deliver integrated solutions to existing 
and potential customers across all businesses. This would include: 
proprietary security systems, video and intelligent camera systems, 
video management systems, global security intelligence systems and 
software tools including incident-management systems such as 
RISK360 in our Secure Solutions business. For Cash Solutions, 
development would include: retail solutions, CASH360, Deposita 
cash-recycling systems and solutions for our smaller retailers. Our 
new information systems for the Secure Solutions service line will 
be implemented in the UK in 2018, with plans to expand into 
other countries once proven to deliver as expected. Focused 
business transformation projects will also be implemented to drive 
further efficiency and improve margins. Oversight, challenge and 
approval of detailed business cases for all such initiatives will be 
enforced by Group and regional teams.

INFORMATION SECURITY
CASH LOSSES
Risk
We operate in many countries across the world, with wide-ranging 
government and political structures, different cultures with varying 
degrees of compliance with laws and human rights, particularly within 
conflict and post-conflict zones. The risk factors include: political 
volatility, including the outcome of elections and referendums 
affecting trade rules and regulations and changes in policies towards 
business, revolution, terrorism, military intervention, mistreatment of 
migrant workers and employees working for our suppliers. These 
risks impact us in many ways: the health and safety of our staff and 
customers; the continued operation of our businesses; and the ability 
to secure our assets and recover our profits.
Risk mitigation
We collaborate with our local partners; conduct early risk 
assessments before and during security assignments; develop 
robust operating procedures; and work closely with our local  
and global customers in managing the risks of operating in such 
environments. We have clear standards on human rights which  
all businesses must comply with. Those based in high-risk countries 
self assess their compliance with these standards annually, with  
this assessment reviewed by Group and checked by internal audit. 
We have a mandatory supplier code of conduct which includes 
anti-bribery and modern slavery requirements. Our G4S Risk 
Management business has particular expertise in providing secure 
solutions in very high risk, low infrastructure environments.
Mitigation priorities for 2018
In markets where potential government policy or trade agreements 
may have a significant impact on our ability to trade we will 
continue to engage with national and international governments to 
promote the benefits that G4S brings to a market and an economy, 
to ensure that we minimise the impact of any trade restrictions or 
trade policy. We will increase the number of countries that 
complete human rights control self-assessments and carry out 
human rights risk assessments in all key business areas. We will also 
work to build awareness of human rights responsibilities across the 
business and our partners and increase engagement with suppliers 
to ensure they are also complying with human rights.
Risk
Increased regulations and sanctions relating to the potential failure to 
secure sensitive and confidential data, which we are entrusted with 
by customers, staff, suppliers and other stakeholders, have increased 
our risks in this area. Like all organisations, we face cyber attacks from 
a variety of sources which, if successful, could result in censure and 
fines by national governments; loss of confidence in the G4S brand 
and specific loss of trust by customers, especially those in 
government and financial sectors. Additionally, we face the risk of 
disruption to service delivery from system failures, incomplete backup 
routines, inadequate business continuity and disaster recovery plans.
Risk mitigation
We have “defence-in-depth” technologies (i.e. multiple layers of 
defence) in key systems to protect business information entrusted 
to us. During 2017 we brought our IT function under direct 
management of the Group team, to enhance the way our systems 
are supported and run. This will ensure policies and best practice 
are applied consistently across all operating businesses. In late 
2017 we commenced a programme of investment in Cyber 
defence tools, to improve the levels of compliance for managing 
these risks across the many systems and infrastructures that exist 
globally. We are also introducing additional standards and 
guidance to ensure compliance with General Data Protection 
Regulation (GDPR) across the UK and Europe.
Mitigation priorities for 2018
We will continue to strengthen the effective performance  
of our IT processes through the centrally-managed IT structure, 
and complete the implementation of our new Cyber Tools 
programme to increase the security of our IT systems and 
infrastructure, including managed cyber security products, 
centralised infrastructure management tools and cyber 
vulnerability assessments. 
Risk
We provide a wide range of cash-management services, including 
cash processing, fit-sorting of notes for recycling, holding funds on 
behalf of customers, secure storage, a range of ATM services, as 
well as transporting high values of cash and valuables including 
international shipments and fully-outsourced cash-management 
solutions such as CASH360. Our cash business is at risk of 
external attacks, internal theft, poor cash reconciliations and weak 
management supervision, which could lead to loss of profit, 
increased cost of insurance and health and safety considerations 
for our staff and the public.
Risk mitigation
During 2017 we refined the standards for Reconciliation and 
Operational Cash Controls and continued through an ‘e-learning 
academy’ and direct support, to ensure wide-spread awareness 
and effective performance of these controls. Self assessments  
against these standards are performed twice a year by each 
branch and head office and compliance is supported and 
monitored by regional teams and through internal audit. We also 
have clearly-defined standards for physical cash security for our 
employees, vehicles and processing centres. The Group and 
regional cash security teams are responsible for monitoring 
compliance with these through self-assessments performed by 
branches and visits to country; for monitoring attacks and other 
cash losses; and for communicating lessons learned. Innovative 
security-defence products such as cash-box tracking, vehicle 
protection foam and protective boxes are used in a number  
of businesses. 
Mitigation priorities for 2018
Our new Global Cash Solutions division will give additional focus 
to drive improvement in the effective performance of physical 
security and cash reconciliations throughout our cash businesses, 
to reduce both the number and value of losses.

Strategic report
Integrated Report and Accounts 2017 G4S plc 65 A STRONG GOVERNANCE CULTURE – KEY TO SUSTAINABLE SUCCESS
I am delighted that, building on the 
foundations laid in recent years,  
the Group has improved both its 
performance and financial position  
in 2017. This is particularly notable,  
in light of the challenging trading 
conditions that prevailed in the  
Middle East & India markets. 
As shown in the business review  
section of this report, the Group  
has made substantial progress on its 
strategic priorities. The board is pleased 
with the focus, energy and leadership 
that the executive team brings to  
the Group.
Chairman’s statement
John Connolly, Chairman
BOARD AREAS OF FOCUS IN 2017 
In my statement last year, I listed six areas of focus for 
the board. These were:
• Annual review of Group strategy and 
management’s execution of the strategy
• Induction and integration of new board members
• Board and management succession planning
• Monitoring business performance 
• Continued understanding of the Group’s businesses 
and management teams
• Maintaining emphasis on risk management and 
efficient structures 
We made good progress in all these areas and further 
information on the key areas of activities for the board 
in 2017 are set out in the governance report. 
Strong governance culture
Ensuring that G4S is resilient and agile and therefore 
able to deal with constant change and evolving 
economic and geo-political situations, is of paramount 
importance. This can only be achieved with a skilled  
and experienced board and management team and  
an appropriate culture and governance structure.
The board and I see strong governance, adapted to  
the Group’s needs, circumstances and business model, 
as a source of competitive advantage. G4S is a large, 
geographically diverse organisation, doing business in 
complex and sometimes sensitive environments. Sharing 
a common understanding of the company’s purpose and 
values is essential. To promote this, the board continues 
to support the application of G4S values throughout the 
organisation. A strong governance culture is supported 
by continuous monitoring, review and promotion of the 
Group’s values, standards and policies. It is also essential 
that directors feel able to provide not only support but 
also constructive challenge. 
Therefore we strive to foster open and effective 
communication within the boardroom and with the 
executive team. This process is informed by best 
practice as well as feedback received and views collated 
from our key stakeholders. There are a number of ways 
in which the board gathers stakeholders’ views, which 
are set out on pages 78 and 79. This year, as in previous 
years, I met with major shareholders as part of our 
annual programme of governance meetings. 
Given the business undertaken by the Group and the 
complex markets in which we operate, it is essential to 
understand the key risks faced by the organisation and 
to ensure that the company has appropriate policies, 
systems, processes and management action plans to 
mitigate these risks to an acceptable level. The board 
therefore maintains a Risk Committee, which is separate 
from the Audit Committee, to provide the necessary 
focus on risk management and mitigation.
Supporting change
Planning for the future requires us to review the board's 
composition regularly to ensure that it remains fit to 
support the changing needs of the Group. Management 
development and succession planning are also key areas of 
interest for the board. This was also particularly important 
this year, as management implemented important 
organisational changes, with the Secure Solutions business 
segment now organised into four regions and the creation 
of a global Cash Solutions division. 
In 2017, the board visited the Americas business and the 
technology business in the UK. Further details of these 
visits can be found on pages 78 and 79. In both 
instances, the board and I were impressed with the 
quality of the products and services offered and the 
importance of technology both in creating new services 
and also enhancing offerings when combined with 
traditional security and cash services. 
As chairman, it is my role to ensure that the board has 
the right skills to understand, support and challenge 
these developments. We give careful consideration  
66 G4S plc Integrated Report and Accounts 2017 to this need during the board members recruitment 
process but also when reviewing committees 
composition, as we did in December. I am confident 
that the board has significant, diverse and relevant skills 
and experience, with strong international exposure and 
knowledge of a significant number of industries (further 
information on the board balance is set out on page 74). 
Performance evaluation
Our externally facilitated performance evaluation was 
conducted between July and December 2017. The 
results confirmed that the board and its committees 
continue to operate well, with all directors contributing 
to the overall success of the Group. I led the 
performance evaluation process, with assistance from 
the Senior Independent Director and the company 
secretary. All the directors participated. The knowledge 
gained from the previous external evaluation allowed  
us to conduct a more focused evaluation this year. The 
board and committees performance review process is 
described in detail on page 77 and I am pleased to 
confirm that no significant issues were raised.
Changes to the board
Due to continued ill health, Ian Springett retired from 
the board on 20 June 2017. We were very sorry that 
Ian was unable to join our board and we wish him well 
for the future. Paul Spence, who was already a member 
of the Audit Committee, served as interim chair with 
effect from 20 January. I am very grateful to Paul for  
his strong stewardship. 
The Nomination Committee oversaw the process to 
find a new non-executive director qualified to act as 
chairman of the Audit Committee, which led to John 
Ramsay joining the board on 1 January 2018. I am 
pleased to welcome John, whose experience in highly 
international, innovation-focused businesses and his 
extensive background in finance and accounting will  
be very valuable to our board and in leading our  
Audit Committee. 
As announced in December 2017, after eight years  
on the board, Clare Spottiswoode will step down after 
the company’s annual general meeting on 15 May 2018. 
I would like to thank Clare for her thoughtful 
contributions to the board and her strong commitment, 
as chair of the CSR Committee since 2014, to help  
the company develop and promote CSR policies  
and processes. The Nomination Committee has initiated 
a search to find a new non-executive director to join 
the board. 
Further information about the work of the Nomination 
Committee during the year under review is set out on 
page 80.
Results
I am pleased to report on another year of good financial 
progress with continued growth in revenue and earnings 
and, importantly, a reduction in net debt with 
achievement of the Group’s leverage target of below 
2.5 times net debt to Adjusted EBITDA by the end  
of the year. 
Our statutory results showed a 3.1% increase in 
revenue, which rose to £7.8 billion, Adjusted PBITA  
up 6.5% to £491 million and earnings up 19.2% to  
£236 million benefiting primarily from a combination  
of profitable growth in our core businesses and profits 
on disposal of a number of businesses as our portfolio 
rationalisation programme drew to a close.
As noted elsewhere, our core businesses in all regions 
apart from the Middle East & India grew revenue and 
Adjusted PBITA such that total Group revenue from 
core businesses was up 3.2% to £7.4 billion and 
Adjusted PBITA grew by 4.2% to £496 million.
The management team’s continued focus on cash and 
working capital enabled the Group to deliver good 
operating cash flow conversion and this, coupled with 
net proceeds from disposal of a number of portfolio 
businesses of £156 million offset by organic capital 
investment of over £100 million, meant that the  
Group’s net debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio reduced 
from 2.8 times at the end of 2016 to 2.4 times at the 
end of 2017, in line with the board’s stated leverage 
reduction target. 
The board is confident in the Group’s outlook and 
proposes to increase the final dividend by 5% to 6.11p 
(DKK 0.5097) per share, payable on 15 June 2018.  
With an interim dividend of 3.59p (DKK0.2948) paid  
on 13 October, this will bring the total dividend for  
the year to 9.70p per share. 
People
The Group has around 570,000 employees in over 90 
countries, often providing complex services in difficult 
environments. This can create significant challenges.  
It is therefore pleasing that the outcome of the 2017 
employee engagement survey, which consisted of 
questions relating to G4S’ new corporate values, 
provided an 84% favourable response rate. 
On behalf of the board, I wish to thank the employees 
of G4S for their engagement, enthusiasm, hard work 
and dedication.

for each committee took place in January 2017.
1. Ms Fok was unable to attend one meeting of the Audit Committee due to a clash with another engagement.

to his appointment to the board.
3. Mr Springett was appointed to the board with effect from 1 January 2017 and shortly thereafter had to take an extended leave of 
absence to undergo treatment for a medical condition, therefore he was not expected to attend board meetings during this time.  
Due to continued ill health, Mr Springett retired from the board on 20 June 2017.
Diversity
The Group’s workforce reflects the  
wide range of countries, cultures and 
environments in which the Group 
operates. The Group has long recognised 
that diversity can enhance decision making 
and performance and promotes diversity 
within the organisation. The result is a 
diverse mix of gender, age, race, religion, 
nationality, language, background and 
experience across the workforce. 
Diversity, including gender diversity, in the 
senior management population remains 
an area of particular focus for the board. 
As well as being diverse in terms of gender 
and nationality, the board also includes 
members with diverse skills, personal 
attributes and experience. While most 
members have international assignment 
experience, others bring extensive 
experience of a variety of industries.  
In addition, the board has a mix of both 
long-serving and new members. These 
differences greatly enrich debate in the 
boardroom, bring fresh perspectives  
and understanding. 
Although the board has not adopted a 
formal board diversity policy, nor has it  
set any specific targets in this respect, 
diversity is a key consideration for the 
board. Recruitment of any new member 
to the board is always based on merit, 
against objective criteria, which take 
account of the diversity benefits each 
candidate can bring to the board. Further 
information in this regard is set out in the 
report of the Nomination Committee on 
pages 80 and 81.
The board also considers diversity as part 
of its annual review of talent management 
and succession plans for the board and 
senior management team. As part of this 
review gender diversity, as well as 
initiatives in place or being developed to 
promote greater representation of 
women and an increase in cultural and 
ethnic diversity across the Group’s global 
leaders are also discussed. 
The board is mindful of its obligations 
under both DTR7.2.8 and Code Provision 
B.2.4 and is considering adopting a formal 
board diversity policy to capture the

board’s approach to diversity and setting 
out the principles it follows in considering 
board appointments, board composition, 
and succession planning. 
However, the board is committed to 
ensuring that any such policy is informed 
by the results of the Group’s diversity and 
inclusion strategy review taking place in 
2018. Therefore the board will keep this 
matter under review during the year.
74 G4S plc Integrated Report and Accounts 2017 Board composition
As at the date of this report, the board comprises 10 
members: the non-executive chairman (John Connolly), 
seven other non-executive directors and two  
executive directors. 
The names of the directors serving as at 31 December 
2017 and their biographical details are set out on pages 
68 and 69. All these directors served throughout the 
year under review, apart from Ian Springett, a non-
executive director who retired from the board on  
20 June 2017, and John Ramsay, who was appointed  
to the board on 1 January 2018. 
Clare Spottiswoode, having completed nearly eight 
years as a non-executive director of the company, will 
retire from the board after the company’s AGM in 
2018. The process of seeking a candidate for a new 
non-executive director role is on-going. 
Independence 
The board considers all the non-executive directors  
to be independent and to bring objective oversight  
and challenge. 
The board acknowledges the recommended term 
within the Code and is mindful of the need for planned 
and orderly succession whenever possible. Therefore 
clear records of the tenure and skill set for each 
non-executive director are maintained. 
Director re‑election 
The company’s articles of association require that all 
continuing directors are subject to election by 
shareholders at the next annual general meeting following 
their appointment and that they submit themselves for 
re-election at least every three years and that at least 
one-third of the directors not standing for election for  
the first time stand for re-election at each annual general 
meeting. However, in accordance with the Code’s 
provision on re-election of directors, all continuing 
directors stand for re-election every year. With the 
exception of Clare Spottiswoode who will step down at 
the end of the 2018 AGM, all continuing directors intend 
to stand for election or re-election, as the case may be,  
at the company’s upcoming AGM.
Potential conflicts
Each of the directors has disclosed to the board any 
situations which apply to them as a result of which they 
have or may have an interest which conflicts or may 
conflict with the interests of the company. In accordance 
with the company’s articles of association, the board has 
authorised such matters. Should a director become aware 
that they may have an interest in an existing transaction 
with G4S, they should notify the board in writing or 
declare it at the next meeting. The company has 
procedures in place for managing such situations. The 
affected director will not vote on a matter in which they 
have an interest and the board may impose additional 
conditions if deemed appropriate. The board reviews 
such matters on a regular basis.

Integrated Report and Accounts 2017 G4S plc 75 Board meetings
Seven scheduled board meetings were held during the 
year ended 31 December 2017. Each year, one of these 
meetings is an extended two-day meeting at which, in 
addition to normal board business, the board and 
executive committee review the Group strategy.
Prior to each board meeting, comprehensive papers  
are circulated to the directors addressing not only the 
regular agenda items on which the executives will 
report, but also details of any matters requiring approval 
or decisions, such as significant transactions or other 
matters reserved to the board.
At each meeting, the board receives regular reports and 
in-depth presentations from line and functional 
executives and the board makes visits to business sites 
from time to time. 
After meetings of the board committees, the respective 
chairs report to the board on the matters considered by 
each committee.
After each board meeting the chairman holds a meeting 
attended solely by the non-executive directors.
There are seven board meetings scheduled for 2018 
including a two-day board and strategy meeting.

INDUCTION, INFORMATION AND DEVELOPMENT
A tailored induction is provided to new directors 
joining the board. The induction is designed to ensure 
directors joining the board have the necessary 
understanding of their role and how they can 
maximise their effectiveness. It is therefore tailored  
to the needs of each director and those of the role 
they will fulfil on the board. 
To build on the induction programme, directors 
receive further briefings both to help in their own 
development and also to enhance their awareness  
of the different elements of the business.
Briefings are provided to board members on legal, 
governance, compliance and reporting developments 
and to members of board committees from time  
to time on matters relevant to their work on  
those committees.
In addition, non-executive directors learn about  
the Group’s business and meet employees and 
management through site visits.
Information about the interactions between members 
of the board, in particular non-executive directors, and 
the business during the year, are set out on pages 78 
and 79.
Tailored induction – Audit Committee chair
Upon joining the board on 1 January 2018, a  
tailored induction programme was prepared for  
John Ramsay who took on the role of chair of the 
Audit Committee.
A four-step programme was devised. Step 1 focused 
on promoting a good understanding of the business 
by providing access to information about the 
company, group structure, management team, board 
governance, minutes of board and committee 
meetings and risk management. Step 2 developed  
an understanding of the company’s business, markets 
and main relationships. Over a day, Mr Ramsay had 
individual sessions with members of the group 
executive team and senior managers. Areas covered 
included strategy and investor relations, governance 
and corporate social responsibility as well as legal, 
human resources and health and safety. Step 3 had  
a strong financial focus and consisted of a day 
dedicated to meetings with the group chief financial 
officer, group financial controller, chief information 
officer, director of risk and internal audit as well as 
the external auditor. Step 4 will consist of site visits 
due to be arranged during the course of H1 2018.
76 G4S plc Integrated Report and Accounts 2017
Corporate governance report continued In accordance with guidance from the Code, the board 
and its committees are assessed yearly with the support 
of an external facilitator. During 2017, a fully externally-
facilitated exercise was carried out by Oliver Ziehn and 
Merlin Underwood of Lintstock. Oliver Ziehn, Merlin 
Underwood and Lintstock have no other connection 
with the company. 
Stage 1 
A thorough brief was provided by the chairman and 
company secretary in July 2017. Lintstock was given 
access to information about the board and particular 
areas of focus. Tailored questionnaires were then 
developed for the board and each committee. 
In early October, each of the directors, company 
secretary, Group HRD, Group Corporate Affairs 
Director, Director of Risk and Internal Audit,  
Group Financial Controller, Director of Compensation 
and Benefits, other regular board committee 
attendees, audit partners from PwC and Deloitte 
(remuneration consultant) was invited to complete 
the questionnaires online. 
In late October and early November, the Lintstock team 
conducted detailed interviews with each board director 
and the company secretary. 
Stage 2 
The Linstock team compiled a report based on 
information and views gathered through replies to the 
questionnaires and follow-up interviews. Lintstock also 
reported on the performance of each of the directors 
and separately on that of the chairman.
Stage 3
The reports, conclusions and recommendations were 
considered and discussed by the board and each of the 
board’s committees when reviewing their performance 
and informed the planning for the board and 
committees’ priorities in 2018. 
As part of this process, the individual director reviews 
were used as the basis for the chairman’s individual 
discussion with each of the directors about their 
performance and any training and development needs. 
The results of the board review were considered as part 
of the review of the committees’ composition by the 
Nomination Committee in December. 
The report on the chairman was used to inform the 
discussion amongst the non-executive directors 
conducted by the Senior Independent Director about 
the chairman’s performance, without the chairman  
being present.
BOARD REVIEW OUTCOME
BOARD AND COMMITTEES PERFORMANCE REVIEW
Board
The conclusions of this year’s review were positive and 
confirmed that the board operates effectively, with the 
board dynamics notably enhanced by recent additions 
to the board and by good information flow. Other areas 
which received positive feedback included the board’s 
relationship with senior management, time management 
and board support. 
A number of areas for further focus were also identified. 
These included greater focus on succession planning, 
monitoring the implementation of strategy and the use 
of technology, gaining a better understanding of certain 
stakeholders’ views, particularly those of customers, 
continued focus on corporate culture and fostering an 
environment conducive to the reporting of serious 
concerns through the available channels. 
Committees
The committees of the board were also reviewed and 
the results of the evaluation were also positive with 
committees perceived to be running efficiently and 
making effective decisions. 
Further information about the results of each committee 
review and how these results inform the following  
year’s plan can be found in each of the board 
committee reports.
Chairman
The chairman’s performance was highly rated and his 
relationship with all board members identified as a 
particular strength.

other things by the results of the board evaluation 
process and will include:

of the strategy
• Monitoring the effectiveness and performance  
of the organisation 
• Application of security technology in the business
• Induction and integration of new board members

Nomination Committee Chairman
Board composition
In January 2017, the Nomination Committee met to 
discuss the adjustments that should be made to the 
composition of the Audit Committee following the 
sudden onset of a medical condition, which prevented 
Ian Springett from taking on his role as chair of the  
Audit Committee. 
Based on the information available at the time, the 
Nomination Committee considered the interim steps 
that should be taken to ensure the Audit Committee 
carried on operating effectively. Mindful of the Code and 
DTR 7.1 requirements with regard to the composition 
of the Audit Committee, the committee reviewed the 
skills and experience of the board members and 
identified Paul Spence, who had strong and effective 
leadership and communication skills, and was already a 
member of the Audit Committee as well as chair of the 
Risk Committee, and Winnie Fok, who had accounting 
qualifications and audit experience and who was 
previously a member of the Audit Committee. 
The Nomination Committee went on to recommend to 
the board Paul’s appointment as interim chair of the Audit 
Committee and that of Winnie as an additional member.
On 20 June 2017, due to continued ill-health, Ian 
Springett retired from the board. The Zygos Partnership 
(Zygos) was appointed to assist with the search for a 
new non-executive director qualified to act as the 
chairman of the Audit Committee. Zygos, who has no 
connection with the company other than as provider  
of recruitment consultancy services to the Nomination 
Committee, was provided with a brief, setting out the 
requirements for the role to be filled and preferred 
attributes of potential candidates. In selecting candidates, 
consideration was given to the skills and competence 
required to fill the role, the need to maintain and 
enhance diversity of relevant skills and experience  
on the board, as well as corporate culture and fit. 
Shortlisted candidates were then interviewed by the 
chairman, the members of the committee as well as  
the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer. 
The recruitment process initiated by the Nomination 
Committee led to the appointment on 1 January 2018 
of John Ramsay. 
Succession planning
Succession planning is very much a matter for the board 
as a whole and is considered by the board at least once 
a year. This year, as in previous years, the entire board 
reviewed succession plans as well as talent management 
and development for the senior management team. 
In addition, at its December meeting, the Nomination 
Committee reviewed and discussed the results of the 
board evaluation, current skills and experience available 
on the board. Discussing what further skills or 
experience may be useful to enable the board to 
support the developing needs of the Group helps inform 
future board recruitments. 
The committee also gave further consideration to board 
succession plans. Clare Spottiswoode having indicated 
that she would not seek re-election at the company’s 
2018 AGM, the committee initiated a search for a new 
Responsibilities
The Nomination Committee’s remit covers broadly five 
areas, namely, board composition, making 
recommendations to the board on appointments with  
a view to maintaining a balance of skills and experience

“2017 was again a busy year for the Nomination 
Committee. Adjustments to committee composition 
were required after a sudden onset of ill-health forced a 
newly appointed non-executive director to take a leave 
of absence before retiring from the board. Subsequently 
a new non-executive director qualified to act as 
chairman of the Audit Committee was recruited. 
The committee also focused on identifying and planning 
for the long-term needs of the company.”

and Zygos was appointed to assist with the search. A 
tailored brief, setting out the particular requirements for 
the role was developed and provided to Zygos. 
Consideration was given to the need for potential 
candidates to possess a range of skills and experience 
allowing them to make a meaningful and broad 
contribution to the board.
Diversity
Diversity is a matter for the board as a whole and is an 
integral part of succession planning and recruitment for 
the board and senior management team. The board’s 
approach to diversity is set out on page 74.
The Nomination Committee seeks assistance from 
executive search agencies which are signatories of the 
Voluntary Code of Conduct to help ensure the most 
diverse talent pools are reached and an approach in line 
with best practice is adopted. 
Consideration is also given to diversity when reviewing 
board composition and the result of the annual board 
performance evaluation.
Directors’ length of service
As part of its annual review of the board composition, 
the Nomination Committee reviews the directors’ 
length of service. In line with our Remuneration Policy, 
executive directors have a rolling service contract, 
whereas non-executive directors are appointed for an 
initial term of two years. Further information about the 
key feature of the executive directors’ service contracts 
and non-executive directors’ letters of appointment can 
be found on page 112.

John Daly’s term of appointment, which was due to 
expire in June 2017, was considered by the Nomination 
Committee in May. The committee was satisfied that 
John continues to remain independent and committed 
to his role as a director and as chairman of the 
Remuneration Committee. 
In coming to this conclusion, the committee took into 
account his experience, qualities and skills, as well as his 
other commitments. The committee recommended to 
the board that his appointment be extended. 
Committees composition
In December, the committee reviewed the composition 
of the committees of the board. Taking into account the 
balance of skills and experience on each committee, it 
was felt that Steve Mogford, as a current serving CEO 
with experience of delivery of complex programmes, 
would bring additional relevant expertise to the Risk 
Committee and that John Ramsay’s extensive 
experience in emerging markets would enable him to 
make a valuable contribution to the CSR Committee. 
Committee performance
The performance of the Nomination Committee was 
reviewed as part of the process undertaken by each of 
the board committees, with assistance from Lintstock.
Although the committee was considered to be effective, 
greater emphasis on succession planning was identified 
as an area for increased focus, and is included as a key 
area for the committee’s work in 2018. The committee 
will also continue to ensure that it has appropriate plans 
for board and executive succession, which promote 
diversity of gender and social and ethnic backgrounds.

CSR Committee Chair
Responsibilities
The Group takes a holistic approach to corporate and 
social responsibility. The scale of the Group, geographic 
spread of its activities and the complex environments 
our employees operate in creates a variety of challenges. 
The CSR Committee was established in 2011 to review 
and monitor the Group’s CSR approach, which includes 
developing policies on various CSR-related matters for 
consideration by the board and to review and monitor 
how the Group performs against relevant policies. 
It oversees reporting on CSR matters and progress 
made during the year. Further details of the committee’s 
responsibilities can be found in the committee’s terms 
of reference which are available at g4s.com/investors. 
Specific issues
The CSR Committee receives regular updates on current 
issues from the human resources and CSR teams.
In late August 2017, G4S became aware of allegations 
regarding the conduct and behaviour of a number of 
staff at Brook House Immigration Removal Centre. 
In response to these allegations, G4S took immediate 
action to strengthen the safeguarding of detainees at 
Brook House. Together with the UK Home Office, an 
action plan was agreed and a joint working party created 
to oversee its implementation. The actions outlined in 
the plan are well underway and many have been 
completed. The key objective throughout has been  
to ensure that detainees are safe at Brook House.
Investigations into staff conduct resulted in the dismissal 
of six members of staff. The committee has received 
regular updates on the measures that have been taken 
to address the issues raised, and on progress of 
investigations and operational improvement plans. I 
visited the centre personally in December to discuss the 
issues with managers, staff and detainees on site and to 
see the progress first hand.
We have commissioned Verita, a specialist consultancy, 
to carry out an independent review to understand the 
extent and root causes of the issues at Brook House. The 
review is examining G4S’ management, operational and 
staffing arrangements and the practices and behaviour of 
G4S’ staff. It is also assessing how G4S oversees the care 
and welfare of detainees, including in relation to 
mental-health issues, self-harm, violence prevention,  
use of force and proper reporting of incidents. 
The review is led by Kate Lampard CBE, a former 
barrister and vice chair of the South of England Strategic 
Health Authority and of the Financial Ombudsman 
Services Limited. The findings will be presented directly 
to the Home Office and the CSR Committee.
Culture and values
As a principal risk for the Group, culture and values  
as well as ethical compliance were reviewed by the 
board as a whole during the year. In addition, the CSR 
Committee oversees the programme supporting the 
embedding of the values across the Group including  
in all HR processes, from recruitment through to 
evaluation and performance management. The 
committee also reviewed and discussed the various

THE CSR COMMITTEE
Committee membership during 2017
 Member Since
Clare Spottiswoode (Chair) January 2012
Winnie Kin Wah Fok March 2012
Paul Spence January 2013
John Ramsay joined the board and the CSR Committee on  
1 January 2018.
Other regular attendees include the chief executive officer for 
care & justice services, the regional president for the Africa 
region, the group corporate affairs director and the group  
HR director.
There were three scheduled meetings and one unscheduled 
meeting of the CSR Committee during 2017. Members’ 
attendance at committee meetings is shown on page 74. 
“Our people and values underpin everything we do.  
Our updated values are the standards which we have  
set for ourselves, the organisation as a whole and our 
stakeholders. In 2016 they were re-launched across the 
Group supported by a targeted communications 
programme, awareness building and training materials. 
The committee will continue to work to ensure that the 
values are embedded firmly throughout the entire 
organisation. This is my last statement as chairman of  
the CSR Committee. After almost eight years as a 
non-executive director, I will step down from the board 
and its committees at the conclusion of the company’s 
annual general meeting in May. I am pleased that since 
joining G4S in 2010, CSR has become firmly embedded  
in the Group’s processes and forms an integral part of 
our overall strategy.
Despite a distinct improvement in work-related fatalities 
in 2017, the committee’s focus on health and safety will 
continue to remain a key part of its activity during 2018, 
as we re-affirm our goal of zero-harm.”
82 G4S plc Integrated Report and Accounts 2017
Corporate governance report continued initiatives that supported the launch of the values, 
including training for management and front-line 
employees and enhanced communication of the 
whistleblowing arrangements to all employees. 
Health and safety 
As part of the CSR Committee’s focus on health and 
safety during the year, the committee oversaw an 
initiative to refresh health and safety induction training 
for front-line employees and the re-issue of a simplified 
firearms policy across the Group. 
As part of its normal cycle of work, the committee 
received regular health and safety reports including 
updates on on-going initiatives and details of future plans 
and summaries of incidents. 
Sadly, in 2017, 25 employees lost their lives in work-
related incidents. Although this is a significant reduction 
over previous years, in part, as a result of a reduction in 
road traffic accident fatalities, the focus and work of 
health and safety professionals and management teams 
in this area will continue. We will build on this progress 
and re-affirm our goal of zero harm. To further this 
endeavour and as mentioned last year, in 2017 the CSR 
Committee reviewed and supported the adoption of a 
new and consistent definition of High Potential Incidents 
(“HPIs”) and the embedding of HPIs reporting across 
the Group. Work to ensure consistent reporting of HPIs 
is on-going, so as to ensure valuable insight is captured 
and efforts are focused preventatively. 
Materiality Assessment
In order to ensure that G4S’ approach to CSR remains 
focused on the areas that are most relevant to the 
business and its stakeholders, a wide-ranging materiality 
assessment of ethical and sustainability issues is carried 
out. The committee’s work also included overseeing this 
process, which is conducted with the support of an 
external facilitator every two years. 
The results, which inform future reporting and strategy, 
confirmed three core priority ethical and sustainability 
areas for the Group during 2018 and 2019:
1) Health and safety
2) Human rights
3) Anti-bribery and corruption
The assessment reinforced the importance of G4S’ 
ethics, culture and values, as well as employee standards 
and behaviour in preventing issues and poor 
performance across the Group’s core priorities and 
other CSR matters.
Further information can be found at g4s.com/csr.
Integrated CSR reporting 
The Group’s approach to corporate and social 
responsibility is now firmly embedded in the Group’s 
business processes, from employee recruitment and 
supplier management to bidding and contract delivery. As 
a result, during the year the CSR Committee considered 
whether the CSR approach and activities should continue 
to be reported on a standalone basis in a separate report 
or whether it was more appropriate to integrate CSR 
activities fully with the company’s annual report and 
accounts. It was decided that a fully-integrated report was 
more representative of the Group’s approach. 
Committee performance
The assessment of the committee’s performance, 
conducted as part of the overall board review process 
with assistance from Lintstock, concluded that the 
committee continued to provide good oversight and 
challenge over the Group’s CSR strategy. 
For 2018, the committee will review the scope of its 
remit and activities, and continue to support the 
communication of the Group’s values and whistleblowing 
arrangement. In addition, informed by the result of the 
materiality assessment, the committee will continue to 
focus its work on issues that are material for the Group.

Responsibilities
Formed in 2013, the Risk Committee advises the board 
on the Group’s overall risk appetite, reviews and 
approves the Group’s risk management strategy, advises 
the Audit Committee and the board on risk exposures 
and reviews the level of risk within the Group. The Risk 
Committee also assesses the effectiveness of the 
Group’s risk management systems and reports thereon 
to the Audit Committee. 
The committee’s composition ensures that a broad set 
of skills and experience comes together to look at how 
the Group manages risk in the business. Further details 
can be found in the committee’s terms of reference

Other regular attendees include the group director of risk and 
internal audit.
There were four scheduled meetings held during the year 
ended 31 December 2017. Members’ attendance at committee 
meetings is shown on page 74. 
Risk governance
As part of its continued focus on risk governance,  
the committee reviewed and discussed proposed 
amendments to Group risk management policies.  
The committee also reviewed both the process and 
results of control self-assessments (CSAs) completed  
by business units across the Group on a regular basis.  
The CSAs, which cover many of the control standards 
addressing the Group’s high inherent risks, are seen  
as a positive way in which to ensure that key controls 
specified by the Group to reduce such risks are 
embedded and compliance enhanced. During the 
process, regional functional leaders review and challenge 
the results of the business units. The internal audit 
function also performs tests to identify and correct any 
potential discrepancy between the results of CSAs and 
its findings. The committee also reviewed the Group’s 
risk appetite and recommended its approval by  
the board. 
The committee also reported to the Audit Committee 
to confirm that it was satisfied that the Group’s risk 
management processes were appropriate.
Principal risks
During the year, the Risk Committee received regular 
updates on the progress of and in mitigating the Group’s 
principal risks set out on pages 62 to 65. 
Presentations on information security, laws and 
regulations, cash losses and culture and values covering 
the inherent risk, mitigations in place and management 
of the residual risk, were also received. Further details of 
the significant risks and uncertainties facing the business 
are set out on pages 60 to 65.
Major contracts and projects
Contract-risk management continues to remain a key 
area of focus for the company and the committee, 
which undertakes a review of a major contract at each 
of its meetings. 
In addition, the committee has particular oversight for 
the project developing lean-order-to-cash processes 
through the development and implementation of a 
standard IT system for the manned-security operations, 
Project Javelin. The committee receives regular reports 
on this project and oversaw the launch of the pilot 
project in Ireland in the last quarter of 2017. Further 
information about this project is set out on page 29. 
Committee performance
The committee’s performance is assessed every year.  
In 2017, the result of the assessment performed by 
Lintstock showed that the committee continued to be 
effective and to provide valuable oversight of the risk 
management framework. 
In 2018, the committee will continue its focus on major 
contracts and projects as well as principal residual risks. 
The committee also plans to increase its focus on 
operational risk and to reinforce its oversight of 
technology and innovation as well as cyber-risk.

a. Winnie Fok was previously a member of the committee 
between October 2010 and December 2012. She stepped 
down from the Audit Committee on 1 January 2018.
b. Due to continued ill health, Ian Springett retired from the 
Audit Committee and the board on 20 June 2017.
On 1 January 2018, John Ramsay joined the board and took 
over the role of chair of the Audit Committee.
Regular attendees include the chief financial officer, the group 
financial controller, the company secretary, the group director 
of risk and internal audit and representatives of the Group’s 
external auditor. The chief executive officer also attends 
meetings from time to time when invited by the chairman. 
During 2017, the chairman of the board, a chartered 
accountant who spent his executive career with Deloitte, 
also attended most meetings.
There were four scheduled meetings held during the year 
ended 31 December 2017. Members’ attendance is shown 
on page 74.
“As announced in December 2017, I joined the board on 
1 January 2018 and succeeded Paul Spence as chairman 
of the Audit Committee from the same date. Paul, who 
remains a member of the committee, was very 
supportive during the transition process and I am very 
grateful for his continued support. 
During the year, the Audit Committee’s work  
continued to focus on enhancing the Group’s control 
environment, the quality of our group financial  
reporting and the effectiveness of the external and 
internal audit processes.”
Committee membership
As reported previously, Ian Springett was appointed  
to the board and as chair of the Audit Committee with 
effect from 1 January 2017. Unfortunately, in January 
2017 Ian had to take an extended leave of absence in 
order to undergo treatment for a medical condition. 
Accordingly with effect from 20 January 2017, Paul 
Spence was appointed as chairman of the Audit 
Committee and Winnie Fok became a member. Paul 
was already a member of the committee and Winnie 
brought an accounting and audit background. 
The board was satisfied that Paul and Winnie together 
with the other members of the committee brought 
significant and relevant experience gained at senior-
management level and that the committee’s composition 
met the requirements of DTR7.1 during the year. Their 
skills and experience are set out on pages 68 and 69. 
However the Audit Committee did not have a member 
with recent financial experience. Mindful of the need  
to ensure continued application of main principle C.1  
of the code, additional steps were taken, including 
further support and training provided to the chair as  
well as the promotion of greater interaction with the  
external auditor. 
In June, due to continued ill health Mr Springett stepped 
down from the Audit Committee and the board. 
Following a search for a new non-executive director 
qualified to act as chairman of the committee,  
John Ramsay was appointed to the board and as chair  
of the Audit Committee on 1 January 2018. 
Responsibilities
The committee ensures that there is effective governance 
of the Group’s financial reporting and internal controls to 
safeguard the integrity of its financial statements and the 
adequacy of related disclosures, and assists the board in 
relation to its consideration of whether or not the annual 
report of the Group is fair, balanced and understandable. 
The committee also has oversight of the performance of 
both the internal audit function and the external auditor.
During the year, the terms of reference of the Audit 
Committee were reviewed, following which a minor 
amendment was made. The terms are available at 
g4s.com/investors.
The committee has an annual agenda, which includes 
standing items that the committee considers regularly, 
as well as specific matters that require the  
committee’s attention.
At the end of each meeting, a private session is held  
by the Audit Committee with representatives of the 
Group’s external auditor or with the Group director  
of risk and internal audit, without members of the 
executive management team being present.
After each meeting, the chairman of the committee reports 
to the board on the matters which have been discussed.

The Audit committee report Significant judgments and issues considered by the Audit Committee
The primary judgments and issues considered by the committee in the 2017 financial statements, and how these 
were addressed, were:
ONEROUS CONTRACT PROVISIONS
Description
The Group delivers certain long-term outsourcing 
services that are complex in nature. Some of those 
contracts may evolve to become loss-making, such that 
net unavoidable losses are expected over their life. This 
requires determining the net present value of estimated 
future losses in order to calculate an appropriate 
onerous contract provision. The identification and 
measurement of such provisions require significant 
judgment, given the extended time periods often 
involved and the number of variables that are not all 
within the Group’s control.
In particular, judgment is required in assessing the future 
expected revenue and costs, including: determining the 
expected impact of any profit improvement plans (PIPs), 
the level of any related lifecycle funds and the estimated 
costs for the remaining life of the contract, and an 
appropriate discount rate to apply to material future 
cash flows. 
Details of the outcome of the assessment of contract 
provisions are set out in the Chief Financial Officer’s 
Review on page 37.
Action taken
The committee reviewed in respect of each onerous 
contract, the critical assumptions provided by 
management and enquired about the judgments made, 
the robustness of the assumptions, the sensitivities to 
changes in the assumptions and the disclosure provided 
in relation to the key material judgments. 
The committee also reviewed the disclosure provided  
in relation to these contracts, and in particular in relation 
to a dispute with a subcontractor in respect of one of 
these onerous contracts.
Conclusion
The Audit Committee was satisfied that the level 
of provisions and the related disclosures as at  
31 December 2017 were appropriate.
COMPLIANCE WITH FOREIGN-OWNERSHIP RESTRICTIONS AND CONSOLIDATION OF UNDERTAKINGS 
Description
In markets where foreign ownership restrictions (FORs) 
apply, the Group seeks to ensure that it complies with 
foreign ownership laws and regulations and meets the 
relevant accounting standards (IFRS10). Professional 
advisors are typically retained to establish and maintain 
contractual ownership structures, which comply with 
local laws and regulations relating to foreign ownership. 
When restrictions apply to direct share ownership, the 
Group also exercises influence or control through 
arrangements, including shareholder agreements. 
FORs can limit the Group’s ability to do business or 
invest in certain markets and could result in a loss of 
management control. 
Consolidation of any of these entities would be at risk if 
the Group’s ability to enforce its rights of control were 
to be undermined by FORs.
Action taken
The committee reviewed the Group’s portfolio of 
investments in countries where FORs apply. 
In addition, the board reviewed the monitoring process 
in place for key markets, discussed relevant changes in 
law and regulations, their potential impact on the 
Group, and, where relevant, reviewed mitigation plans. 
The committee also received specific reports in relation 
to a number of countries.
Conclusion
The committee was satisfied with the Group’s  
processes and approach to foreign ownership and 
consolidation of undertakings. 
This will remain an area of focus to ensure that the 
committee remains abreast of changes in laws, 
regulations and standards.
86 G4S plc Integrated Report and Accounts 2017
The Audit committee report continued Description
The Group uses Adjusted PBITA as a consistent internal 
and external reporting measure of its financial 
performance, given that management views it as being 
more representative of the normal course of business 
and more comparable period to period. Adjusted PBITA 
excludes strategic restructuring costs, amortisation of 
acquisition-related intangible assets and specific and  
other separately disclosed items which the Group 
believes should be disclosed separately by virtue of their 
size, nature or incidence (see page 35 for further details). 
Judgment is required when defining those items to be 
disclosed separately and when applying the classification 
criteria to each period’s results. Further details on 
separately disclosed items are set out in note 8. 
Action taken
The Audit Committee reviewed and challenged, in light 
of the guidance issued by the FRC in December 2013, 
October 2016 and November 2017, and the results of 
the FRC review of the 2016 Integrated Report and 
Accounts, the enhanced disclosures prepared by 
management in the 2017 Integrated Report and 
Accounts (pages 35 and 36) in relation to alternative 
performance measures (APMs) and specific items.  
The committee observed that the Group’s accounting 
policies were being applied consistently from year to 
year, and considered whether specific items were being 
identified in line with Group policies and that these 
items included both debits and credits as appropriate. 
The committee also reviewed information from 
management to satisfy itself that changes in estimates 
related to items that were classified as specific items 
were treated equally and consistently as specific  
items, in particular for both increases and decreases  
of provisions.
Conclusion
The committee was satisfied that the Group’s definition 
of APMs, and in particular in relation to specific and 
other separately disclosed items, had been applied 
correctly and that the designation of specific items 
was subject to objective and balanced criteria. The 
committee noted the enhanced disclosure and 
explanation on APMs and considered that these give  
a meaningful and balanced view of the operations of  
the Group.
ALTERNATIVE PERFORMANCE MEASURES
GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TESTING
Description
The total value of the Group’s goodwill as at  
31 December 2017 was £1.9bn, a significant proportion 
of which was generated by the merger of the security 
services businesses of Group 4 Falck and Securicor in 
2004, which was accounted for as an acquisition of 
Securicor by Group 4 Falck. 
The Group tests tangible and intangible assets, including 
goodwill, for impairment on an annual basis or more 
frequently if there are indications that an impairment 
may be needed. The impairment analysis consists of the 
estimation of the recoverable amount of goodwill 
supported by the Group’s cash generating units, which 
requires significant judgment, primarily in relation to the 
achievability of long-term business plans and future cash 
flows. Such achievability is dependent on circumstances 
both within and outside management’s control, in 
relation to the discount rates adjusted to reflect risks 
specific to individual assets used, and in relation to the 
macro-economic assumptions and related modelling 
assumptions underlying the valuation process.
As a result of the annual review of the carrying value  
of goodwill, no impairment charge to goodwill was 
required (see notes 4 and 18 to the consolidated 
financial statements). The full methodology and results 
of the Group’s impairment testing, including an analysis 
of the sensitivity of goodwill to the key assumptions, are 
provided in note 18.
Action taken
The Audit Committee reviewed the methodology and 
results of the impairment tests prepared by management.
The Audit Committee reviewed the assumptions used 
in relation to long-term growth, the resulting headroom 
and the sensitivities applied by management. In addition, 
these results were considered against alternative 
valuation bases such as reference to transactions for 
similar assets in similar locations, both within the Group 
and external to the Group.
For those businesses that are expected to be sold as 
part of the strategic portfolio management programme, 
the Audit Committee reviewed the recoverable value 
on the basis of expected sale price less costs to sell. 
Finally, the Audit Committee considered the adequacy 
of the disclosures provided, particularly in respect of 
cash generating units where changes in key assumptions 
could give rise to an impairment.
Conclusion
The committee was satisfied with the carrying value of 
goodwill and related disclosures as at 31 December 2017.
Governance
Integrated Report and Accounts 2017 G4S plc 87 TAXATION
Description
The Group operates in around 90 countries and is 
therefore subject to numerous reviews by individual tax 
authorities in the ordinary course of business. In some 
countries, tax legislation is not consistently applied and 
under some complex contractual structures, the 
responsibility for tax arising is not always clear. 
Judgments and estimates are required to determine  
the appropriate amount of tax to provide for and any 
required disclosure around contingent tax liabilities at 
each period end.
Provisions for tax liabilities are estimated for existing 
matters under dispute with local tax authorities, as well 
as for matters which it is considered may be disputed by 
them, where it is probable that a future liability will arise. 
In some instances, tax reviews may result in claims being 
raised by tax authorities. Any claims are handled by the 
local legal entity in the first instance. More complex 
cases are reviewed by the Group tax function and 
provisions, where necessary, are made based on the 
best estimate of the likely outcome.
The Group recognises deferred tax assets in respect  
of temporary timing differences, mainly in relation to 
pension arrangements, fixed assets and carried forward 
losses. At 31 December 2017, total deferred tax assets 
were £240m (2016: £285m). Recognising such assets 
requires an assessment of their likely recovery through 
utilisation, which includes an assessment of the taxable 
profits expected to be made in each of the relevant 
jurisdictions in the future. Deferred tax assets can be 
affected by changes in legislation and in tax rates.
Action taken
The Audit Committee reviewed the Group’s tax 
strategy, including the tax report and tax risk 
management processes and the board approved the  
tax policy, which complies with the UK Confederation 
of British Industry’s seven tax principles.
The committee also reviewed information prepared  
by management in relation to existing or potential tax 
exposures, the adequacy of the provisions recorded, 
their treatment and disclosure in the financial statements 
and emerging matters arising from the OECD’s Base 
Erosion and Profit Shifting framework.
The committee reviewed information prepared by 
management supporting the recoverability of deferred 
tax assets, considered the period of time under which 
these assets would be recovered and made enquiries  
of the external auditor on the appropriateness of the 
Group’s tax position. The committee reviewed the 
impact of the US tax reform and in particular to the 
recognition and re-measurement of US deferred tax 
assets, and reviewed the disclosure provided in this area.
Conclusion
The committee was satisfied with the Group’s  
approach to tax, with the assessment of recoverability  
of deferred tax assets and with the accounting 
treatment and disclosure of tax exposures. 
The committee was satisfied that the disclosure 
provided in connection with the US tax reform was 
clear and appropriate
LAWS AND REGULATIONS
Description
The Group operates in many jurisdictions globally, with 
complex and diverse regulatory frameworks. Due to 
such operations, the Group faces many associated risks, 
including increasing litigation and class actions; bribery 
and corruption; obtaining operating licences; complying 
with local tax regulations; changes to and application of 
employment and employee remuneration legislation; 
complying with human rights legislation; and new or 
changed restrictions on foreign ownership. Furthermore, 
the Group may face new or changing regulations which 
may require modification of its processes and staff 
training. Not being compliant with applicable laws and 
regulations can have far-reaching consequences, 
including higher costs from claims and litigation; inability 
to operate in certain jurisdictions; loss of management 
control; and damage to the Group’s reputation.
Action taken
During the year the committee received a report from 
the Group General Counsel, analysing significant areas 
of exposure to claims and areas where in particular 
labour laws and regulations are complex and there  
is therefore an inherent risk to the judgment made 
when applying those laws and regulations. For the  
most material items, the committee was provided  
with regular updates throughout the year. 
Conclusion
The committee was satisfied that the provisions 
booked at 31 December 2017 were appropriate. 
The committee was satisfied that the disclosure for the 
judgments made in relation to contingent liabilities was 
clear and appropriate.

The Audit committee report continued RISK OF ACCOUNTING ERRORS AND MANAGEMENT OVERRIDE OF INTERNAL CONTROLS
Description
The Group operates in around 90 countries and has 
around 600 legal entities, with a significant number of 
local financial systems and processes. This leads to an 
inherently-diverse set of processes and controls that rely 
on local capabilities for implementation and execution of 
the controls. As set out on page 61, the Group has 
adopted a three-lines-of-defence model to control and 
manage risks across the Group.
Over the course of the last four years the Group has 
made significant investment in strengthening capability in 
finance, internal audit and risk, and has introduced 
additional internal controls and enhanced Group 
oversight to mitigate these risks. These include monthly 
reviews of the quality of earnings, a comprehensive 
internal audit plan and a regular cycle of reviews of local 
business unit or country balance sheets and controls.
Action taken
The committee oversaw the progress made over 
embedding minimum financial controls and received 
regular updates on the overall control environment  
of the Group, including results of internal audits, training 
and up-skilling of capabilities across the Group, as well 
as the regular reports from the external auditor and the 
output of the whistleblowing process.
The committee confirmed in particular that controls had 
been strengthened to minimise the risk of re-occurrence 
of control failures that required the restatement of the 
2014 annual results and balance sheet in the 2015 
Integrated Report and Accounts. The committee also 
considered progress made to reduce reliance on manual 
controls, by developing and integrating financial and 
operational systems across the Group.
Conclusion
The committee acknowledged the progress made in 
relation to the strengthening of controls and the plans  
in place to reduce the number of systems and reliance 
on manual controls across the Group, but noted that, 
although good progress has been made to date, 
significant work remains to be done.
Viability statement
 At the March 2018 meeting, the committee reviewed  
a paper prepared by management which examined the 
longer-term solvency and viability of the Group. The 
committee tested the underlying assumptions and 
analysis performed by management, reviewed assurance 
work carried out and considered the appropriateness of 
the timeframe of the assessment. The committee was 
satisfied that the three-year period covered by the 
viability statement remains appropriate in that it aligns 
with the Group’s regular business planning period, over 
which management has a reasonable level of confidence 
in its projections reflecting the life cycle of the majority 
of the Group’s contracts, and takes account of the 
limited visibility on material bidding opportunities in  
the pipeline beyond that period. The committee also 
reviewed and challenged the outcome of the stress-
testing of projections by management.
The committee recommended to the board that the 
directors confirm that they have a reasonable 
expectation that the Group will be able to continue in 
operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over  
the three-year period of the assessment, as set out  
on page 92.
Fair, balanced and understandable
One of the key compliance requirements of a group’s 
financial statements is for the annual report, taken as  
a whole, to be fair, balanced and understandable. 
Guidelines on Alternative Performance Measures 
(APMs) were issued by the European Securities and 
Markets Authority (ESMA) and have been applicable 
since July 2016. In addition, the FRC issued a “Frequently 
Asked Questions” guidance document and published 
the results of its thematic review on this matter in 
November 2017. The committee considered each of 
the above in assessing whether the Group’s annual 
report was fair, balanced and understandable.
The committee reviewed a paper setting out the 
approach taken by management in the preparation  
of the annual report to ensure it met the requirements  
of the FRC’s Code and the ESMA guidance, including 
the reasons for and clear explanation of the non-GAAP 
measures used by the Group in reporting its results  
for the year. The paper described the process and 
procedures followed and detailed the steps taken in 
each of the sections of the annual report to ensure that 
the information presented was complete and accurate. 
This paper also described the review processes carried 
out internally to ensure that the annual report is fair, 
balanced and understandable. In addition, an external 
verification exercise was carried out to confirm that  
the information contained in the annual report is 
supported either by factual evidence, or by confirmation 
from management where such information is a 
statement of belief or intent. 
The committee was satisfied with the work performed 
and advised the board that the annual report, taken as  
a whole, presents a fair, balanced and understandable 
view of the business and its performance for the year 
under review.
Governance
Integrated Report and Accounts 2017 G4S plc 89 Internal control
Since 2013, the Group has had a heightened focus  
on improving systems of internal control and risk 
management for financial reporting. The main features  
of these control systems include clearly-defined reporting 
lines and authorisation procedures, a comprehensive 
budgeting and monthly reporting system, written policies 
and procedures and the use of a single global 
consolidation system for internal management reporting, 
budgeting and planning as well as for external reporting.
The system is designed to ensure the integrity of 
financial reporting and the committee’s responsibility is 
to ensure that these internal controls remain effective. 
The committee does this primarily through receiving 
reports from management, from the internal audit 
function and from the external auditor.
The committee reviewed progress on the strengthening 
of internal controls, and on plans to continue progress, 
which included a targeted audit plan for 2017 from 
Group Internal Audit for those areas where issues  
have been identified.
The committee also considered the plans being 
implemented by management to reduce reliance on 
manual controls, through the gradual implementation 
and integration of new financial systems.
Further details on internal controls are set out on page 
61. The Audit Committee confirmed to the board that 
although it is satisfied that the Group’s risk management 
and internal control processes and procedures are 
appropriate and effective, the need for continued focus 
on enhancing the internal control environment remains.
Internal audit
During 2017, the internal audit function focused on 
assessing the effectiveness of a broader set of mandated 
controls including Minimum Financial Controls, HR Core 
Standards, Driver and Firearms Controls, Human Rights 
and Anti-Bribery and Corruption, with the goal of 
focusing local management on the most material control 
issues specific to their local environment. 
The Group finance function and Regional Audit 
Committees also provided support to assist in driving 
improvements where appropriate. 
The internal audit function continued to provide support 
and guidance to business units to improve awareness 
of and compliance with Minimum Financial Controls. 
In 2018, internal audits will continue to test the 
operational effectiveness of the Group’s standards and 
controls. Precise coverage in each country will be 
determined through risk assessment.
External audit
Following an audit tender process during 2014 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC) was appointed as 
the Group’s new external auditor for the 2015 financial 
year. PwC was subsequently re-appointed for the 2016 
financial year and at the 2017 AGM to hold office until 
the next AGM. Richard Hughes has been lead audit 
partner since the beginning of 2015.
During the year, the committee reviewed PwC’s Group 
audit plan including the scope to be undertaken as well  
as their reports on external audit findings, with particular 
focus on the areas set out above. The committee also 
had private sessions with the external auditor both during 
the year and at the end of a number of Audit Committee 
meetings, and approved the fee for the external audit. 
The committee also considered and approved the 
representation letter to be issued to the auditor.
In addition, in March 2017, the committee reviewed the 
report of the FRC on its review of PwC’s audit of the 
2015 Integrated Report and Accounts.
Non-audit services
To ensure that the independence of the audit is not 
compromised, the committee has put a policy in place 
covering the non-audit services that can be provided by 
the external auditor, the relevant approval process for 
certain services, and detailing those services which the 
auditor is prohibited from providing. 
In essence, the external auditor is prohibited from 
providing services that could create a conflict of interest, 
result in the audit firm auditing its own work, or result in 
the performance of management functions. Examples  
of non-permitted services are actuarial services, book-
keeping services, internal audit outsourcing services and 
legal services.
The committee has pre-approved certain services which 
can be provided by the auditor subject to specified fee 
limits, above which further approval is required. All other 
services would require prior approval by the committee. 
Every year, the Audit Committee reviews its policy on the 
provision of non-audit services by the external auditor.
The auditor, PwC, has written to the Audit Committee 
confirming that, in its opinion, it was independent for 
the period through to 8 March 2018.
Details of the fees paid for audit services, audit-related 
services and non-audit services can be found in note 10 
to the consolidated financial statements.
Effectiveness of the external auditor
A combination of formal and informal processes is used 
in the assessment of the effectiveness of the external 
audit process.
A formal questionnaire is completed at the end of the 
audit by members of the Audit Committee, by the 
Group finance department and by the finance directors 
of significant operations across the Group, and the 
results of those questionnaires are reviewed by the 
Audit Committee. The assessment of the external audit 
for 2017 concluded that it remained effective and that 
the external auditor is independent.
FRC review of the 2016 Integrated Report and 
Accounts
During the year, the Group received a letter from the 
FRC confirming that the Annual Report for the year 
ended 31 December 2016 had been subject to a limited 
review by its Conduct Committee, which is responsible 
for reviewing and investigating the annual accounts, 
directors’ and strategic reports of UK public companies. 
90 G4S plc Integrated Report and Accounts 2017
The Audit committee report continued The key areas of focus were in relation to the use of 
alternative performance measures and compliance with 
the ESMA Guidelines and the commentary provided on 
IFRS measures in the strategic report. 
As a result of on-going discussions with the FRC as part 
of its enquiry, we have considered the labelling of the 
alternative performance measures used and provided 
enhanced disclosure and explanations on page 44. We 
have also provided further and clearer narrative on 
financial performance based on statutory measures,  
on pages 38 to 43.
CMA Order Compliance 
The G4S Group audit was put out to tender in 2014, 
following which PwC were appointed with effect  
from 2015. 
The committee confirms that the company has 
complied with the Audit Services for Large Companies 
(Mandatory Use of Competitive Tender Processes and 
Audit Committee Responsibilities) Order 2004. 
Committee performance
The assessment of the committee’s performance, 
conducted with assistance from Lintstock, concluded 
that the committee had performed well during 2017,  
in particular in reviewing the quality of the Group’s 
financial reporting. 
In 2018, the committee will support the induction of its 
new chair, review internal and external audit coverage  
in light of the changing shape of the Group and in 
conjunction with the CSR Committee, refine the 
whistleblowing process further.
John Ramsay
Audit Committee Chairman
RISK MANAGEMENT AND INTERNAL CONTROL
The directors acknowledge their responsibility for the 
Group’s systems of risk management and internal 
control and for reviewing their effectiveness each year. 
The main features of these control systems include 
clearly-defined reporting lines and authorisation 
procedures, a comprehensive budgeting and monthly 
reporting system, written policies and procedures and 
the use of a single global consolidation system for 
internal management reporting, budgeting and planning 
as well as external reporting. While the Audit 
Committee has primary responsibility on the board’s 
behalf, a separate committee of the board, the Risk 
Committee, was set up in 2013 as part of the Group’s 
heightened focus on improving systems of internal 
control and risk management. 
The board, through the Risk Committee, has carried 
out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the 
company and of how those risks might affect the 
prospects of the company. The principal risks and their 
possible impact on the company and the mitigations 
taken, are set out on pages 62 to 65.Through the Audit 
Committee, the board conducted a review of the 
effectiveness of the systems of internal control during 
the year. The systems are designed to manage rather 
than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business 
objectives, and can only provide reasonable and not 
absolute assurance against material misstatement or 
loss. The enterprise risk management governance 
model, described on page 61 sets out some of the key 
features of the Group’s risk-management process 
which was in place throughout the year under review.
During the year, the Risk Committee reviewed the 
Group’s risk appetite, which was considered and 
approved by the board. Further information on the 
work of the Risk Committee in relation to the risk 
management framework, including the Group’s risk 
appetite, can be found in the report of the Risk 
Committee on page 84. 
Whilst further improvement has been made in the 
effective performance of internal controls during  
the year, given the number of countries in which the 
Group operates and the variety of systems used there 
is still opportunity for improvement in the operational 
effectiveness of mandated controls and this will 
continue to be a focus during 2018. 
The Audit Committee has confirmed that, although  
it is satisfied that the Group’s risk management and 
internal control processes are appropriate and 
effective, the need for continued focus on enhancing 
the internal control environment remains. Further 
information on the work of the Audit Committee in 
this respect can be found in the Audit Committee 
report on page 85. The board has reviewed the 
Group’s risk management and internal control systems 
for the year to 31 December 2017 by considering 
reports from the Audit Committee and the Risk 
Committee and has also taken account of events since 
31 December 2017.
Governance
Integrated Report and Accounts 2017 G4S plc 91
Corporate governance report VIABILITY STATEMENT
FAIR BALANCED AND UNDERSTANDABLE
In accordance with provision C.2.2 of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code 2016, the directors have 
assessed the viability of the Group over a three year 
period, aligned with that of the Group’s rolling planning 
cycle, taking into account the Group’s current position 
and the potential impact of the principal risks 
documented on pages 62 to 65. Extension of viability 
testing beyond three years is seen by the Group as 
being of limited value because of the following factors:
• The majority of the Group’s contracts are less than 
three years in duration;
• The correlation of demand for security services 
with the global economy; and
• The impact of the Group’s on-going productivity 
programme. 
The Group’s prospects are assessed primarily through 
its bottom-up strategic planning process. The overall 
strategy for the Group was refreshed comprehensively 
in November 2013 and the board has monitored 
progress closely against this strategy as well as the risks 
to its success. The 2017 process commenced in June 
with each country and business unit updating its rolling 
three-year strategic plan and considering the risks to 
achievement of that plan. These plans were reviewed 
and refined by regional management and then by the 
Group Executive Committee before being reviewed 
by the board in October 2017. The key assumptions 
in the financial forecasts, reflecting the overall  
strategy, include: 
• A continued demand for security services, as set 
out on page 8 of the strategic report; 
• An ability to continue to drive through our 
productivity programmes and to flex the cost base, 
as set out on pages 28 to 29; and 
• Continuing to deliver good operating cash flow 
performance as set out on pages 30 and 31.
The output of this plan is used as the baseline for 
stress-testing covenant and headroom analysis. This 
analysis includes sensitivity analysis to changes in 
trading conditions affecting profit growth and the 
capital needs of the business, as well as the principal 
residual risks.
The vast majority of the Group’s risks exist at an 
individual country level and are individually immaterial. 
The principal residual risks described on pages 62 to 
65 are an aggregate view of individual risks captured in 
country, region and Group functional risk registers. 
These wide-ranging risks are highly unlikely to 
crystallise simultaneously and it is therefore unlikely 
that such risks would have a material impact on the 
Group’s financial position. Nevertheless, the Group 
has sensitised its three-year financial projections for 
the following risks: 
a)  Potential loss of certain of the Group’s top 
customers; 
b)  Potential adverse changes in foreign ownership 
legislation resulting in cessation of material  
business lines; 
c)  Potential claims from major contracts resulting in 
material settlement payments; and 
d)  Litigation or Class Action claims resulting in material 
legal costs and settlement payments. 
The directors consider that this stress-test assessment 
of the Group’s prospects is reasonable in the 
circumstances. The directors have also considered the 
debt maturities in 2019 and 2020 as indicated on page 
31 under the stress test scenarios and concluded that 
the Group would be able to meet its maturities as 
they fall due with the existing facilities currently in 
place, without the need to access the financial markets. 
Based on this assessment, the directors have  
a reasonable expectation that the Group will be  
able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities  
as they fall due over the three financial years to  
31 December 2020.
The preparation of the Integrated Report and Accounts 
is co-ordinated by the finance, investor relations and 
company secretariat teams with group-wide support 
and input from other areas of the business. 
Comprehensive reviews were undertaken at regular 
intervals throughout the process by senior 
management and other contributing personnel  
within the Group. 
The process was reviewed by the Audit Committee 
and the board has reviewed a paper setting out the 
governance relating to the preparation of the report 
prepared by management. 
The board has separately considered the disclosures  
in the Integrated Report and Accounts and has 
concluded that they are fair, balanced and 
understandable. 
The statement required to be given by the directors 
by Code provision C.1.1 can be found on page 119.

Responsibilities
The Remuneration Committee is responsible for 
overseeing all elements of the remuneration of 
the executive directors, other members of the 
Group Executive Committee and the chairman  
of the board.
It also agrees with the board the framework  
and policy for the remuneration of other senior 
managers of the Group and reviews and 
recommends to the board the remuneration  
of the company secretary.
In determining remuneration policy, the committee 
takes into account a variety of legal and regulatory 
requirements and the relevant provisions of the 
UK Corporate Governance Code.
The committee also determines policy on the 
duration, notice period and termination payments 
under the contracts with the executive directors, 
with a view to recognising service to the company 
whilst ensuring that failure is not rewarded and 
that the duty to mitigate loss is recognised.
The committee approves the design and 
determines the measures and formulae for 
performance-related pay schemes operated by 
the company. It approves the eligibility of 
executive directors and other Group Executive 
Committee members for annual bonuses and 
benefits under long-term incentive plans and 
assesses performance against the objectives of 
those plans. No directors are involved in 
determining their own remuneration. 
The committee’s terms of reference are available 
on the Company’s website at g4s.com/investors.
Our remuneration approach
We seek to attract and retain the best people 
whilst ensuring that the remuneration policy and 
practice drive behaviours that are in the long-
term interests of the company and its 
shareholders.

Directors’ remuneration report Business context and performance
In 2017, management delivered another year of 
profitable growth and good cash generation, enabling 
continued investment in growth, technology and 
productivity programmes, while continuing to strengthen 
the balance sheet. Our leadership team continues to 
demonstrate commitment to the long-term success  
of the business and I am pleased to report that they 
produced core business revenue growth of 3.2%, 
Adjusted PBITA increase of 4.2%, Adjusted EPS growth 
of 5.9% and a reduction in net debt to Adjusted 
EBITDA of 2.4x from 2.8x at the end of 2016. Further 
details are set out in the chief executive officer’s 
introduction to the Strategic Review on pages 4 to 7.
2017 Remuneration outcomes
Pay review – As reported last year, the CEO’s salary 
was increased by 1.5% effective from 1 January 2017 
and that of the CFO, who was appointed in October 
2016, remained the same. The increase awarded to the 
executive directors was in line with the increase 
applicable to Group employees and most managers 
based in the UK.
Annual Bonus – The Group’s financial performance, 
together with individual performance against strategic 
objectives, supports a high level of annual bonus pay-out 
for the executive directors. Recognising the impact of 
trading conditions in the Middle East & India during 
2017, the executive directors recommended a 
reduction equivalent to 10% of base pay be applied to 
their bonus payments. The Remuneration Committee 
commended this initiative and approved the proposal, 
which resulted in payments, after adjustment, of 79.5% 
of maximum opportunity for the CEO and 69.5% of 
maximum opportunity for the CFO.
Long term incentive plan – In line with our commitment 
to ensure that our remuneration framework aligns with 
our strategy and promotes the long-term success of 
G4S, a significant part of performance-related reward is 
delivered through shares. Given the growth in earnings 
and strong operating cash-flow over the three years 
from 2015 to 2017, awards that were granted in 2015 
vested at a level of 62%.
Further information on the levels of executive 
remuneration earned in 2017, including performance 
against the relevant targets, is given on pages 96 to 98.
Key areas of focus in 2017
Remuneration Policy and approach
During 2016, the committee carried out a thorough 
review of our remuneration policy and found that the 
policy approved by shareholders in 2014 continued to 
operate effectively. Therefore, no substantive changes 
were made to the Directors’ Remuneration Policy 
submitted for shareholders’ approval at our AGM last 
May. The policy received a high level of support with 
97.26% of favourable votes, for which I am grateful. 
During 2017, the committee undertook a further review 
of our current remuneration practices taking account of 
the overall approach and structure of employee reward 
across the Group, developments in remuneration for 
executives in the global market as well as views of the 
investor community. The committee together with its 
advisor is developing a package of measures, in relation 
to which consultation with major shareholders will take 
place during the latter part of 2018, with a view to 
finalising an up-to-date policy for submission to 
shareholders’ approval at our AGM in 2019. Key areas 
where changes are being considered include the 
introduction of a two-year holding period post vesting 
of shares for awards to the Group executive committee 
under our long-term incentive plan and an increase in 
the shareholding requirements. The level of company 
pension contributions for future executive appointments 
is also under review. 
Our stakeholders
The committee considers shareholders’ views via 
consultation and wider stakeholders’ views through 
reviews of regular reports from the committee’s advisor 
on market and governance developments. During the 
year, the committee also reviewed the analysis and 
results of the UK gender pay gap reporting 
requirements. It is also aware of institutional investors’ 
views, including the Investment Associations’ Principles 
of Remuneration published in November 2017 and 
intends to consider the implications of the revised UK 
Corporate Governance Code once it is finalised and 
published later in the year. 
Governance
With a view to refocusing the work of the committee 
and updating some of the committee’s duties such  
as its reporting obligations, the committee reviewed  
and approved for recommendation to the board, a  
number of amendments to its terms of reference. 
The committee’s revised terms of reference are 
available on the company’s website at g4s.com/investors. 
UK Code Compliance
The company had in place malus and clawback before 
their introduction became a feature of the revised UK 
Corporate Governance Code. These are explained  
on page 111.
The committee is also conscious of the Code’s 
requirement that executive directors’ remuneration 
should be designed to promote the long-term success 
of the company – and that performance-related 
elements of remuneration should be transparent, 
stretching and applied rigorously.

Directors’ remuneration report continued Implementation of remuneration in 2018
Pay review
For 2018, the CEO and CFO’s base pay has been 
increased by 2%. This pay review took account of 
market salary trends as well as salary increases 
elsewhere in the Group. 
The increase awarded to the executive directors was  
in line with the increase applicable to Group employees 
and most managers based in the UK.
Incentives
The bonus opportunity and LTIP award levels remain 
unchanged in 2018, both of which are subject to caps  
as set out in the Remuneration Policy on pages 107  
to 115.
In relation to bonus, the committee seeks to set targets 
that support the overarching strategy, reflecting the 
business context for the relevant period. Targets are 
also intended to be stretching whilst remaining 
achievable and are compatible with the Group’s risk 
appetite. The committee is confident that the targets  
set meet these criteria.
The long-term incentive plan introduced in 2014 
received overwhelming support from shareholders and 
will continue to operate in 2018.
The committee’s performance 
Consistent with our practice every year, a formal review  
of the committee’s performance was carried out at the 
end of 2017. 
Details of the process for board and committee 
performance evaluations are set out on page 67.
The review concluded that the committee continues to 
be effective and to perform well. It also highlighted the 
committee’s awareness of its key role, as the Group’s 
new organisational structures bed in and delivery of the 
strategic objectives gains momentum, in continuing to 
focus on ensuring that the Group’s remuneration 
practices enable the Group to attract, retain and reward 
the high calibre individuals and talent it needs to deliver 
long-term sustainable success.
Voting on remuneration
The annual report on remuneration will be put to an 
advisory vote at this year’s AGM, and we look forward 
to receiving shareholders’ support once again this year.
I will be available to answer questions and listen to the 
views of our shareholders at the forthcoming AGM.

Notes:
1. The 2016 base pay figure for Mr Weller includes £122,145 received between the date of his appointment as an executive director  
on 24 October 2016 until the end of the year, as well as fees in an amount of £50,034 for his role as a non-executive director of  
the company. 
2. Benefits include car allowance, business-related travel, healthcare, disability and life assurance. Benefit values include the cost of certain 
travel, overnight accommodation, meals and memberships which HMRC treats as a taxable benefit and on which the company has 
paid, or will in due course pay, as it does not consider such expenses to be benefits in the ordinary tax sense. The grossed-up amounts 
for 2017 are £71,706 (2016: £61,544) for Ashley Almanza. Benefit values also include local travel costs of £10,420 (2016: £17,384) for 
Ashley Almanza who bears the tax himself, and contain other business costs which HMRC deems to be benefits.
3. Any bonus due above 50% of the individual’s maximum bonus entitlement is awarded as deferred shares, which vest after a period of 
three years unless the individual ceases employment prior to the third anniversary and qualifies as a good leaver, in which case release 
of such deferred shares occurs shortly after termination of employment. 2017 bonus figures are adjusted figures, following the exercise 
of the committee’s discretion to reduce bonus pay-outs, as recommended by the executive directors. Further information regarding 
2017 bonus performance and resulting pay-outs is set out on page 97 and 98.
4. In addition, for 2017, Ashley Almanza received a fee of $88,500 from Noble Corporation from his non-executive directorship referred 
to on page 112, and retained such remuneration (2016: $95,000 and $316,674 of fee and shares respectively). For 2016, Mr Almanza 
also received £37,618 from Schroders plc before stepping down from its board in April 2016. Mr Weller received and retained 
£17,000 from the Carbon Trust for his non-executive directorship during the year under review (2016: £3,214). 
5. Values in the LTIP column relate to the 2015 LTIP due to vest on 20 March 2018. Since the share price on the date of vesting is unknown 
at the date of this report, the figures provided are estimates calculated using the average market value over the last quarter of the year 
under review, i.e. 266.59p per share. Further information regarding performance and vesting of the 2015 LTIP is set out on page 99.

Directors’ remuneration report continued 2017 Annual bonus
During the financial year ended 31 December 2017, the performance measures relating to the annual bonus 
scheme rules were consistent with the Remuneration Policy, with 85% of the bonus for Ashley Almanza and  
70% for Mr Weller being based on achievement of challenging financial performance measures. The financial 
performance measures were based on budgeted Group earnings (excluding specific and other separately disclosed 
items) and budgeted Group operating cash flow before capital expenditure. For threshold performance, 35% of 
maximum entitlement would pay out with on-target performance resulting in a payment of 60% of maximum 
entitlement, with 100% only being earned in the event of achievement of a stretch performance significantly in 
excess of budget. The element of bonus determined for each financial performance measure is calculated by 
interpolating actual achievement against the range between the minimum i.e. entry threshold and the maximum 
target to achieve maximum performance. 
The remaining 15% of the bonus for Mr Almanza and 30% for Mr Weller was linked to objectives relating to 
non-financial performance. These consisted of personal objectives or related to the organisation and were linked to 
specific elements of the Group’s strategy for which the particular director had responsibility. Each executive director 
has a number of strategic performance measures linked to areas that the committee has agreed for the year. The 
committee reviews the progress in each area and then makes an assessment as to whether the executive has 
performed in accordance with expectations.
The maximum bonus potential remained unchanged from 2016 at 150% of base pay for both Messrs Almanza and 
Weller. Bonuses are paid in cash up to 50% of maximum entitlement. Where the bonus amount is in excess of 50% 
of the maximum bonus potential, the amount which exceeds 50% is delivered in the form of a deferred share award 
which vests after a period of three years. 
The tables below show how pay was linked to performance in 2017 and set out details of each of the financial 
measures, the targets in respect of these measures and the actual outcomes:

Personal objectives
Mr Almanza was able to earn up to 15% of the maximum bonus potential for achieving personal objectives. These 
were designed to align with the strategic priorities for 2017 (see pages 32 and 33) and were set out in the 2016 
Directors' Remuneration report. 
Mr Almanza’s 2017 personal objectives consisted of improving health and safety performance, updating the growth 
and innovation strategy, continuing to strengthen the global leadership team and achieving substantial completion of 
the strategic portfolio programme. 
Personal Objective Achievement Performance Rating
Health and safety Clear and visible focus and leadership on safety has resulted  
in significant performance improvement in 2017 with 25  
work related fatalities, a reduction from 47 in 2016. This 
demonstrates the results of a culture change programme 
incorporating leadership behaviour, capability building and 
performance management.
As a result of the significant improvements 
and progress in these areas the assessment 
against non-financial objectives for the 
Group CEO was agreed as 11 out  
of 15 points.
  Global leadership team With effect from 1 January 2018, the group-wide management  
of our core business has been reorganised. This resulted in new 
appointments for five of the Group Executive Committee, 
including a new external hire. The new organisation will enable 
the further strengthening of strategic, commercial and operational 
focus in each of the core service lines. 
Growth and Innovation The Group made clear progress growing new technology 
services in both Cash Solutions and Secure Solutions 
Portfolio programme The Group has substantially completed the strategic portfolio 
programme established a few years ago. This has improved 
profitability and raised over £500 million in gross proceeds.

Personal objectives
Mr Weller was able to earn up to 30% of the maximum bonus potential for achieving personal objectives. The 
personal objectives for the CFO role were set at the beginning of the year to align with the strategic priorities for 
2017. These were set out in the 2016 Directors Remuneration report and focused on three key areas, namely 
organisational efficiency and finance functions, delivery of integrated IT systems and procurement efficiency. 
 
Personal Objective Achievement Performance Rating
Organisation efficiency There has been continued focus on efficiency across the Group, 
with particular focus on the finance function, and steps taken  
to embed streamlined reporting and management information  
as well as de-layering have resulted in significant  
efficiency improvements. 
As a result of the improvements and 
progress in these areas the assessment 
against non-financial objectives for the  
Group CFO was agreed as 16 out  
of 30 points.
 
 
Integrated IT systems The pilot of the Javelin IT-enabled operating model was  
launched in Ireland in 2017 and the enhanced version of Javelin 
encompassing all of the lessons learned will be deployed into 
Ireland before roll-out to the UK commences later this year.
Procurement efficiency Procurement programmes continued to operate across the 
Group with a category focused approach across all regions.  
Key areas of improvement included continued supplier base 
rationalisation, demand management and implementation  
of new procurement tools providing more efficient and 
controlled procurement .
 
 
 
The table below sets out the annual bonus awards which were made to executive directors in respect of the 
financial year ended 31 December 2017, based on the performance described on the previous pages. As mentioned 
earlier in the report, the executive directors suggested their bonus pay-outs be reduced by an amount equivalent  
to 10% of their base pay. The Remuneration Committee, which commended their initiative, was fully supportive  
and used its discretion to reduce the awards accordingly. The annual bonus awards set out below are shown

average OCF component and 80% of the portion allocated to average annual EPS growth vested. Dividend 
payments to shareholders were maintained throughout the performance period, however relative TSR performance 
was affected by share price fluctuations so did not result in any pay-out for this measure.
Total pension entitlements (audited information)
None of the executive directors have any prospective entitlement to a Group defined benefit pension nor is either 
a member of the Group’s pension plan, which is a defined contribution group personal pension plan available to all 
UK employees. Instead the CEO and CFO receive cash allowances of 25% and 20% of their base pay, respectively.

Notes:
1. The face-value calculation for all awards deemed granted in March 2017 was based on a share price of £2.952 which represents the 
average closing share price during the three business days following the announcement of the company’s 2016 financial results. 
2. Awards of conditional shares under the 2017 LTIP were granted in accordance with the Directors' Remuneration Policy. As a result, 
conditional share awards representing 250% of base pay and 200% of base pay were granted to Messrs Almanza and Weller respectively. 
3. The face-value calculation for the 100,000 share award for Mr Weller, deemed granted in March 2016, was based on a share price of 
£1.8383 which represents the average closing share price during the three business days following the announcement of the company's 
2015 financial results. 
4. Further details of performance conditions are set out in the table below. 
Performance measures for long-term incentives awarded in 2017
The bespoke comparator group consists of companies constituent of the FTSE 100 index corrected to exclude 
financial institutions and companies in the extractive sector, and include competitor companies which are outside 
that index.
The company’s current policy is to use market-purchased shares to satisfy LTIP awards. Participants in the LTIP will 
receive a further share award with a value equivalent to the dividends which would have been paid in respect of 
LTIP awards vesting at the end of the performance period.
The company calculates whether the EPS performance target has been achieved by reference to the Group’s 
audited accounts, which provide an accessible and objective measure of the Group’s earnings per share. The 
average OCF performance target is calculated by reference to the relevant definition set out in the LTIP rules 
approved by shareholders. The committee may alter the terms of the EPS measure if it feels that it is no longer  
a fair measure and is no longer incentivising. TSR ranking will be verified externally.

at the normal vesting dates. Such award is due to vest on 20 March 2018 and Mr Gibson will receive an estimated 
56,729 shares (before selling sufficient shares to pay withholding taxes). 
Himanshu Raja
Himanshu Raja stepped down from the board of the company and his role as chief financial officer on  
1 October 2016. He ceased to be an employee on the same date. Details of payments for loss of office in 2016  
are set out on page 95 of the company’s Integrated Report and Accounts 2016 available at g4s.com.
In April 2017, he received the sum of £349,322 as second instalment of the payment in lieu of his 12 month notice 
period that he was entitled to contractually. 
Awards made to Mr Raja under the company’s long term incentive plan were pro-rated to 1 October 2016. All 
such awards remain subject to performance, to be tested at the normal vesting dates. On 20 March 2017, Mr Raja 
received 344,499 shares following the vesting of the LTIP award made in 2014. On 20 March 2018, Mr Raja will 
receive an estimated 151,889 shares (before selling sufficient shares to pay withholding taxes) following the vesting 
of the LTIP award made in 2015. The last remaining award under the 2016 LTIP remains subject to performance, 
which will be tested at the normal vesting date in March 2019.

Notes:
1. Nick Buckles stepped down as CEO on 31 May 2013 and Ashley Almanza took over as CEO from 1 June 2013.
2. After July 2011, the CEO’s total single figure of annual remuneration included payment in lieu of pension. This was 40% of base pay for Nick 
Buckles and is 25% of base pay for Ashley Almanza. Prior to July 2011, a notional sum equal to 40% of relevant base pay has been included.
3. The value of shares that vested in the relevant year under the PSP (or a notional value in the case of shares vested but unexercised) 
has been included in the prior year’s CEO’s total figures, since that is the most relevant year for measurement of performance.
4. The figures before 2013 did not include taxable expenses.
5. Bonus % of maximum awarded figure for 2017 is the adjusted figure after a reduction equivalent to 10% of base pay was applied, as 
recommended by the executive directors and approved by the Remuneration Committee.
 
PERCENTAGE CHANGE IN CEO’S REMUNERATION
The table below shows how the percentage change in the CEO’s salary, benefits and bonus between 2016 and 
2017 compared with the percentage change in the average of each of those components of pay for UK-based G4S 
employees. The Remuneration Committee has chosen all employees in the UK who were in employment during 
the two-year period – 2016 and 2017 – as the group which should provide the most appropriate comparator, as 
the Group CEO is based in the UK.

Governance
Integrated Report and Accounts 2017 G4S plc 103 STATEMENT OF IMPLEMENTATION OF REMUNERATION POLICY IN 2018
Decisions were taken on the basis of the directors’ remuneration policy approved at the company’s 2017 AGM set 
out on pages 107 to 115. 
Executive directors’ remuneration
Base pay
For 2018, at the annual pay review, it was decided to increase Messrs Almanza and Weller’s base pay by 2% from 
£939,755 to £958,550 and £643,750 to £656,625 respectively. These changes took effect from 1 January 2018.
Annual Bonus Scheme
The annual bonus for the 2018 financial year will operate on the same basis as that for 2017 and will be consistent 
with the existing remuneration policy. The maximum bonus opportunity remains at 150% of base pay for both 
Ashley Almanza and Tim Weller. The financial measures of group earnings and operating cash flow remain and 
revenue will also be included in the financial measures for 2018. These have been selected as they support the 
company’s key strategic objectives. As for last year, the financial measures are allocated weightings of 85% for Ashley 
Almanza. They have increased to 80% for Tim Weller. The non-financial measures will therefore account for up to 
15% and 20% of the maximum bonus opportunity for Messrs Almanza and Weller respectively.
These non-financial measures are based on the Group’s strategy and core values and include the following 
key areas:
Ashley Almanza
Mr Almanza’s personal objectives for 2018 cover three key areas, namely strategy, productivity and organisation and 
are as follows:
• Strategy – Continue to develop the Group’s use of technology in its products and services.
• Productivity – Develop and initiate the next phase of the Group productivity programme.
• Organisation – Embed new organisation to ensure new teams operate effectively.
 
Tim Weller
For 2018, Mr Weller’s personal objectives cover productivity and IT.
• Productivity – Contribute to Group programme with efficiency improvements in key support functions. 
• IT – Deliver lean process IT project.
Details of the performance measures and targets are deemed to be commercially sensitive since they relate to the 
2018 financial year. To the extent that they are no longer commercially sensitive, targets and performance levels 
against them will be disclosed in the company’s 2018 integrated report and accounts. 
The proposed target levels for 2018 have been set to be challenging and align with the Group’s strategic priorities 
and business plan. In reviewing the targets, the committee took into account a number of factors, including for 
example the fact that in relation to group earnings, the minimum target that needs to be met in order for any bonus 
to be payable must be at least equal to the earnings in 2017. 
The committee considered the proposed targets relating to non-financial measures and concluded that these were 
also demanding.
Long Term Incentive Plan
The level of awards due to be granted in the 2018 financial year under the LTIP approved by shareholders at the 
2014 AGM will be consistent with the existing remuneration policy. 
As for 2017, the committee considers that a combination of earnings per share growth, total shareholder return and 
average cash flow targets are the most appropriate performance measures for the 2018 awards, as they provide a 
robust method of assessing the company’s performance, both in terms of underlying financial performance and 
returns to shareholders.
Awards granted under the LTIP during the 2018 financial year are subject to the performance conditions listed in 
the table on page 105.

The company’s current policy is to use market-purchased shares to satisfy LTIP awards.
Participants in the LTIP will receive a further share award with a value equivalent to the dividends which would have 
been paid in respect of LTIP awards vesting at the end of the performance period.
The company calculates whether the EPS performance targets have been achieved by reference to the Group’s 
audited accounts, which provide an accessible and objective measure of the Group’s earnings per share.
Adjustments to EPS will be made in respect of:
• Constant exchange rates – in line with previous years, these will be normalised to the rates in the base year
• Acquisitions – earnings will be added to the EPS base at the level used in the acquisition business case
• Disposals – earnings will be removed from the EPS base at the business plan rate
• Share buy-back – the company will only execute buy-backs if the investment is economically accretive and it is  
in the interest of the company. The adjusted EPS for the purposes of calculating performance against the LTIP 
target shall be further adjusted by:
(a) increasing the average number of shares in issue during the performance year by the number of shares 
bought back during the past three years
(b) decreasing the net interest cost in the performance year in respect of the interest charge on the cash cost  
of any share buy-backs during the past three years. Interest will be calculated at the Group’s average costs  
of funds for the year.
The Remuneration Committee will apply discretion in the event of impairment. If the impairment is not a result of 
management failure, then it will not impact the pay-out.
The Remuneration Committee may alter the terms of the EPS measure if it feels that it is no longer a fair measure 
and is no longer incentivising.
Operating cash flow is a measure taken before capital expenditure and investments – to ensure that management  
is not incentivised to under-invest in growth opportunities – and before pension deficit repayment. Operating cash 
flow is expressed as EBITDA +/- working capital and provisions movement as a percentage of EBITDA. Average 
operating cash flow is the average over three years.
TSR ranking will be verified externally.
Governance
Integrated Report and Accounts 2017 G4S plc 105 Non-executive directors’ remuneration
The fees payable to the non-executive directors other than the chairman are set by the executive directors who 
receive input from the chairman. The fees payable to the non-executive chairman are set by the Remuneration 
Committee. In both cases, fees are reviewed annually. Fees were last increased in July 2016 for the chairman and 
July 2015 for non-executive directors. 
In July 2017, it was decided to postpone the exercise to the end of the year, so that it would take place at the same 
time as the pay review for executive directors and employees in general. The review carried out at the end of 2017 
received input from the Remuneration Committee’s advisor, Deloitte.
As a result of the review, the Remuneration Committee considered and approved a proposed increase of the 
chairman’s fee, in line with the increase applicable to group employees based in the UK, of 2% from January 2018.
The review also resulted in a proposed increase to the basic fee for non-executive directors of 2.8%, from £61,750 
to £63,500. Such increase was within the range of market practice in the FTSE 100 and in line with increases for 
other employees over the same period. Consistent with market median for companies ranked 31 – 100 in the FTSE 
index and in recognition of the increased demands of the role, the fee for the chair of the Audit Committee 
increased from £19,000 to £20,000. There was no proposed increase to the fees for the role of Senior Independent 
Director or other committee chairs. All increases took effect from 1 January 2018.
The table below, sets out the fees for the non-executive chairman and other non-executive directors applicable for 
2018 as well as the percentage increase, where relevant, applied following the annual fee review.

ADVISORS TO THE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
Deloitte was appointed by the Remuneration Committee as its advisor in 2014. Such appointment is reviewed 
every year and was confirmed in August 2017. The committee received advice from Deloitte on executive and 
senior management remuneration matters throughout the year under review. The committee has satisfied itself as 
to the independence of Deloitte. Deloitte is a member of the Remuneration Consultants Group and operates 
voluntarily under its code of conduct in the UK.

The group chief executive, Ashley Almanza, provided guidance to the committee on remuneration packages for 
senior executives within the Group. Further guidance was received from the Group’s HR director, Jenni Myles, and 
the director of compensation and benefits, Sok Wah Lee. Neither the group chief executive nor the group HR 
director participated in discussions regarding their own remuneration.
The committee is satisfied that the advice it received during the year was objective and independent based on the 
experience of its members generally.
Information about who are the members of the Remuneration Committee and their attendance at meetings of the 
committee during the year under review can be found on pages 74 and 93.
STATEMENT OF VOTING AT GENERAL MEETING
A resolution to approve the Directors’ Remuneration Policy as set out in the company’s annual report for the year 
ended 31 December 2016 was passed at the company’s annual general meeting held on 25 May 2017. In addition,  
a resolution was passed to approve the Directors’ Remuneration Report (other than the part containing the 
Directors’ Remuneration Policy) for the year ended 31 December 2016.
The results of the votes on these resolutions are set out in the table below:

106 G4S plc Integrated Report and Accounts 2017
Directors’ remuneration report continued BASE PAY
Purpose and link to strategy
Base pay is set at competitive levels in order to recruit 
and retain high calibre executives with the skills required 
in order to manage a company of the size and global 
footprint of G4S.
The level of pay will reflect a number of factors 
including individual experience, expertise and role.
Operation
Reviewed annually and fixed for 12 months  
commencing 1 January. Interim salary reviews may be 
carried out following significant changes in role, scope  
or responsibility or at any other time at the  
committee’s discretion.
The final salary decision may also be influenced by role, 
experience, individual and company performance, 
internal relativities and increases for Group employees.
Maximum opportunity
Actual base pay for each executive director is disclosed 
each year in the Directors’ remuneration report.
In determining salary increases, the committee considers 
market salary levels including those of appropriate 
comparator companies.
Ordinarily, annual salary increases would be no more 
than the average annual increase across the Group. 
However, in exceptional circumstances a higher level  
of increase may be awarded, for example:
• following a significant change to the nature or scale 
of the business;
• following a significant change to the nature or scope 
of the role; or
• for a new appointment, where the base pay may initially 
be set below the market level and increased over time, 
as experience develops and with reference to the 
individual’s performance in the first few years in the role.
Where exceptional increases are made we will fully 
disclose and explain the rationale for such increases.
Performance measures and clawback
None, although individual performance may have a 
bearing on salary increases.
DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION POLICY
Remuneration policy for executive directors
BENEFITS
Purpose and link to strategy
As with base salary, a suitable range of benefits is made 
available in order to recruit and retain high calibre 
executives.
Operation
Executives are entitled to a number of benefits 
comprising paid holiday, healthcare for themselves and 
their family and life insurance of up to four times base 
salary, car allowance, business related transport, limited 
financial advice from time to time and expatriate 
benefits where relevant. A relocation allowance 
reflecting reasonable costs actually incurred will be paid.
Other benefits may be granted at the discretion of the 
Remuneration Committee.
Reasonable business expenses in line with G4S’ 
expenses policy (e.g. travel, accommodation and 
subsistence) will be reimbursed and in some instances 
the associated tax will be borne by the company.
Maximum opportunity
Maximum benefits per director per annum:
• holidays – 30 days
• car allowance – £20,000
• business related local transport – £40,000
• for financial advice, expatriate benefits and relocation 
expenses, the expense will reflect the cost of the 
provision of benefits from time to time but will be 
kept under review by the committee
• other benefits granted at the discretion of the 
committee up to 3% of base pay per annum  
per director
• reasonable business expenses are not subject to  
a maximum, since these are not a benefit to  
the director
Any allowance in relation to relocation will provide for 
the reimbursement of reasonable costs incurred.
Performance measures and clawback
None.
Governance
Integrated Report and Accounts 2017 G4S plc 107 ANNUAL BONUS
Purpose and link to strategy
Rewards the achievement of annual financial and strategic 
business targets and delivery of personal objectives.
Deferred element encourages long-term shareholding 
and discourages excessive risk taking.
Operation
Awarded annually based on performance in the year. 
Targets are set annually and relate to the Group and/or 
the business managed by the executive.
Bonus outcome is determined by the committee 
after the year end, based on annual performance 
against targets.
Bonuses are paid in cash, but executives are required  
to defer any bonus payable in excess of 50% of their 
maximum bonus entitlement into shares. Deferral is  
for a minimum period of three years. Dividends or 
equivalents accrue during the deferral period on 
deferred shares.
Bonuses are not pensionable.
Maximum opportunity
Maximum opportunity of 150% of base pay per annum 
for the CEO and the CFO.
125% of base pay per annum for any other executive 
director.
Performance measures and clawback
Typically, executive directors’ bonus measures are 
weighted so that:
• between 70% and 85% of the bonus is based on 
achievement of challenging financial performance 
measures (e.g. profit before tax and amortisation, 
organic growth, cash-flow measures, etc.), with each 
measure operating independently of the others; and 
the remainder is linked to personal and/or non-
financial measures, which are strategic or operational 
in nature.
Each year, the committee may use its discretion to vary 
the exact number of measures, as well as their relative 
weightings, and this will be disclosed in the annual 
remuneration report.
As a result of the number of factors taken into account 
in determining bonus, there is no minimum pay-out level.
For illustrative purposes, in the event that only threshold 
has been achieved, pay-out would be 35% of maximum, 
rising to full pay-out should achievement of a stretch 
performance level be achieved for all measures assuming 
the non-financial performance measures were satisfied.
The deferred element of the bonus is not subject to any 
further performance measures but is subject to 
clawback in certain circumstances. The non-deferred 
part of the bonus, which is settled in cash, is also subject 
to clawback (see separate section on page 111).
LONG TERM INCENTIVE PLAN
Purpose and link to strategy
Incentivises executives to achieve the company’s 
long-term financial goals, as well as focus on value 
creation, whilst aligning the interests of executives  
with those of shareholders.
Operation
Executive directors are granted awards on an annual 
basis, which vest over a period of at least three years 
subject to continued service and the achievement of  
a number of key performance measures.
The Remuneration Committee reviews the quantum  
of awards to be made to each executive each year to 
ensure that they remain appropriate.
Dividends or equivalents accrue during the vesting 
period on awards that vest.
The award is settled by the transfer of market-
purchased shares to the executive directors.
All the released shares (after tax) must be retained  
until the minimum shareholding requirement is met. 
Currently, the minimum shareholding requirement is 
200% of base salary for the CEO and 150% for the 
other executive directors.
Maximum opportunity
Maximum opportunity of 250% of base pay per annum 
for the CEO.
Maximum opportunity of 200% of base pay per annum 
for other executive directors.
Performance measures and clawback
Awards vest based on performance over a period of at 
least three financial years commencing with the financial 
year in which the award is made.
Performance will be measured based on a combination 
of earnings per share growth, total shareholder return 
against a comparator group and average operating cash 
flow. For awards made in 2017, these were in the 
proportion of 40%, 30% and 30% respectively. 
However, the committee retains the flexibility to amend 
these proportions, provided that no single measure will 
be a significantly greater proportion than the others.
At threshold, 25% of the relevant portion vests. This 
increases on a straight-line basis up to 100% for 
performance in line with maximum. Targets are set out 
on page 99.
Awards are subject to clawback in certain circumstances 
(see below on page 111).

Purpose and link to strategy
As with base salary and other benefits, making available 
a suitable retirement benefits package aids the 
recruitment and retention of high calibre executives, 
allowing such executives to provide for their retirement.
Operation
G4S operates a defined contribution Group-wide 
personal pension plan in the UK in which executives 
may participate. Alternatively, G4S may provide a cash 
allowance in lieu of a contribution into such plan.
The current executive directors receive cash allowances. 
The CEO receives 25% of base pay as a cash allowance; 
the CFO and other executive directors receive 20% of 
base pay.
The level of award is kept under review by the 
committee and is intended to be broadly market 
comparable for the roles.

Maximum opportunity of up to 25% of base pay for  
the CEO and 20% for other executive directors.
Performance measures
None.
CHAIRMAN’S FEE
NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS’ FEES (EXCLUDING THE CHAIRMAN)
Purpose
To attract and retain a high calibre chairman by offering 
a market-competitive fee, which also reflects the 
responsibilities and time commitment. There are no 
performance-related elements.
Operation
The chairman’s fee is disclosed each year in the 
Directors’ remuneration report. The fees are reviewed 
annually by the committee. The annual fee is an 
all-inclusive consolidated amount. The committee retains 
the discretion to review the chairman’s fee at any other 
time if appropriate. The chairman’s fee is reviewed 
against other companies of a similar size.
Purpose
To attract and retain high calibre non-executive directors 
(NEDs) by offering market-competitive fees which 
should reflect the responsibilities and time commitment. 
There are no performance-related elements.
Operation
NED fees including any additional fee for any additional 
role listed below are disclosed each year in the 
Directors’ remuneration report.
With the exception of the chairman, the fees for NEDs 
are structured by composition build-up consisting of:
• a base fee 
• an additional fee for chairing a committee
• an additional fee for the role of senior independent 
director
Maximum opportunity
Ordinarily, any increase in the chairman’s fee would  
be in line with other increases for similar roles in  
other companies.
Fees payable to the chairman and other non-executive 
directors in aggregate per annum shall not exceed the 
maximum specified in the company’s articles of 
association for the relevant year.
The NED fees are reviewed annually by the executive 
directors. The board retains the discretion to review the 
NED fees at other times, as appropriate, to reflect any 
changes in responsibilities or commitment.
The basic fee covers committee membership and each 
NED is expected to participate in one or more board 
committees. All the fees are reviewed against other 
companies of a similar size.
Maximum opportunity
Ordinarily, any increase in the NEDs’ fees would be in line 
with other increases for similar roles in other companies.
Fees payable to non-executive directors (including the 
chairman) in aggregate per annum shall not exceed the 
maximum specified in the company’s articles of 
association for the relevant year.

Purpose
Benefits may be provided from time to time in 
connection with the chairman and other NEDs 
performing their roles, such as business travel, 
subsistence and entertainment, accommodation and 
professional fees for tax and social security compliance, 
and other ancillary benefits.
Operation
Reasonable business expenses in line with G4S 
expenses policy (e.g. travel, accommodation and 
subsistence) will be reimbursed and in some instances 
the associated tax will be borne by the company.
Maximum opportunity
Reasonable business expenses are not subject to a 
maximum, since these are not a benefit to the director.
Benefits and expenses will reflect the actual cost  
of provision.
Notes to the directors’ remuneration policy 
1. Performance measures
Annual Bonus Plan – The actual performance measures 
and targets are set by the Remuneration Committee at 
the beginning of each year. The performance measures 
used for our annual bonus plan have been selected to 
reflect the Group’s key performance indicators. 
The committee aims to ensure that the measures 
appropriately encourage the executive directors to 
focus on the company’s strategic priorities, whilst the 
targets are set to be stretching but achievable.
The aim is to strike an appropriate balance between 
incentivising annual financial and strategic business 
targets, and each executive director’s key role-specific 
objectives for the year.
Long Term Incentive Plan – In choosing the 
performance measures for the Long Term Incentive 
Plan, the committee aims to find a balance of measures 
which reflect the company’s long-term financial goals as 
well as incentivise executives to create sustainable, 
long-term value for shareholders.
Legacy plans – The committee reserves the right to 
make any remuneration payments and/or payments for 
loss of office (including exercising any discretions 
available to it in connection with such payments) 
notwithstanding that they are not in line with the  
policy set out above where the terms of the payment 
were agreed 
(i) before 5 June 2014 (the date the company’s first 
shareholder-approved directors’ remuneration policy 
came into effect); 
(ii) before the policy set out above came into effect, 
provided that the terms of the payment were consistent 
with the shareholder-approved directors’ remuneration 
policy in force at the time they were agreed; or 
(iii) at a time when the relevant individual was not a 
director of the company and, in the opinion of the 
committee, the payment was not in consideration for 
the individual becoming a director of the company.
For these purposes, payments may include the 
committee satisfying awards of variable remuneration. 
In cases where all or part of the variable remuneration 
award was in the form of shares, the payment terms are 
those agreed at the time the award was granted.
Details of the vesting of the awards will be published in 
the annual remuneration report each year.
The non-executive directors do not participate in any 
incentive schemes nor do they receive any benefits 
other than those referred to in the above table.
Directors’ remuneration policy – continued
Remuneration policy for non-executive directors
110 G4S plc Integrated Report and Accounts 2017
Directors’ remuneration report continued Principles and approach to recruitment and 
internal promotion of directors
When hiring a new executive director, or promoting to 
the board from within the Group, the committee will 
offer a package that is sufficient to retain and motivate 
and, if relevant, attract the right talent whilst at all times 
aiming to pay no more than is necessary. Ordinarily, 
remuneration for a new executive director will be in line 
with the policy set out in the table summarised above. 
However, discretion may be required for exceptional 
circumstances such as dealing with remuneration 
relinquished in a previous job.
The maximum level of on-going variable pay that may 
be awarded to new executive directors on recruitment 
or on promotion to the board shall be limited to 400% 
of base salary as set out in the policy above (calculated 
at the date of grant, excluding any buy-out awards – see 
below). Remuneration and any buy-out arrangements 
will be announced as far as possible at the time a new 
executive director or chairman is appointed, or in the 
following Directors’ remuneration report.
When determining the remuneration of a newly-
appointed executive director, the Remuneration 
Committee will apply the following principles:
The on-going remuneration package to be designed in 
accordance with the policy above.
• New executive directors will participate in the annual 
bonus scheme and Long Term Incentive Plan on the 
same basis as existing executive directors.
• The Remuneration Committee has discretion to 
grant one-off cash or share-based awards to 
executive directors where it determines that such an 
award is necessary to secure the recruitment of that 
executive director and where it is in the best 
interests of the company to do so. Such awards 
would only be made as compensation for 
remuneration relinquished under a previous 
employment (i.e. buy-out arrangements) and would 
be intended to mirror forfeited awards as far as 
possible by reflecting the value, nature, time horizons 
and performance measures attached. In such 
circumstances, the company will disclose a full 
explanation of the detail and rationale for such 
one-off awards.
• In certain circumstances, it may be necessary to buy 
out long notice periods of previous employment.
• With regard to internal promotions, any 
commitments made before promotion and 
unconnected with the individual’s promotion may 
continue to be honoured even if they would not 
otherwise be consistent with the policy prevailing 
when the commitment is fulfilled.
• For external and internal appointments, the 
Remuneration Committee may agree that the 
company will meet certain relocation expenses 
(including legal fees), as set out in the policy.
• In determining the approach for all relevant elements, 
the Remuneration Committee will consider a number 
of factors, including (but not limited to) external 
market practice, current arrangements for existing 
executive directors and other internal relativities.

2. Malus and claw-back mechanisms
Since 2010, any cash and/or shares awarded under the 
annual bonus plans and the previous Performance Share 
Plan may be subject to clawback. 
The Long Term Incentive Plan and the annual bonus plan 
may be subject to malus or clawback from the executive 
director concerned if the Remuneration Committee so 
determines and, in the case of misstatement of accounts, 
where the Audit Committee concurs. 
The time period in which the clawback can be operated 
depends on the reason for the overpayment as set out 
in the table below.
The amount to be clawed back directly from the 
executive director will be the overpaid amount, but the 
Remuneration Committee retains the discretion to claw 
back the “net” (i.e. post-tax) amount of the award 
received by the executive director.
Governance
Integrated Report and Accounts 2017 G4S plc 111 Service contracts
Shareholders are entitled to inspect a copy of executive 
directors’ service contracts at the company’s head office 
and at the AGM.
Executive directors’ service contracts all have the 
following features:
• Contracts are drafted in line with best practice at  
the time the executive directors were appointed.
• Terminable on 12 months’ notice by either party.
Specific provisions for Ashley Almanza and Tim Weller’s 
contracts (dated 2013 and 2016 respectively) include:
• Messrs Almanza and Weller are each allowed to 
hold one external non-executive appointment and 
retain the fees paid to them for such appointments. 
Mr Almanza is a non-executive director of Noble 
Corporation and Mr Weller is a non-executive 
director of the Carbon Trust.
• Mitigation obligations on termination payments are 
explicitly included in the executive directors’ 
contracts. Notice payments for Ashley Almanza and 
Tim Weller are payable monthly.
Non-executive directors’ letters of appointment:
• Appointment is subject to the provisions of the 
articles of association of the company, as amended 
from time to time regarding appointment, retirement, 
fees, expenses, disqualification and removal of 
directors.
• All continuing non-executive directors are required to 
stand for re-election by the shareholders at least once 
every three years, although they have agreed to submit 
themselves for re-election annually in accordance with 
the UK Corporate Governance Code.
• Initial period of appointment is two years.
• All reasonably-incurred expenses will be met.
• Fees are normally reviewed annually.
Loss-of-office payment
The duration of the notice period in the executive 
directors’ contracts is 12 months.
The Remuneration Committee would consider the 
application of mitigation obligations in relation to any 
termination payments.
The contracts do not provide for the payment of  
a guaranteed bonus in the event of termination. 
Neither Ashley Almanza nor Tim Weller will be eligible 
for bonus accrual during any period of garden leave.
In relation to Mr Almanza, the value of the termination 
payment would cover the balance of any salary and 
associated benefits payments due to be paid for the 
remaining notice period, the value of which will be 
determined by the Remuneration Committee. 
In relation to Mr Weller, the value of the termination 
payment would amount to the balance of any salary due 
to be paid for the remaining notice period multiplied by 
1.25 to reflect the value of contractual benefits during 
such period. 
The Remuneration Committee would also retain the 
discretion to make appropriate payments necessary to 
finalise any settlement agreement, but in exercising such 
discretion the Remuneration Committee would remain 
mindful to ensure that there was no reward for failure.
The fees for outplacement services and reasonable legal 
fees in connection with advice on a settlement 
agreement may be met by the company.

relevant vesting date.
The vesting date for such awards 
will normally be the original vesting 
date, unless otherwise determined 
by the Remuneration Committee.
Awards will lapse.
As directors may leave employment for a wide range of reasons, the committee retains discretion to approve 
payments where the reason for leaving does not fall precisely within the prescribed “good leaver” category. 
The committee will take account of the director’s performance in office and the circumstances of their exit. The 
committee will seek to balance the interests of shareholders, the departing director and the remaining directors. 
Any awards subject to performance conditions would be assessed at the end of the relevant period and be subject 
to time apportionment.
Corporate Action
If the company is subject to a change in control, the Long Term Incentive Plan provides that awards will vest subject 
to the performance targets having been satisfied up to the date of the change of control and, unless the committee 
determines otherwise, time pro-rating. 
On a variation of share capital, other reorganisation of the company, or a demerger of a substantial part of the 
Group’s business, the committee may make such adjustment to awards as it may determine to be appropriate.

Directors’ remuneration report continued Statement of consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the Group
The structure of the executive directors’ pay policy is generally in line with the policy for remuneration of the senior 
management within the Group, although the levels of award will be different. 
The performance measures that apply in the variable element of the remuneration will reflect the relevant areas of 
responsibilities. There may be one-off awards for retaining scarce and critical individuals below board level. 
Remuneration of employees globally will depend on local regulation and practice, taking any collective bargaining 
agreements into account, where they exist.
Elements of 
remuneration Availability
Fixed Pay Available to all employees worldwide
 Pensions Available to most employees in developed markets
Variable Annual bonus Available to all senior managers worldwide
 Long term incentive plan Available to some senior managers worldwide
Benefits Car or car allowance Available to all senior managers worldwide
 Life/Income protection insurance Available to most employees in developed markets
 Private Healthcare Available to all senior managers in markets where it is 
commonly provided
Across the Group the company seeks to pay competitively, taking into account external benchmarking and internal 
moderation at each level to ensure that remuneration is in line with market practice. When determining base salary 
increases for executive directors, the Remuneration Committee pays particular attention to the data at senior 
manager level.
At G4S, the committee does not normally consult directly with employees as part of the process of determining  
the remuneration policy and pay decisions for executive directors and has not therefore done so in setting this 
remuneration policy. However, employee surveys are carried out biennially which help determine employees’ views 
of their own pay and benefits, as well as those of colleagues in general.
Statement of consideration of shareholder views
We are committed to on-going engagement on key remuneration issues and seek our major shareholders’ views 
prior to proposing any major change in policy. This provides us with valuable feedback and we take into 
consideration these views and seek to reflect them in our policy.
The chairman of the Remuneration Committee will be available to answer any questions and listen to the views  
of our shareholders at the forthcoming annual general meeting.

Remuneration Committee Chairman

and Wales with company number 4992207. It trades 
primarily through its subsidiaries and joint ventures in 
numerous jurisdictions. A list of those subsidiaries and 
joint ventures is set out on pages 187 to 201.
G4S plc has its primary listing on the London Stock 
Exchange and has a secondary listing on the NASDAQ 
OMX exchange in Copenhagen.
2. Reporting obligations
In compliance with relevant listing rules and also with 
DTR4.1.5.R and DTR4.1.8R, the Integrated Report and 
Accounts 2017 contain the consolidated results for the 
year, shown in the Consolidated income statement on 
page 132, a management statement contained in the 
strategic report and in the Directors’ report and 
responsibility statements on pages 116 to 119.
Details of the development and performance of the 
Group’s business during the year, its position at the  
year end, future developments, principal risks and 
uncertainties, prospects of the Group and other 
information which fulfils the requirements of a 
management report, are all contained on pages 4 to 65 
of the strategic report and are incorporated by 
reference in this Directors’ report. The Corporate 
governance report, the Audit Committee report and 
the Directors’ remuneration report set out on pages 85 
to 115 and the Chief Financial Officer’s review on pages 
37 to 50 are also incorporated in this report by 
reference. The Group’s financial risk management 
objectives and policies in relation to its use of financial 
instruments and its exposure to price, credit, liquidity 
and cash flow risk, to the extent material, are set out  
in note 31 to the consolidated financial statements  
on pages 168 to 172 which is also incorporated by 
reference in this Directors’ report.
None of the matters required to be disclosed by LR 
9.8.4C R apply to the company other than shareholder 
waiver of dividends which is referred to in section 4 of 
this Directors’ report.
3. Dividends
The directors propose the following dividend for  
the year:
• Interim dividend of 3.59p (DKK 0.2948) per share 
paid on 13 October 2017
• Final dividend of 6.11p (DKK 0.5097) per share 
payable on 15 June 2018
Shareholders on the Danish VP register will receive their 
dividends in Danish kroner. Shareholders who hold their 
shares through CREST or in certificated form will 
receive their dividends in sterling unless they prefer to 
receive Danish kroner by way of a cheque payable in 
the UK, in which case they should apply in writing to the 
Registrars by no later than 3 May 2018.
4. Capital
The issued share capital of G4S plc at 31 December 
2017 is as set out on page 182 (note 35 to the 
consolidated financial statements) and consisted of 
1,551,594,436 ordinary shares of 25 pence each. The 
number of shares in issue as at 8 March 2018  
remains unchanged.
In general there are no restrictions on the holder’s 
ability to transfer their shares or exercise their voting 
rights, other than in situations where the company is 
legally entitled to impose such restrictions (usually 
where amounts remain unpaid on the shares after 
request, or the holder is otherwise in default of an 
obligation to the company).
The company is not aware of any agreements between 
its shareholders that may restrict the transfer of their 
shares or the exercise of the voting rights attaching to 
them except in relation to the G4S Employee Benefit 
Trust (“the Trust”) which has been established to 
facilitate certain employee share plans.
Resolutions granting the directors power, subject to 
certain conditions, to allot and make market purchases 
of the company’s shares will be proposed at the 
company’s annual general meeting. At 31 December 
2017 the directors had authority in accordance with a 
resolution passed at the company’s annual general 
meeting held on 25 May 2017 to make market 
purchases of up to 155,159,000 of the company’s shares.
The company does not hold any treasury shares as such. 
However, the 4,362,068 shares held within the Trust 
and referred to on page 182 (note 36 to the 
consolidated financial statement) are accounted for as 
treasury shares. The Trust has waived its right to receive 
dividends in respect of the company’s shares which it 
held during the period under review.
5. Significant agreements – change of control 
The company is party to a £1,000,000,000 multi-
currency revolving credit facility agreement which 
requires prompt notification of a change of control 
event following which funds committed but unutilised 
could be cancelled and repayment of outstanding funds 
utilised would need to be made within 45 days.
The company entered into two US Private Placement 
Note Purchase Agreements (the “USPP Agreements”), 
on 1 March 2007 and 15 July 2008 respectively. The first 
USPP Agreement is for $550,000,000 and series C-D 
senior notes representing $250,000,000 remain 
outstanding and mature between 1 March 2019 and  
1 March 2022. The second USPP Agreement is for 
$513,500,000 and £69,000,000 and series D-F senior 
notes representing $298,500,000 and £44,000,000 
remain outstanding and mature between 15 July 2018 
and 15 July 2020. Under the terms of both USPP 
Agreements, the company is required to offer the note 
holders the right to purchase the notes at par value 
together with interest thereon upon a change of control.
Directors’ report
116 G4S plc Integrated Report and Accounts 2017 We do not employ forced, bonded or child labour.  
We appoint people based on their skills and capabilities 
and not any personal characteristics which are 
discriminatory or illegal in the countries in which we 
work. Our aim is to develop and grow so removing 
barriers to employment helps us ensure we tap into the 
widest talent pool and are able to harness all the skills 
and abilities people have. If, during the course of their 
employment individuals become disabled and unable to 
meet the job requirements we seek to retrain or retain 
their talents by making reasonable adjustments wherever 
possible. Further information on our approach to 
diversity and inclusion can be found on page 16.
9. Political donations
Each year the company’s shareholders have passed  
a resolution on a precautionary basis to allow the 
company and its subsidiaries to make political donations 
or incur political expenditure not exceeding £50,000. 
However, the board confirms that the Group’s policy is 
not to make any financial contribution to political parties 
and that the company and its subsidiaries have made no 
contributions during the year to political parties carrying 
on activities, or to candidates seeking election within the 
EU, or anywhere else in the world.
10. Greenhouse gas emissions
Alongside the risks faced by people and infrastructure 
from climate change are the challenges presented by 
global economic conditions.
Managing fuel costs and the impact of “carbon taxes” 
through programmes to improve the Group’s energy 
efficiency and reduce its environmental impacts are 
important to the continued effectiveness and 
sustainability of the Group’s business.
We follow WBCSD* and WRI** Greenhouse Gas 
Protocol to measure our Scope 1 and 2 emissions – 
vehicle fleet, fuel, refrigerants and electricity usage for 
G4S businesses over which the Group has financial and 
operational control. In addition the Group has measured 
Scope 3 emissions from employee business air travel.
The businesses that reported data in the 2017 GHG 
measurement represent 90% of the Group’s operations, 
across a 12 month period. This level of measurement, 
including each of the Group’s main service types, allows 
reliable calculation of the total GHG emissions for 100% 
of the Group.
The G4S total carbon footprint during 2017, 
extrapolated to 100% of the business equates to some 
501,467 t/CO
2
e. These CO
2
e emissions, including 
emissions generated by services which our customers 
have outsourced to G4S, have decreased by 2.5% since 
2016 – against a 3.2% revenue growth in our core 
businesses during the same period, reflecting the efforts 
made to increase the energy efficiency of our business.
In 2018, we will continue to implement energy efficiency 
strategies with the aim of reducing carbon intensity by at 
least 3.5% per annum.

Under the terms of the £2,500,000,000 Euro Medium 
Term Note Programme the company issued four 
tranches of Medium Term Notes (MTNs), issued to 
various institutions on 13 May 2009 (£350,000,000),  
6 December 2012 (€500,000,000), 9 November 2016 
(€500,000,000) and 2 June 2017 (€500,000,000). In the 
event of a change of control, a put option comes into 
force, according to which holders of any MTN may 
require the company to redeem the MTNs at par if the 
MTNs carry a sub-investment grade credit rating in the 
period immediately prior to the change of control, or in 
certain circumstances where the MTNs are downgraded 
to sub-investment as a result of the change of control.
The Group’s UK pension scheme trust deed contains 
provisions which apply if a takeover event occurs. 
Following such an event, the appointment and removal 
of trustees becomes subject to unanimous trustee 
agreement and the trustees acquire the unilateral power 
to set the employer contribution rates in certain 
sections of the scheme.
6. Post balance sheet events
There have been no significant events from  
31 December 2017 to the date of this report.
7. Research and development expenditure
Research in connection with the development of new 
services and products and the improvement of those 
currently provided by the Group is carried out 
continuously. Research and development written-off to 
profit and loss during the year amounted to £4m 
(2016:£4m).
8. Employees
Asking for, listening to and acting on the feedback from 
our people enables us to address their concerns and 
capture their ideas for improvements. They are closest 
to our operations and to the needs of our customers  
in a constantly changing marketplace. We value the 
feedback from our biennial global and management 
surveys and take time in between to address the issues 
raised. The high response rate helps identify underlying 
problems and provides a strong mandate for action. In 
addition to the surveys we encourage dialogue with our 
employees directly and also seek feedback from our 
networks with union representatives at a global, 
European and local level. These networks provide early 
warning signs of any issues and are an additional avenue 
for communication and for sharing updates on business 
performance. More information on employee 
communication and consultation can be found on  
pages 16 and 17. 
Our managers are invited to participate in webinars 
which coincide with announcements of our financial 
results and are encouraged to cascade the information 
shared with their teams. In 2017, we also introduced 
new on-line newsletters for our senior managers 
containing information on contract wins, projects and 
market developments. The newsletters showcase 
examples of security innovations and help businesses 
struggling with similar challenges to become early 
adopters building on new ideas rather than  
recreating them.
Governance
Integrated Report and Accounts 2017 G4S plc 117 12. Auditor
A resolution to re-appoint PricewaterhouseCoopers 
LLP, chartered accountants, as auditor to the company 
for 2018, and for their remuneration to be fixed by the 
Audit Committee, will be submitted to the annual 
general meeting.
13. Directors
The directors, biographical details of whom are 
contained on pages 68 and 69, held office throughout 
the year, apart from Ian Springett who retired from the 
board on 20 June 2017 and John Ramsay, who was 
appointed to the board on 1 January 2018.
In accordance with the code provisions on re-election 
of directors in the UK Corporate Governance Code, 
each of the directors continuing in office will offer 
themselves for re-election. The board believes that the 
directors standing for re-election possess experience 
and expertise relevant to the company’s operations; that 
they continue to be effective; that they are committed 
to the success of the company; and that they should be 
re-elected (or elected) at the annual general meeting.
The contracts of service of the executive directors have 
no unexpired term since they are not for a fixed term. 
They are terminable at 12 months’ notice. None of the 
non-executive directors has a contract of service.
The company has executed deeds of indemnity for the 
benefit of each of the directors in respect of liabilities 
which may attach to them in their capacity as directors 
of the company. These deeds are qualifying third-party 
indemnity provisions as defined by section 234 of the 
Companies Act 2006 and have been in effect since  
14 June 2010 for Ms Spottiswoode, 1 October 2010 for 
Ms Fok, 8 June 2012 for Mr Connolly, 1 January 2013 
for Mr Spence,1 April 2013 for Mr Weller,1 May 2013  
for Mr Almanza, 5 June 2015 for Mr Daly, 27 May 2016  
for Mr Mogford, 1 July 2016 for Ms Thoralfsson, 
1 January 2017 for Mr Springett and 1 January 2018  
for Mr Ramsay. Copies of the forms of indemnity are 
available on the company’s website. In addition, 
indemnities have been granted by the company in 
favour of certain of the directors of some of the 
Group’s subsidiaries in the USA, Greece, India, the UAE 
and the Philippines. The company has maintained a 
directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policy 
throughout the year under review.
Details of directors’ interests (including the interests of 
their connected persons) in the share capital of G4S plc 
are set out on page 101, and the directors’ remuneration 
is set out on page 96.
The directors who held office at the date of approval  
of this Directors’ report confirm that, so far as they are 
each aware, there is no relevant audit information of 
which the company’s auditor is unaware, and each 
director has taken all the steps that he or she ought  
to have taken as a director to make himself or herself 
aware of any relevant audit information, and to establish 
that the company’s auditor is aware of that information.
None of the directors had a material interest in any 
contract significant to the business of the Group during 
the financial year.

Directors’ report continued
118 G4S plc Integrated Report and Accounts 2017 Statement of directors’ responsibilities in 
respect of the annual report and the 
financial statements
The directors are responsible for preparing the 
annual report and the Group and parent company 
financial statements in accordance with applicable law 
and regulations. 
Company law requires the directors to prepare group 
and parent company financial statements for each 
financial year. Under that law they are required to 
prepare the group financial statements in accordance  
with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and applicable law and 
have elected to prepare the parent company financial 
statements in accordance with UK Accounting Standards.
Under company law the directors must not approve the 
financial statements unless they are satisfied that they 
give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the 
Group and parent company and of their profit or loss 
for that period. In preparing each of the group and 
parent company financial statements, the directors are 
required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply 
them consistently;
• make judgments and estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent;
• for the group financial statements, state whether 
they have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs  
as adopted by the EU;
• for the parent company financial statements, state 
whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have 
been followed, subject to any material departures 
disclosed and explained in the parent company 
financial statements; and
• prepare the financial statements on the going 
concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume 
that the Group and the parent company will 
continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate 
accounting records that are sufficient to show and 
explain the parent company’s transactions and disclose 
with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial 
position of the parent company and enable them to 
ensure that its financial statements comply with the 
Companies Act 2006. They have general responsibility 
for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to 
safeguard the assets of the Group and to prevent and 
detect fraud and other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, the directors are 
also responsible for preparing a strategic report, 
Directors’ report, Directors’ remuneration report and 
Corporate governance statement that comply with that 
law and those regulations.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and 
integrity of the corporate and financial information 
included on the company’s website. Legislation in the 
UK governing the preparation and dissemination of 
financial statements may differ from legislation in  
other jurisdictions.
Directors’ responsibility statement
Each of the directors, the names of whom are set out on 
pages 68 and 69 of this Integrated Report and Accounts, 
confirm that, to the best of his or her knowledge:
• the financial statements in this Integrated Report and 
Accounts have been prepared in accordance with 
the applicable accounting standards and give a true 
and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position 
and results of the company and the Group; and
• the management report required by DTR4.1.8R 
(contained in the strategic report and the Directors’ 
report) includes a fair review of the development 
and performance of the business and the position  
of the company and the Group taken as a whole, 
together with a description of the principal risks  
and uncertainties they face.
The strategic report from the inside front cover to page 
65 includes information on the Group structure, the 
performance of the business and the principal risks and 
uncertainties it faces. The financial statements on pages 
132 to 210 include information on the Group and the 
company’s financial results, financial outlook, cash flow 
and net debt and balance sheet positions. Notes 22, 26, 
27, 30 and 31 to the consolidated financial statements 
include information on the Group’s investments, cash 
and cash equivalents, borrowings, derivatives, financial 
risk management objectives, hedging policies and 
exposure to interest, foreign exchange, credit, liquidity 
and market risks.
Pages 132 to 201 contain information on the 
performance of the Group, its financial position, cash 
flows, net debt position and borrowing facilities. Further 
information, including financial risk management policies, 
exposures to market and credit risk and hedging 
activities, is given in note 31 to the financial statements. 
After making enquiries, the directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the Group has adequate resources to 
continue in operational existence for the foreseeable 
future. For this reason the directors consider it 
appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in 
preparing the financial statements.
Directors are also required to provide a broader 
assessment of viability over a longer period, which can be 
found on page 92 of the Integrated Report and Accounts.
The directors consider that the Integrated Report and 
Accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and 
understandable and provides the information necessary 
for shareholders to assess the company’s performance 
and position, business model and strategy.
The statement of directors’ responsibilities and the strategic 
report are approved by a duly authorised committee of the 
board of directors on 8 March 2018 and signed on its 
behalf by Tim Weller, Chief Financial Officer.

Directors’ responsibilities REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE 
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Opinion
In our opinion:
• G4S plc’s Group financial statements and parent 
company financial statements (the “financial 
statements”) give a true and fair view of the state  
of the Group’s and of the parent company’s affairs  
at 31 December 2017 and of the Group’s profit and 
cash flows for the year then ended;
• the Group financial statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standard (“IFRSs”) as adopted by the 
European Union;
• the parent company financial statements have been 
properly prepared in accordance with United 
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice 
(United Kingdom Accounting Standards, comprising 
FRS 101 “Reduced Disclosure Framework”, and 
applicable law); and
• the financial statements have been prepared in 
accordance with the requirements of the Companies 
Act 2006 and, as regards the Group financial 
statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
We have audited the financial statements, included 
within the Integrated Report and Accounts (the “Annual 
Report”), which comprise:
• the consolidated statement of financial position at  
31 December 2017; 
• the parent company statement of financial position  
at 31 December 2017; 
• the consolidated income statement for the year  
then ended;
• the consolidated statement of comprehensive 
income for the year then ended;
• the consolidated statement of cash flows for the year 
then ended;
• the consolidated statement of changes in equity for 
the year then ended; 
• the parent company statement of changes in equity 
for the year then ended; and 
• the notes to the financial statements, which include  
a description of the significant accounting policies. 
Our opinion is consistent with our reporting to the 
Audit Committee.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with 
International Standards on Auditing (UK) (“ISAs (UK)”) 
and applicable law. Our responsibilities under ISAs (UK) 
are further described in the auditors’ responsibilities for 
the audit of the financial statements section of our 
report. We believe that the audit evidence we have 
obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis 
for our opinion.
Independence
We remained independent of the Group in accordance 
with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our 
audit of the financial statements in the UK, which 
includes the FRC’s Ethical Standard, as applicable to 
listed public interest entities and we have fulfilled our 
other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these 
requirements.
To the best of our knowledge and belief, we declare 
that non-audit services prohibited by the FRC’s Ethical 
Standard were not provided to the Group or to the 
parent company.
Other than those disclosed in note 10 to the financial 
statements, we have provided no non-audit services to 
the Group or to the parent company in the period from 
1 January 2017 to 31 December 2017.
Our audit approach
Context
G4S is an integrated security company specialising in the 
provision of security and related services to customers 
in around 90 countries, which in 2017 was organised 
into seven geographical regions.
Overview
Materiality
• Overall Group materiality: £20m (2016: £15m), 
which represents approximately 5% of adjusted 
profit before tax, being profit before tax after adding 
back certain items that are separately reported on 
the face of the consolidated income statement 
including specific items, restructuring costs and profit 
on disposal. 
• Overall parent company materiality: £15m (2016: 
£13.5m), which represents approximately 1% of net 
assets.
Audit scope
• Our audit included full scope audits of the Group’s 
seven geographical regions. The regional audits were 
supported by full scope audits at 73 country 
components with specified audit procedures 
performed at a further 16 country components.
• Taken together, the components at which either  
full scope audit work or specified audit procedures 
were performed accounted for 76% of consolidated 
revenue, 78% of consolidated profit before tax and 
73% of consolidated adjusted profit before tax.

The scope of our audit
As part of designing our audit, we determined 
materiality and assessed the risks of material 
misstatement in the financial statements. In particular, 
we looked at where the directors made subjective 
judgments, for example in respect of significant 
accounting estimates that involved making assumptions 
and considering future events that are inherently 
uncertain. We gained an understanding of the legal and 
regulatory framework applicable to the Group and to 
the industry in which it operates and considered the risk 
of acts by the Group which were contrary to applicable 
laws and regulations, including fraud. We designed audit 
procedures at the Group and component levels to 
respond to this risk, recognising that the risk of not 
detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is higher 
than the risk of not detecting one resulting from error, 
as fraud may involve deliberate concealment by, for 
example, forgery or intentional misrepresentations or 
through collusion. 
We designed audit procedures that focused on the risk 
of non-compliance related to, but not limited to, 
compliance with payroll, foreign ownership and tax laws 
and regulations. Our tests included, but were not limited 
to, the review of the financial statement disclosures to 
underlying supporting documentation, review of 
correspondence with legal advisors, enquiries of 
management, review of significant component auditors’ 
work and review of Internal Audit reports in so far as 
they related to the financial statements. There are 
inherent limitations in the audit procedures described 
above and the further removed non-compliance with 
laws and regulations is from the events and transactions 
reflected in the financial statements, the less likely we 
would become aware of it. We found payroll 
compliance and tax to be key audit matters and these 
are discussed further below. 
As in all of our audits, we also addressed the risk of 
management override of internal controls, including 
evaluating whether there was evidence of bias by 
management that represented a risk of material 
misstatement due to fraud and the risk of fraud in 
revenue recognition. Procedures designed to address 
these risks included testing of material journal entries 
and post-close adjustments, testing and evaluating 
management’s key accounting estimates for 
reasonableness and consistency, undertaking cut-off 
procedures to check proper cut-off of revenue and 
testing the occurrence and accuracy of revenue 
transactions. In addition, we incorporate an element of 
unpredictability into our audit work each year.
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in the auditors’ 
professional judgment, were of most significance in the 
audit of the financial statements of the current period 
and include the most significant assessed risks of 
material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) 
identified by the auditors, including those which had the 
greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the 
allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the 
efforts of the engagement team. We have also set out 
how we tailored our audit to address these specific 
areas in order to provide an opinion on the financial 
statements as a whole. These matters, and any 
comments we make on the results of our procedures 
thereon, were addressed in the context of our audit of 
the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our 
opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate 
opinion on these matters. This is not a complete list  
of all risks identified by our audit.

Integrated Report and Accounts 2017 G4S plc 121 Key audit matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter
Onerous contract provisioning  
Refer to Audit Committee report on page 85 
and to note 33 of the Group financial statements.
Certain of the Group’s contracts are onerous 
and long-term in nature. These contracts can be 
complex and incorporate penalty and key 
performance indicator (“KPI”) clauses in the 
event of non-compliance. The Group is 
therefore required to make operational and 
financial assumptions to estimate future losses 
over periods that can extend beyond 20 years. 
Variability of contract penalties, underlying 
delivery costs and customer and subcontractor 
claims or disputes can put additional pressure 
on margins and on future contract profitability, 
giving rise to onerous contract provisions.
The prediction of future events over extended 
periods contains inherent risk and the outcome 
of customer and sub-contractor claims is 
uncertain and involves a high degree of 
management judgment. 
The Group’s onerous contract provisions at 
31 December 2017 are £62m (2016: £69m)  
and the income statement charge for onerous 
contracts in 2017 amounts to £19m (2016: £6m). 
 Our global approach to testing complex contracts starts with an evaluation  
of management’s process to identify and quantify onerous and at-risk contracts. 
Management focuses on the top 25 contracts by region and on contracts with 
margins of less than 3%. We performed scanning analytics on contract margins 
and investigated unusual or unexpected trends to check inclusion of all relevant 
contracts in management’s assessment. Our sampling of contracts focused  
our testing on higher risk and larger contracts and enabled us to form an 
independent view as to whether management’s process had identified all 
onerous and at-risk contracts. 
For each contract in our sample, we obtained and read the key contractual 
terms and tested that the revenue recognised in the period was in accordance 
with the contractual terms and was supported by evidence of service delivery. 
We read and understood the contract penalty clauses and evaluated the 
completeness of penalties through discussions with contract managers and 
reading minutes of meetings between G4S and the customer, and  
customer correspondence.
We assessed each of the key assumptions used in management’s forecasts to 
identify and quantify onerous contract provisions. Where possible, we obtained 
third party evidence to corroborate management’s assumptions and assessed 
the appropriateness of the Group’s forecasts based on past performance. The 
Group’s policy is to include the benefits of performance improvement plans 
only where there is evidence of plans being achievable. We critically challenged 
these benefits based on observable benefits achieved to date and the extent  
to which these plans are within the Group’s direct control.
We assessed the appropriateness of the discount rate used to present value the 
obligation and checked that the rate appropriately reflected the risk in the 
underlying cash flows. We also assessed the recoverability of dedicated contract 
assets where the contract was identified as onerous.
Having examined management’s analysis, including accounting papers prepared 
to support key contract judgments and onerous contract provisions, our 
procedures focused on the Facilities Management and Care & Justice businesses 
in the UK and specifically on the Compass contract and on a legacy PFI contract 
which is long-term in nature. Both contracts are sensitive to changes in 
assumptions and have given rise to changes in provisioning levels at year-end.
For these contracts, we performed our own independent sensitivity analysis and 
we have undertaken additional analysis on key assumptions to which 
management’s provisioning judgments are more sensitive. 
We also held discussions with in-house and external legal counsel and read 
appropriate documentation to evaluate contractual claims and disputes with 
customers and subcontractors. We obtained and evaluated evidence to support 
decisions and rationale for provisions held or the decision not to record 
provisions, including correspondence with external legal counsel. We also 
considered external information sources to assess and evaluate the alternate 
possible scenarios. 
We considered the level of provisioning to be acceptable in the context of the 
Group financial statements taken as a whole. However, we noted that the 
assumptions and judgments that are required to formulate the provisions mean 
that the range of possible outcomes is broad. We are satisfied with the Group’s 
related disclosures of these onerous contracts in light of the underlying 
assumptions and accounting judgments made.

Independent auditors’ report to the members of G4S plc continued Key audit matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter
Goodwill impairment  
Refer to Audit Committee report on page 85 
and to note 18 of the Group financial statements.
The Group has £1.9bn of goodwill at  
31 December 2017 (2016: £2.0bn).  
No impairment charge has been recorded  
in 2017 (2016: £9m). 
Management determines the recoverable 
amount of a cash generating unit (“CGU”) as 
the higher of value in use (“VIU”) or fair value 
less cost of disposal (“FVLCD”).
The carrying value of goodwill is contingent on 
future cash flows and there is risk if these cash 
flows do not meet the Group’s expectations 
that the assets will be impaired. The impairment 
reviews performed by the Group contain a 
number of significant judgments and estimates 
including revenue growth, profit margins, cash 
conversion and long-term growth and discount 
rates. Changes in these assumptions can have a 
significant impact on the headroom available in 
the impairment calculations.
 We assessed the mathematical accuracy of management’s cash flow model and 
agreed the underlying forecasts to board approved budgets and assessed how 
these budgets were compiled.
With the support of our valuations experts, we assessed the terminal growth 
rates and discount rates applied by management to third party information and 
confirmed whether they fell within a reasonable range of external market data. 
Where they did not, we applied our independent view of a more appropriate 
rate to management’s forecast.
We considered the reliability of management’s forecasting for revenue, profit 
and cash conversion by comparing budgeted results to actual performance over 
a period of three years, which we considered appropriate. Where we identified 
significant shortfalls against budget in prior years, this informed our 
determination of sensitivities to apply as we formed our independent view 
about reasonable downside scenarios.
Where the recoverable amount has been assessed with reference to a valuation 
multiple, we assessed the appropriateness of the multiple by comparison to 
recent business disposals and to other third party information, with the support 
of our valuations experts. 
We challenged management as to the appropriateness of the level of aggregation 
of each CGU and the independence of cash flows from other assets. 
We performed our own risk assessment by considering historical performance, 
forecasting accuracy and modelled headroom to highlight the CGUs with either 
a lower headroom or which are more sensitive to changes in key assumptions. 
We also considered the valuation multiple implied by management’s estimate. 
For those CGUs with low headroom, we performed our own sensitivity analysis 
to understand the impact of changes in the assumptions on the available 
headroom. We critically assessed management’s forecast by comparing growth 
forecast to actual growth to date and to IMF projections. 
The recoverable amounts of a number of CGUs including Brazil Secure 
Solutions, Risk Management and UK Cash Solutions were found to be sensitive 
to reasonably possible changes in assumptions and we satisfied ourselves that 
this risk was appropriately highlighted in the disclosures in note 18. 
As a result of our work, we determined that it was appropriate that no 
impairment charge was recognised in the context of the Group financial 
statements taken as a whole and that adequate disclosure has been made.

Uncertain tax positions and 
deferred tax assets
  
Refer to Audit Committee report on page 85 
and to notes 13 and 34 of the Group financial 
statements.
The Group operates in a complex multinational 
tax environment and is subject to a range of tax 
risks during the normal course of business 
including transaction related tax matters and 
transfer pricing arrangements. 
Where the amount of tax payable is uncertain, 
the Group establishes provisions based on 
management’s judgment of the probable 
amount of the future liability. At 31 December 
2017, the Group has recognised provisions  
of £42m related to uncertain tax positions  
(2016: £37m).
In addition, the Group has recognised £240m 
of deferred tax assets at 31 December 2017 
(2016: £285m). The recognition of deferred  
tax assets involves judgment by management 
regarding the likelihood of the realisation of 
these assets. The expectation that these assets 
will be realised is dependent on a number of 
factors, including whether there will be sufficient 
taxable profits in future periods to support 
utilisation of these assets.
There have been a number of changes in tax 
law in 2017, especially in the US that have 
resulted in a significant impact on the Group’s 
deferred tax balances. The most significant 
change has been the US Tax Cuts and Jobs  
Act which was substantively enacted before  
31 December 2017. The Group has needed to 
consider the impact of this new tax law on both 
its current and deferred taxes. Certain of the 
changes introduced by the Act are complex 
and there are number of areas of uncertainty 
relating to both the manner in which the law 
will apply and to the accounting in certain areas.
 With the assistance of our local and international tax specialists, we evaluated 
and challenged management’s judgments in respect of estimates of tax 
exposures and contingencies in order to assess the adequacy of the Group’s  
tax provisions. 
In understanding and evaluating management’s judgments, we considered the 
status of recent and current tax authority audits and enquiries, judgmental 
positions taken in tax returns and current year estimates and developments  
in the tax environment. Where appropriate, we also read appropriate 
documentation to understand the legal positions reached. From the evidence 
obtained, we considered the level of provisioning to be acceptable in the 
context of the Group financial statements taken as a whole. However, we 
noted that the assumptions and judgments that are required to formulate  
the provisions mean that there is a broad range of possible outcomes.
In respect of the recoverability of deferred tax assets, we evaluated 
management’s assessment of how these assets will be realised and whether 
there will be sufficient taxable profits in future periods to support their 
recognition. We evaluated the directors’ future cash flow forecasts and the 
process by which they were prepared, ensuring consistency of cash flows  
with those used for the purpose of goodwill impairment testing. Based on  
our procedures, future cash flow forecasts supported the recoverability of  
the deferred tax assets recognised.
We have reviewed the Group’s impact assessment as a result of US tax reform, 
deploying our US tax specialists. We have discussed with management the key 
judgments made in evaluating how the legislation applies to the Group and 
compared these judgments with our independent expectations based on our 
knowledge of the Group’s tax affairs. We have also verified the mathematical 
accuracy of the deferred tax re-measurement calculations. We are satisfied that 
the Group has appropriately accounted for the impact of US tax reform in the 
context of the Group financial statements taken as a whole.

Compliance with payroll laws and regulations  
Refer to Audit Committee report on page 85 
and to note 33 of the Group financial statements.
The Group employs over 570,000 employees 
across six continents. There are a number of 
ongoing employee and regulatory claims in 
relation to the interpretation and potential risks 
relative to the application of local payroll laws 
and regulations in a number of countries. 
Interpreting and complying with payroll laws 
and regulations is complex. There is inherent 
judgment associated both with assessing and 
quantifying probable outcomes in relation to 
ongoing claims and with determining any 
exposure (and the need for provision) in areas 
where legal requirements are open to 
interpretation. In addition, possible outcomes 
need to be considered for disclosure as 
contingent liabilities. Unexpected adverse 
outcomes could materially impact the Group’s 
financial performance and position. 
 We met with the directors, management and in-house legal counsel and held 
discussions with the Group’s external legal advisors to assess the probable 
outcomes in relation to ongoing claims and exposures in countries and areas 
where legal requirements are open to interpretation. 
We evaluated and challenged management’s judgments in order to assess the 
adequacy of the Group’s provisions and disclosures. In understanding and 
evaluating management’s judgments, we considered the status and basis of 
employee and regulatory claims, settlement history and the views of internal 
and external legal counsel regarding the interpretation and application of local 
payroll laws and regulations. Where appropriate, we also read relevant 
documentation and correspondence to understand the legal positions reached. 
From the evidence obtained, we are satisfied with the Group’s provisioning 
decisions at 31 December 2017 in the context of the Group financial 
statements taken as a whole and with the adequacy of the contingent liability 
disclosures given the status, materiality and likely outcome of employee and 
regulatory claims and exposures in countries and areas where legal 
requirements are open to interpretation. 
Income statement presentation  
Refer to Audit Committee report on page 85 and 
to note 3(b) of the Group financial statements.
The Group has historically reported specific and 
other items (including restructuring costs) which 
are disclosed separately on the face of the 
income statement and which are excluded from 
management’s reporting of the underlying 
results of the business. Consistent with the 
Group’s definition of profit before interest, tax 
and amortisation (“Adjusted PBITA”), the 
following items have continued to be disclosed 
separately on the face of the income statement 
in 2017: net specific items £34m (2016: £13m); 
restructuring costs £20m (2016: £12m); and 
net profit on disposal and closure of subsidiaries 
£74m (2016: £7m).
The treatment of specific and other separately 
disclosed items is explained in the Group 
accounting policy in note 3(b). We focused on 
this area because the classification of items as 
specific or separate disclosure of items of 
income or expenditure on the face of the 
income statement requires judgment and 
because certain of these items are excluded 
from the calculation of elements of executive 
remuneration in line with the Group’s 
remuneration policy. Consistency in the 
identification and presentation of these items is 
important to ensure comparability of year-on-
year reporting in the Annual Report.
 We substantiated the nature and quantum of individual items to appropriate 
corroborating evidence.
We considered whether the designation of individual items as specific was 
consistent with the Group’s accounting policy and treatment in prior years. 
Furthermore, we considered whether amounts included as specific items related 
to current year trading and might be more appropriately reflected in the 
underlying results. 
We considered whether the Group has taken a balanced approach to this area, 
checking that exceptional one-off items of income are treated consistently with 
one-off items of cost.
We tested management’s process for identifying and tracking the current year 
reversal of any prior year specific items, or utilisation of or adjustment to related 
provisions, to identify whether these have been appropriately presented in the 
current year income statement.
Based on our procedures, we were satisfied that the treatment and classification 
of these items were consistent year-on-year and with the Group’s policies.

Integrated Report and Accounts 2017 G4S plc 125 Key audit matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter
Control environment
The geographical span and decentralised 
structure of the Group, coupled with the 
current disparate systems landscape and 
evolving control environment, means that there 
is an increased risk of errors remaining 
undetected and aggregating to cause a material 
misstatement to the Group financial statements.
Progress has been made by the Group in 2017 
to strengthen the controls framework through 
the embedding of the Minimum Financial 
Controls (“MFC”) framework. However, as the 
framework is still in its early stages, the operation 
and formalisation of these controls is at different 
levels of maturity across the organisation. 
In recognition of the Group’s scale and decentralised structure and aligning to 
the Group’s regional management structure, we continued to deploy teams in 
each of the Group’s regions to lead our interactions with regional management, 
to coordinate the audit work performed at a country component level and to 
audit and report on the aggregated financial information of that region.
Given that the operation and formalisation of MFC controls are at different 
levels of maturity across the organisation, we did not seek to test or rely on 
these controls for our 2017 audit. We therefore instructed our component 
teams not to rely on financial controls at the local business level but to perform 
a substantive audit focused on transaction testing and on the integrity of the 
year-end balance sheet. 
With the support of our regional teams, we determined the entities to be 
included in our Group audit scope based on those locations with significant risk 
and those which contribute a significant amount to material line items in the 
Group financial statements. 
We applied a reduction to our overall materiality to set a performance 
materiality benchmark that we used to determine the nature, timing and extent 
of our detailed audit procedures. Our performance materiality benchmark for 
the Group audit of £12.5m reflects the Group’s evolving control environment, 
the risk of multiple misstatements resulting in a material misstatement and the 
history of past audit adjustments.
Wherever we identified audit adjustments or control matters which could be 
pervasive across the Group, we instructed our regional and country component 
teams to assess whether similar errors had arisen elsewhere. While we did 
identify audit differences across the Group, management corrected the more 
significant items meaning that the uncorrected items reported to the Audit 
Committee were considered to be immaterial for adjustment, both individually 
and in aggregate.
126 G4S plc Integrated Report and Accounts 2017
Independent auditors’ report to the members of G4S plc continued How we tailored the audit scope
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements 
as a whole, taking into account the structure of the Group and the parent company, the accounting processes and controls and the 
industry in which they operate.
In 2017, the Group was structured into seven geographical regions being Africa, Asia Pacific, Europe, Latin America, Middle East & India, 
North America and the UK & Ireland (“UK&I”). Corporate head office entities are managed at a Group level. Each geographical region 
(“regional component”) is an aggregation of a number of country-based components along with the Group’s interests in joint ventures 
(together the “country components”). Each geographical region has a separate management team which coordinates the businesses 
within that region.
The Group’s accounting processes are structured around a local finance function in each of the country components. In addition, finance 
shared service centres in the UK, North America and India support certain of the Group’s businesses. The country components report 
to the regions and to the Group through an integrated consolidation system. 
In performing our audit, we determined that we needed to conduct audit work over the complete financial information of each of the 
regional components. We therefore deployed regional component audit teams in each of the seven regions to lead our interactions 
with regional management, to coordinate the audit work performed on country components and to audit and report on the aggregated 
financial information of that region. In addition to the seven regional components, specific audit procedures over central functions, the 
Group consolidation, head office entities and areas of judgment (including taxation, goodwill and intangible assets impairment, treasury 
and post-retirement benefits) were directly led by the Group audit team.
Recognising that not every country component in each regional component is included in our Group audit scope, we considered as part 
of our Group audit oversight responsibility what audit coverage had been obtained in aggregate by our regional component teams by 
reference to country components at which audit work had been undertaken. Beneath the regional component layer, the Group financial 
statements are an aggregation of approximately 700 reporting units, each of which is considered to be a country component. We 
identified 73 country component units that, in our view, required a full scope audit due to their size or risk characteristics. Specific audit 
procedures over significant balances and transactions were performed at a further 16 country component units to give appropriate 
coverage of all material balances. 
Where the work was performed by regional and country component audit teams, we determined the level of involvement we needed 
to have in the audit work at those components. As a result, six of the seven regions were visited by senior members of the Group audit 
team as a supplement to the regular dialogue between our Group and regional teams and the issuance of instructions to direct their 
work. Regional teams visited a further 10 country components performing oversight procedures under our instruction. For those 
components in Group audit scope where a site visit was not undertaken, our Group and our regional component audit teams’ 
involvement included regular dialogue with our country component teams, review of component auditor work papers and participation 
in certain component audit clearance meetings for the more significant country components.
Taken together, the components and functions where we performed either full scope audit work or specified audit procedures 
accounted for 76% of consolidated revenue, 78% of consolidated profit before tax and 73% of consolidated adjusted profit before tax. 
This was before considering the contribution to our audit evidence from performing audit work at the regional and Group levels, 
including disaggregated analytical review procedures and our evaluation of entity level controls, which covered a significant portion of 
the Group’s smaller and lower risk components that were not directly included in our Group audit scope.
Materiality
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality. These, 
together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit 
procedures on the individual financial statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating the effect of misstatements, both individually 
and in aggregate on the financial statements as a whole. 
Based on our professional judgment, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:
Financial report
Integrated Report and Accounts 2017 G4S plc 127  Group financial statements Parent company financial statements
Overall materiality £20m (2016: £15m). £15m (2016: £13.5m).
How we determined it 5% of adjusted profit before tax, being profit 
before tax after adding back certain items that 
are separately reported on the face of the 
consolidated income statement including specific 
items, restructuring costs and profit on disposal.
1% of net assets.
Rationale for 
benchmark applied
The Group’s principal measure of earnings is profit 
before interest, tax and amortisation adjusted for a 
number of items of income and expenditure 
(“Adjusted PBITA”). Management uses this 
measure as it believes that it reflects the underlying 
performance of the Group. We took this measure 
into account in determining our materiality, except 
that we did not adjust profit before tax to add 
back amortisation of acquisition-related intangible 
assets and finance income and expense as in our 
view these are recurring items which do not 
introduce volatility to the Group’s earnings.
The parent company holds the 
Group’s investments and performs 
treasury functions on behalf of the 
Group. Therefore, the entity is not in 
itself profit-oriented. The strength of 
the balance sheet is the key measure 
of financial health that is important  
to shareholders since the primary 
concern for the parent company  
is the payment of dividends and 
servicing of debt.
For each component in the scope of our Group audit, we allocated a materiality that is less than our overall Group 
audit materiality. The range of overall materiality allocated to each regional component was between £5m and 
£15m and by each region to each country component was between £0.01m and £14m. Certain components were 
audited to a local statutory audit materiality level that was also less than our overall Group audit materiality. 
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit 
above £1m (Group audit) (2016: £1m) and £750,000 (parent company audit) (2016: £675,000) as well as 
misstatements below those amounts that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.
Going concern
In accordance with ISAs (UK) we report as follows:
Reporting obligation Outcome
We are required to report if we have anything material to add or draw 
attention to in respect of the directors’ statement in the financial 
statements about whether the directors considered it appropriate to 
adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial 
statements and the directors’ identification of any material uncertainties to 
the Group’s and the parent company’s ability to continue as a going 
concern over a period of at least twelve months from the date of 
approval of the financial statements.
We have nothing material to add  
or to draw attention to. However, 
because not all future events or 
conditions can be predicted, this 
statement is not a guarantee as to 
the Group’s and parent company’s 
ability to continue as a going concern.
We are required to report if the directors’ statement relating to Going 
Concern in accordance with Listing Rule 9.8.6R(3) is materially 
inconsistent with our knowledge obtained in the audit.
We have nothing to report.
Reporting on other information
The other information comprises all of the information in the Annual Report other than the financial statements and 
our auditors’ report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information. Our opinion on the financial 
statements does not cover the other information and, accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion or, except  
to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in this report, any form of assurance thereon. 
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in 
doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our 
knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify an apparent material 
inconsistency or material misstatement, we are required to perform procedures to conclude whether there is a 
material misstatement of the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other information. If, based on 
the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are 
required to report that fact. We have nothing to report based on these responsibilities.
With respect to the Strategic Report, Directors’ Report and Corporate Governance Statement, we also considered 
whether the disclosures required by the UK Companies Act 2006 have been included. 
Based on the responsibilities described above and our work undertaken in the course of the audit, the Companies 
Act 2006, (CA06), ISAs (UK) and the Listing Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) require us also to 
report certain opinions and matters as described below (required by ISAs (UK) unless otherwise stated).
Independent auditors’ report to the members of G4S plc continued
128 G4S plc Integrated Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic Report and Directors’ Report
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit, the information given in the Strategic 
Report and Directors’ Report for the year ended 31 December 2017 is consistent with the financial statements and 
has been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements. (CA06)
In light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and parent company and their environment obtained in 
the course of the audit, we did not identify any material misstatements in the Strategic Report and Directors’ 
Report. (CA06)
Corporate Governance Statement
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit, the information given in the Corporate 
Governance Statement (in the corporate governance report) about internal controls and risk management systems 
in relation to financial reporting processes and about share capital structures in compliance with rules 7.2.5 and 7.2.6 
of the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules sourcebook of the FCA (“DTR”) is consistent with the financial 
statements and has been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements. (CA06)
In light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and parent company and their environment obtained in 
the course of the audit, we did not identify any material misstatements in this information. (CA06)
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit, the information given in the Corporate 
Governance Statement (in the corporate governance report) with respect to the parent company’s corporate 
governance code and practices and about its administrative, management and supervisory bodies and their 
committees complies with rules 7.2.2, 7.2.3 and 7.2.7 of the DTR. (CA06)
We have nothing to report arising from our responsibility to report if a corporate governance statement has not 
been prepared by the parent company. (CA06)
The directors’ assessment of the prospects of the Group and of the principal risks that would threaten the 
solvency or liquidity of the Group
We have nothing material to add or draw attention to regarding:
• The directors’ confirmation on page 91 of the Annual Report that they have carried out a robust assessment of 
the principal risks facing the Group, including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, 
solvency or liquidity;
• The disclosures in the Annual Report that describe those risks and explain how they are being managed or 
mitigated; and
• The directors’ explanation on page 92 of the Annual Report as to how they have assessed the prospects of the 
Group, over what period they have done so and why they consider that period to be appropriate and their 
statement as to whether they have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in 
operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their assessment, including any related 
disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.
We have nothing to report having performed a review of the directors’ statement that they have carried out a 
robust assessment of the principal risks facing the Group and statement in relation to the longer-term viability of the 
Group. Our review was substantially less in scope than an audit and only consisted of: making inquiries and 
considering the directors’ process supporting their statements; checking that the statements are in alignment with 
the relevant provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code (the “Code”); and considering whether the 
statements are consistent with the knowledge and understanding of the Group and parent company and their 
environment obtained in the course of the audit. (Listing Rules)
Other Code Provisions
We have nothing to report in respect of our responsibility to report when: 
• The statement given by the directors, on page 119, that they consider the Annual Report taken as a whole to be 
fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for the members to assess the Group’s 
and parent company’s position and performance, business model and strategy is materially inconsistent with our 
knowledge of the Group and parent company obtained in the course of performing our audit; 
• The section of the Annual Report on page 85 describing the work of the Audit Committee does not 
appropriately address matters communicated by us to the Audit Committee; and
• The directors’ statement relating to the parent company’s compliance with the Code does not properly disclose 
a departure from a relevant provision of the Code specified, under the Listing Rules, for review by the auditors.
Directors’ Remuneration
In our opinion, the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in 
accordance with the Companies Act 2006. (CA06)
Financial report
Integrated Report and Accounts 2017 G4S plc 129 Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit
Responsibilities of the directors for the financial statements
As explained more fully in the directors’ responsibilities set out on page 119, the directors are responsible for the 
preparation of the financial statements in accordance with the applicable framework and for being satisfied that they 
give a true and fair view. The directors are also responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary 
to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud  
or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s and the parent company’s 
ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing as applicable matters related to going concern and using the going 
concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the Group or the parent company or to 
cease operations or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that includes our opinion. 
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with 
ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and 
are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the 
economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. 
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the FRC’s website 
at: www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditors’ report.
Use of this report
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the parent company’s members as a body in 
accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving 
these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is 
shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.

Financial report
Integrated Report and Accounts 2017 G4S plc 135 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 
132 G4S plc Integrated Report and Accounts 2017 
1. General information 
G4S plc is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom. The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements  
of the Company and entities (its subsidiaries) controlled by the Company (collectively comprising “the Group”) and the Group’s  
interest in joint ventures made up to 31 December each year. The Group operates throughout the world and in a wide range of 
functional currencies, the most significant being the Euro, the US dollar and Sterling. The Group’s financial statements are presented  
in Sterling, as the Group’s primary listing is in the UK. The address of the registered office is given on page 212. 
2. Statement of compliance 
The consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006, with International 
Financial Reporting Standards adopted by the European Union (IFRSs) and interpretations issued by the IFRS Interpretations Committee 
(IFRS IC), and the accounting policies have been consistently applied. The parent company financial statements have been prepared in 
accordance with FRS 101 – Reduced Disclosure Framework, in accordance with UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (UK 
GAAP). These are presented on pages 202 to 210. 
3. Significant accounting policies 
(a) Basis of preparation 
The consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared on a going concern basis and using the historical cost basis, 
except for the revaluation of certain non-current assets and financial instruments. The principal accounting policies adopted are set out 
below. Judgments made by the directors in the application of those accounting policies which have a significant effect on the financial 
statements, and estimates with a significant risk of material adjustment, are discussed in note 4.  
Presentation of the Consolidated statement of financial position 
The Consolidated statement of financial position as at 31 December 2016 has been re-presented to show the re-classification of  
certain items within cash and cash equivalents of £20m as investments and to show the re-classification of certain investments totalling 
£12m previously presented as current, as non-current. As a consequence of this change in presentation, cash and cash equivalents as  
at 31 December 2016 have decreased from £851m to £831m, current investments have increased from £44m to £52m and new  
non-current investments of £12m have been presented. 
(b) Presentation of the Consolidated income statement 
In order to provide further clarity in the Group’s Consolidated income statement and segmental analysis, the Group separately  
discloses specific items, restructuring costs, profits or losses on disposal/closure of subsidiaries, amortisation of acquisition-related 
intangible assets and any related expenses and goodwill impairment. This is consistent with the way that financial performance is 
measured by management and reported to the Board and assists in providing a more meaningful analysis of the Group’s results. The 
directors believe that presentation of the Group’s results in this way aids the understanding of the Group’s financial performance. 
Further explanation about the Group’s rationale for separately presenting these items is set out in the Alternative Performance 
Measures section of the Strategic Report on pages 35 and 36. 
Specific items 
The Group’s Consolidated income statement and segmental analysis note separately identify results before specific items. Specific items 
are those that in management’s judgment need to be disclosed separately in arriving at operating profit by virtue of their size, nature  
or incidence. In determining whether an event or transaction is specific, management considers quantitative as well as qualitative factors 
such as the frequency or predictability of occurrence.  
All items that are reported as specific items are evaluated and approved by the Group’s Audit Committee prior to being separately 
disclosed. The Group seeks to be balanced when reporting specific items for both debits and credits, and any reversals of excess 
provisions previously created as specific items are classified consistently as specific items. 
In general, provisions recognised for future losses on onerous contracts are charged to the Consolidated income statement within 
Adjusted PBITA. However, where onerous contract charges are significant by virtue of their size, they are separately charged within 
specific items. Such losses are distinct from “in-year” losses, which are utilised against provisions for onerous contract losses. Releases  
of onerous contract provisions originally charged as specific items are separately credited within specific items. 
Specific items may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures used by other companies. Specific items for the current and prior 
years are described in note 8. 
Other separately disclosed items  
In order to provide further clarity in the Consolidated income statement, the Group also discloses separately certain strategic 
restructuring costs, profits or losses on disposal or closure of subsidiaries, acquisition-related amortisation and expenses and  
goodwill impairment. 
Restructuring costs that are separately disclosed reflect the multi-year productivity programme which is being implemented by the 
Group. This programme is of a strategic nature and, as such, is monitored and approved by the Group’s Executive Committee. During 
2016 and 2017 activities under the programme have focused primarily on transforming the operating model in the UK & Ireland and 
Europe regions. Restructuring costs that are incurred in the normal course of business are recorded within Adjusted PBITA. Going 
forwards the Group has announced a three-year plan to 2020 to implement efficient organisational design and leaner processes,  
which is likely to require further restructuring investment. 
Further explanation about the Group’s rationale for separately presenting profits or losses on disposal or closure of subsidiaries, 
amortisation of acquisition-related intangible assets and goodwill impairment is set out on page 36.

 Integrated Report and Accounts 2017 G4S plc 133 
(c) Basis of consolidation 
Subsidiaries 
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. Control is achieved where the Group has existing rights that give it the current ability 
to direct the activities that affect the Group’s returns and exposure or rights to variable returns from the entity. This can be determined 
either by the Group’s ownership percentage, or by the terms of any shareholder agreement. In the case of certain investments detailed 
analysis of the different contracts in place is required, together with a level of judgment, to ascertain whether there is control under the 
definition of IFRS 10 – Consolidated financial statements (see note 4). 
On acquisition, the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquired business are measured at their fair values at the date of 
acquisition. The cost of acquisition is measured as the acquisition date fair value of the assets transferred as consideration to the vendor 
and does not include transaction costs. Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is 
recognised as goodwill. Any deficiency in the cost of acquisition below the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired (i.e. discount 
on acquisition) is credited to the Consolidated income statement in the year of acquisition. 
The cost of acquisition includes the present value of deferred and contingent consideration payable, including that in respect of  
put options held by non-controlling shareholders, as estimated at the date of acquisition. Subsequent changes to the present value  
of the estimate of contingent consideration and any difference upon final settlement of such a liability are recognised in the 
Consolidated income statement with respect to contingent consideration and in other comprehensive income with respect to put 
options. Non-controlling interests are stated at their proportion of the fair values of the assets and liabilities recognised. Profits and 
losses are applied in the proportion of their respective ownership to the interest of the parent and to the non-controlling interest.  
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the Consolidated income statement from the  
effective date of control and up to the effective date of disposal, respectively.  
Joint ventures 
A joint venture is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control have the rights to the net assets of the arrangement. 
The results and assets and liabilities of joint ventures are incorporated in the Group’s consolidated financial statements using the equity 
method of accounting. Under the equity method, investments in joint ventures are carried in the Consolidated statement of financial 
position at cost as adjusted for post-acquisition changes in the Group’s share of the net assets of the joint venture, less any impairment 
in the value of the investment. The Group’s share of post-tax profits or losses is recognised in the Consolidated income statement.  
Transactions eliminated on consolidation 
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation. Where a Group company transacts with  
a joint venture of the Group, profits and losses are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in the relevant joint venture.  
(d) Foreign currencies 
The financial statements of each of the Group’s businesses are prepared in the functional currency applicable to that business. 
Transactions in currencies other than the functional currency are translated at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the 
transactions. At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities which are denominated in other currencies are retranslated  
at the rates prevailing on that date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities carried at fair value which are denominated in other currencies 
are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined. Non-monetary items measured at historical cost 
denominated in other currencies are not retranslated. Gains and losses arising on retranslation are included in the Consolidated income 
statement for the period.  
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s overseas operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on their 
acquisition, are translated into Sterling at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date. Income and expenses are translated into 
Sterling at the average exchange rates for the period (unless this is not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rate 
prevailing on the transaction dates, in which case income and expenses are translated at the rates on the dates of the transact ions). 
Exchange differences arising are recognised in other comprehensive income, together with exchange differences arising on monetary  
items that are in substance a part of the Group’s net investment in foreign operations, and on borrowings and other currency instruments 
designated as hedges of such investments where and to the extent that the hedges are deemed to be effective. On disposal, translation 
differences are recognised in the Consolidated income statement in the period in which the operation is disposed of.

3. Significant accounting policies continued 
(e) Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting  
In accordance with its treasury policy, the Group only holds or issues derivative financial instruments to manage the Group’s exposure 
to financial risk, not for trading purposes. Such financial risk includes the interest-rate risk on the Group’s variable-rate borrowings, the 
fair-value risk on the Group’s fixed-rate borrowings, commodity risk in relation to its diesel consumption and foreign-exchange risk on 
transactions, on the translation of the Group’s results and on the translation of the Group’s net assets measured in foreign currencies. 
The Group manages these risks through a range of derivative financial instruments, including interest-rate swaps, fixed-rate agreements, 
commodity swaps, commodity options, forward-currency contracts and currency swaps.  
Derivative financial instruments are recognised in the Consolidated statement of financial position at fair value as financial assets or 
financial liabilities.  
The gain or loss on re-measurement to fair value is recognised immediately in the Consolidated income statement, unless the 
derivatives qualify for hedge accounting where the treatment of any resultant gain or loss depends on the nature of the item  
being hedged as described below: 
Fair-value hedges 
The change in the fair value of both the hedging instrument and the related portion of the hedged item that is attributable to  
the hedged risk is recognised immediately in the Consolidated income statement.  
Cash-flow and net-investment hedges  
The change in the fair value of the portion of the hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective hedge is recognised in equity 
and subsequently recycled to the Consolidated income statement when the hedged cash flow or hedged net investment impacts the 
Consolidated income statement. The ineffective portion of the fair value of the hedging instrument is recognised immediately in the 
Consolidated income statement.  
(f) Intangible assets  
Goodwill  
Business combinations are accounted for by the application of the acquisition method. Goodwill arising on consolidation represents  
the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent  
liabilities at the date of acquisition of a subsidiary or joint venture. No goodwill arises on the acquisition of an additional interest from a 
non-controlling interest in a subsidiary as this is accounted for as an equity transaction. Goodwill is stated at cost, less any accumulated 
impairment losses, and is tested annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that amounts may be impaired.  
On disposal of a subsidiary or joint venture, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or  
loss on disposal.  
Acquisition-related intangible assets  
Intangible assets on acquisitions that are either separable or arising from contractual rights are recognised at fair value at the date 
of acquisition. Such acquisition-related intangible assets include trademarks, technology, customer contracts and customer relationships. 
The fair value of acquisition-related intangible assets is determined by reference to market prices of similar assets, where such 
information is available, or by the use of appropriate valuation techniques, including the royalty relief method and the excess 
earnings method. 
Acquisition-related intangible assets are amortised by equal annual instalments over their expected economic life. The directors  
review acquisition-related intangible assets on an on-going basis and, where appropriate, provide for any impairment in value.  
The estimated useful lives are as follows: 
Trademarks and technology up to a maximum of five years 
Customer contracts and customer relationships up to a maximum of ten years 
Non-acquisition-related intangible assets 
Development expenditure represents expenditure incurred in establishing new services and products of the Group. Such expenditure  
is recognised as an intangible asset only if the following can be demonstrated: the expenditure creates an identifiable asset, its cost can 
be measured reliably, it is probable that it will generate future economic benefits, it is technically and commercially feasible, and the 
Group has sufficient resources to complete development. In all other instances, the cost of such expenditure is taken directly to the 
Consolidated income statement. 
Capitalised development expenditure is amortised over the period during which the expenditure is expected to be revenue-producing, 
up to a maximum of ten years. The directors review the capitalised development expenditure on an on-going basis and, where 
appropriate, provide for any impairment in value.  
Research expenditure is charged to the Consolidated income statement in the year in which it is incurred.  
Capitalised computer software is stated at cost, net of amortisation and any provision for impairment. Amortisation is charged on 
software so as to write off the cost of the assets to their estimated residual values by equal annual instalments over their expected 
useful economic lives, up to a maximum of eight years.  
  
138 G4S plc Integrated Report and Accounts 2017  
 Integrated Report and Accounts 2017 G4S plc 135 
(g) Property, plant and equipment  
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and any provision for impairment. Depreciation  
is provided on all property, plant and equipment other than freehold land. Depreciation is calculated so as to write off the cost  
of the assets to their estimated residual values by equal annual instalments over their expected useful economic lives as follows:  
Freehold and long leasehold buildings up to 50 years 
Short leasehold buildings (under 50 years) over the life of the lease 
Equipment and motor vehicles 2 to 10 years 
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over the shorter of their expected useful economic lives and the terms of the  
relevant lease. 
Where significant, the residual values and the useful economic lives of property, plant and equipment are re-assessed annually.  
(h) Financial instruments  
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instruments.  
Trade receivables  
Trade receivables are initially recognised at fair value and are subsequently carried at amortised cost less provision for impairment. 
Provisions are made where the Group identifies a risk of non-payment, taking into account ageing, previous losses experienced and 
other local economic and market conditions and are calculated by discounting expected cash flows using the effective interest rate  
at origination of the receivable. 
Investments  
Investments comprise investments in securities which are classified as held-for-trading. Such investments are initially recognised at cost, 
including transaction costs, and subsequently measured at fair value. Gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are recognised  
in the Consolidated income statement.  
Cash and cash equivalents  
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and that form  
an integral part of the Group’s cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the 
Consolidated statement of cash flow. 
Interest-bearing borrowings  
Interest-bearing bank overdrafts, loans and loan notes are recognised at the value of proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Finance 
charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are recognised in the Consolidated income 
statement on an accrual basis using the effective-interest method.  
Trade payables  
Trade payables are not interest-bearing and are stated initially at fair value.  
Equity instruments  
Equity instruments issued by the Group are recorded at the value of proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.  
(i) Inventories  
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost represents expenditure incurred in the ordinary course of 
business in bringing inventories to their present condition and location and includes appropriate overheads. Cost is calculated using 
either the weighted average or the first-in-first-out method. Net realisable value is based on estimated selling price, less further costs 
expected to be incurred to completion and disposal.  
(j) Impairment  
The carrying values of the Group’s assets, with the exception of inventories, financial receivables and deferred tax assets, are reviewed 
on an on-going basis for any indication of impairment and, if any such indication exists, the assets’ recoverable amount is estimated. An 
impairment loss is recognised in the Consolidated income statement whenever the carrying value of an asset or its cash-generating unit 
exceeds its recoverable amount.  
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. In respect of any other asset, an impairment loss is reversed if there has  
been a change in the estimates used to determine its recoverable amount. The amount of the reversal is limited such that the asset’s 
carrying amount does not exceed that which would have been determined (after depreciation and amortisation) if no impairment loss 
had been recognised.

3. Significant accounting policies continued 
(k) Employee benefits  
Retirement benefit costs  
Payments to defined contribution schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due. Payments made to state-managed retirement 
benefit schemes are dealt with as payments to defined contribution schemes where the Group’s obligations under the schemes are 
equivalent to those arising in a defined contribution retirement benefits scheme.  
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the Consolidated statement of financial position represents the present value of the 
Group’s total defined benefit obligation reduced by the fair value of the related scheme assets. The total of all of the Group’s individual 
schemes that are in a net asset position is presented separately in the Consolidated statement of financial position. The value of any net 
asset recognised for a defined benefit scheme is limited to the present value of available refunds and reductions in future contributions 
to the scheme. 
For defined benefit plans, the cost charged to the Consolidated income statement consists of current service cost, net interest cost,  
and past service cost. The finance element of the pension charge is shown in finance expense and the remaining service cost element  
is charged as a component of employee costs in the Consolidated income statement. Actuarial and other re-measurement gains and 
losses are recognised immediately in full within other comprehensive income. 
Share-based payments 
The Group issues equity-settled and cash-settled share-based payments to certain employees. The fair value of equity-settled share-
based payments is determined at the date of grant and expensed, with a corresponding increase in equity, on a straight-line basis  
over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of the shares that will eventually vest. The amount expensed is adjusted over 
the vesting period for changes in the estimate of the number of shares that will eventually vest, excluding changes resulting from any 
market-related performance conditions. Cash-settled share-based payments are recognised as a liability at fair value at the date of  
grant. The value of the liability is re-measured at each reporting date and at the date the liability is settled. Changes in the liability  
are recognised directly in the Consolidated income statement. 
(l) Provisions and contingent liabilities 
Provisions are recognised when a present legal or constructive obligation exists for a future liability in respect of a past event and where 
the amount of the obligation can be estimated reliably. The amount recognised as a provision is the Group’s best estimate of the likely 
outflows at the end of the reporting period.  
In respect of claims, onerous customer contracts and litigation, the Group provides for anticipated costs where an outflow of resources 
is considered probable and a reasonable estimate can be made of the likely outcome. For all risks, the ultimate liability may vary from 
the amounts provided and will be dependent upon the eventual outcome of any settlement. Management exercises judgment in 
measuring the Group’s exposures to contingent liabilities (see note 33) through assessing the likelihood that a potential claim or  
liability will arise and in quantifying the possible range of financial outcomes. 
Where the time value of money is material, provisions are stated at the present value of the expected expenditure using an appropriate 
discount rate. 
(m) Restructuring costs 
A restructuring provision is recognised when the Group has developed a detailed formal plan for the restructuring and has raised a 
valid expectation in those affected that it will carry out the restructuring by starting to implement the plan or by announcing its main 
features to those affected by it. The measurement of a restructuring provision includes only the direct expenditures arising from the 
restructuring, which are those amounts that are both necessarily entailed by the restructuring and not associated with the on-going 
activities of the entity. 
The Group distinguishes in the Consolidated income statement between restructuring costs that are recurring and those that relate 
to one-off or transformational Group programmes that impact a number of operations.  
Recurring restructuring costs that are incurred in the normal course of business are recorded as part of the Group’s results within 
adjusted profit before interest, tax and amortisation (Adjusted PBITA).  
Restructuring costs that are one-off and individually material or relate to programmes linked to the Group’s wider transformation,  
and require approval at executive level, are disclosed separately in the Consolidated income statement. 
(n) Revenue recognition  
The Group’s revenue arises from two primary sources – Secure Solutions products, mainly comprising manned security and facilities 
management services, and Cash Solutions, mainly the provision of physical cash management services.  
Within Secure Solutions there are additional revenue streams arising from: 
• 
Technology services, comprising the supply, installation and monitoring of alarm systems, and security and building systems 
technology;  
• 
Facilities management; and  
• 
Care & Justice services. 
  
140 G4S plc Integrated Report and Accounts 2017  
 Integrated Report and Accounts 2017 G4S plc 137 
Within Cash Solutions there is an additional revenue stream arising from Technology services to retailers, comprising the provision  
of hardware and software for customer cash management and related services. 
In all of these business areas revenue is measured at the fair value of consideration received or receivable, net of discounts, VAT  
and other sales-related taxes. 
Certain low-volume, high-value government contracts, mainly for Care & Justice services and facilities management services, can cover a 
range of bundled services over a long period of time, that are provided on a time and materials basis. Revenue for this type of contracts 
is recognised on an accrual basis based on the individual services provided and in accordance with the terms of the contract. 
Where services provided to customers include more than one particular revenue source, particularly in cash technology services and in 
the alarms business, such as the supply and installation of equipment together with on-going services and maintenance contracts, the fair 
value of each revenue source is separately identified and allocated to each element of the arrangement and recognised as the product is 
sold or the services are delivered. 
Manned security, cash management, facilities management, other care and justice services and security systems services 
Revenue is recognised to reflect the period in which the service is provided. 
Security alarm systems installations 
Revenue for B2B customers is recognised on completion of the installation, and the attributable costs of the installation are recognised 
as a cost of sale, given that economic ownership of the asset is transferred to the customer. 
Revenue for B2C customers is deferred and recognised along with the revenue from the related monitoring service over the term  
of the contract, given that legal and economic ownership of the assets remains with the Group. 
Service and monitoring fees for all alarm system contracts are recognised in the period when the service is provided.  
Long-term contracts  
These contracts are mainly related to certain long-term construction or alarm or other technology installation projects which span  
one or more reporting periods and where long-term contract accounting is applied.  
Where the outcome of a long-term contract can be estimated reliably, revenue and costs are recognised by reference to the stage of 
completion of the contract activity at the balance sheet date. This is measured either by the proportion that contract costs incurred for 
work to date bear to the estimated total contract costs, or by the proportion that the sales value of work completed to date bears to 
the total sales value. Variations in contract work, claims and incentive payments are included to the extent that it is likely that they will 
be agreed with the customer and hence recoverable. 
Where the outcome of a long-term contract cannot be estimated reliably, contract revenue is recognised only to the extent of  
contract costs incurred that are deemed likely to be recoverable. Contract costs are recognised as expenses as they are incurred.  
Where it is probable that total contract costs will exceed total contract revenue, the expected loss is recognised immediately as  
an expense. 
(o) Pre-contract and mobilisation costs 
Pre-contract costs in respect of major outsourcing contracts, incurred after the point at which the Group achieves preferred bidder 
status (at which point it is considered probable that the contract will be obtained) and before contract mobilisation, are capitalised  
and expensed over the life of the contract, subject to recoverability criteria. Costs incurred prior to this point are expensed as incurred. 
Capitalised costs are expensed immediately in the event that preferred bidder status is not followed by the award of the contract, or 
where these may no longer be expected to be recovered through future profits. 
Mobilisation costs are those costs incurred after the signing of a contract with a customer, and prior to commencement of delivery of 
the contract. Costs incurred during this stage are generally only capitalised if the criteria to be capitalised as inventories or as property, 
plant and equipment are met. In all other cases mobilisation costs are expensed as incurred. 
(p) Onerous contracts 
Onerous contract provisions are recognised where the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the contract exceed the 
economic benefits expected to be received under it. Management’s profit-improvement plans to recover the position on loss-making 
contracts require a level of judgment and are generally taken into account in the calculation of the onerous contract provision only 
when implementation has commenced and tangible evidence exists of benefits being delivered. The provision is calculated based on 
discounted cash flows to the end of the contract.  
In general, provisions recognised for future losses are charged to the Consolidated income statement within Adjusted PBITA.  
Where onerous contract provisions are material by virtue of their size, they are separately charged within specific items.  
In-year operating losses from onerous contracts are accounted for as a utilisation of the related provision for future losses. Any  
excess or shortfall to the initial estimate for onerous contract provisions is credited or charged in the Consolidated income statement 
consistent with where the charge for the initial provision was recognised.  
Vacant property provisions are recognised when the Group has committed to a course of action that will result in the property 
becoming vacant. The provision is calculated based on discounted cash flows to the end of the lease taking into account expected 
future sub-lease income.

3. Significant accounting policies continued 
(q) Interest  
Interest income is accrued on a time basis by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable.  
This is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset’s net carrying 
amount. Borrowing costs, also calculated using the effective-interest method, are recognised as an expense in the Consolidated  
income statement. 
(r) Income taxes  
Tax is recognised in the Consolidated income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in equity, in which  
case it is recognised through other comprehensive income. The tax expense represents the sum of current tax and deferred tax,  
and excludes charges for interest on tax and certain penalties on tax settlements, which are reported within finance expenses and 
administration expenses respectively. 
Current tax is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the Consolidated income 
statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes  
items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted  
or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.  
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in 
the consolidated financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for 
using the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences. Deferred 
tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary 
differences can be utilised.  
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and interests in joint 
ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary 
difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.  
The carrying amount of potential deferred tax assets is re-assessed at each balance sheet date and recognised to the extent that  
it is probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow those assets to be recovered. 
Deferred tax is measured based on the tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period.  
Tax liabilities or refunds may differ from those anticipated due to changes in tax legislation, differing interpretations of tax legislation and 
uncertainties surrounding the application of tax legislation. In situations where uncertainties exist, provision is made for tax liabilities and 
assets on the basis of management judgment following consideration of the available relevant information. Further detail on 
management’s judgments in respect of taxation is provided in note 4. 
(s) Leasing 
Leases are classified as finance leases when the terms of the lease transfer substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership  
to the lessee. On occasion this classification requires a level of judgment. All other leases are classified as operating leases.  
Assets held under finance leases are recognised at the inception of the lease at their fair value or, if lower, at the present value of the 
minimum lease payments. The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the Consolidated statement of financial position as a 
finance lease obligation. Lease payments made or received are apportioned between finance charges or income and the reduction of 
the lease liability or asset so as to produce a constant rate of interest on the outstanding balance of the liability or asset.  
Rentals payable or receivable under operating leases are charged or credited to income on a straight-line basis over the lease term,  
as are incentives to enter into operating leases.  
(t) Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations  
Non-current assets (and disposal groups) classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less 
costs to sell.  
Non-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered through a sale 
transaction rather than through continuing use. This condition is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and the asset  
(or disposal group) is available for immediate sale in its present condition. The Group must be committed to the sale, which should  
be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of classification.  
A discontinued operation is a component of the Group’s business that represents a separate major line of business or geographical area 
of operations or is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale that has been disposed of, has been abandoned or meets the 
criteria to be classified as held for sale.  
(u) Dividend distribution  
Dividends are recognised as distributions to equity holders in the period in which they are paid or approved by the shareholders in 
general meeting.

(v) Adoption of new and revised accounting standards and interpretations 
The Group has not early-adopted any standard, amendment or interpretation. A number of new standards, amendments to standards 
and interpretations are not yet effective for the year ended 31 December 2017. The directors are currently evaluating the impact of 
these new standards on the group financial statements: 
• 
Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2014-2016 Cycle 
• 
IFRS 2 amendments – Classification and Measurement of share-based payment transactions 
• 
IFRIC 22 – Foreign currency transactions and advance consideration  
• 
IFRIC 23 – Uncertainty over income tax treatments 
IFRS 15 – Revenue from Contracts with Customers 
The Group has adopted IFRS 15 – Revenue from Contracts with Customers with effect from 1 January 2018, and will prepare its 2018 
Interim Results and Integrated Report and Accounts in accordance with the requirements of this new standard, with full retrospective 
application restating comparatives where appropriate. 
The majority of the services which the Group provides are related to Secure Solutions (including security systems) and Cash Solutions 
(including hardware and software systems). Following a thorough review of the contractual terms of the contracts under which the 
Group provides these services, and from an assessment of the basis on which customers are invoiced in relation to work performed  
on a number of material contracts in each of these business categories, it has been concluded that the Group’s right to consideration 
from the customer corresponds directly with the value to the customer of the Group’s performance completed to date. The Group  
is therefore allowed to recognise revenue in the amount to which it has the right to invoice, and there will be no significant change  
in revenue recognition in respect of these services. The Group will apply the practical expedient approach allowed by IFRS 15 in such 
cases, whereby revenue is recognised in line with amounts invoiced to customers, based on the value of services performed over the 
duration of the contract.  
Only a residual amount of care and justice services have been identified where the practical expedient approach is not applicable, but 
based on a detailed assessment of the most material of such contracts in relation to IFRS 15 revenue recognition criteria, no material 
change to current revenue recognition has been identified. 
In addition to review and assessment of revenue recognition, the Group has assessed the impact of IFRS 15 criteria for capitalisation  
of contract-acquisition and contract-fulfilment costs by comparison with its existing accounting policies. Certain changes (such as  
the cessation of capitalisation of pre-contract costs after attainment of preferred supplier status) are required to those existing  
policies under IFRS 15, but these changes will likewise have no material impact on the Group’s results or Consolidated statement  
of financial position. 
As a result of these reviews, management has concluded that, whilst refinements are required to certain of the Group’s existing  
revenue recognition and contract cost capitalisation policies for compliance with IFRS 15, together with the inclusion of a number of 
additional disclosures in the Integrated Report and Accounts for 2018 and for subsequent years, there will be no material change to  
the Group’s revenue, Adjusted PBITA, profit before tax or profit for the year, or to its Consolidated statement of financial position,  
as a consequence of adoption of this new standard. 
IFRS 9 – Financial Instruments 
The Group has adopted IFRS 9 – Financial Instruments with effect from 1 January 2018, and will prepare its 2018 Interim Results and 
Integrated Report and Accounts in accordance with the requirements of this new standard, with restated comparatives where appropriate. 
The new standard is applicable to financial assets and financial liabilities, and covers the classification, measurement, impairment and  
de-recognition of financial assets and liabilities together with a new hedge accounting model. 
Management has completed its assessment of the impact of this new accounting standard on its consolidated financial statements, with 
particular reference to the impact of the expected credit loss model for impairment of financial assets and to the changes in respect  
of hedge accounting, from which it has been concluded that there will be no material change to the Group’s revenue, Adjusted PBITA, 
profit before tax or profit for the year, or to its Consolidated statement of financial position, as a consequence of adoption of IFRS 9, 
and there will be no change to the Group’s existing hedging strategy. 
IFRS 16 – Leases 
The Group continues to assess the impact of adopting IFRS 16 – Leases, which will be effective for the Group’s financial year ending  
31 December 2019. 
Additional debt will be recognised in the Consolidated statement of financial position, together with additional property, plant and 
equipment assets.  
The impact on the Consolidated income statement is currently expected to be a small increase in Adjusted PBITA, due to the  
re-classification of the interest element of operating lease rentals as finance costs.  
The impact on Profit before tax will be variable over the term of a lease, as interest is charged at the effective rate on the reducing 
balance of the liability over the lease term. Over the course of each lease the cumulative impact on pre-tax profit will be neutral. 
The impact on the Consolidated statement of cash flows will be an increase in net cash flow from operating activities, equivalent to the 
increase in Adjusted PBITA, matched by an increase in cash outflow from financing activities due to the re-classification of finance lease 
interest, with no impact on net cash flow.

4. Accounting estimates, judgments and assumptions  
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with adopted IFRSs requires management to make judgments, estimates and 
assumptions that affect the application of the Group’s accounting policies, which are described in note 3, with respect to the carrying 
amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of  
the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting period.  
Significant judgments 
Significant judgments are those made by management when applying its accounting policies that are considered to have the most 
significant impact on amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements. 
During the year, management reassessed the most significant judgments and determined that those relating to revenue recognition 
were no longer considered to be significant.  
Those judgments that are considered to have the most significant impact on amounts recognised in the consolidated financial 
statements, apart from those involving estimations (which are disclosed separately below), are the following: 
Compliance with foreign ownership rules and consolidation of subsidiaries 
The Group has a diverse set of complex ownership structures, which are sometimes driven by local laws and regulations relating to 
foreign ownership. In some instances the Group operates through local structures with limited direct share ownership of the business 
but exercises control through shareholder agreements.  
Judgment is required in determining whether certain Group entities qualify for consolidation under IFRS10 – Consolidated Financial 
Statements, and in some instances professional and legal advice is sought to support these judgments. Consolidation of any of these 
entities would be at risk if the Group’s ability to enforce its rights of control was successfully challenged. 
These judgments have been applied in determining how the Group consolidates businesses with an aggregated revenue of c.£800m, 
Adjusted PBITA of c.£60m and equity shareholders’ funds of c.£200m. The impact on the Group’s earnings (after tax) of equity 
accounting rather than full consolidation would not be material. 
Classification of leases 
The classification of leases as operating or finance leases is based on the criteria set out in IAS 17 – Leases, which defines a series  
of attributes which, when contained within a lease, may result in its classification as a finance lease. Judgment is required in assessing 
leases at inception as to whether individual attributes, in aggregate or in isolation, are such that the substance of the lease is that of  
a finance lease. Details of the Group’s finance leases are disclosed in note 28 and the Group’s operating lease commitments are set  
out in note 38. 
Alternative Performance Measures 
The Group uses Adjusted PBITA as a consistent internal and external reporting measure of its performance, as management views it as 
being more representative of the normal course of business and more comparable period to period. Adjusted PBITA excludes strategic 
restructuring costs, amortisation of acquisition-related intangible assets and specific and other separately disclosed items which the 
Group believes should be disclosed separately by virtue of their size, nature or incidence. Judgment is required when defining those 
items to be disclosed separately and when applying the classification criteria to each period’s results. Further details on separately 
disclosed items are set out in note 8. 
Significant estimates and assumptions 
Significant estimates and associated assumptions are those that have a significant risk of resulting in a material adjustment to the carrying 
amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year. Significant estimates are made taking into account historical experience 
and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, including current and expected economic 
conditions, and, in some cases, actuarial techniques. Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an on-going basis. Revisions 
to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised and in any future periods affected. 
The most significant estimates, assumptions and sources of uncertainty in preparing the Group’s 2017 consolidated financial statements 
are set out below: 
Onerous contracts 
The Group delivers certain long-term services that are complex in nature. Some of these contracts may evolve to become loss-making, 
such that net unavoidable losses are expected to be incurred over their life.  
Where a contract is expected to be loss-making over its remaining term, the net present value of estimated future losses is determined 
in order to calculate an onerous contract provision. The identification and measurement of such provisions is subject to inherent risk, 
given the extended time periods often involved and the number of variables which are not all within the Group’s control.  
In particular, estimation is required in assessing future expected revenue and costs on such contracts, including: 
• 
determining the expected impact of any profit improvement plans where sufficient evidence exists of benefits being delivered  
by those plans; and 
• 
determining an appropriate discount rate to apply to material future cash flows. 
The level of uncertainty in the estimates and assumptions supporting expected future revenues and costs can vary with the complexity 
of each contract and with the form of service delivery.  
For further details of how the Group has applied judgments and estimates to significant onerous contract provisions refer to note 33  
on pages 179 to 181.  
144 G4S plc Integrated Report and Accounts 2017  
 Integrated Report and Accounts 2017 G4S plc 141 
Carrying value of goodwill 
The Group tests tangible and intangible assets, including goodwill, for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if there are 
indications that amounts may be impaired. The impairment analysis for such assets is based principally upon discounted estimated future 
cash flows from the use and eventual disposal of the assets, requiring assumptions on growth rates and the impact of local economic 
factors. The full methodology and results of the Group’s impairment testing, including an analysis of the sensitivity of goodwill to the key 
assumptions, are presented in note 18. 
Taxation 
The Group operates in many tax jurisdictions including countries where the tax legislation is not consistently applied and under some 
complex contractual circumstances where the responsibility for tax arising is not always clear. Judgments and estimates are required to 
determine the appropriate amount of tax to provide for and any required disclosure around contingent tax liabilities at each period end.  
Provisions for tax liabilities are estimated for existing matters under dispute with local tax authorities, as well as for matters which it is 
considered may be disputed by them, where it is probable that a future liability will arise. The tax liability provided is management’s best 
estimate, taking into account external advice, the anticipated position of the relevant tax authorities, and other local factors. In certain 
cases, and where appropriate, a probability weighting is applied in determining the amount provided. In all cases it is assumed that  
the local tax authorities have, or will be provided with, full information. Therefore the tax liability is not reduced for “detection risk”. 
Further details about the range of the potential tax exposure to which the Group is subject are set out in note 13.  
The Group has tax losses and other deductible temporary differences, mainly in the UK and USA, that have the potential to reduce tax 
payments in future years. Deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent that their recovery is probable, having regard to the 
projected future taxable income of these entities and after taking into account specific risk factors that affect the recovery of these 
assets. The same profit projections are used for these purposes as are used by the business, for example in assessing the carrying  
value of goodwill. Judgment is applied on a case-by-case basis due to the jurisdictional nature of taxation. This analysis is considered 
afresh at each balance sheet date. 
Valuation of retirement benefit obligations 
The valuation of defined retirement benefit schemes is arrived at using the advice of qualified independent actuaries who use  
the projected unit credit method for determining the Group’s obligations. This methodology requires the use of a variety of  
assumptions and estimates, including the determination of an appropriate discount rate, the expected return on scheme assets,  
mortality assumptions, future service and earnings increases of employees and inflation. Full details of the Group’s retirement benefit 
obligations, including an analysis of the sensitivity of the calculations to the key assumptions, are presented in note 32. 
Labour laws and commercial agreements  
The Group is involved in disputes in a number of countries, mainly related to activities incidental to its operations. Currently there  
are a number of such disputes open in relation to the application of local labour law, commercial agreements with customers and 
subcontractors and claims and compliance matters, in some cases in the course of litigation. In addition the interpretation of labour laws 
and regulations in a number of countries where the Group operates is complex and there is an inherent judgment made when applying 
those laws and regulations that are open to interpretation. As such, there is a risk that further disputes and claims from employees could 
arise in the future. Where there is a dispute (or where there is a risk of a dispute on claims in the future) and where, based on legal 
counsel advice, the Group estimates that it is probable that the dispute will result in an outflow of economic resources, provision is 
made based on the Group’s best estimate of the likely financial outcome. For further details of how the Group has applied judgments 
and estimates to these provisions and, where relevant, an analysis of the sensitivity of the provisions to the key underlying estimates  
and assumptions, refer to note 33 on pages 179 to 181.  
In certain instances it is not possible to determine a reliable estimate or a reasonable range of potential outcomes. For these cases, 
disclosure of the relevant items as contingent liabilities is provided in note 33.

7. Discontinued operations 
The loss from discontinued operations of £6m in the current year relates to impairments of trade receivables and costs and charges 
incurred or expected to be incurred relating to historical disposals of businesses classified as discontinued operations at the time of  
sale (2016: £3m costs and charges relating to historical disposals). Discontinued operations incurred no tax charge during the year 
(2016: £nil). None of the Group’s businesses currently held for sale or closure meet the criteria to be classified as discontinued 
operations in the current year (2016: none). 
The effect of discontinued operations on segment results is disclosed in note 6. 
Discontinued operations generated no cash flows for the year ended 31 December 2017 (2016: £9m operating cash outflow).

Operating profit 501 402
Operating profit includes items that are separately disclosed for the year ended 31 December 2017 relating to: 
• 
Net specific items charge of £34m (2016: £13m), of which £19m (2016: £4m) primarily relates to the anticipated total losses over 
the next 15-20 years in respect of certain UK contracts. The net specific item charge also includes £6m relating to the estimated  
cost of settlement of subcontractor claims from commercial disputes in respect of prior years, and £9m relating mainly to the 
settlement of labour-related disputes in respect of prior years in North America and Latin America. Specific items in 2016 included 
a £10m charge due to the revision of estimates relating to legacy acquisitions and labour claims in Latin America, £7m relating to 
commercial restructuring in Middle East & India, and a net £4m supplementary onerous contract provision primarily in respect of  
the Compass asylum seekers contract, all offset by an £8m credit mainly relating to the recovery of a legal claim in Europe and of 
certain disputed debtor balances in the UK; 
• 
Costs of £20m (2016: £12m) arising from restructuring activities during the year, mainly in the UK & Ireland and Europe regions, as 
part of the multi-year strategic prodcutivity programme across the Group which is now drawing to a close. In addition, the Group 
incurred non-strategic severance costs of £10m (2016: £9m) which are included within cost of sales and administration expenses  
as appropriate. Going forwards the Group has announced a three-year plan to 2020 to implement efficient organisational design  
and leaner processes, which is likely to require further restructuring investment; 
• 
Amortisation of acquisition-related intangible assets of £10m (2016: £32m) is lower than the prior year as certain intangible assets 
recognised on a number of legacy acquisitions became fully amortised in 2016; and 
•

The effective tax rate for continuing operations was 33% (2016: 26%). 
(i) Items that are not deductible and other additions to taxable profit – £20m (2016: £25m) 
This category reflects the tax effect of items which, in management’s judgment, are potentially disallowable for the purposes  
of determining local taxable profits. This includes unrelieved withholding taxes of £8m (2016: £9m) relating to withholding tax  
deducted on domestic or cross-border payments in excess of the profits tax arising in the recipient company. 
(ii) Profits on disposal of businesses not taxable or covered by capital losses – £nil (2016: £(8)m) 
This relates to profits arising on the disposal of businesses where any taxable gain arising on the disposal is either exempt from tax 
under the relevant tax legislation or there are capital losses available to offset against those taxable gains, for which deferred tax assets 
were not previously recognised. Similarly, losses on disposal of businesses not relieved of £1m (2016: £7m) relates to the disposal of 
businesses where no deductible loss arises or where there is a low probability that losses will be utilised. 
(iii) Different tax rates of subsidiaries operating in non-UK jurisdictions – £23m (2016: £12m) 
This relates to the effect of profits of the Group being subject to tax at rates different from the current UK corporation tax rate of 19%.  
(iv) Tax losses not recognised in the current year – £2m (2016: £2m) 
This relates to current-year losses not recognised as deferred tax assets on the basis that there are insufficient taxable profits available  
to utilise those losses in the foreseeable future. 
(v) Impact of US tax reforms – £19m (2016: £nil) 
On 22 December 2017, the US tax legislation known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was signed into law and introduced significant 
changes in US tax laws taking effect on 1 January 2018. For 2017, the changes in legislation result in a one-off charge to the income 
statement of £19m which relates to a revaluation of deferred tax asset balances due to the reduction in the US Federal tax rate and  
the impairment of foreign tax credits which are no longer expected to be utilisable in future periods against foreign source income.  
On the basis of currently available information and analysis completed since the legislation was enacted, these are likely to be the most 
significant impacts for the Group. However, as more detailed analysis and future legislative guidance becomes available, it is possible that 
the Group may be further impacted in the current year and subsequent years by the legislative changes. 
(vi) Re-assessment of deferred tax recoverability on losses – £(5)m (2016: £(36)m) 
Relates to the recognition of additional deferred tax assets on historical tax losses during the period as a result of improvements in 
profitability in group forecasts and business plans. Forecasted taxable profits for future years support a marginal increase in the level  
of deferred tax assets recognised on tax losses compared to the prior year. The increased recognition in 2016 reflected improvements 
in the taxable profit profile of the relevant Group companies, underpinned by the continuing progress of the Group’s transformation 
strategy to generate future, sustainable profitable growth. 
(vii) Adjustment in respect of prior years – current and deferred tax – £2m (2016: £15m) 
This relates to a re-assessment of the tax deductibility of expense items and provisions for unresolved tax issues as a result of case  
law developments and settlements with tax authorities.

Issues relating to taxation 
The calculation of the Group’s total tax charge involves consideration of certain items whose tax treatment cannot be ultimately 
determined until final resolution has been reached through negotiation with the relevant tax authorities, or via a domestic or 
international dispute resolution process.  
The global nature of the Group’s operations means that the most significant tax risk is in relation to challenges from tax authorities  
in relation to the pricing of cross-border transactions and the Group’s interpretation of the OECD’s arm’s-length principle. This risk is 
largely driven by the inherently subjective nature of transfer pricing and the divergent views taken by tax authorities. In determining the 
appropriate level of provisions in respect of such challenges, the Group applies a risk-based approach which considers factors such as 
the quantum of the charge, the countries party to the transaction and the relevant statutes of limitation.  
An assessment is also made of the likelihood that compensating adjustments will be obtained under the relevant tax treaties to mitigate 
the level of double taxation which could arise. As the Group operates in a significant number of countries, determining the appropriate 
level of judgment is typically influenced by the Group’s evolving experience of tax controversy in different countries. The Group has 
open tax periods in a number of countries involving a number of issues, with the most material disputes typically being in respect of 
cross-border transactions. As at 31 December 2017, the Group had total tax exposures of approximately £146m (2016: £102m) of 
which £42m (2016: £37m) is provided against. The Group believes that it has made appropriate provision for open tax periods which 
have not yet been agreed by tax authorities. The final agreed liabilities may vary from the amounts provided, as these are dependent 
upon the outcomes of the domestic and international dispute resolution processes in the relevant countries. The Group typically has 
limited control over the timing of resolution of uncertain tax positions with tax authorities. Acknowledging this inherent unpredictability, 
and on the basis of currently available information, the Group does not expect material changes to occur to the level of provisions 
against uncertain tax positions during the next twelve months. 
Following the referendum held on 23 June 2016, the UK voted to leave the European Union. The potential tax impacts which could 
arise as a consequence of the UK withdrawing from the European Union are currently uncertain, but on the basis of current information 
the Group does not anticipate that significant additional tax liabilities will arise.

Goodwill allocation 
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to the cash-generating units (CGUs) which are expected to benefit from that 
business combination. A significant portion of the Group’s goodwill was generated by the merger of the security services businesses of 
Group 4 Falck and Securicor in 2004, which was accounted for as an acquisition of Securicor by Group 4 Falck.  
Goodwill impairment testing 
The Group tests tangible and intangible assets, including goodwill, for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if there are 
indications that any of these assets may be impaired. The Group’s annual impairment test compares the carrying value of goodwill and 
other relevant non-current assets held by each CGU with the recoverable amount of each CGU as at 31 December each year. CGUs 
for goodwill impairment testing purposes are identified on a country-level basis including significant business units, consistent with the 
Group’s detailed management accounts. Under IAS 36 – Impairment of Assets, an impairment is deemed to have occurred where the 
recoverable amount of a CGU is less than the carrying value of goodwill and other relevant non-current assets.  
The recoverable amount of a CGU is generally determined by its value in use which is derived from discounted cash flow calculations. 
The key inputs to the calculations are described below. In certain circumstances, where market prices can be ascertained (for example 
through recent transactions or by reference to normal industry standard multiples), the fair value less costs to sell is used as a basis for 
the recoverable amount. In the current year the value of goodwill in the Group’s Greece CGU was supported by this valuation method. 
Forecast cash flows 
All operating countries in the Group are required to submit a budget for the next financial year (for the year ending 31 December 
2018) and strategic plan forecasts for the two years following the budget year (i.e. for the years ending 31 December 2019 and 
31 December 2020). 
Estimated future cash flows are based on these plan forecasts for the first three years, with year 4, year 5 and the terminal  
value projected by applying growth rates as set out in the growth rate section below. Estimated cash flows are discounted  
using country-specific risk-adjusted discount rates as described in the discount rate section. 
Growth rates 
The following table demonstrates the application of growth rates to forecast cash flows:

In this example, budgeted year 1 growth rate is 8%, forecast growth in year 2 is 7% and in year 3 is 6%. The long-term country inflation 
rate is 2% so the year 4 growth rate is calculated to be the midpoint between 6% in year 3 and 2% in year 5, i.e. 4%. The terminal value 
calculation is then based on the long-term inflation rate of 2%.

Discount rates 
The following key inputs are used to calculate country-specific discount rates for all CGUs: 
Input How determined  31 Dec 2017 31 Dec 2016 
Risk-free rate (Group) The Group’s risk-free rate is based on the UK government's 20 year gilt / 
bond rates.   
1.75% in UK 1.89% in UK 
Adjusted risk-free rate 
(country specific) 
Country-specific risk free rates are derived for each CGU by adjusting the 
Group’s risk-free rate for both the relevant inflation rate differential 
between the UK and that CGU’s country and by applying an appropriate 
country-specific risk premium sourced primarily from the IMF and New 
York University websites as well as other studies by independent 
economists.  
2.3% in UK 2.4% in UK 
Unleveraged beta Beta is a risk adjustment applied to the discount rate to reflect the risk of 
the Group’s operating companies relative to the market as a whole. The 
Group’s beta is estimated by performing an analysis of comparable multi-
national listed companies and is adjusted for the appropriate leverage of 
the Group.  
0.75 for the 
Group 
0.7 for the 
Group 
Debt margin The Group applies a Group-wide debt margin to the country-specific risk-
free rates to obtain a cost of debt for each CGU. The debt margin is 
determined by calculating the premium between the yield on a BBB-rated 
15+ year UK benchmark bond and the UK risk-free rate.  
1.3% in UK  1.5% in UK 
Weighted-average cost

The weighted-average cost of capital is calculated by weighting the cost of 
equity and the cost of debt by the applicable debt to equity ratio at the 
year end.

Impairment charge in 2016 
During the prior year the Group recognised an impairment charge of £9m relating to businesses held for sale or closure as a result  
of their estimated recoverable amounts being less than the carrying value of their net assets. 
Sensitivity to key assumptions 
The key assumptions used in the discounted cash flow calculations relate to the discount rates and long-term growth rates used. The 
table below shows the additional impairment that would arise from an increase in discount rates by 1% and 3% (with all other variables 
being equal, for example, increasing the UK base rate from 9.1% to 10.1% and 12.1%) or a decrease in long-term growth rates by 1% 
and 3% (to a minimum of 0% with all other variables being equal, for example, decreasing the UK long-term growth rate from 2.0%  
to 1.0% and 0.0%) for the Group in total and for each of its countries that represent significant goodwill balances:

1. Lower of the long-term country growth rate per the IMF and the implied year 3 business forecast growth rate. 
2. For the Brazil CGU, for certain CGUs in the United Kingdom (primarily the UK Cash Solutions CGU) and for the Risk Management CGU (included within 
‘other’ with a goodwill balance of £35m), the impairment model indicated a potential impairment when applying sensitivities as presented in the table above. 
For these CGUs management is satisfied that the carrying value of goodwill is currently supported by fair value less costs to sell and therefore no impairment  
is required as at 31 December 2017.

assets was £109m (2016: £126m) and the depreciation charge for the year was £16m (2016: £21m). 
The rights over assets held on finance leases are effectively security for lease liabilities. These rights revert to the lessor in the event  
of default.

The net book value of equipment and vehicles includes £25m (2016: £23m) of assets leased by the Group to third parties under 
operating leases. Accumulated depreciation on these assets was £28m (2016: £40m) and the depreciation charge for the year was  
£9m (2016: £7m). 
The net book value of land and buildings comprises freeholds of £68m (2016: £71m), long leaseholds of £17m (2016: £20m) and

Credit risk on trade receivables 
There is limited concentration of credit risk with respect to trade receivables, as the Group’s customers are both large in number  
and dispersed geographically in around 90 countries. The Group performs various services to a number of UK Government agencies 
which, in total, comprised approximately 6% of the total trade debtor balance as at 31 December 2017 (2016: 8%). The Group 
considers these individual Government agencies to be separate customers due to the limited economic integration between each 
agency. Management are satisfied that across the G4S Group’s total trade debtors as at 31 December 2017 there is no significant 
concentration risk. Group companies are required to follow the Group Finance Manual guidelines with respect to assessing the credit-
worthiness of potential customers. These guidelines include processes such as obtaining approval for credit limits over a set amount, 
performing credit checks and assessments and obtaining additional security where required. 
Credit terms vary across the Group and can range from 0 to 90 days to reflect the different risks within each country in which the 
Group operates. There is no group-wide rate of provision, and provision is made for debts according to local conditions and past 
default experience. 
The movement in the provision for impairment of trade receivables is as follows: 
 
2017

181-365 days overdue 13 11
Over 365 days 8 5
Net trade debtors and accrued income 1,177 1,146
No additional provision has been made on the above amounts as there has not been a significant change in credit quality and the 
Group believes that the amounts are still recoverable. The Group does not hold any collateral over these balances. The proportion  
of trade debtors at 31 December 2017 that were overdue for payment was 22% (2016: 20%). The Group’s DSO measure (days’  
sales outstanding) for continuing operations based on revenue from the last 90 days of the year is 52 days (2016: 46 days).  
The directors believe that the fair value of trade and other receivables, being the present value of future cash flows, approximates  
to their book value.

of retentions held by customers for contract work amounted to £3m (2016: £5m). All trade and other receivables arising from 
construction contracts are due for settlement within one year.

As at 31 December 2017, disposal groups classified as held for sale include the assets and liabilities associated with minor operations  
in the Group’s Africa, Asia Pacific, Latin America and Europe regions. 
As at 31 December 2016, disposal groups classified as held for sale include the assets and liabilities associated with a number of group-
wide operations. The more material of these operations include G4S Israel, the US Youth Services business and the children’s homes 
business in the UK.

The Group’s Cash Solutions businesses provide a range of cash handling and processing services on behalf of customers. Certain  
of those services comprise collection, segregated storage and delivery of customer cash, with title to the cash handled remaining  
with the customer throughout the process. Such cash is never recorded in the Group’s balance sheet. 
A number of other cash-processing services are provided to customers, such as the sale and purchase of physical cash balances, and  
the replenishment of ATMs and similar machines from customer funds held in Group bank accounts. Such funds, which are generally 
settled within two working days, are classified as “funds within cash-processing operations”, along with the related balances due to  
and from customers in respect of unsettled transactions, and are included gross within the relevant balance sheet classifications.

26. Cash, cash equivalents and bank overdrafts continued 
Whilst such cash and bank balances are not formally restricted by legal title, they are restricted by the Group’s own internal policies such 
that they cannot be used for the purposes of the Group’s own operations. For the purposes of the Group’s Consolidated statement of 
cash flow, funds within cash-processing operations are therefore recorded net of the related balances due to and from customers in 
respect of unsettled transactions, within cash, cash equivalents and bank overdrafts, and hence have no impact on the Group’s statutory 
cash flow. 
A reconciliation of cash, cash equivalents and bank overdrafts at the end of the year per the Consolidated statement of financial position 
to the corresponding balances included within the Consolidated statement of cash flow is as follows:

Cash, cash equivalents and bank overdrafts at the end of the year in the Consolidated statement of 
cash flow 571 672
Cash and cash equivalents comprise principally short-term money market deposits, current account balances and Group-owned cash 
held in ATM machines. At 31 December 2017 cash and cash equivalents earned interest at a weighted-average rate of 0.6% (2016: 
0.6%). The credit risk on cash and cash equivalents is limited because wherever possible, and in accordance with Group Treasury policy, 
the cash is placed with bank counterparties that hold investment grade credit ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies. 
The Consolidated statement of financial position at 31 December 2016 has been re-presented to show the re-classification of certain 
items within cash and cash equivalents of £20m as trading investments. As a consequence of this change in presentation, cash and cash 
equivalents at 31 December 2016 have decreased from £851m to £831m. 
Cash and cash equivalents of £71m (2016: £75m) are held by the Group’s wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiaries. Their use  
is restricted to the settlement of claims against the Group’s captive insurance subsidiaries.

At 31 December 2017, the Group’s committed bank borrowings comprised a £1bn multi-currency revolving credit facility with  
£964m maturing in January 2022 and the remainder in January 2021. At 31 December 2017, this committed facility was undrawn. 
Interest on all committed bank borrowing facilities is at prevailing LIBOR or EURIBOR rates (with a floor of zero), dependent upon  
the period of drawdown, plus an agreed margin, and is re-priced within one year or less.  
Borrowing at floating rates exposes the Group to cash-flow interest-rate risk. The management of this risk is discussed in note 31.

27. Bank overdrafts, bank loans and loan notes continued 
The Group’s average cost of gross borrowings in 2017, net of interest hedging, was 4.1% (2016: 4.1%). 
In June 2017 the Group issued a €500m Public Bond which matures in June 2024 and pays an annual coupon of 1.5%. 
The committed bank facilities and the private loan notes are subject to one financial covenant (based on a net debt to Adjusted 
EBITDA ratio where Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as Group Adjusted PBITA plus depreciation and amortisation of non-acquisition-
related intangible assets) and non-compliance with the covenant may lead to an acceleration of maturity. The Group complied with  
the financial covenant throughout the year to 31 December 2017 and the year to 31 December 2016. The Group has not defaulted 
on, or breached the terms of, any material loans during the year. 
Bank overdrafts, bank loans, the loan notes issued in July 2008 and May 2009, €380m of the loan notes issued in December 2012, the 
loan notes issued in November 2016 and €400m of the loan notes issued in June 2017 are stated at amortised cost. The loan notes 
issued in March 2007, €120m of the loan notes issued in December 2012 and €100m of the loan notes issued in June 2017 are stated 
at amortised cost but are designated in a fair-value hedge relationship which has a fair-value adjustment in relation to the hedged 
interest-rate risk. 
Cross-currency swaps with a nominal value of US$50m (£37m) relating to the loan notes issued in July 2008 have a fair-value mark-to-
market gain of £12m (2016: gain £16m), predominantly resulting from fixing the Sterling value of this portion of the loan notes at an 
exchange rate of 1.975 and partly from fixing the Sterling and US dollar interest rates. 
Cross-currency swaps with a nominal value of €350m (£311m) relating to the loan notes issued in December 2012 have a fair-value 
mark-to-market gain of £30m (2016: gain £20m), predominantly resulting from fixing the Sterling value of this portion of the loan notes 
at an exchange rate of 1.233 and partly from fixing the Sterling and Euro interest rates. 
Cross-currency swaps with a nominal value of €270m (£240m) relating to the loan notes issued in November 2016 have a fair-value 
mark-to-market loss of £9m (2016: loss £17m), predominantly resulting from fixing the Sterling value of this portion of the loan notes  
at an exchange rate of 1.109 and partly from fixing the Sterling and Euro interest rates. 
Cross-currency swaps with a nominal value of €400m (£356m) relating to the loan notes issued in June 2017 have a fair-value mark-to-
market gain of £12m, predominantly resulting from fixing the Sterling value of this portion of the loan notes at an exchange rate of 
1.157 and partly from fixing the Sterling and Euro interest rates.

The Group leases certain of its fixtures and equipment under finance leases. The weighted-average lease term is six years (2016: six 
years). For the year ended 31 December 2017, the weighted-average effective borrowing rate was 5.7% (2016: 5.7%). Interest rates  
are fixed at the related contract dates. All leases are on a fixed repayment basis and no arrangements have been entered into for 
contingent rental payments.  
The Group’s obligations under finance leases are secured by the lessors’ charges over the leased assets.

Derivative financial instruments are stated at fair value, measured using techniques consistent with Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy 
(inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are observable for the asset and liability, either directly or indirectly). Market 
prices are sourced from Bloomberg or third-party relationship counterparty banks. The relevant currency-yield curve is used to  
forecast the floating-rate cash flows anticipated under the instrument, which are discounted back to the balance sheet date. This  
value is compared to the original transaction value giving a fair value of the instrument at the balance sheet date. 
Certain financial instruments are not designated or do not qualify for hedge accounting. Changes in fair value of any derivative 
instruments in this category are immediately recognised in the Consolidated income statement. In 2017 these included certain  
interest-rate swaps and in 2016 included certain forward-currency contracts used for interest and cash management. 
The mark-to-market valuation of the derivatives has improved by £15m during the year, mainly due to an increase in the value  
of the cross-currency swaps as a result of Sterling’s weakness. 
Offsetting and enforceable master netting agreements 
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the Consolidated statement of financial position when there is a 
legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or realise the asset and settle 
the liability simultaneously. There were no material amounts offset in the Consolidated statement of financial position and no material 
balances associated with enforceable master netting agreements were identified.

31. Financial risk 
Capital management 
£964m of the original £1 billion multi-currency revolving credit facility matures in January 2022, with the remainder maturing in  
January 2021. At 31 December 2017 there were no drawings from the facility. 
In May 2017, Standard & Poor’s affirmed the Group’s long-term credit rating of BBB- (negative). The Group will continue to manage  
its capital structure so that it retains an investment-grade rating. 
The Group’s policy objective is a net debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio of less than 2.5x. At the end of 2017 the ratio was 2.4x  
(2016: 2.8x).  
The next debt maturities are £44m and US$224m of US Private Placement debt maturing in July 2018 and a €500m Public Bond 
maturing in December 2018. Overall the debt portfolio has a medium to long-term debt maturity profile. The Group is currently well 
placed to access finance from the debt-capital markets and from the bank market if required. Borrowings are principally in Sterling, US 
dollars and Euros reflecting the geographies of the Group’s significant operational assets and profits. 
Liquidity risk 
The Group mitigates liquidity risk by ensuring there are sufficient undrawn committed facilities available to it. For more details of the 
Group’s bank overdrafts, bank loans and loan notes see note 27. 
The percentage of the available committed Revolving Credit Facility that was undrawn during the course of the year was as follows: 
31 December 2016 100% 
31 March 2017 86% 
30 June 2017 93% 
30 September 2017 89% 
31 December 2017 100% 
To reduce re-financing risk, Group Treasury obtains finance with a range of maturities to minimise the impact of a single material source 
of finance terminating on a single date. 
Re-financing risk is further reduced by Group Treasury opening negotiations to either replace or extend any major medium-term facility 
at least 12 months before its termination date.

Market risk 
Currency risk and forward-currency contracts  
The Group conducts business in many currencies. Transaction risk is limited since, wherever possible, each business operates and 
conducts its financing activities in local currency. However, the Group presents its consolidated financial statements in Sterling and  
it is in consequence subject to foreign-exchange risk due to the translation of the results and net assets of its foreign subsidiaries.  
Treasury policy is to manage significant translation risks in respect of net operating assets and its consolidated net debt/Adjusted 
EBITDA ratio by holding foreign currency denominated loans, cross-currency swaps and to a lesser extent forward-currency contracts. 
The Group has hedged a substantial proportion of its exposure to fluctuations in the translation into Sterling of its overseas net assets 
through these instruments. 
Translation adjustments arising on the translation of foreign currency loans and on changes in the fair value of cross-currency swaps 
meeting hedge accounting criteria are recognised in equity to match translation adjustments on foreign currency equity investments  
as they qualify as net investment hedges with no residual impact to equity. 
At 31 December 2017, the Group’s US dollar and Euro net assets were approximately 91% and 90% respectively hedged by  
foreign currency loans and the cross-currency swaps designated as net-investment hedges (2016: US dollar 80%, Euro 93%).  
Cross-currency swaps with a nominal value of $449m (£332m) were arranged and designated as net-investment hedges. 
Cross-currency swaps with a nominal value of £25m are in place hedging the foreign currency risk on US$50m of the second US  
Private Placement notes issued in July 2008, effectively fixing the Sterling value of this portion of debt at an exchange rate of 1.9750. 
Cross-currency swaps with a nominal value of £284m are in place hedging the foreign currency risk on €350m of the Euro public  
notes issued in December 2012, effectively fixing the Sterling value of this portion of debt at an exchange rate of 1.2332. 
Cross-currency swaps with a nominal value of £244m are in place hedging the foreign currency risk on €270m of the Euro public  
notes issued in November 2016, effectively fixing the Sterling value of this portion of debt at an exchange rate of 1.1088. 
Cross-currency swaps with a nominal value of £346m were arranged to hedge the foreign currency risk on €400m of the Euro public 
notes issued in June 2017, effectively fixing the Sterling value of this portion of debt at an exchange rate of 1.1570. 
Applying the relative movements in US dollar and Euro foreign exchange rates against Sterling in 2017 compared with 2016 to carrying 
values at 31 December 2017, the fair value net gain on the cross-currency swaps which hedge part of the currency loan notes would 
have increased by £33m with a direct impact on the Consolidated income statement. This would be offset by an equal and opposite 
revaluation to the underlying bonds. Any of the underlying bonds not in a cash-flow hedge are in a net investment hedge relationship  
so that ultimately the impact on the Consolidated income statement is nil. 
Interest-rate risk and interest-rate swaps  
Much of the Group’s debt is issued at fixed rate, but to the extent there is borrowing at floating rates as described in note 27, the 
Group is exposed to cash-flow interest-rate risk, which the Group manages within policy limits approved by the directors. Interest-rate 
swaps and, to a limited extent, forward-rate agreements are utilised to fix the interest rate on a proportion of borrowings on a reducing 
scale over forward periods up to a maximum of five years. At 31 December 2017 there were no such contracts in place (2016: £60m).  
The US Private Placement market is predominantly a fixed-rate market, with investors preferring a fixed-rate return over the life of the 
loan notes. At the time of the first issue in March 2007, the Group was comfortable with the proportion of floating rate exposure not 
hedged by interest-rate swaps and therefore rather than take on a higher proportion of fixed-rate debt arranged fixed to floating swaps 
effectively converting the fixed coupon on the Private Placement to a floating rate. Following the swaps the resulting average coupon on 
the US Private Placement is LIBOR + 60bps. These swaps have been documented as fair-value hedges of the US Private Placement 
fixed interest loan notes, with the movements in their fair value recognised in the Consolidated income statement at the same time as 
the movement in the fair value of the hedged item. 
The interest on the US Private Placement notes issued in July 2008, the Sterling public notes issued in May 2009, €510m of the Euro 
public notes issued in May 2012, €380m of the Euro public notes issued in December 2012, the Euro public notes issued in November 
2016 and €400m of the public notes issued in June 2017 was initially kept at fixed rate. In April 2014, the interest rate on £44m of the 
US Private Placement notes issued in July 2008 and on all the Sterling public notes issued in May 2009 was swapped from fixed to 
floating for a period of three years using derivatives and therefore matured in 2017. 
All four public notes have a coupon step-up of 1.25% which is triggered should the credit rating of G4S plc fall below investment grade. 
The core Group borrowings are held in US dollars, Euros and Sterling. Although the impact of rising interest rates is largely shielded by 
fixed-rate loans and interest-rate swaps which provide certainty on the vast majority of the exposure, some interest-rate risk remains.  
A 1% increase in interest rates across the yield curve in each of these currencies, with the 31 December 2017 debt position constant 
throughout 2018, would result in an expectation of an additional interest charge of £6m in the 2018 financial year. 
Commodity risk and commodity swaps 
The Group’s principal commodity risk relates to the fluctuating level of diesel prices, particularly affecting its Cash Solutions businesses. 
Commodity swaps and commodity options are on occasions used to fix synthetically part of the exposure and reduce the associated 
cost volatility. The hedging programme is under evaluation, and as a consequence there was no commodity hedging in place at  
31 December 2017.

31. Financial risk continued 
Counterparty credit risk 
The Group’s strategy for credit-risk management is to set minimu m credit ratings for counterparties and to monitor these on a r egular basis.  
For treasury-related transactions, the Group’s policy limits the aggregate credit risk assigned to a counterparty. The utilisation of a credit 
limit is calculated by applying a weighting to the notional value of each transaction outstanding with each counterparty based on the 
type and duration of the transaction. The total mark-to-market value outstanding with each counterparty is also closely monitored 
against policy limits assigned to each counterparty. For short-term transactions (under one year), at inception of the transaction, the 
financial counterparty must be investment-grade rated by either the Standard & Poor’s or Moody’s rating agencies. For long-term 
transactions, at inception of the transaction, unless otherwise approved, the financial counterparty must have a minimum rating of 
BBB+/Baa1 from Standard & Poor’s or Moody’s.  
Treasury transactions are dealt with through the Group’s relationship banks, all of which have a strong investment grade rating. At  
31 December 2017 the largest two counterparty exposures related to treasury transactions were £48m and £29m and both were held 
with institutions with a long-term Standard & Poor’s credit rating of A. These exposures represent 29% and 18% of the carrying values 
of the treasury transactions, with a fair value gain at the balance sheet date. Both of these banks had significant loan commitments 
outstanding to G4S plc at 31 December 2017. 
The Group operates a multi-currency notional pooling cash management system with a wholly-owned subsidiary of an A-rated  
bank. At year end, credit balances of £271m were pooled with debit balances of £260m, resulting in a net pool credit balance  
of £11m. There exists a legal right of set-off under the pooling agreement and an overdraft facility of £3m. In accordance with  
IFRS Interpretations Committee (IC) requirements, the cash and overdraft pool balances are presented gross in the Consolidated 
statement of financial position. 
At an operating level the minimum investment-grade rating criteria applies. Exceptionally, where required by local country 
circumstances, counterparties with no rating or a non-investment grade rating can be approved as counterparties for a period of up to 
12 months. Due to the Group’s global geographical footprint and exposure to multiple industries, there is minimal concentration risk.  
32. Retirement benefit obligations 
The Group operates a wide range of retirement benefit arrangements which are established in accordance with local conditions and 
practices within the countries concerned. These include funded defined contribution, multi-employer and funded and unfunded defined 
benefit schemes.  
Defined contribution arrangements 
The majority of the retirement benefit arrangements operated by the Group are of a defined contribution structure, where the em ployer 
contribution and resulting income statement charge is fixed at a set level or is a set percentage of employees’ pay. Contributi ons made to 
defined contribution schemes in 2017 and charged to the Cons olidated income statement totalled £67m (2016: £77m). 
In the UK, following the closure of the defined benefit schemes to new entrants in 2004, the main scheme for new employees is  
a contracted-in defined contribution scheme.  
Multi-employer arrangement 
In the Netherlands, most employees are members of the Security Industry Wide Pension Fund (IWPF). This is a career-average defined 
benefit plan. Pensionable salary is subject to a cap, and minus an offset that reflects social security levels. Withdrawal from the scheme  
is only possible under certain strict conditions determined by Dutch law and by the pension fund board of the IWPF.  
The plan is funded by a premium that is set by the IWPF board in line with the financing rules that state that the premium should cover 
the cost of the annual accrual of pension benefits. As of 1 January 2018 the premium is 35.3% and historically has been around 30% of 
pensionable salaries. The employer pays 60% of this premium and the employees the remaining 40%.  
The financing rules specify that an employer is not obliged to pay any further premiums in respect of previously accrued benefits. This 
means that in case of insufficient funding, the benefits of participants could, in theory, be reduced. The current solvency ratio is 104.2% 
(December 2017). The required solvency ratio according to Dutch law is 124.2% (as at 31 December 2017). Should a surplus appear 
within the scheme the board will decide if a reduction in premium is possible although this would only be possible at much higher 
solvency levels.  
Premiums paid to the scheme by the Group and charged to the Consolidated income statement in 2017 totalled £11m (2016: £10m). 
The estimated premium expected to be paid to the scheme during the financial year commencing 1 January 2018 in respect of the  
on-going accrual of benefits is approximately £12m.  
The scheme is not accounted for as a defined benefit scheme under IAS 19 – Employee Benefits as it is not possible to identify the 
Group’s share of the scheme’s assets and liabilities. As a result, and in line with general practice for such schemes, the scheme is 
accounted for as if it were a defined contribution scheme under IAS 19.  
The Netherlands Cash Solutions Pension Plan (“the Cash Solutions scheme”) is a separate scheme operated by the Group but is 
required to provide benefits at least equivalent to the IWPF, and in particular pension increases in payment and deferment, as well  
as revaluation of active members’ rights in the Cash Solutions scheme, have to follow the multi-employer scheme (which applies a 
conditional approach).

Defined benefit arrangements  
The Group operates several funded defined retirement benefit schemes where the benefits are based on employees’ length of service. 
Whilst the Group’s primary scheme is in the UK, it also operates the Cash Solutions scheme in the Netherlands and other less material 
plans elsewhere. Under funded arrangements, the assets of defined benefit schemes are held in separate trustee-administered funds or 
similar structures in the countries concerned. 
Consolidated income statement 
The amounts recognised in the Consolidated income statement in relation to the material funded schemes are included within the 
following categories: 
 
2017 
£m 
2016
£m
Cost of sales 4 4
Administration expenses 2 2
Net finance costs 8 7
Total for material funded defined benefit schemes 14 13
There are also various less material unfunded arrangements, for which the Group does not hold related assets separate from the 
Group. In aggregate, other unfunded arrangements incurred £10m (2016: £8m) of costs within cost of sales and finance costs of  
£3m (2016: £3m). 
Consolidated statement of comprehensive income 
Re-measurements of the net defined benefit obligation are recognised in full in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income  
in the year in which they arise. These comprise the impact on the net defined benefit liability of changes in demographic and financial 
assumptions compared with the start of the year, actual experience being different to those assumptions and the return on plan assets 
above the amount included in the net pension interest expense.
 
During the year the Group recognised a total net re-measurement gain 
of £26m (2016: loss of £169m) within other comprehensive income (OCI) comprising a re-measurement gain of £29m (2016: loss of 
£164m) relating to material funded defined benefit schemes offset by a re-measurement loss of £3m (2016: loss of £5m) relating to 
unfunded or other funded defined benefit schemes. 
Consolidated statement of financial position 
The Group’s net defined benefit deficit recognised in the Consolidated statement of financial position at 31 December 2017 was 
£381m (2016: £437m), or £318m (2016: £368m) net of applicable tax in the relevant jurisdictions.

UK defined benefit scheme 
The defined benefit scheme in the UK accounts for 88% (2016: 94%) of the net balance sheet liability for material funded defined 
retirement benefit schemes. It comprises three sections: the Group 4 section which is the pension scheme demerged from the former 
Group 4 Falck A/S, the Securicor section, for which the Group assumed responsibility on 20 July 2004 with the acquisition of Securicor 
plc, and the GSL section, for which the Group assumed responsibility on 12 May 2008 with the acquisition of GSL.  
The UK scheme is closed to future accrual apart from some sub-sections of the GSL section, and for most members defines the pension 
based on final salary. Certain sub-sections of the GSL section have historically remained open to provide a facility to accept former 
public-sector employees who join the Group through outsourcings. In the Group 4 and Securicor sections, members retain their link  
to final salary where appropriate on their benefits accrued up to closure in 2011.  
As at the latest actuarial funding valuation the participants of the UK pension scheme sections can be analysed as follows:

There is a mix of fixed and inflation-dependent pension increases (in payment and deferment) which vary from member to member 
according to their membership history and the section of the scheme. 
The discounted weighted-average duration of the accrued liabilities of the sections is as follows:  
 2017 2016
Group 4  17 17
GSL  19 20
Securicor  18 18
The scheme is set up under UK law and governed by a Trustee company which is responsible for the scheme’s investments, 
administration and management. The Board of the Trustee company comprises an independent chairman and further  
independent, Group and scheme membership representatives. 
The current schedule of deficit recovery contributions provides for a contribution of approximately £41m during 2018. In addition,  
the Company has pledged a share of any material disposal proceeds to the pension scheme (to be shared in the same proportion as 
the pension scheme deficit bears to overall group indebtedness) and has agreed that additional contributions would be made in the 
event that the average annual dividend payment to ordinary shareholders over the three financial years 2016, 2017 and 2018 exceeds  
a certain threshold or in the event that the Company makes a significant special dividend payment (or equivalent capital return), to its 
ordinary shareholders over the same period.  
A funding valuation is carried out for the scheme’s Trustee every three years by an independent firm of actuaries. Depending on  
the outcome of that valuation a schedule of future contributions is negotiated; the Group has guaranteed any contributions due  
from its subsidiaries. 
Under the terms of the existing agreement with the pension trustees, deficit payments are due to increase by 3% per annum until  
the next funding valuation in 2018 when they will be subject to review and potential renegotiation. 
The Group has concluded that it should allow for a refund of any residual surplus in all three sections of the UK Scheme assuming  
wind-up after all benefits have been paid in the normal course of events. Therefore no adjustments for asset ceiling or additional 
liabilities under the IFRIC 14 interpretation are made. At present the GSL section has a surplus and the other two sections have  
deficits. The IASB is proposing to amend IFRIC 14 and the Group will assess if there are any implications once the final form of  
the revised interpretation is clarified.

Principal risks 
The Group’s pension schemes create a number of risk exposures. Annual increases in benefits are, to a varying extent from scheme  
to scheme, dependent on inflation so the main uncertainties affecting the level of benefits payable are future inflation levels (including 
the impact of inflation on future salary increases) and the actual longevity of the membership. Benefits payable will also be influenced  
by a range of other factors including member decisions on matters such as when to retire and the possibility to draw benefits in 
different forms. 
A key risk is that additional contributions are required if the investment returns fall short of those anticipated when setting the 
contributions to the pension plans. For the UK funding valuation those assumed investment returns (for funding valuations) are set 
based on fixed margins over the LIBOR swap curve. The management of the UK pension fund assets has been delegated to an asset 
manager, who manages the assets against a liability benchmark. The key parameters of this mandate can be summarised as follows: 
Risk Description Mitigation 
Asset mix The plan assets may fall in value. The assets are managed dynamically over time rather than a set 
strategic allocation. 
Interest rate risk The plan assets may fall in value as a result  
of a fall in interest rates. 
Managed with the benchmark of hedging 100% of these risks as a 
percentage of the asset value through the use of debt instruments 
(government bonds) and derivatives. 
Inflation risk The plan assets may fall in value as a result of 
rise in inflation.  
Managed with the benchmark of hedging 100% of these risks as a 
percentage of the asset value through the use of debt instruments 
(government bonds) and derivatives. 
Currency risk Any plan assets held in foreign currencies  
are exposed to changes in foreign currency 
exchange rates.  
Managed with the objective of hedging at least 70% of the 
overseas currency exposure in the portfolio through the  
use of forward foreign currency contracts. 
Regulatory risk All pension schemes are regulated by the 
relevant jurisdictions. These include extensive 
legislation and regulatory mechanisms that 
are subject to change and may impact the 
Group’s pension schemes. 
G4S monitors changes in regulations in the UK and the 
Netherlands to assess the potential impact these changes  
could have on the Group’s material pension schemes.  
Actuarial 
assumptions risk 
Actuarial assumptions made on a range  
of demographic and financial matters that  
are used to project the expected benefit 
payments including future inflation, salary 
growth and life expectancy. The DBO  
and service cost are also very sensitive  
to the IAS 19 discount rate, which 
determines the discounted value of the 
projected benefit payments. The discount 
rate depends on market yields on high-
quality corporate bonds. 
The UK pension trustees have adopted investment strategies to 
mitigate changes in key assumptions applied to the valuation of 
pension liabilities for funding purposes. These strategies mainly 
hedge against interest rate and inflation expectations generally,  
as described above, but do not specifically seek to hedge against 
changes in credit spreads that also affect the IAS 19 discount  
rate. As a result the difference between the market value of  
the assets and the valuation of the pension obligations under  
IAS 19 may be volatile.  
Financial assumptions and sensitivity analysis  
The weighted averages for each of the principal assumptions used for the purposes of the actuarial valuations were as follows: 
UK Netherlands
Key assumptions used at 31 December 2017  
Discount rate 2.55% 2.0%
Expected rate of salary increases 3.3% N/A
Pension increases in payment (for the UK, at RPI
*
 with a limit of 5% p.a.) 3.1% 1.2%
Inflation 3.2% 1.8%
Key assumptions used at 31 December 2016  
Discount rate 2.5% 2.0%
Expected rate of salary increases 3.4% N/A
Pension increases in payment (for the UK, at RPI
*
 with a limit of 5% p.a.) 3.1% 0.8%
Inflation 3.3% 1.9%
* RPI with a limit of 5% p.a. is the most common level of increase in the UK arrangements. Assumptions for other increases are derived from the above inflation 
assumption for RPI, and an annual CPI assumption of 2.2% (2016: 2.3%) as appropriate. 
IAS 19 specifies that pension liabilities should be discounted at appropriate high quality corporate bond rates. The Group considers that 
it is appropriate to consider AA-rated corporate bonds as high quality and has therefore used discount rates based on yields on such 
bonds corresponding to the liability profile of the respective schemes. In 2017 the Group has refined its approach to exclude certain 
university and government-backed bonds that the Group does not consider to be corporate bonds for the purposes of IAS 19. 
The effect of a movement in the discount rate applicable in the UK alters reported liabilities (before associated deferred tax 
adjustments) by approximately the amounts shown in the table overleaf.

approximately the amounts shown in the table below:

The above sensitivities allow for inflation-dependent assumptions such as salary growth and relevant pension increases to vary 
corresponding to the inflation assumption variation. Due to the caps and floors on pension increases a certain movement in the inflation 
assumption will not generally result in the same movement in the pension increase assumption. 
Demographic assumptions and sensitivity analysis  
In addition to the above, the Group uses appropriate mortality assumptions when calculating the schemes’ obligations. The mortality 
tables used for the scheme in the UK are: Birth year table S2P[M/F]A Base with future improvements in line with CMI_2015 Core 
projections, based on a long-term improvement rate of 1.25% p.a. and allowing for individual scaling factors based on the mortality 
analysis carried out as part of the last funding valuation. 
The resulting assumed life expectancy of a male member of the UK schemes currently aged 65 is 21 years. The assumed life expectancy 
at 65 of a male currently aged 52 is 22 years. At those ages, the assumed life expectancy for a female member is between two and 
three years longer than for a male member.  
The effect of a one-year change in this UK life expectancy assumption is to alter reported liabilities (before associated deferred tax 
adjustments) by approximately £123m (2016: £137m).  
The selection of these movements to illustrate the sensitivity of the DBO to key assumptions should not be interpreted as the Group 
expressing any specific view of the probability of such movements happening.

Total UK assets  2,345 2,339
Multi-strategy assets are held in a pooled fund structure, which is a multi-asset fund investing across all asset classes. 
Within the UK pension fund, the Equity, Credit, Macro-orientated and Multi-strategy sub-categories consist of pooled vehicles investing 
predominantly in assets with quoted prices in active markets. All government bonds are issued by the UK government and have quoted 
prices in active markets. Other UK investments are predominantly unquoted.  
Derivatives include a range of interest-rate and inflation-linked swaps, forward-currency contracts, equity-index total return swaps, equity 
options, and futures. Investing in interest-rate and inflation-linked swaps is designed to mitigate the impact of future changes in interest 
rates and inflation. 
None of the pension scheme assets are held in the Group’s own financial instruments or in any assets held or used by the Group. 
The fair value of directly-held securities (equities and bonds) is taken as the closing price on an actively-traded market. Fair value  
of holdings in pooled funds is provided by the investment manager, who calculates the price based on the aggregate value of the 
underlying assets held by the fund (based on closing prices of the securities on an actively-traded market) and the number of  
units issued.

Judgment is required in quantifying the Group’s provisions, particularly in connection with claims and onerous customer contracts,  
which are based on a number of assumptions and estimates where the ultimate outcome may be different to the amount provided. 
Each of these provisions reflects the Group’s best estimate of the probable exposure at 31 December 2017 and this assessment has 
been made having considered the sensitivity of each provision to reasonably possible changes in key assumptions. The Group is satisfied 
that it is unlikely that changes in these key assumptions will have a material impact on the Group’s overall provisioning position in the 
next 12 months. 
Employee benefits  
The provision for employee benefits is in respect of any employee benefits which accrue over the working lives of the employees, 
typically including items such as long service awards and termination indemnity schemes.  
The Group’s net obligation in respect of long-term service benefits other than retirement benefits represents the present value of the 
future benefit that employees have earned at the balance sheet date, less the fair value of scheme assets out of which the obligations 
are to be settled directly.

33. Provisions and contingent liabilities continued 
Restructuring  
Restructuring provisions include amounts for redundancy payments, and the costs of closure of activities in acquired businesses  
and discontinued operations. Settlement of restructuring provisions is highly probable. The timing is uncertain but is generally likely  
to be short-term. During the year the Group incurred restructuring costs of £20m (2016: £12m) within specific items relating to the 
multi-year strategic productivity programme across the Group. In addition, the Group incurred non-strategic reorganisation costs of 
£10m (2016: £9m) which are included within Adjusted PBITA. 
Claims 
Claims provisions represent any outstanding litigation claims against the Group that are considered likely to lead to the outflow of funds 
in the future, including provisions within the captive insurance companies to cover (where appropriate) anticipated claims incurred as at 
the balance sheet date, based on actuarial assessments to calculate the liabilities. 
These claims reserves are held by the Group’s wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiaries in Guernsey and the US which underwrite 
part of the Group’s Cash Solutions, general liability, workers’ compensation and auto liability policies. In the year the Group provided 
£36m (2016: £20m) in relation to claims made under these policies which comprise a significant number of unrelated claims, most of 
which are individually immaterial. Claims provisions are subject to regular actuarial review and are adjusted as appropriate. Settlement  
of these provisions is highly probable but both the value of the final settlements and their timing is uncertain, dependent upon the 
outcome of on-going processes to determine both liability and quantum in respect of a wide range of claims or possible claims.  
During the year the Group also recognised additional provisions of £9m mainly relating to the settlement of labour-related disputes in 
North and Latin America in respect of prior years, and £6m relating to the estimated cost of settlement of subcontractor claims from 
commercial disputes in respect of prior years. Both of these amounts have been presented within specific items in the Consolidated 
income statement.  
Onerous customer contracts  
The Group recognised as specific items additional onerous contract provisions of £19m (2016: £4m) relating primarily to the anticipated 
total losses over the next 15 to 20 years in respect of certain UK contracts. It is expected that around 60% of the Group’s total 
provision for onerous contracts will be utilised by the end of 2020, mainly as the Compass contract comes to an end in August 2019. 
Given the short period remaining to the finalisation of this contract, any potential future changes to key assumptions made when 
estimating its future losses are not expected to have a significant impact. The additional expected losses of £19m are mainly related to 
two other PFI contracts where there has been an expected increase in costs to deliver the required maintenance regime. The expected 
additional future losses are expected to be partially offset by profit improvement plans, although these are reflected only to the extent 
that they have been implemented and are delivering the expected savings. A number of profit improvement plans that have been 
designed but which have not yet been embedded successfully in the contract delivery were not considered when estimating future 
expected losses. This is consistent with the Group’s policy which requires evidence that profit improvement plans will be successfully 
implemented before they are reflected in anticipated future cash flow projections for onerous contract provisioning purposes. There  
is no single change in key variables that could materially affect future expected losses on these contracts. Furthermore, management 
believes that the current level of provision is balanced and that any significant potential downside from possible changes to key 
assumptions could be offset by further progress made in those profit improvement plans that have not been considered following the 
Group’s policy described above. The discount rates applied when calculating onerous contract provisions for these contracts were 
between 1.4% and 1.7%. 
Property and other  
Included within property and other provisions are future liabilities for long-term idle leased properties, for properties sub-let at a 
shortfall, for the cost of replacing or reinstalling assets where there is a present contractual requirement, and for customer claims  
on contracts that are related to the performance on a contract but do not form part of onerous customer contract provisions.  
Whilst the likelihood of settlement of these obligations is considered probable, there is uncertainty over their value and duration.  
Included in property and other provisions are contract-related provisions of £35m (2016: £43m) and onerous property lease provisions 
of £17m (2016: £16m).  
Contingent liabilities 
The Group is involved in disputes in a number of countries, mainly related to activities incidental to its operations. Currently there are  
a number of disputes open in relation to the application of local labour law, commercial agreements with customers and subcontractors 
and claims and compliance matters, in some cases in the course of litigation. In addition, the interpretation of labour laws and regulations 
in a number of countries where the Group operates is complex and there is inherent judgment made when applying those laws and 
regulations that are open to interpretation. As such, there is risk that further disputes and claims from employees could arise in the 
future. Where there is a dispute or where there is a risk of a dispute or claims in the future and where, based on legal counsel advice, 
the Group estimates that it is probable that the dispute will result in an outflow of economic resources, provision is made based on the 
Group’s best estimate of the likely financial outcome. Where a reliable estimate cannot be made, or where the Group, based on legal 
counsel advice, considers that it is not probable that there will be an outflow of economic resources, no provision is recognised.  
In this regard, the Group is party to a number of on-going litigation processes in relation to interpretation of local labour law and 
regulations in a number of countries, and where it is expected that these matters will not be resolved in the near future. At this stage, 
the Group’s view is that these cases will either be resolved in a manner favourable to the interests of the Group or, due to the nature 
and complexity of the cases, it is not possible to estimate the potential economic exposure. In addition, in the ordinary course of 
business, other contingent liabilities exist where the Group is subject to commercial claims and litigation from a range of parties in 
respect of contracts, agreements, regulatory and compliance matters, none of which are expected to have a material impact on 
the Group.

The investigation opened by the Serious Fraud Office in 2013 in respect of the Group’s Electronic Monitoring contract remains on-
going. The Group continues to co-operate fully with the investigation but, based on currently available information, is unable to make a 
reliable estimate of the outcome of that review.

At 31 December 2017, the Group had unutilised tax losses of approximately £780m (2016: £842m) potentially available for  
offset against future profits. A deferred tax asset of £92m (2016: £110m) has been recognised in respect of approximately  
£508m (2016: £529m) of gross losses based on profitability from approved budgets and business plans.  
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of the remaining £272m (2016: £313m) of gross losses due to the 
unpredictability and availability of future profit streams in the relevant jurisdictions, and the fact that a significant proportion of such 
losses remains unaudited by the relevant tax authorities. In certain cases, there are continuing structural issues which prevent the 
utilisation of losses within the foreseeable future. Losses which will never be utilised, for example due to the operation of statute,  
are not included in the above figures. 
Approximately £54m (2016: £80m) of the gross unrecognised losses relate to the UK group. Utilisation of such losses is dependent 
upon the profitability of particular trading and corporate entities. The financial projections used in assessing the future profitability are 
consistent with those used in assessing the carrying value of goodwill as set out in note 18. The utilisation of these losses will occur at 
different rates due to the incidence and timing of profits within these entities, which consequently impacts their recognition as deferred 
tax assets. 
Included in unrecognised tax losses are gross losses of £27m (2016: £40m) which will expire between 2018 and 2026. Other losses 
may be carried forward indefinitely.  
At 31 December 2017, the Group has capital losses available to carry forward of approximately £2.6bn (2016: £0.25bn). The in-year 
increase is mainly related to liquidation of dormant holding companies crystallising tax losses. These losses have no expiry date and  
have not been agreed with the relevant tax authorities. No deferred tax assets have been recognised in respect of these losses on  
the basis that the likelihood of their future utilisation is considered to be remote. 
At 31 December 2017, the aggregate amount of undistributed earnings of non-UK subsidiaries and joint ventures on which temporary 
differences may exist was £1,416m (2016: £1,646m). A deferred tax liability of £2m (2016: £3m) has been recognised on undistributed 
earnings, based on expected distributions from such subsidiaries and joint ventures. 
Other temporary differences vary by country and include items relating to the local tax treatment of fixed assets, employee benefits, 
and provisions.

Other reserves include: 
Hedging reserve  
The hedging reserve comprises the effective portion of the cumulative net change in the fair value of cash-flow hedging instruments 
related to the hedged transactions that have not yet occurred (net of tax). During the year a fair value gain of £21m (2016: £69m)  
was recognised in the hedging reserve relating to the increase in fair value of the cash-flow hedging instruments. Out of this gain, £21m 
(2016: £73m) relating to the re-translation of those hedging instruments was transferred from the hedging reserve to the Consolidated 
income statement. This was offset by an equal and opposite revaluation to the hedged loan note items so that the net impact on the 
Consolidated income statement was nil. 
Translation reserve  
The translation reserve comprises all foreign exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial statements of foreign 
operations, as well as from the translation of liabilities that hedge the Group’s net investment in foreign operations (net of tax). During 
the year £42m (2016: £nil) of cumulative translation adjustments and £24m (2016: £nil) of cumulative net investment hedging amounts 
relating to business disposals were recycled to the Consolidated income statement (see note 17). 
Merger reserve  
The merger reserve comprises reserves arising upon the merger between the former Group 4 Falck A/S and the former Group 4 
Securitas BV in 2000 and the acquisition of Securicor plc by the Group in 2004. In accordance with Section 612 of the Companies Act 
2006 the £308m premium on ordinary shares issued in the Group’s 9.99% share placement in August 2013 was initially recorded in the 
merger reserve, and has subsequently been transferred to retained earnings. 
Reserve for own shares  
An Employee Benefit Trust established by the Group held 4,362,068 shares at 31 December 2017 (2016: 4,844,243 shares) to satisfy 
the vesting of awards under the performance share plan and performance-related schemes (see note 39). During the year 3,489,049 
shares (2016: no shares) were purchased by the trust, and 3,971,224 shares (2016: 1,475,901 shares) were used to satisfy the vesting  
of awards under the schemes. At 31 December 2017, the cost of shares held by the trust was £12,330,829 (2016: £12,896,107), whilst 
the market value of these shares was £11,646,722 (2016: £11,383,971). Shares held by the trust are treated as treasury shares, are 
deducted from equity, do not receive dividends and are excluded from the calculations of earnings per share.  
Distributable reserves 
As at 31 December 2017 the parent company of the Group had distributable reserves of £885m (2016: £918m).

38. Operating lease arrangements 
The Group as lessee 
As at 31 December 2017, the Group had outstanding commitments under non-cancellable operating leases, which fall due as follows:

Within one year 99 113
In the second to fifth years inclusive 246 288
After five years 125 124
Total operating lease commitments 470 525
The Group leases a number of its office properties, vehicles and other operating equipment under operating leases. Property leases are 
negotiated over an average term of around ten years, at rates reflective of market rentals. Periodic rent reviews take place to bring lease 
rentals into line with prevailing market conditions. Some, but not all, lease agreements have an option to renew the lease at the end of 
the lease term. Leased vehicles and other operating equipment are negotiated over an average lease term of four years.  
a. As a consequence of the detailed work carried out to date to assess the impact of IFRS16 – Leases, effective 1 January 2019, it has been determined that the 
operating lease commitments reported at 31 December 2016 were understated. The ageing analysis previously reported was £104m payable within one year, 
£272m payable within two to five years and £110m payable after more than five years.

39. Share-based payments 
Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) 
Shares allocated under the Group’s LTIP are subject to performance conditions and forfeitures, as detailed in the Directors’ 
Remuneration report on page 93.  
Under the Group’s LTIP, Relative Total Shareholder Return (a market performance condition) constitutes 30% (2016: 30%) of  
the performance criteria and is measured over three financial years. The Relative Total Shareholder Return is measured against a 
comparator group of selected relevant companies. 25% of this element of the award vests upon the Group’s Total Shareholder Return 
being ranked median against the comparator group. The fair value of the shares awarded which is subject to this market performance 
condition has therefore been reduced by 75%. 
Deferred Bonus Share Plan (DBSP) and Restricted Share Plan (RSP) 
Shares allocated under the Group’s DBSP and RSP are not subject to further financial performance conditions, but in both cases, are 
subject to forfeitures, either in part or in full, subject to continued employment, unless a participant is deemed a good leaver by the 
Remuneration Committee. Share awards under the RSP were granted in 2016 for the first time. 
Share-based payment plans information 
All three share plans have a three-year vesting period from their dates of grant. 
The following table shows the movements in the number of shares held under the share-based payment plans outstanding but

The weighted-average remaining contractual life of conditional share allocations outstanding at 31 December 2017 was 15 months 
(2016: 17 months). The weighted-average share price at the date of allocation of shares allocated conditionally during the year was 
283.1p (2016: 185.2p) and the contractual life of all conditional allocations was three years. The weighted-average share price at the 
date of exercise for the shares exercised during the year was 279.0p (2016: 196.3p).  
The Consolidated income statement is charged with an estimate for the vesting of shares awarded conditionally and subject to  
non-market performance conditions. The charge for 2017 was £10m (2016: £13m), out of which £9m (2016: £10m) arose from 
equity-settled share-based payments. The total carrying amount for the liabilities arising from share-based payment transactions  
as at 31 December 2017 was £6m (31 December 2016: £6m).

These financial statements were prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard (‘FRS’) 101- Reduced Disclosure Framework. 
(c) Significant accounting policies  
Basis of preparation 
The financial statements have been prepared under the going concern basis and using the historical cost convention, except for the 
revaluation of certain financial instruments, in accordance with Companies Act 2006 and applicable United Kingdom Accounting 
Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (‘UK GAAP’)). The principal accounting policies and measurement 
bases adopted are the same as those disclosed in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, except as noted below, and have 
been applied consistently to all the years presented, unless stated otherwise. Judgments made by the directors in the application of 
these accounting policies which have a significant effect on the financial statements, and estimates with a significant risk of material 
adjustment, have been disclosed in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements. 
Going concern 
Pages 132 to 200 of the consolidated financial statements contain information on the performance of the Group, its financial position, 
cash flows, net debt position and borrowing facilities. Further information, including financial risk management policies, exposures to 
market and credit risk and hedging activities, is given in note 31 to the consolidated financial statements, ‘Financial risk’. After making 
enquiries, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the company has adequate resources to continue in operational existence 
for the foreseeable future. For this reason the directors consider it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the 
financial statements. 
Exemptions 
In accordance with section 408(3) of the Companies Act 2006, the company is exempt from the requirement to present its own 
income statement. 
The company has taken advantage of certain disclosure exemptions in FRS 101, in part because its financial statements are included  
in the publicly-available consolidated financial statements of G4S plc. 
These disclosure exemptions relate to:  
• 
the requirements of IAS 7 – Statement of Cash Flows; 
• 
the statement of compliance with International Financial Reporting Standards adopted by the European Union; 
• 
new IFRSs that have been issued but are not yet effective and which have not been applied by the company; 
• 
comparative information for the movements from the beginning to the end of the year in respect of intangible assets and certain 
other additional comparative information;  
• 
information on the assumptions used in the determination of fair value and recoverable amounts of cash-generating units containing 
goodwill and management’s approach to determining these amounts; 
• 
financial instruments disclosures required by IFRS 7 – Financial Instruments: Disclosures; 
• 
disclosures required by IFRS 13 – Fair Value Measurement;  
• 
certain related-party disclosures on key management compensation and transactions entered into between two or more wholly-
owned members of a Group; and 
• 
capital management disclosures. 
Investments in subsidiaries 
Investments in subsidiary undertakings are stated at cost less provisions for impairment. The accounting policy for impairments  
is disclosed in note 3(j) to the consolidated financial statements. 
Amounts owed by/to Group undertakings 
Amounts owed by/to Group undertakings are recognised initially at fair value and are subsequently stated at amortised cost. Finance 
income and expense are recognised in the income statement on an accruals basis using the effective interest method. 
Impairment of financial assets 
The company provides for impairments in financial assets when there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more 
events that impact the estimated future cash flows of the financial assets. 
204 G4S plc Integrated Report and Accounts 2017  
180  G4S plc Integrated Report and Accounts 2017 
Share-based payments 
The company issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees. The fair value of equity settled share-based payments  
is determined at the date of grant and is either expensed or capitalised as an investment in the relevant subsidiary, with a corresponding 
increase in equity, on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the company’s estimate of the shares that will eventually 
vest. The amount expensed or capitalised is adjusted over the vesting period for changes in the estimate of the number of shares that 
will eventually vest, save for changes resulting from any market-related performance conditions.  
The company also issues cash-settled share-based payments to certain employees, which are recognised as a liability at fair value at  
the date of grant. The value of the liability is re-measured at each reporting date and at the date on which the liability is settled. The  
fair value of cash settled share-based payments is expensed in the income statement if it relates to employees of the company and 
capitalised as an investment in the relevant subsidiary if it relates to employees of a subsidiary company. 
Financial guarantees 
The company enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies within the Group. The 
company considers these to be insurance arrangements and accounts for them as such. The company therefore treats such contracts  
as a contingent liability unless and until such time as it becomes probable that the company will be required to make a payment under 
the guarantee.

Derivative financial instruments are stated at fair value, measured using techniques consistent with Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy 
(inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are observable for the asset and liability, either directly or indirectly). The source 
of the market prices is Bloomberg and in addition the third-party relationship counterparty banks. The relevant currency yield curve is 
used to forecast the floating-rate cash flows anticipated under the instrument, which are discounted back to the reporting date. This 
value is compared to the original transaction value, giving a fair-value of the instrument at the reporting date. 
The fair value of derivative financial instruments is calculated using a discounted cash flow approach and using inputs based on 
observable market data. Judgment is used to determine the relevant inputs, currency yield curves and discount rates. Although these 
judgments, estimates and associated assumptions are based on management’s best knowledge of current events and circumstances,  
the actual results may differ. 
Currency risk and cross-currency swaps 
The Group conducts business in many currencies. The Group presents its consolidated financial statements in Sterling and as a c onsequence  
is subject to foreign exchange risk due to the translation of the results and net asse ts of its foreign subsidiaries. The company, together with  
its subsidiary G4S International Finance plc, hedges a substantia l portion of the Group’s exposure to fluctuations in the trans lation into Sterling  
of the Group’s overseas net assets by hold ing loans in foreign currencies and cross-currency swaps. On consolidation, translati on adjustments 
arising on the translation of foreign currency loans and changes in the fair value of the cross-currency swaps meeting hedge ac counting criteria 
are recognised in equity to match translation adjustments on fore ign currency equity investments as they qualify as net-investment hedges. 
However, in the company’s own financial statements, translation adjustments arising on the translation of foreign currency loans are recognised 
in the income statement and are in pa rt hedged by cross-currency swaps. 
Cross-currency swaps with a nominal value of £25m are outstanding. These swaps were arranged to hedge the foreign currency risk  
on US$50m of the second US Private Placement notes issued in July 2008, effectively fixing the Sterling value on this portion of debt  
at an exchange rate of 1.9750. These swaps will mature in July 2018.

 Integrated Report and Accounts 2017 G4S plc 183 
(i) Derivative financial instruments continued  
Interest-rate risk and interest-rate swaps  
Borrowings issued at fixed rates expose the company to fair value interest-rate risk, which the company manages within policy  
limits approved by the directors. When fixed/floating interest-rate debt in the preferred mix is unavailable directly from investors, 
interest-rate swaps are utilised to create the desired blend in accordance with Treasury policy, with the proportion of fixed interest rate 
held reducing on a sliding scale over forward periods up to a maximum of five years. The quantity of interest-rate swaps outstanding in 
the Company is expected to continue to decline as treasury activity is increasingly conducted by G4S International Finance plc. 
The US Private Placement market is predominantly a fixed-rate market, with investors preferring a fixed-rate return over the life of  
the loan notes. At the time of the first issue in March 2007, the Group was comfortable with the proportion of floating-rate exposure 
not hedged by interest-rate swaps and therefore rather than take on a higher proportion of fixed-rate debt it arranged fixed-to-floating 
swaps, effectively converting the fixed coupon on the Private Placement to a floating rate. Following the swaps the resulting average 
coupon on the US Private Placement is LIBOR + 60bps. These swaps have been documented as fair-value hedges of the US Private 
Placement fixed-interest loan notes, with the movements in their fair value posted to profit and loss at the same time as the movement 
in the fair value of the hedged item. The swaps with a nominal value of US$200m matured in 2017 with the remainder of US$145m 
maturing in 2019 and US$105m maturing in 2022. 
The interest on the US Private Placement notes issued in July 2008, and on the £350m public notes issued in May 2009, was initially 
kept at fixed rate. In April 2014, the interest rate on £44m of the US Private Placement notes issued in July 2008, and on all of the 
£350m public notes issued in May 2009, was swapped from fixed to floating for a period of three years using derivatives. These swaps 
matured in 2017. 
The £350m public notes have a coupon step-up of 1.25%, which is triggered should the credit rating of the company fall below 
investment grade. 
(j) Retirement benefit obligations 
The company is the sponsoring company for the Group’s UK defined benefit pension scheme, to which it provides a guarantee over  
all payments to be made to the scheme by the operating companies. The following disclosures relate to the UK scheme only and are

At 31 December 2017, the company had unutilised tax losses of approximately £271m (2016: £298m) potentially available for offset 
against future profits. A deferred tax asset of £49m (2016: £58m) has been recognised in respect of approximately £271m (2016: 
£298m) of gross losses based on expected/forecast profitability from approved budgets and business plans. The recognition of deferred 
tax assets on tax losses is predicated on the projected generation of income in the company which should result in the utilisation of  
the available tax losses within a foreseeable period. This income stream is driven by the current and future global results of the Group  
in line with business plans. The timing of recognition of the tax losses as a deferred tax asset in 2017 was supported by the improved 
profit profile of the company, which itself is underpinned by the continuing progress of the Group’s transformation strategy to generate 
future sustainable, profitable growth. 
As at 31 December 2017, the company has capital losses available to carry forward of approximately £2.5bn (2016: £0.14bn). These 
losses have no expiry date and have not been agreed with the relevant tax authorities. No deferred tax assets have been recognised  
in respect of these losses on the basis that the likelihood of their future utilisation is considered to be remote.
