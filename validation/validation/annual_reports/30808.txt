FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS
The effectiveness of our strategy is reflected in the record 2017 financial results highlighted below.
* Profit from continuing operations — GEL 403.5 million (+9.0% y-o-y); Profit from discontinued operations — GEL 59.9 million (+2.8% y-o-y).
** Tier 1 Capital Ratio (NBG Basel III) at 31 December 2017 – 12.4%.
*** Including discontinued operations.
**** In 2017, we changed the Group’s accounting policy in relation to subsequent measurement of office buildings and service centres from revaluation model to cost model.  
We have accordingly restated the balance sheet accounts for affected periods, while the change did not have any material impact on the income statement. In addition,  
we started presenting Aldagi as part of the Investment Business since 2Q17. Therefore, Banking Business balance sheet and income statement accounts, and the ratios  
have been updated accordingly for prior periods presented to reflect these changes.

RETAIL BANKING
CLIENT-CENTRIC, MULTI-BRAND STRATEGY FOR OUR C.2.3 MILLION CLIENTS.
We are the leading retail banking player in Georgia, serving c.2.3 million clients through the widest network  
of 281 retail branches, 850 ATMs and 2,842 Express Pay (self-service) terminals, a sales force of more than 
3,000 people, along with our diverse products and services. Our Retail Banking business, the prominent 
component of our business, runs a client-centric, multi-brand strategy, which reaches the entire spectrum  
of retail clients through three well-established and recognised brands:
1.  Express – designed to service emerging retail clients with minimal incremental operational costs through 
cost-efficient distance channels such as our Express Pay terminals, internet and mobile banking and 
technology-intensive Express branches;
2. Bank of Georgia – providing long-established banking services to our mass retail clients; and
3.   Solo – targeting mass affluent clients and providing a unique blend of banking and lifestyle products  
and services.
WEALTH MANAGEMENT
WE ARE AN ESTABLISHED LEADER OF INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT SERVICES IN GEORGIA.
We have been active in asset and wealth management since 2005. Accommodating 1,434 local and 
international clients from 75 countries worldwide, our Wealth Management business provides private banking 
services to our high net-worth individual clients and offers investment management products internationally 
through representative offices in Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Great Britain. The unique offer of the  
Bank of Georgia provides our clients with the opportunity of investing in Georgia, which many foreign customers 
perceive as very attractive. As Georgia has a pay-as-you-go pension system, the Bank believes that its wealth 
management franchise can benefit by focusing on the distribution of local debt.
In May 2017, we held the first regional conference of Wealth Management in Tbilisi. The event aimed to 
introduce Georgia as a regional hub for private banking services. The prospects and challenges of making 
Georgia a regional banking centre were discussed, including the investment climate in Georgia, the country’s 
economy and the banking sector. The conference was attended by leading financial institutions from the 
countries of Europe and the Middle East, including Israel and Russia, as well as by international clients and 
professionals with legal and taxation backgrounds.
CORPORATE INVESTMENT BANKING
INTEGRATED SOLUTIONS FOR OUR CIB CLIENTS.
Our Bank is a leading corporate lender in the country, with deep sector knowledge and local expertise. Our 
Corporate Banking business is characterised by outstanding flexibility in meeting our corporate clients’ needs and 
offers the most comprehensive range of products and services in the country. We are proud to accommodate 
more than 2,500 businesses in Georgia and play our part in developing various sectors of the economy such as 
trade, energy, industry and tourism, among others. Corporate Banking additionally serves as the country’s leading 
trade finance business and provides leasing services through the Group’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Georgian 
Leasing Company (GLC).
We are at the forefront of capital markets development in Georgia. We aim to leverage our superior knowledge 
and capital markets capabilities in the Georgian and neighbouring markets in terms of both reach and expertise 
that we have accumulated over the past several years through our corporate advisory, debt and equity capital 
market research and brokerage practices united under Galt & Taggart, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Group. 
Our brokerage business serves regional and international markets, including hard-to-reach frontier economies. 
Our macro and sectoral research currently covers various sectors of the Georgian economy and developments 
taking place in regional economies. In addition, since August 2017, Galt & Taggart publishes an extensive 
quarterly report on macroeconomic developments in the Georgian economy, followed by a conference call 
hosted by Galt & Taggart for interested stakeholders to discuss the developments (subscription to the research 
on www.galtandtaggart.com).
BNB
WELL CAPITALISED SME BANK IN BELARUS.
JSC Belarusky Narodny Bank (BNB) offers individual and business banking services principally to SMEs and 
middle-income retail banking customers in Belarus. BNB was one of the first privately-owned commercial 
banks in Belarus, established in 1992. The Group increased its ownership of BNB from 79.99% in 2016 to 
99.98% in 2017. The Group is exploring options for realising value from BNB, as it is not located in our core 
region of focus. 05 Annual Report 2017 BGEO Group PLC

P&C INSURANCE (ALDAGI)
THE LEADING PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE BUSINESS.
Our Property & Casualty business (P&C or Aldagi) is a leading player in the Georgian P&C insurance market, 
with a market share of 38.6% based on gross premiums earned as of and for the nine months ended 
30 September 2017. The company offers a wide range of insurance products in Georgia to corporate and  
retail clients, covering more than 47,000 customers through five business lines: motor, property, credit life, 
liability and other insurance services. Aldagi’s insurance products are offered through the offices in Tbilisi and 
large cities across Georgia, a network of insurance agents, local partner banks and non-financial institutions 
(such as major car dealerships), insurance brokers and online portals.
Aldagi aims to unlock the full potential of Georgia’s significantly underpenetrated retail insurance segment by 
extending cooperation with local financial institutions to successfully diversify its multi-channel distribution network, 
uncover additional sources of high quality customers for its leading insurance products and consolidate its market 
leadership position in digital insurance, which will enable Aldagi to strengthen its presence in the fast-emerging 
retail insurance segment.

GEORGIA HEALTHCARE GROUP (GHG)
THE LEADING INTEGRATED PLAYER IN THE GEORGIAN HEALTHCARE ECOSYSTEM WITH A VALUE OF GEL 3.5 BILLION.
Georgia Healthcare Group PLC is the UK incorporated holding company of the largest healthcare services 
provider and the largest pharmaceuticals retailer and wholesaler in the fast-growing, predominantly privately-
owned, Georgian health market. GHG offers by far the most comprehensive range of inpatient and outpatient 
services in Georgia. GHG targets the mass market segment through its vertically integrated network of 37 
hospitals and 12 polyclinic clusters, including 16 district polyclinics and 24 express outpatient clinics, and 255 
pharmacies as at 31 December 2017. GHG is the single largest market participant, accounting for 24.5% of 
total hospital bed capacity in the country as at 31 December 2017.
GHG is the largest pharmaceuticals retailer and wholesaler in Georgia, with approximately 30% market share by 
revenue in 2017. GHG has approximately c.2.1 million client interactions per month, with 0.5 million loyalty card 
members. GHG is also the second largest provider of medical insurance in Georgia with a 29.0% market share 
based on gross revenue and has approximately 155,000 insurance customers at January 2018.
At 31 December 2017, in line with IFRS, GHG is classified as a “disposal group held for sale” and the results  
of its operations are reported under “discontinued operations”. For details see Overview of Financial Results on 
page 52.
GEORGIA GLOBAL UTILITIES (GGU)
MAJOR UTILITY AND ENERGY COMPANY, WITH CLEAR GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES AND ROOM TO IMPROVE EFFICIENCY.
GGU has two main business lines – water utility and electric power generation. In its water utility business, GGU 
has a natural monopoly that supplies water and provides a wastewater service to 1.4 million people (more than 
one-third of Georgia’s population) in three Georgian cities: Tbilisi, Mtskheta and Rustavi. In the electric power 
business, GGU has a portfolio of three hydropower generating facilities (an additional 2.9MW facility under 
management) with a total of 149.3MW capacity. Generated power is primarily used by GGU’s water business, 
with the excess amount sold to third parties. GGU is developing hydropower plants (HPPs), as well as solar and 
wind power sources in Georgia. In 2017, GGU commenced construction of the 50MW HPP in North-Western 
Georgia (Svaneti region) aiming for the HPP to be operational in December 2018. Moreover, 44.3MW Zoti HPP 
in Western Georgia (Guria region) is currently under development with a target to complete the construction by 
the end of 2020. c.100MW wind projects are currently at the feasibility stage and once complete, GGU expects 
to commence construction works.
BEVERAGE BUSINESS (TELIANI VALLEY)
CREATING A LEADING BEVERAGE PRODUCER AND DISTRIBUTOR IN SOUTH CAUCASUS.
Teliani is a leading Georgian wine producer and beverage distributor with a wide distribution platform for a variety  
of imported beverages as well as own produced wine. Teliani sells around 3.5 million bottles of wine annually,  
with about 68% of sales coming from exports. Building on its existing distribution franchise of c.5,000 sales points, 
Teliani has expanded into a new business line of beer and soft beverage production, with a ten-year exclusivity 
from Heineken to sell in three countries: Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan – a total population of c.17 million 
people. The construction of the beer brewing facility completed in 2016 and Teliani launched local mainstream  
beer and lemonade production in June and August 2017, respectively. The newly launched beer “ICY” was well 
received by the local market, which immediately earned 97% brand awareness and 16% market share upon 
launch. Teliani is on track to brew Heineken and Krushovice beers in 2018. With a strong management team and  
a proven track record, Teliani aims to become a leading beverages producer and distributor in South Caucasus. 06 Annual Report 2017 BGEO Group PLC
CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
Dear Shareholders,
This is expected to be the last BGEO annual 
report. The forthcoming demerger of the Group, 
announced in July 2017, reflects both the end 
of an era and the start of a new one. The Board 
and management team are convinced that  
we are on the right strategic path. In fulfilling  
our fiduciary duties to you, the Board regularly 
examines strategic options. We elected to split 
the Group into two independent businesses: 
the Bank and an investment vehicle, which  
we call Georgia Capital.
If we do it right, we could be at the eve of  
a major jump in value creation. We will have 
created three large groups, all quoted on the 
London Stock Exchange, each with their own 
Board, management, and strategic logic. It is 
an opportunity to deliver better service to our 
clients, better development to our employees, 
more growth of the corporate sector of the 
country, and finally significant financial return  
to our shareholders. Each management team 
and the Boards will focus on the development 
of one kind of business.
In my letter, I have traditionally followed a  
set structure. First, a few words on Georgia; 
then on the strategy of the Group; and then  
on people – Board and top management.  
Irakli Gilauri, our CEO, and others will expand 
on the detail of the businesses.
Economically, Georgia is doing exceptionally 
well in a difficult region and world. I believe 
three key factors make the Georgian situation 
positive in the long term:
1. Macroeconomic stability. Prudent monetary 
and fiscal policies have led to almost 5% 
real GDP growth during 2017. This has 
allowed the first ever issuance of offshore 
local currency bonds by Bank of Georgia.
NEIL JANIN
CHAIRMAN
2. Many healthy and developing sectors, in line 
with Government policies:
a. The financial sector, of which we are part
b. Infrastructure development, especially in 
the power sector
c. Healthcare, where we participate in the 
universal healthcare access policies of 
Government
d. Finally, and more long term, the 
Government has a programme to 
improve education, and to make the 
public sector more efficient.
3. Good Government
a. Strong anti-corruption policies. According 
to Transparency International, Georgia 
has maintained its ranking as a low 
bribery environment — on a par with 
many European Union member states
b. Georgia’s ease of doing business ranking 
was 9th out of 190 countries in the world, 
in 2018, up from 16th last year. Here 
again an excellent result
c. Fiscal development. The corporate tax 
reforms, effectively eliminating corporate 
income tax for all re-invested or retained 
earnings, started at the beginning of  
the year and have already yielded GEL 
600-650 million cash buffer for corporate 
re-investment in the first year on the 
policy’s adoption. The reform efforts also 
envisage capital market development 
and pension reform. Georgia is on the 
right path, and these are developments 
which take time
d. Reduction of the fiscal deficit. The 
Government is determined to reduce  
its fiscal deficit, on the back of reducing 
non-essential current spending. The 
2018 draft budget is an illustration  
that Government delivers on its 
commitments; as was the case  
in 2017.
The proof of this economic progress lies in  
the fact that we were able do the first ever  
Lari Eurobond issuance and that Moody’s has 
upgraded both Georgia and Bank of Georgia  
to a level two notches below investment grade. 
The strategy of creating a “mini Singapore” 
within the region is moving forward day by day. 
Singapore was not created in one day.
Politically, things are as calm as they can be 
with Russia. The New York Times reported  
last year on Russia’s attempts to provoke 
Georgia on the boundaries of Abkhazia and 
South Ossetia – all true; but we also see that 
Russia is doing more business with Georgia, 
specifically in terms of transport links and 
increased tourism flows. Elsewhere, Turkey 
remains Georgia’s largest trade partner, whilst 
the development of trading links with Iran  
are likely to take more time than we originally 
thought. At the same time, Georgia signed a 
free trade agreement with China and now has 
access to a market of 1.4 billion consumers, 
with zero tariffs, without additional customs 
fees and without any transition period.
Internally, it is important to remember that 
Georgia is still a pluralist and free country. It is 
taking the habits of democracies, albeit with 
one party dominance: historically the UNM 
party, and Georgian Dream now. We have a 
Government which is supportive and has very 
competent public servants. Finally, investors 
should not forget that the United States and  
the European Union exercise strong external 
checks and balances – they do not want to 
lose Georgia as a rare democratic success 
story. They showed their confidence in the 
country by granting Georgia visa-free entry  
to the 26 countries of the Schengen Area. 07 Annual Report 2017 BGEO Group PLC

Information
The thinking behind our decision to break-up  
the Group into two separate businesses, each 
expected to be quoted on the premium segment 
of the London Stock Exchange, deserves to be 
explained.
It did not come from the analysis of a 
conglomerate discount, and the expectation 
that we would see a valuation bump because of 
the transaction. The value creation boost for the 
two entities is derived from our belief that we will 
run them better— with higher ROE and higher 
growth. The logic is simple: first, complexity 
creates confusion, simplicity creates focus. 
Second, each entity will be freer to pursue its 
own growth strategy without worrying about 
“the Group”. We can already see the effects  
of this decision. One example is our insurance 
subsidiary which has already signed a number 
of distribution agreements with banks other  
than the Bank of Georgia. This might not have 
happened if we had decided to stay in the 
“previous structure”.
Both entities have substantial potential of 
earnings and sales growth.
The Bank is repositioning its portfolio away from 
straight lending to corporates which require 
capital and see their margins diminishing. It 
behooves us to find innovative ways to serve 
the corporate segment much more profitably. 
We are also moving into the high net-worth 
segments, where we can attract wealth  
from the region. We will continue to reduce 
costs. Finally, digital technologies offer us an 
opportunity that we have not yet exploited.  
The Bank has a very good management team 
with Kaha Kiknavelidze as its leader, and they 
are at work on this strategy. I will become 
Chairman of the Bank and this will be my  
only Board appointment.
The non-banking business within BGEO will 
become an investment company — Georgia 
Capital — which will include real estate, energy, 
utility, beverages, and insurance. It will also have 
listed stakes in the healthcare business and the 
Bank. The value proposition to investors is “the 
best vehicle for emerging growth opportunities in 
Georgia, selected by people with unsurpassed 
understanding of the local landscape, and 
managers/entrepreneurs”. Georgia Capital  
will be run like a private equity fund with one 
exception. The interest of its investors will be 
aligned with those of its “Partners”. In fact, its 
CEO will be paid exclusively in shares vesting 
over six years, and his executive team will have  
a similar compensation structure. Irakli Gilauri will 
leave the Group and the Bank, to head this 
company as Chairman and CEO. The Board is 
made up of old hands, such as David Morrison 
and Kim Bradley and a number of new recruits: 
Caroline Brown, William Huyett, Massimo 
Salvadori and Jyrki Talvitie.
The healthcare company, GHG, is a stand-alone 
entity today, with its own Board and separate 
stock market listing. It has much potential that 
you can read about in its own annual report.
Board quality and composition have been  
one of my main preoccupations: we have an 
opportunity to build a new Board for Georgia 
Capital and to reinforce the Boards of the Bank 
and the healthcare company. We have tried to 
prioritise skills and experience as well as gender 
diversity. We need Board members who will 
spend time on the ground in Georgia. We have 
attracted Cecil Quillen to the Bank’s Board and 
are actively seeking an additional member. All  
of our Board members are T-shaped, capable 
of broad judgement and all bring a speciality to 
the company. The composition of the two new 
Boards and the experience and qualifications  
of their members are set forth on page 19 of 
this Report. 
Unfortunately, at the outset, we will still have 
only one woman on each of our boards. Our 
goal is to correct that yesterday. We are still 
seeking to achieve the diversity targets at board 
level expected of a company of our size, and as 
chairman, I make this a personal priority. It has 
been a war for talent.
Corporate culture and human capital have 
increasingly become the cornerstone of our 
success. We would not be able to breakup  
if we had not developed capable leaders to 
take over. One of the key components of our 
talent or human resource development strategy 
has been our incentive system. Its intent is  
to incentivise management to create value  
on a long-term basis: more than 85% of 
management’s compensation is in shares  
that vest over a three-to-five-year period – 
discouraging quick earnings temptations.
This year we have moved further into changing 
our corporate culture in every one of the entities. 
We want to go from solo performance executives 
to executives who thrive on teamwork. We have 
instituted personal development programmes 
starting at the very top and cascading to the 
lower level of the hierarchy. Meritocracy and trust 
are what we aim to achieve. This starts with top 
managers’ behaviour and talk. It is reinforced by 
training programmes which teach both 
self-development, how to give and receive 
feedback, as well as how to dialogue rather  
than impose. All this will not be enough if good 
behaviour is not encouraged and bad behaviour 
not tolerated. The Board and I take a particular 
interest in seeing this through.
Before closing, I would like to thank Irakli Gilauri 
for his leadership as Chief Executive Officer. 
During his tenure at BGEO, Irakli has taken  
a Georgia quoted bank and transformed it  
into the organisation with multiple businesses 
which we have today. He did not do it alone.  
He attracted and developed many executives 
who all lead their own businesses today, and 
are developing in turn a set of new leaders.  
His final act will be to achieve the break-up 
successfully. The Board of Directors and I are 
truly grateful for his leadership over the years  
he has been with the company.
In closing, I would like to thank our investors.  
It is because of your trust that we were able to 
achieve all that has been achieved. You will now 
have a choice of which parts of the business 
you will hold – I hope that you will continue to 
hold both.

Chairman
7 March 2018 08 Annual Report 2017 BGEO Group PLC
CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S STATEMENT
In what is expected to be my final letter to 
BGEO Group shareholders I would like to  
talk about three subjects:
1. The outstanding performance of the Group
2. Simplicity is a key ingredient to our future 
success, which drove our difficult decision 
to demerge
3. Our determined and high-achieving Board 
PERFORMANCE
BGEO Group delivered another extremely  
strong performance during 2017 that resulted in 
record profit for the year of GEL 463 million, and 
earnings per share of GEL 11.61, an increase of 
11.5% year-on-year. Group revenues increased 
by 23.7% to GEL 1.1 billion. Book value per 
share at the end of 2017 was GEL 65.22,  
up 15.2% year-on-year. This reflects excellent 
performance from our Banking Business as  
well as strong momentum and strategic delivery 
from our Investment Businesses, which were 
supported by Georgia’s strong macroeconomic 
performance and business outlook.
In the Banking Business, 2017 was 
characterised by strong franchise growth in 
Retail Banking operations, particularly in the 
fourth quarter. This reflected the continued 
strong performance of our retail business in  
all segments and an increase in retail lending 
during the year of 29.3%. In addition, in 3Q17 
we completed our three-year programme to 
reduce concentration risk in our Corporate 
Bank and consequently started to deliver 
corporate lending growth in the last quarter  
of the year. Loan yields have remained stable, 
and net interest margins have therefore  
stayed robust at 7.3%. Costs have remained  
well-controlled, whilst ensuring continued 
investment in building an increasingly strong 
customer franchise. The Banking Business  
cost of risk ratio in 2017 was 2.2%, in line  
with our medium-term cost of risk expectations, 
and a significant reduction from 2.7% in 2016. 
In addition, we have continued to improve our 
asset quality and provisions coverage ratios. 
The Return on Average Equity in the Banking 
Business continued to improve, and stood  
at 25.2% for the year, and 27.8% in the  
fourth quarter. 
We have again delivered on all of our key 
strategic priorities. 2017 revenue growth of 
17.5% was particularly supported by strong 
Retail Banking franchise growth, where revenue 
increased by 24.4% and customer lending 
continues to grow at more than 20% per  
annum. This offset the anticipated decline in the 
Corporate Investment Banking loan portfolio, as 
we wound down the banking relationship with a 
small number of significant corporate borrowers, 
earlier in 2017. Importantly, this helped us to 
make strong progress in reducing concentration 
risk in the Corporate Investment Banking, and  
we lowered the concentration of our top ten 
corporate borrowers to only 10.7% of our lending 
portfolio. We have now exceeded our targeted 
rebalancing of the retail/corporate portfolio mix to 
further improve the return profile of the Banking 
Business. Retail Banking now represents 68%  
of the Bank’s customer lending and Corporate 
Investment Banking represents 32%.
In addition to the strong retail lending growth, 
Retail Banking made strong progress in 
implementing its customer-centric approach 
with the launch of its new loyalty reward 
programme Plus+ in July 2017, and continued 
investment in digital growth. Our product to 
client ratio also improved from 2.0 to 2.2 during 
the second half of 2017. In July 2017, we won 
the exclusive right to modernise public transport 
payment system in Tbilisi and continue as the 
sole provider of the Tbilisi Metro’s payment 
support systems for the next ten years. In 
addition, Solo, our premium banking brand, has 
continued to deliver strong growth momentum, 
with customer numbers increasing to 32,104, 
up 66.6% over the last 12 months. Solo is on 
track to achieving its target of 40,000 Solo 
clients by the end of 2018.
The improving growth and strength of the 
Georgian economy continue to support asset 
quality. In addition to the reduction to 2.2%  
in the cost of risk ratio mentioned above, we 
were able to reduce the ratio of NPLs to Gross 
Loans, which fell from 4.2% in December 2016, 
to 3.8% in December 2017. Our NPL coverage 
ratio also improved – from 86.7% at the end of 
December 2016, to 92.7% at the end of 2017.
The Group’s capital and funding position  
remain strong, with capital being held both  
in the regulated Banking Business and at the 
holding company level. At the end of 2017, 
liquid assets totalling GEL 310 million were  
held at the holding company level. Within the 
Banking Business, the NBG (Basel II) Tier 1 
Capital Adequacy ratio increased by 120 basis 
points to 10.3% during the year, reflecting both 
the continued de-dollarisation of the Banking 
Business lending portfolio and the Banking 
Business’ high return on average equity and 
internal capital generation. 
The National Bank of Georgia is currently  
in the process of transitioning to Basel III 
standards, and introduced new capital adequacy 
requirements in December 2017. On the basis of 
new regulation, the NBG (Basel III) Tier 1 capital 
adequacy ratio was 12.4% at 31 December 
2017, compared to a new minimum Tier 1 
capital requirement of 9.9%, which is expected 
to increase to 11.4% on 31 December 2018. 
Bank of Georgia has strong capital ratios and 
high levels of internal capital generation. As a 
result, the transition to Basel III is not expected 
to affect the Bank’s growth expectations or 
existing dividend payout policy.
The Group’s Investment Business continued 
to deliver strong growth and performance, with 
EBITDA growing 55.7% year-on-year, and profit 
before non-recurring items and income tax, 
including discontinued operations, increasing 
by 21.4% over the same period. 
We now expect that, in line with our planned 
exit strategy for the business, it is highly 
probable that the Group will own less than  
a 50% stake in Georgia Healthcare Group 
(“GHG”) at the end of 2018. As a result, GHG is 
now reported under “discontinued operations” 
in the Group’s consolidated income statement. 
Within the business, GHG delivered a year of 
strong progress towards its planned investment 
and business roll-out in all key areas of the 
Georgian healthcare system. GHG delivered net 
revenues of GEL 745.7 million during the year, 
an increase of 76.0%, reflecting a combination 
of solid organic growth and the impact of

acquisitions. The healthcare services EBITDA 
margin continues to be strong at 26.4%, 
notwithstanding the dilutive effect of the 
significant roll-out of the two major hospital 
renovations – Tbilisi Referral Hospital and Deka 
– and the ongoing roll-out of a nationwide  
chain of polyclinics (outpatient clinics). In the 
pharmacy business, we have made significant 
progress towards the integration of our two 
recently acquired businesses, whilst avoiding 
any significant business disruption. As a result, 
the EBITDA margin of 8.6% for the year has 
already exceeded our target of a margin of 
“more than 8%”.
Our water utility and energy business, GGU, 
continued to focus on improving efficiencies in 
the water utility business and delivered a 6.1% 
year-on-year growth in revenues during the 
year, whilst achieving a 52% EBITDA margin. 
GGU has also continued to achieve efficiencies 
in its own energy consumption, to free up 
electricity for third-party sales, and has started 
a number of investments in additional capacity 
for electricity generation with the goal to 
establish a renewable energy platform. During 
2017, GGU commenced construction of one  
of two planned hydro power plants targeting 
c.100MW of additional capacity over the next 
few years.
Our real estate business, m
2
 Real Estate, 
continues to demonstrate its strong execution 
skills to unlock value in the real estate 
development business. During 2017, m
2
  
sold 629 apartments with a total sales value  
of US$ 49.1 million, in addition to further 
increasing its portfolio of yielding assets.  
In addition, the real estate business continued  
to execute on its strategy of developing 1,000 
hotel rooms by the end of 2020. In the fourth 
quarter of 2017, we acquired the shell of 
approximately 100-room hotel, and in February 
2018 we launched a 152-room Ramada  
Encore hotel in central Tbilisi. As part of our 
“asset light” strategy, m
2
 signed its largest  
ever franchise agreement to construct and 
develop a residential complex under the m
2
 
brand name on a third-party land plot in a 
densely populated Tbilisi suburb. Additionally, 
m
2
’s construction arm gained its first major 
third-party construction agreement to construct 
the shell and core of a new shopping mall and 
business centre in Tbilisi’s Saburtalo district. 
These developments underpin an extremely 
successful year for the real estate business, 
and provide significant growth potential over 
the next few years.
Our property and casualty insurance business, 
Aldagi, continues development of a strong 
portfolio of new products, supporting 24.6% 
year-on-year growth in net earned premiums 
during 2017 and Aldagi’s position as the  
clear market leader in the fast-developing 
Georgian P&C insurance market. Over the  
last few months, Aldagi has also enhanced  
its distribution capabilities by signing major third-
party partnership agreements with two Georgian 
banks – Liberty Bank and Credo Bank – which 
will support the further diversification of Aldagi’s 
multi-channel distribution network. These 
contracts would not have materialised had  
it not been for the proposed demerger. 
Our beverage business, Teliani, increased its 
revenues by 102.5% year-on-year, continued to 
diversify its distribution portfolio and launched 
its mainstream beer and lemonade production 
during 2017. 
The Group Board expects to recommend a 
regular annual dividend for 2017 totalling c.GEL 
120 million. This is in the range of our regular 
dividend payout ratio target of 25-40% paid 
from the Banking Business profits. Since 2010, 
the Group has grown its annual dividend per 
share by 40% CAGR on a GEL basis, and by 
32% CAGR on a Dollar basis. If the expected 
demerger is successfully implemented as 
planned, it is intended that Bank of Georgia 
Group PLC (the then new parent company  
of the Banking Business), will instead, shortly 
after the demerger is completed, declare and 
pay a dividend in a similar aggregate amount  
to shareholders then on the record. In the  
event that the demerger is for any reason not 
completed it is intended, subject to shareholder 
approval, that the Board would implement the 
payment of this dividend, which would represent 
a payment of GEL 3.1 per share, payable in 
British Pounds Sterling at the prevailing rate,  
a 19.2% increase over the 2016 dividend.
In addition to the regular annual dividend paid 
to shareholders, US$5.0 million was returned 
to shareholders by way of the buyback and 
cancellation of 115,608 shares during 2017,  
as part of the existing Board approved US$50 
million buyback and cancellation programme. 
During 2017, the Group Employee Benefits 
Trust also purchased shares in the market 
totalling US$34.1 million.
SIMPLICITY
In July 2017, the Group announced its intention 
to demerge BGEO Group PLC into two 
separate London-listed businesses: a banking 
business, Bank of Georgia Group PLC, and an 
investment business, Georgia Capital PLC. On 
12 February 2018, the Group announced that 
the Board has approved the implementation of 
the demerger, which is subject to shareholder 
approval at a General Meeting expected to be 
held in April 2018. The demerger is expected to 
complete before the end of June 2018. The 
main benefit of the demerger is to simplify the 
structure, which in turn will enable the Boards 
and management teams of the respective 
businesses greater focus on strategy setting 
and execution. It was not an easy decision to 
separate the Group, but simplicity will bring so 
much benefit that it has clearly out-weighed all 
the potential downsides. 
In its final year before the forthcoming 
demerger, and supported by the continued 
macroeconomic performance of Georgia, 
BGEO Group has delivered a record breaking 
performance in terms of profitability and growth. 
Growth and return momentum is there for both 
the Banking and the Investment Businesses. 
BOARD
Our Board’s role in the success of the  
Group may not always be apparent to our 
shareholders or the broader community – but  
it is pivotal. Each Board member’s dedication, 
vision, rationalism and collaboration have made 
an important contribution to our development 
into the world-class institution we have 
become. Special thanks go to Neil Janin,  
our Chairman whose leadership of the board 
and active involvement in strategy setting and 
mentoring of senior management has been 
critical in the success of our Group. The  
good news is that Neil will continue to be  
the Chairman of Bank of Georgia. We have 
continued our commitment to a strong and 
independent governance structure and have 
managed to put first-class independent Boards 
and management teams in both businesses 
and I am confident that under the proposed 
governance structure following the demerger 
both companies independently will prosper 
even more and will continue their excellent 
recent track record for many years to come.
In what is expected to be my final letter to 
shareholders, I would like to thank you for  
your continuous support and loyalty. I have  
very much enjoyed meeting you on roadshows, 
which served as very good guidance for me 
personally. I have learned a great deal over  
the past 13 years of being an executive of  
a publicly listed company and believe, with  
your help, a lot more learning will follow in the 
years ahead. I am very much looking forward  
to meeting you to discuss our strategy in my  
new capacity as CEO of the first publicly listed 
investment company from the region. 
Sincerely yours,
Irakli Gilauri, 
Chief Executive Officer

INDUSTRY AND MARKET OVERVIEW
REFORMS-DRIVEN SUCCESS
Georgia has carried out genuine economic  
and structural improvements which have been 
institutionalised. As a result, corruption has 
decreased, doing business has become easier, 
productivity was enhanced and the economy 
diversified – enabling the country to withstand 
global financial crisis and recent shocks related 
to the commodity price slump with a relative 
strength. Georgia is consistently ranked as  
the top performer in governance and doing 
business indicators, in economic policy and 
institutional assessments as tracked by eminent 
international institutions. Georgia, with a ranking 
of 9, has implemented the highest number of 
business regulation reforms since the launch  
of the Ease of Doing Business report by the 
World Bank in 2003 – a total of 47 reforms – 
and Georgia is the only lower-middle-income 
country that made it in the top 20 countries 
ranked by Ease of Doing Business.
Furthermore, Georgia is ranked 16th out of  
180 countries by Index of Economic Freedom 
measured by Heritage Foundation in 2018  
and 25th out of 200 countries in the Trace 
International’s 2017 Matrix of Business Bribery 
Risk. Georgia is a positive exception to the 
trend of high bribery rates in the regional 
economies and is on a par with European 
Union (EU) member states with only 7% of 
people admitting having paid a bribe, according 
to the 2017 Global Corruption Barometer study 
by Transparency International.
The Economic Liberty Act, effective since 
January 2014, ensures the continuation of  
a credible fiscal and monetary framework for 
Georgia, by capping consolidated Government 
expenditures at 30% of Gross Domestic Product 
(GDP), fiscal deficit at 3% of GDP and public 
debt at 60% of GDP . The Economic Liberty Act 
also requires electorates’ approval through a 
nationwide referendum for imposing new taxes 
and raising existing tax rates, subject to certain 
exceptions. Furthermore, as of January 2017, 
corporate income tax is now applicable to  
only distributed profits; undistributed profits, 
reinvested or retained, are exempted. Georgia 
has one of the world’s friendliest tax regimes 
according to the Forbes Misery Tax Index,  
having slashed the number of taxes from  
21 in 2004 to just six currently.
The EU-Georgia Association Agreement, that 
came into force in July 2016, and related Deep 
and Comprehensive Free Trade Agreement 
(DCFTA), effective since September 2014,  
lay solid groundwork to improve governance, 
strengthen the rule of law and provide more 
economic opportunities by expanding the  
EU market to Georgian goods and services.  
A closer economic tie with the EU and a trust  
in prudent policy-making are also expected  
to attract foreign investments to Georgia. A 
visa-free travel to the EU, granted to Georgian 
passport holders in March 2017, is another 
major success of the Georgian foreign policy. 
While remaining committed to EU integration, 
Georgia has also managed to stabilise its 
relations with Russia, as the latter lifted its 
embargo on Georgian products in 2013. 
Tourism increasingly benefits from rising Russian 
arrivals, with Georgia being re-discovered by 
Russian as well as other visitors from regional 
countries. Moreover, Georgia-China economic 
ties are increasing and a free trade agreement 
signed in 2017 is expected to further expand 
the Chinese market for Georgia’s exports. In 
2017, China was the third largest consumer of 
Georgian wine, after Russia and Ukraine, and 
the fifth largest consumer of Georgia’s exports 
overall. Georgia is participating in China’s huge 
Belt and Road Initiative, that will have positive 
spillovers on the Georgian economy and the 
region overall. The number of countries now 
engaged in the Initiative stands at nearly 70  
and may reach 100 or more and cumulative 
investment in the corridors could reach US$  
1 trillion over the next ten years according to 
International Monetary Fund (IMF).
Georgia once again demonstrated its 
commitment to European standards and  
norms by ensuring free and fair 2016 
parliamentary elections. After the elections, 
Georgia’s ruling Georgian Dream party 
introduced a package of legislative changes  
to support the implementation of the 
Government’s four-pillar reform programme 
aimed to boost growth and enhance the 
economy’s resilience to external shocks.  
The programme includes new tax benefits, 
infrastructure schemes, governance reforms 
and modernisation of the education system.
Attractive place for doing business 
Georgia is an open and resilient emerging market and its ambition to transform itself into a Regional Hub Economy has already produced tangible 
results: tourism is booming and trade integration has strengthened. These, coupled with a business friendly environment and policies aimed at 
further diversifying the economy, support to attract foreign investments and boost growth.

The ongoing US$ 285 million three-year IMF 
programme will help Georgia reduce economic 
vulnerabilities and promote economic growth. 
The programme includes ambitious structural 
reforms to generate higher and more inclusive 
growth and fully supports Government’s 
four-point reform programme focusing on: 
improving education, investing in infrastructure, 
making public administration more efficient, and 
further developing the business environment  
to boost the private sector as a growth engine. 
In September 2017, Moody’s upgraded the 
sovereign credit rating of Georgia to Ba2  
from Ba3 and maintained the stable outlook. 
According to Moody’s, the Georgian economy’s 
resilience in the wake of the 2014 regional 
economic shock proves the country’s economic 
and institutional strength and is the main driver 
behind the one-notch rating upgrade.
Government focuses on addressing the 
shortcomings in employment benefit schemes, 
further cutting non-essential expenditures, 
consolidating public sector institutions, making 
social and healthcare spending more targeted 
and increasing the efficiencies in capital 
expenditure.
In order to enhance external sustainability, 
National Bank of Georgia introduced a ten- 
point de-dollarisation action plan, including the 
reforms to expand the use of the local currency 
in the economy, address high dollarisation  
in the banking sector and support domestic 
savings in the economy through capital  
markets development. 
MEASURES TO STRENGTHEN  
GEORGIA’S POSITIONING TO BECOME 
THE REGIONAL HUB ECONOMY
With its business-friendly environment,  
stable Government, developed infrastructure, 
stable energy supply, flexible labour legislation, 
stable and profitable banking sector, strategic 
geography and a Government committed  
to addressing structural improvements in  
the economy through its four-pillar reform 
programme, Georgia is well positioned to 
become a regional hub economy.
A natural transport and logistics hub, 
connecting important regions and a market 
of 2.8 billion customers without customs 
duties. Georgia’s favourable geographic 
location (between land-locked energy-rich 
countries in the East and European markets in 
the West) and well developed air, land and sea 
transport networks position the country to reap 
the benefits in transport, logistics and tourism. 
The Anaklia deep sea project is seen as a major 
scheme to enhance the regional transit hub 
potential. The Port of Anaklia sits on the shortest 
route from China to Europe, the route that  
has become a major focal point for Chinese 
investments in infrastructure. Once completed, 
it will be the first Georgian port capable of 
accommodating Panamax size cargo vessels. 
The Government’s ongoing infrastructure 
investments and increased spending on roads, 
energy, tourism and municipal infrastructure  
will also reinforce the potential. To enhance 
Georgia’s competitiveness the Government 
continues to strengthen integration in existing 
international systems as well as new transit 
routes (e.g. Lapis Lazuli, Persian Gulf – Black 
Sea, Baltic Sea – Black Sea). Georgia is a 
regional energy corridor that accounts for 
approximately 1.6% of the world’s oil and  
gas supply transit volumes. Georgia’s existing 
free trade deals (with the EU, CIS, EFTA, Turkey, 
and China) enable it to access a market of 2.8 
billion customers and are expected to further 
strengthen Georgia’s positioning as a platform 
to trade with, produce for and service regional 
markets.
Established tourism destination. Georgia  
is already an established tourism destination. 
Travel inflows are a significant source of foreign 
currency for Georgia. The number of visitors to 
Georgia increased at a 21.7% compounded 
annual growth rate (CAGR) over 2008-2017 
and tourism inflows stood at US$ 2.8 billion 
(18.2% of GDP) in 2017. The Government 
plans to enhance Georgia’s positioning as a 
four-season tourism location through improved 
connectivity of different regions with an aim to 
tap into their potential.

2017 LATEST AVAILABLE DATA
Stable energy supply and electricity transit 
hub potential. Georgia has a developed,  
stable and competitively priced energy sector. 
The country has overcome the chronic energy 
shortages of electricity and gas supply 
interruptions of a decade ago by renovating  
and building new hydropower plants (HPPs), 
improving transmission infrastructure and 
increasingly diversifying its natural gas imports 
from Azerbaijan, instead of from Russia. Energy 
needs of the country are growing steadily: on 
average by 3.6% for electricity and by 5.3% for 
natural gas. The needs are being addressed by 
constructing HPPs, renovating and rehabilitating 
internal and external electricity grid and natural 
gas pipelines. Currently, only an estimated 
20%-25% of Georgia’s hydro potential is utilised. 
The pipeline of investment projects in the energy 
sector is estimated at about US$ 4.4 billion in 
the next five to seven years, including US$ 2.5 
billion for three large HPP projects: Nenskra, 
Khudoni and Tskhenistskali cascade. Currently, 
43 power plants (1.5GW) are at various stages  
of construction or development, with 102 more 
(3.7GW) at feasibility study stage. Government 
policy over the last decade has encouraged 
investment in the hydropower sector, resulting in 
28 new HPPs, with a total capacity of 509.9MW, 
being added to the system over 2012-2017. 
Georgia’s transmission capacity is poised to 
increase and accommodate an additional 
installed capacity of 3.5GW by 2027 to meet  
the growth in export and domestic demand. 
Georgia is foreseen to be an electricity transit 
hub for neighbouring economies. In 2016-2017, 
already 1,104GWh was transited through 
Georgia to neighbouring countries. 
Attractive place for foreign investors. 
Georgia’s business-friendly environment 
coupled with its sustainable growth prospects 
continues to attract foreign investments. 
Georgia’s liberal economic reforms and 
business-friendly environment supported 
substantial Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) over 
the past decade. These capital flows boosted 
productivity and accelerated growth. Public 
infrastructure projects were also instrumental  
in driving growth, as well as better realising the 
country’s potential in logistics, transport and 
tourism. Faced with low domestic savings,  
FDI is an important source of financing growth 
in Georgia, as well as a reliable source of 
Georgia’s persistently high current account 
deficit funding. Despite the fact that many 
countries faced reduced capital flows during 
the recent economic turbulence, FDI into 
Georgia was relatively secure thanks to the 
business-friendly environment as well as
strategic infrastructure projects – such as the 
British Petroleum gas pipeline construction 
project and the railway project connecting 
Azerbaijan-Georgia-Turkey. FDI was at all-time 
high during nine months 2017, reaching US$ 
1.3 billion or 12.1% of GDP . FDI increased 
substantially in construction (+204.1% y-o-y), 
hotels and restaurants, (+287.1% y-o-y) and 
real estate (+68.9% y-o-y) sectors. Importantly, 
reinvestment by foreign companies almost 
doubled and reached c.US$ 600 million during 
nine months of 2017, indicating investors’ trust 
in Georgia’s growth model and the success  
of the profit tax reform introduced in 2017. 
Along with planned investment programmes  
of cross-country significance such as the 
Anaklia deep sea port and hydro energy 
projects, Georgia’s business-supportive 
environment and the growing numbers of  
free trade agreements are expected to lead  
to further strong FDI inflows to Georgia in  
the medium term.
Growing number of free trade deals. There 
have been significant changes in Georgia’s 
export structure and destination markets in 
recent years; however, Georgia has not yet 
tapped into international markets. Georgia’s 
exports performance is explained by its 
commodity structure, dominated by used  
car re-exports and resource-based metals  
and minerals, while employment-generating 
processed product exports remain secondary. 
One of the biggest changes in destination 
markets has been a reorientation from the 
Russian market after the 2005 embargo,  
as the embargo forced Georgian producers  
to redirect exports to other Commonwealth  
of Independent States (CIS) countries, the EU 
and the Middle East. Exports to Russia picked 
up again in 2013 as Russia opened its borders 
to Georgian products. Since 2013, Georgia’s 
developed logistics and transport infrastructure 
has helped to shore up opportunities for new 
re-export commodities, including copper and 
pharmaceuticals. Given these trends, it is  
likely that re-exports will continue to fuel 
Georgia’s export growth supported also  
by the Government policies which aim at  
further enhancing the platform for current and 
potential trade partners. Access to new large 
markets – EU and China – could increase 
market penetration and there is also scope  
for diversifying agricultural exports, once the 
quality and standards improve under EU-
DCFTA. Georgia’s existing free trade deals  
(with the EU, CIS, EFTA, Turkey, and China) 
enable it to access a market of 2.8 billion 
customers without customs duties. The 
prospective free trade agreements with  
Hong Kong and India also offer significant 
upside potential for Georgia’s exports.

GEORGIAN ECONOMY – THE FASTEST 
GROWING ECONOMY IN THE REGION
Georgia continued to deliver positive results  
in 2017. It is the ninth easiest place to do 
business globally, according to the latest World 
Bank Doing Business report. The resilience  
of the economy has been acknowledged by  
a one-notch sovereign credit rating upgrade 
from Moody’s. Trust in Georgia’s growth model 
was demonstrated by record high reinvestment 
by foreign companies in 2017, on the back  
of which the economy grew by an estimated 
4.8%. Increased external demand for goods 
and services originating in Georgia made net 
exports the main driver of growth in 2017 for 
the first time since 2013. Tourism demonstrated 
a stellar performance, with revenues in the 
sector totalling US$ 2.8 billion. The Government 
boosted capital expenditure, while the fiscal 
deficit reduced to 2.9% in 2017 under an IMF 
supported programme. 
Annual inflation came in at 6.7% in December 
2017 – above the National Bank of Georgia’s 
(NBG) target of 4.0% – as the rising world 
commodity prices and increased excise tax on 
fuels and tobacco have been putting pressure 
on prices in 2017. Notably, 3ppts of the growth 
in prices was due to excise tax-related 
increases. With overall increase in prices driven 
broadly by fuel and food prices, core inflation 
remained below the headline figures throughout 
2017 and came in at 4.7%. To curb inflationary 
expectations, the NBG increased the policy rate 
to 7.25% in 2017 from 6.5% at end of 2016.  
As the price pressures are transitory, inflation  
is expected to decline in 2018 close to the 
3.0% target once the effects of the excise tax 
increases fade.
After a weak start in 2017, the Georgian Lari 
started appreciating in mid-February, reflecting 
stronger external earnings and the pick-up in 
economic activity. The NBG intervened in the 
FX market and purchased US$ 129.8 million 
during April-August 2017 boosting international 
reserves to US$ 3.0 billion. The currency then 
started weakening against the Dollar again in 
September 2017, predominantly driven by the 
negative expectations built up over the past 
three years. The lack of fundamental reasons 
behind this depreciation, coupled with a strong 
external inflow supported the Lari to partially 
regain its value without central bank intervention 
in December 2017. 
The growth is expected to accelerate further  
in 2018 as an economic recovery in Georgia’s 
major trading partners is gaining momentum 
and the public infrastructure investments and 
growing free trade deals are boosting growth 
prospects. Notably, the 2018 budget envisages 
a further decline in the fiscal deficit despite an 
increase in capital spending. Ongoing reforms 
in various directions – pension reform, capital 
market development and business enhancing 
measures – are expected to further support 
investments, thus reinforcing the country’s 
economic potential. The IMF expects growth  
to average 4.9% annually in 2018-2022, 
making Georgia the fastest growing economy  
in the region.
WELL CAPITALISED BANKING SECTOR 
WITH LOW NON-PERFORMING LOANS 
(NPLS)
The banking sector has been one of the faster 
growing sectors of the Georgian economy.  
The banking sector’s assets growth rate of 
17.0% (ten-year CAGR) has far outstripped  
the nominal GDP growth rate for the same 
period. The banking sector is entirely privately-
owned and quite concentrated, with the two 
largest banks accounting for 70.8% of total 
assets as at the end of 2017. Amidst multiple 
downgrades by global rating agencies across 
the region in the face of the economic 
headwinds of 2015-2016, the Georgian banking 
sector has remained profitable and maintained 
its credit ratings with a stable outlook. Prudent 
regulation and conservative oversight by the 
central bank resulted in stability and resilience  
of the financial sector during different shocks  
to the economy. In 2017, the average capital 
adequacy ratio remained above 16%, the  
share of NPLs. NPLs stood at 2.8% and the 
overall liquidity ratio remained high at close  
to 40%. Pick-up in economic activity along  
with improved confidence supported the solid 
credit portfolio growth at 17.9% y-o-y in 2017. 
Although Lari depreciation spurred loan and 
deposit ratios to GDP , the penetration rates  
still remain low with the retail loans estimated  
at 29.6% of GDP and the total loans at 54.8%  
of GDP as of 2017 (and 52.1% of GDP for the 
deposits). Due to the central bank’s conservative 
regulations, liquidity and capitalisation rates in 
the banking sector have been historically high. 
Nevertheless, the sector’s profitability has 
remained robust at 21.0% return of equity  
over the past three years. 14 Annual Report 2017 BGEO Group PLC

by 40% CAGR on a GEL basis, and by 32% CAGR on a Dollar basis. If the expected demerger  
is successfully implemented as planned, it is intended that Bank of Georgia PLC (the then new 
parent company of the Banking Business), will instead, shortly after the demerger is completed, 
declare and pay a dividend in a similar aggregate amount to shareholders then on the record. In 
the event that the demerger is for any reason not completed it is intended, subject to shareholder 
approval, that the Board would implement the payment of this dividend, which would represent a 
payment of GEL 3.1 per share, payable in British Pounds Sterling at the prevailing rate, a 19.2% 
increase over the 2016 dividend

 – 115,608 shares were repurchased and cancelled for a total consideration of US$ 5.0 million 
since the commencement of the share buyback and cancellation programme
 – US$ 34.1 million capital was spent on Employee Benefit Trust buybacks

growth opportunities in the strongly growing 
Georgian economy. Both businesses are 
already leaders in their respective fields, with 
separate strategic, capital, and economic 
characteristics and strong and knowledgeable 
management teams. We expect the demerger 
to benefit the two businesses in a number of 
areas, most specifically by providing greater 
flexibility for each business to manage its own 
capital and human resources, and to pursue 
strategic options appropriate to its respective 
sector. The Board believes that the demerger 
is the best way to enable the individual 
businesses to grow faster and develop
independently over the next few years.
In February 2018, the Board approved 
the implementation of the demerger. The 
demerger is subject to shareholder approval  
at the 2018 AGM and the process is currently 
expected to complete by 30 June 2018.
For strategies of Bank of Georgia Group and 
Georgia Capital provided the demerger is 
approved, see pages 20 to 29. This annual 
report speaks for BGEO Group PLC for the  
year ended 31 December 2017 and its current 
strategy and position, and in the case of the 
demerger not being approved, the current 
strategy of the Group remains unchanged. 20 Annual Report 2017 BGEO Group PLC
ROAE
BANK OF GEORGIA STRATEGY 
OVER THE NEXT TWO TO THREE YEARS
Bank of Georgia is a leading universal Georgian bank, which is well positioned to benefit from the 
underpenetrated banking sector in Georgia through providing best in class services.
Two key metrics we use to measure Banking Business performance are: (1) Return on Average Equity (ROAE) targeted at 20%, and (2) 15%-20% 
growth of our loan book. Bank of Georgia is also well positioned in terms of both capital and liquidity to deliver on its growth strategy.
We have two segments in the Bank, of which 
Retail Banking will drive most of our Banking 
Business growth. In Retail Banking we aim  
to harness our optimised branch operating 
model to effectively serve each target segment 
of our emerging, mass and affluent clients 
based on their needs. In Corporate Investment 
Banking we have successfully achieved our risk 
de-concentration and loan portfolio repositioning 
targets and intend to resume the corporate  
loan book growth, as well as increase the share 
of fee and commission income in the medium 
term. Going forward, we expect the growth of 
the total loan book to be balanced between 
Retail Banking and Corporate Investment 
Banking. In Wealth Management, under 
Corporate Investment Banking, we will  
focus on strengthening and promoting  
our regional private banking franchise. 
The Bank is well positioned to become a 
regional finance centre, where high net-worth 
individuals are confident to deposit their funds.
The Bank’s strategic priorities are:
• In Retail Banking, to increase the mass retail 
product to client ratio from the current 1.8 to 
3.0 in the next two years
• In Express Banking, to double the number 
of transactions over the next two years
• In Solo Banking, to increase the number of 
Solo clients to 40,000 by the end of 2018 
(currently 32,104)
• In Investment Banking, to develop a 
significant regional private banking franchise 
to reach AUM of GEL 2.5 billion by the end 
of 2020 (currently GEL 1.9 billion)
In addition, over the medium to long term:
• The net interest margin is expected to 
exceed 7% (currently 7.3%)
• The Bank aims to manage a cost to income 
ratio of around 35% (currently 37.7%)
• The Bank will enhance its already prudent 
risk management practice, and will aim to 
maintain its Non-Performing Loans coverage 
ratio in the range of 80%-120% through the 
economic cycle (currently 92.7%) – with a 
normalised ratio of 100%
• Through the long-term economic cycle,  
the Bank’s cost of risk ratio is expected to 
be c.2.0% per annum (currently 2.2%)
• The Bank aims for its dividend payout ratio to 
be in the range of 25%-40%. Implementing our 
strategy successfully should improve the quality 
of ordinary dividend generation capabilities of 
Bank of Georgia and make it more sustainable 
over a long period of time. For information 
on this year’s dividend, see page 18.

Continued investment in digital penetration growth
In order to better connect with and efficiently serve the various segments 
of the retail client base, Bank of Georgia operates a multi-brand strategy.
We began implementing our Express Banking strategy in 2012 by rolling 
out small-format Express branches offering predominantly transactional 
banking services to clients through ATMs and Express Pay terminals. 
Out of the total current network of 281 retail branches, 156 have been 
transformed to Express, while a remaining 12 will follow in 2018.
Under the Bank of Georgia brand we target the mass retail segment. 
This is our flagship brand and the most significant profit contributor. By 
the end of 2017, we completed the transformation process of our Retail 
Banking operations from a product-based model into a client-centric 
model, as well as the implementation of the client-centric model in our 
branches. As a result, 86 out of 113 mass retail branches now operate 
on a client-centric service model.
In April 2015, we launched Solo – a fundamentally different approach to 
premium banking. The Bank’s Solo clients are given access to exclusive 
products and the finest concierge-style environment at our specially 
designed Solo lounges. They are provided with new lifestyle opportunities, 
such as exclusive events and handpicked lifestyle products.

Over the past decade, Retail Banking demonstrated a stellar performance by reaching 2.3 million clients, delivering on loan book growth and 
ROAE targets. While we were targeting this milestone, the Bank was product-centric with a focused client acquisition approach. Having attracted 
over two million clients, we now target growth through increasing product to client ratio.
We are actively investing in information technology solutions in order to increase digital banking penetration for our services. In 2017, we launched 
a new fully-transformed, user-friendly, multi-feature mobile banking application – mBank – which continues to gain popularity. Since its launch 
on 29 May 2017, and over the course of the following seven months, over 261,000 downloads were made by the Bank’s customers, while the 
previous application had less than 120,000 downloads since its launch. C.3.88 million online transactions were performed during the same period 
using the new application. The number of transactions have increased by c.140% since 2016. 22 Annual Report 2017 BGEO Group PLC

RETAIL BANKING – CLIENT-CENTRIC, MULTI-BRAND STRATEGY
EXPRESS – CAPTURING EMERGING RETAIL BANKING CLIENTS
Our Express Bank brand is aimed at the emerging bankable population. Express serves as a platform for bringing the currently under-banked 
population into banking and its main focus is to enable its client base to transact in a fast and easy way.
SOLO – A FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT APPROACH TO PREMIUM BANKING
The Solo brand is used to serve the emerging mass affluent segment. Our new Solo model was introduced in 2015. It is a fundamentally 
different approach to premium banking. As part of the new strategy, the Bank’s Solo clients are given access to exclusive products and the finest 
concierge-style environment at our specially designed Solo lounges, and are provided with new lifestyle opportunities, such as exclusive events 
and handpicked lifestyle products.
BANK OF GEORGIA – UNPARALLELED MASS RETAIL BANKING FRANCHISE
Under the Bank of Georgia brand, we serve mass retail clients, for whom we have successfully optimised and redesigned the operating model 
of our mass retail branches around a client-centric approach. Mass retail is the largest segment of Retail Banking, where we aim to increase the 
product to client ratio from the current 1.8 to 3.0 in the medium term.
In 2017, we installed 113 new Express Pay terminals, resulting in 2,842 total Express Pay 
terminals at the end of the year. We are leaders in Georgia in the payment systems market.
In 2017, we won a tender, organised by Tbilisi City Hall, for the modernisation of the public 
transportation payment system in Tbilisi. As a result, the Bank will continue to be the sole provider 
of payment support services to the public transport network, and operate Express branches  
in Tbilisi metro (i.e. subway) stations for the next ten years. As part of the tender mandate and  
the Bank’s own digitilisation strategy, Bank of Georgia will implement a modern digital payment 
system across public transport network in Tbilisi, including payment processing using Visa and 
MasterCard cards, and create a digital platform for ticket reservations and purchases through 
mobile applications. The Bank’s branch network presence in public transport services contributes 
c.2.1 million transactions per month.
We issued 388,567 Express cards in 2017 and had 1,258,940 Express cards outstanding at the end of the year. In 2017, the number of clients 
served and number of total transactions through Express cards increased by 48.3% and 15.2% y-o-y, respectively. We sell only a limited number  
of banking products to our Express Banking clients. Currently, 106 out of a total of 156 Express branches are located in Tbilisi.
Nowadays, Express is the major growth driver in our fee and commission income from the Retail Banking segment and a strong franchise attracting 
the unbanked population to the Bank, eventually growing them into mass retail customers.
To qualify for Solo services one needs to have an income of GEL 3,000 per month. At Solo 
lounges, clients are attended by personal bankers and, in addition to the banking products, 
are offered luxury goods at cost and other lifestyle offers including a travel magazine and 
entertainment. In 2017, Solo organised concerts with world famous artists. Such events are 
limited to Solo clients and create additional interest in the Solo franchise. Profit per Solo client 
reached GEL 1,704 in 2017, over 24 times what we have in the mass retail segment under the 
Bank of Georgia brand. Solo’s gross loan book and deposit portfolio demonstrated impressive 
growth of 44.7% and 37.4% y-o-y.
We are well on track to achieve our target of 40,000 Solo customers by the end of 2018, from  
the current 32,104. The share of new customers acquired in 2017 accounted for 43.8% of the 
total of Solo clients at the end of the year, which clearly demonstrates the growing popularity of 
the franchise in our domestic market.
In 2017, we launched Solo Club, a membership group within Solo, which offers exclusive access to Solo’s products and offers ahead of other Solo 
clients at a higher fee. This includes American Express Platinum cards, which were also launched in 2017 and are available to Solo Club members 
only. At 31 December 2017, Solo Club had 1,882 members.
Solo is actively diversifying the range of its lifestyle offerings in travel, entertainment, education and well-being to make the franchise even more 
distinguishable and enjoyable.
In 2017, we accelerated proactive interactions with our clients by advising and offering them 
the financial products and solutions that best serve their individual needs. We continue to 
see strong growth in sales volumes and the number of products sold to our clients in transformed 
branches, contributing to 29.3% y-o-y growth in the retail loan book. The number of products sold 
to mass retail customers has increased by 163.0%, compared to the sales before transformation 
of the retail segment.
In order to unlock the full potential of current customers and boost a product to client ratio, we 
launched a new loyalty programme called “Plus+” in 2017. The programme is part of the mass 
retail customer-centric approach and offers the customers different status levels and reward 
points. They accumulate based on their business with the Bank and can redeem points with 
partner companies’ products and/or services. At 31 December 2017, the number of upgraded 
members reached 159,781 and active Plus+ cards outstanding were 250,307, while the total 
number of members grew to 586,870.

GEORGIA CAPITAL STRATEGY
GEORGIA CAPITAL’S KEY PRINCIPLES AROUND INVESTING AND MANAGING COMPANIES
KEY TO SUCCESS – ALIGNED SHAREHOLDER 
AND MANAGEMENT INTERESTS
GEORGIA CAPITAL THREE PILLAR STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK
• Cash preservation is a key target for Georgia Capital and therefore two thirds of total operating expenses are related to share-based compensation
• Georgia Capital’s senior management’s compensation will be paid in long-vested shares only, with no cash component
• Portfolio company management will be paid in proxy shares of their respective companies
PRIVATE EQUITY
n/a
Georgia Capital is a Georgia-focused, well diversified investment company targeting minimum IRR of 25% 
from its investments.
Georgia Capital seeks to capture growth opportunities in the sectors in which it currently operates and drive the development of new structurally 
attractive, high-growth businesses in Georgia, which it intends to add either by acquiring businesses in their early development stage or by 
establishing greenfield businesses, often consolidating fragmented or underdeveloped markets. Georgia Capital actively manages its portfolio 
companies to maturity, setting the strategy and business plan of each business and driving its execution. In order to unlock the value of the 
companies in which it invests and which it manages, Georgia Capital sets an exit strategy prior to making an investment.
STRONG CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
• Outstanding track record in:
 – Institutionalising businesses, creating independently run/
managed institutions
 – investor reporting transparency and granularity
• Aligned shareholder and management interests
 – Management compensation linked to performance
 – Equity/performance dominating compensation structure
• Top class Board and governance
1. INVESTMENT & CAPITAL MANAGEMENT
• Highly disciplined investing approach.  
The Georgian economy entered into a 
period of significant development and 
growth approximately ten years ago and 
different sectors and businesses are at an 
early stage of formation. Access to capital 
and management personnel is limited, 
owners of businesses are cash poor and,  
as a result, Georgia Capital can pursue 
attractive investment opportunities and 
acquire assets on relatively attractive terms 
with a view to consolidating fragmented  
and underdeveloped markets. Because  
the company is under no time pressure to 
invest, it takes a selective and opportunistic 
approach to new investments. Georgia 
Capital’s capital return policy is a natural 
self-discipline mechanism for its capital 
allocation decisions
• 360
o
 analysis when evaluating capital returns, 
new investment opportunities or divestments. 
Georgia Capital does not have capital 
commitments or a primary mandate to 
deploy funds or divest assets within a 
specific time-frame. As such, it can focus 
on shareholder returns and on opportunities 
which meet its investment return and growth 
criteria. The company targets a minimum IRR 
of 25% for its existing and new businesses, 
to buy back and cancel its shares and/or pay 
special dividends linked to exits from its 
existing businesses and new investments
2. MANAGING PORTFOLIO COMPANIES
Georgia Capital sets the strategy and business 
plan of each business it acquires or establishes 
and then actively manages their implementation, 
particularly at early stages of development.  
As the availability of management personnel  
is limited, by developing top talent in Georgia  
the company can add value for the company’s 
shareholders. Investing time in growing and 
developing management continues to be critical 
for the success of the company’s strategy. 
Georgia Capital will apply a hands-on 
management approach to the non-public 
portfolio companies at early stages of their 
development and acts as an advisor for the 
management of more mature companies.  
In the publicly listed companies, Georgia Capital 
will be represented on the Board at least until its 
ownership stake falls below 25%.
3. EXIT
As a business matures, Georgia Capital will 
normally seek to monetise its investment, 
including through initial public offering, strategic 
sale or other appropriate exit, typically within five 
to ten years from acquisition. As investments 
are monetised, Georgia Capital plans either to 
redeploy the proceeds to capture opportunities 
for growth in new sectors or in the company’s 
existing businesses, or return proceeds to 
shareholders in accordance with its capital 
return policy.
ACCESS TO MANAGEMENT
• Reputation among talented managers as the “best group to work for”
• Attracted talent have demonstrated track record of successful delivery
• Proven DNA in turning around the companies and growing them 
efficiently
• Strong skillset in company exits
 – LSE IPO track record
 – Divestiture skills
SUPERIOR ACCESS TO CAPITAL
• Only investment company in Georgia
• Uniquely positioned given the access to capital in a small frontier 
economy, where access to capital is limited:
 – c.US$ 500 million raised in equity at LSE
 – Issued four Eurobonds totalling US$ 1.2 billion
 – US$ 3 billion+ raised from IFIs (EBRD, IFC, etc.)
• Flexibility to use own shares as acquisition currency

GGU – NATURAL MONOPOLY IN THE WATER 
BUSINESS, WITH UPSIDE IN ELECTRICITY 
GENERATION AND SALES
GGU has a significant opportunity to increase its operational cash flow over the next few years from a combination of improving cash collection 
rates, growing cost efficiencies from cutting technical and commercial water loss rates, and reducing energy consumption internally to preserve 
the supply available for sale to third parties, while also planning the construction of hydro, wind and solar power generation plants.
GGU is an established business with two 
business lines – water utility and electric power 
generation. In its water utility business, GGU 
has a natural monopoly that supplies water 
and provides a wastewater service to 1.4 
million people (more than one-third of Georgia’s 
population) in three cities: Tbilisi, Mtskheta 
and Rustavi. GGU is self-sufficient in its 
power usage for water transportation and 
invests in additional capacity for electricity 
generation with the goal to establish a 
renewable energy platform.
GGU has been investing heavily in its 
infrastructure, thereby replacing the depreciated 
asset base over time and achieving continuous 
growth in the Regulatory Asset Base (RAB). 
GGU plans to invest at least GEL 200 million 
over the next three years in the upgrade of 
existing and the development of substantial  
new water utility infrastructure. GGU’s 
Investment in infrastructure is expected to 
significantly improve the rendering of water 
supply and wastewater services to customers 
and achieve cost efficiencies through reduced 
water losses. In 2017, GGU’s regulatory body 
approved increased tariffs for water supply  
and wastewater services based on a new 
methodology, which is in line with international 
best practices. New tariffs provide fair return  
on investment, as well as compensating for 
eligible operating expenses.
In 2017, GGU commenced construction 
of a 50MW HPP in North-Western Georgia 
(Svaneti region) with a target to have the HPP 
operational in December 2018. Construction 
of 2.5MW Bodorna HPP also started in 2017, 
which is expected to become fully operational 
from September 2018. Moreover, 44.3MW  
Zoti HPP in Western Georgia (Guria region)  
is currently under development with a target  
to complete the construction of this plant  
by the end of 2020. c.100MW wind projects 
are currently at the feasibility stage and once 
complete, GGU expects to commence 
construction works.
The key elements of GGU’s business strategy 
are outlined below:
• Reducing water loss rates and 
increasing energy efficiency. GGU  
aims to achieve efficiencies in operating  
and maintaining its network by heavily 
investing in the refurbishment of its existing 
and the development of new infrastructure.  
As a result, GGU plans to substantially 
reduce technical and commercial water 
losses in the medium term, thereby reducing 
water and energy consumed internally.  
Asa result of achieving efficiencies in its  
own energy consumption, GGU expects  
to free up electricity for third-party sales. 
GGU intends to achieve additional cost 
efficiencies through reduced maintenance 
costs for existing water infrastructure, 
which management expects to result in 
increased profitability
• Establishing a renewable energy 
platform. GGU plans to establish a 
renewable energy platform by developing 
hydro, wind and solar power plants. 
Currently, GGU owns and operates 
149.3MW installed capacity, has c.100MW 
HPPs at a construction stage and c.100MW 
wind projects at feasibility stage. Additionally, 
GGU is constantly identifying new renewable 
projects that it aims to develop in the 
medium term
• Preparing for IPO in the medium term. 
As part of preparing for a potential IPO, 
GGU aims to achieve EBITDA of more than 
GEL 115 million in 2019. GGU plans to use 
IPO proceeds to fund new development 
initiatives, including renewable energy 
projects
GGU has been successfully growing EBITDA 
and reaching its targets for several years in  
a row and the company is well on track to 
further increase it to more than GEL 115 million 
in 2019 by increasing its renewable energy 
portfolio and tapping into additional efficiencies 
in the water business. Strong and stable cash 
flow generation is expected to enable GGU to 
sponsor steadily increasing dividend payouts  
to shareholders and to prepare the combined 
utility and renewable energy business for an 
IPO in approximately two to three years.

The current low level of insurance market 
penetration in Georgia (1.2%, of which 0.6% 
relates to P&C insurance and 0.6% to medical 
insurance) provides enormous potential of 
growth and Aldagi is well equipped to capture 
these opportunities.
Aldagi aims to triple its current net profit and 
become a GEL 50 million net profit company 
by 2022. The company plans to achieve this 
by strategically focusing on each of its three 
main business lines set out below:
Retail customers. The Georgian retail 
insurance market offers ample room for growth, 
as most of its potential is yet to be unlocked.
Motor insurance accounts for 50% of the total 
retail insurance market in Georgia, of which 
Aldagi’s share is 42%. The motor insurance 
segment has great potential to increase, as only 
4% of registered cars are insured on the local 
market. Moreover, compulsory Border Motor 
Third Party Liability (MTPL) insurance will be 
effective from March 2018, and Aldagi expects 
it to increase the size of the existing P&C 
market by approximately GEL 30-50 million 
(15-25% of the existing P&C insurance market). 
Furthermore, a new law requiring a mandatory 
local MTPL for all vehicles registered in Georgia 
is expected to launch in 2019 and significantly 
boost retail market penetration.
In 2017, Aldagi actively worked on developing 
new products and introduced livestock 
insurance to underpenetrated rural areas. 
The company came up with an online travel 
insurance product, with a unique combination 
of coverage and competitive pricing. Aldagi 
partnered with Public Service Hall, whose 
clients can electronically acquire affordable 
insurance for any property registered on the 
public registry.
Aldagi aims to further strengthen its market 
leadership position by harnessing its digital 
insurance platform over the next five years. 
The company intends to execute all of its 
processes and procedures, including issuance 
of e-policies, remote claims regulation and 
building web/mobile customer profiles, 
principally through digital channels. Aldagi 
plans to increase the percentage of retail sales 
conducted online to approximately 20% of total 
retail sales, and the percentage of motor claims 
processed online to 25% of total motor claims.
The company actively diversifies its distribution 
channels by forming partnerships with financial 
institutions. Extended cooperations with leading 
financial institutions in Georgia will enable 
Aldagi to uncover additional sources of high 
quality deals for its leading insurance products 
and continue to successfully diversify its 
multi-channel distribution network.
SME segment. Georgia’s insurance market  
for small and medium sized enterprises is 
currently in its infancy. Aldagi’s strategy is  
to focus the attention of its experienced  
retail sales force (in addition to the corporate 
sales department) towards entering this 
underpenetrated segment. Aldagi sees 
significant potential to grow this segment  
of the portfolio by developing tailor-made 
products and providing them through digital 
portals, created especially for SME clients,  
and its multi-channel distribution network.
Large corporates. Although the level of 
insurance penetration within the corporate 
segment is relatively high compared to  
retail and SME segments, a combination 
of favourable Georgian macroeconomic 
conditions, a good investment climate, 
stable economic growth and an increase in 
infrastructure projects will further increase 
customer demand for insurance products.
ALDAGI – UNDISPUTED LEADER IN GEORGIA’S 
FAST-DEVELOPING P&C INSURANCE MARKET
Over nearly three decades in the Georgian P&C insurance market, Aldagi has achieved almost universal brand awareness, leading positions in retail 
insurance services, the largest product portfolio and exceptional financial strength. The company has doubled its retail portfolio over the last three 
years, outperformed market growth by 5% and achieved a ROAE of 38.5%. Based on the latest available market data as at 30 September 2017, 
Aldagi continues to be the most profitable insurance company in the local market with 89.4% share of the insurance industry profit and a market 
share of 38.6% based on gross premiums earned.
TARGETS AND PRIORITIES FOR THREE BUSINESS DIRECTIONS
• No mandatory lines, border and 
local MTPL, also GTPL mandatory 
insurance to be introduced
• Develop simple products for  
mass retail
• Digitilisation of all processes
• More partnership with financial 
institutions after demerger
• Underpenetrated market
• Developing tailored products
• Digital portal for SME
• Good investment climate
• Stable economic growth
• Increase in infrastructural projects

TELIANI – CREATING A LEADING BEVERAGE
PRODUCER AND DISTRIBUTOR IN SOUTH 
CAUCASUS
Teliani Valley aims to become a leading beverage producer and the biggest distribution company not only in Georgia, but in South Caucasus.  
The company is well equipped to leverage its strong existing production and excellent sales and distribution franchise.
LOCAL MAINSTREAM BEER PRODUCTION LAUNCHED IN 2017
Teliani Valley is an established leading beverage 
producer and distributor in Georgia with three 
major business lines: wine production, beer 
production, and distribution of its own and 
third-party brands in Georgia.
The company is a leading wine producer in 
Georgia, selling around 3.5 million bottles of 
wine in 14 countries globally per annum, with 
about 68%* of its revenue coming from exports. 
Teliani intends to not only retain its leading 
position on the local wine market, but also to 
become a top exporter by 2019. Teliani aims to 
grow its domestic and international wine sales 
by benefiting from favourable market trends  
in Georgia and expanding exports through  
new sales channels in high-growth countries, 
including China.
Teliani has an established distribution franchise, 
which has contracts with a number of 
international beverage brands. Teliani plans to 
diversify the products in its distribution portfolio 
and eventually become the largest third-party 
distribution company.
Teliani’s strong production and distribution 
franchise led the company to establish a 
partnership with Heineken. Teliani will produce 
Heineken brands in Georgia under a ten-year 
exclusive license agreement and sell them in 
the countries of the South Caucasus region 
(population of c.17 million). Teliani is well on 
track to brew Heineken and Krušovice Beers 
in its brand new brewery in 2018.
In line with its strategy to diversify its distribution 
portfolio, Teliani obtained exclusive rights
to import and distribute Lavazza coffee in 
Georgia, and won other non-alcoholic beverage 
distribution contracts in 2017.
In 2017, Teliani launched production of a 
lemonade and local mainstream beer. The 
newly launched beer “ICY” was well received  
by the local market, which immediately earned 
97% brand awareness and 16% market share 
upon launch. Both products are planned to be 
exported to CIS countries.
Of the US$ 49.3 million investment in the beer 
project, US$ 29.5 million is equity, of which 
US$ 23.3 million is BGEO’s share. Teliani 
expects EBITDA to grow to c.US$ 5.5 million  
in 2020, up from the current US$ 0.6 million, 
with growth primarily driven by the expansion 
into the beer segment.

Record results driven by strong performance across all businesses.
The Group’s KPIs for 2017 reflect a continuing strong performance in each of the Group’s Banking and Investment Businesses, demonstrating 
excellent customer lending growth with stable margins, a strong balance sheet and strong profitability, together with substantial further progress 
in the Group’s Investment Businesses.
PROFITABILITY KPIs
Diversified revenue sources, a growing loan 
book, improved asset quality and efficient  
cost performance were the main drivers of  
the exceptional results in terms of profitability.
The resilience of Net Interest Margin (NIM) is  
a function of our distribution capabilities and 
pricing power. The substantial growth of the 
loan book, as well as shift to GEL-denominated 
loan portfolio, and stable cost of funds during 
2017 enabled our NIM to withstand downward 
pressures from increased competition on the 
market. The resulting outstanding growth in 
interest and non-interest income, strong margins 
and well controlled asset quality and costs 
translated into 25.0% growth in profit.
In 2018 and beyond, we will continue to focus 
on profitable earnings growth, to be driven by 
sustainable levels of customer lending growth 
without compromising asset quality, to increase 
the share of income from fee-generating 
operations and to enhance cost efficiencies.
For more information on our financial results, 
see pages 52 to 75.
*  In 2017, we changed the Group’s accounting policy in relation to subsequent measurement of office buildings and service 
centres from revaluation model to cost model. We have accordingly restated the balance sheet accounts for affected 
periods, while the change did not have any material impact on the income statement. In addition, we started presenting 
Aldagi as part of the Investment Business since 2Q17. Therefore, Banking Business balance sheet and income statement 
accounts, and the ratios, have been updated accordingly for prior periods presented to reflect these changes. 31 Annual Report 2017 BGEO Group PLC

Leverage is calculated as total liabilities divided by 
total equity.
EFFICIENCY KPIs
In 2017 operating expenses broadly kept pace 
with revenue growth, reflecting organic growth 
of our Retail Banking business and increase in 
administrative expenses. Express Banking, a 
technology-intensive remote banking channel, 
is the main driver of efficiency for our Banking 
Business. Other measures, such as various 
investments in IT aimed at optimising of 
workflow processes and cost centre reporting 
procedures, represent the cost control 
measures we continue to deploy across the 
board in order to keep a tight grip on costs.
CAPITAL KPIs
In 2017, our Tier I Capital Adequacy ratio 
(NBG, Basel II) stood at 10.3%. The risk 
weighted assets increased by 13.5%, reflecting 
the increase in interest earning assets during 
the year. Tier I Capital Adequacy ratio (NBG 
Basel III) stood at 12.4% at 31 December 2017, 
above the minimum 9.9% requirement.
GROWTH KPIs
The 15.9% loan book growth was driven by 
our Retail Banking business, which posted 
a 29.3% growth in the loan book in 2017.  
The Corporate Investment Banking loan book 
decreased by 5.6% in 2017, which marked 
the end of successful risk de-concentration 
and loan portfolio repositioning. CIB resumed 
its growth in the fourth quarter of 2017 and 
q-o-q growth on constant currency basis 
reached 9.2%. Going forward, we will be 
targeting growth of 15-20% in the Banking 
Business loan book.
ASSET QUALITY KPIs
Our asset quality improved in 2017, 
as a result of our prudent application of the 
Group’s risk management policies. Cost of  
risk decreased from 2.7% in 2016 to 2.2%  
in 2017. NPLs to gross loans improved from 
4.2% as at 31 December 2016 to 3.8% at the 
end of 2017. NPL coverage ratio increased in 
2017 to 92.7%. 32 Annual Report 2017 BGEO Group PLC
BGEO RISK MANAGEMENT
We identify, evaluate, manage and monitor the risks that we face through an integrated control framework supported by formal policies and procedures, 
clearly delegated authority levels and comprehensive reporting. The Board confirms that our framework has been in place throughout the year under 
review and to the date of approval of this Annual Report and is integrated into both our business planning and viability assessment processes.
OVERVIEW
Our Board, supported by our Audit and Risk 
Committees and executive management,  
is ultimately responsible for the Group’s risk 
management and internal controls.
We believe that in order to have an effective risk 
management framework there needs to be a 
strong risk management culture within the Group. 
We have worked to ensure that managing risk  
is ingrained in our everyday business activities. 
We seek to create an environment where there  
is openness and transparency in how we make 
decisions and manage risks and where business 
managers are accountable for the risk 
management and internal control processes 
associated with their activities. Our culture also 
seeks to ensure that risk management is 
responsive, forward-looking and consistent.
OUR FRAMEWORK
The Board’s mandate includes determining the 
Group’s risk appetite and risk tolerance as well 
as monitoring risk exposures to ensure that the 
nature and extent of the main risks we face are 
consistent with our overall goals and strategic 
objectives. The Board is accountable for 
reviewing the effectiveness of the systems and 
processes of risk management and internal 
control, with the Audit and Risk Committees 
assisting in the discharge of this responsibility.
At the Board, Committee and executive 
management levels, we develop formal  
policies and procedures which explain the  
way in which risks need to be systematically 
identified, assessed, quantified, managed and 
monitored. Each business participates in the 
risk management process by identifying the key 
risks applicable to its business. The principal 
risks and uncertainties faced by the Group  
are identified through this process.
On a day-to-day basis, management is 
responsible for the implementation of the 
Group’s risk management and other internal 
control policies and procedures. Based on  
our risk culture, managers “own” the risks 
relevant to their respective function. For each 
risk identified at any level of the business,  
the risk is measured, mitigated (if possible) in 
accordance with our policies and procedures 
and monitored. Managers are required to report 
on identified risks and responses to such risks 
on a consistent and frequent basis. Executive 
and senior management regularly review  
the output from the bottom-up process by 
providing independent challenge and assessing 
the implementation of the risk management  
and internal control policies and procedures.
Our reporting process enables key risks to be 
escalated to the appropriate level of authority 
and provides assurance to the Committees 
and the Board. Key developments affecting 
our principal risks and associated mitigating 
actions are reviewed quarterly (or more often 
if necessary on an ad hoc basis, outside of the
regular reporting process) by the Audit and Risk 
Committees, as appropriate, and the Board.
The principal risks and uncertainties faced by the 
Group are identified through the above processes.
A description of these principal risks and 
uncertainties, including to recent trends and 
outlook, as well as mitigation efforts, can be 
found on pages 34 to 37 of the Strategic Report.
Since the Bank is the Group’s largest business 
and operates in the complex financial services 
sector, its risk management and internal control 
framework is key to that of the Group.
A description of the Bank’s risk management 
and internal control framework can be found 
on pages 38 to 43 of the Strategic Report.
INTERNAL CONTROL
As mentioned above, our Board is responsible 
for reviewing and approving the Group’s system 
of internal control and its adequacy and 
effectiveness. Controls are reviewed to ensure 
effective management of strategic, financial, 
operational and compliance, among other risks 
we face. Certain matters, such as the approval 
of major capital expenditure, significant 
acquisitions or disposals and major contracts, 
among others, are reserved exclusively for the 
Board. The full schedule of matters specifically 
reserved for the Board can be found on our 
website, at http://bgeo.com/page/id/67/
schedule-of-matters-reserved-for-the-board. 
With respect to other matters, the Board is often 
assisted by both the Audit and Risk Committees.
With respect to internal control over financial 
reporting, including over the Group’s 
consolidation process, our financial procedures 
include a range of system, transactional and 
management oversight controls. Our businesses 
prepare detailed monthly management reports 
that include analyses of their results along with 
comparisons, relevant strategic plans, budgets, 
forecasts and prior results. These are presented 
to and reviewed by executive management. 
Each quarter, the CFO of the Bank and the 
Group and other members of the finance team 
discuss financial reporting and associated 
internal controls with the Audit Committee, 
which reports significant findings to the Board. 
The Audit Committee also reviews the quarterly, 
half-year and full-year financial statements and 
corresponding press releases and provides 
feedback to the Board. The external and internal 
auditors attend each Audit Committee meeting 
and the Audit Committee meets regularly both 
with and without management present.
Our Audit and Risk Committees monitor internal 
control over operating and compliance risk 
through discussions with the Deputy CEO,  
Chief Risk Officer and the Head of AML and 
Compliance and other executive management  
on a quarterly basis. Any key issues identified are 
escalated to the Board. The Board also receives
regular presentations directly from the head of 
each risk unit. Important risk and internal control 
issues are addressed in such presentations.
The Group’s internal audit function reviews 
a number of areas of risk pursuant to a 
programme approved by the Audit Committee. 
Any significant issues or risks arising from  
an internal audit review are reported to the  
Audit Committee and appropriate actions are 
undertaken to ensure satisfactory resolution. 
The Head of Internal Audit has a direct reporting 
line to the Chairman of the Audit Committee.
Our systems of internal control are also 
supported by our Whistleblowing Policy,  
which allows employees to report concerns  
on an anonymous basis. The Audit Committee 
approves the Whistleblowing Policy on an annual 
basis and receives reports from the Head of AML 
and Compliance on any significant issues raised.
EFFECTIVENESS REVIEW
Each year, we review the effectiveness of 
our risk management processes and internal 
control systems, with the assistance of the 
Audit and Risk Committees. This review  
covers all material systems, including financial, 
operational and compliance controls. The  
latest review covered the financial year to 
31 December 2017 and the period from 
year-end to the approval of this Annual Report.
We obtained assurance from management  
and Internal Audit.
The Board is able to conclude with reasonable 
assurance that the appropriate internal controls 
and risk management systems were maintained 
and operated effectively throughout 2017 and 
the period from year-end to the approval of  
this Annual Report. The review did not identify 
any significant weaknesses or failings in  
the systems. We are satisfied that our risk 
management processes and internal control 
systems processes comply with the UK 
Corporate Governance Code 2016 (the Code) 
and the Financial Reporting Council (FRC)’s 
guidance on Risk Management, Internal Control 
and Related Financial and Business Reporting.
Although we did not identify any significant 
weaknesses or failings, we continuously strive 
to improve our framework and focus on further 
mitigating our key risks, especially as they 
evolve. We will also provide online training 
focused on the importance of risk management 
and internal controls.
COMMITTEE REPORTS
As noted throughout this discussion, both the 
Audit and Risk Committees play an essential 
role in implementing effective risk management 
and internal control. Each Committee has 
described this work in its Committee report.
The Audit Committee Report and Risk Committee 
Report can be found on pages 91 to 94 and 
pages 95 to 96, respectively.

Information
In accordance with the Corporate Governance Code, the Directors are required to assess the prospects of the Company to meet its liabilities  
by taking into account its current position and principal risks. The viability review was conducted in respect of the Group in case the demerger is 
not approved by AGM, as well as its underlying businesses post demerger. The Board performed this review over a three-year period beginning 
1 January 2018, being the first day after the end of the financial year to which this report relates. In determining the appropriate period over which 
to make their assessment, the Directors considered the duration of strategic plans and financial forecasts, which are usually set and prepared  
for the three year period, the diverse nature of the Group’s activities, the evolving nature of the regulatory environment in which the Group’s 
businesses operate, demerger of the Group, as well as recent trends relating to Lari volatility. A period of three years beyond the balance sheet 
date was therefore considered the most appropriate viability period for the Company.
In order to consider the Group’s viability, the Board considered a number of key factors, including:
• the Group’s financial and operational position, including capital allocation and other key financial ratios;
• the Board’s risk appetite;
• the Group’s business model and strategy as set out on pages 14 to 29;
• the Group’s principal risks and uncertainties, principally those related to adverse economic conditions, the depreciation of the Lari, IT and/or 
information security (including cyber-security) control failures, Investment Business strategy, demerger risk and how these risks and 
uncertainties are managed, as set out on pages 34 to 37;
• the effectiveness of our risk management framework and internal control processes; and
• stress testing, as described below.
The key factors above have been reviewed in the context of our current position and strategic plan, financial budgets and forecasts assessed 
annually and on a three-year basis.
The viability assessment involved a risk identification process which included recognition of the principal risks to viability (risks that could impair 
the Group’s business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity), excluding risks not sufficiently severe over the period of assessment for 
consolidated BGEO Group PLC, including Banking and Investment Businesses. Principal risks and uncertainties identified by the Group are 
currency volatility, global and regional economic instability, market competition and interest rate volatility. We also identified other risks which, 
while not necessarily severe in themselves, could escalate when combined with others. For each risk, we considered our risk appetite and 
tolerance, as well as risk proximity and momentum.
For those risks considered sufficiently severe to affect our viability, we performed stress testing for the assessment period, which involved 
modelling the impact of a combination of severe and plausible adverse scenarios. The Group has examined following stress scenarios over  
the assessment period: GEL depreciation against US Dollar, market competition driven shrinkage of net interest margin, increase in operating 
expenses resulting in higher Banking Business cost to income ratio, impairment of loan portfolio quality, possible underperformance of Investment 
Business entities. The stress test scenarios were then reviewed against the Group’s and its businesses’ current and projected liquidity position 
(considering current committed funding), capital adequacy and solvency. The stress testing also took into account the availability and likely 
effectiveness of the mitigating actions, such as decline in lending activity, reduction of operating expenses, as well as the assumption that the 
Group will be able to prolong or refinance existing borrowings, or increase the financing from DFIs, at the terms similar to existing ones, that could 
be taken to avoid or reduce the impact or occurrence of the identified underlying risks to which the Group and its businesses are exposed.
The Directors have also satisfied themselves that they have the evidence necessary to support the statement below in terms of the effectiveness 
of the Group’s risk management framework and internal control processes in place to mitigate risk. Based on the analysis described above,  
the Directors confirm that they have a reasonable expectation that the Group and its businesses will be able to continue operation and meet its 
liabilities as they fall due over the three-year period from 1 January 2018 to 31 December 2020.
If the demerger is implemented successfully then the new Boards of the demerged businesses will make their own viability statement in their 
respective annual reports next year and the Group, as it is currently comprised, will cease to exist.
VIABILITY STATEMENT
GOING CONCERN STATEMENT
The Group’s business activities, objectives and strategy, principal risks and uncertainties in achieving its objectives and performance are set out 
on pages 14 to 75. After making enquiries, the Directors confirm that they have a reasonable expectation that BGEO and the Group, as a whole, 
have adequate resources to continue in operational existence and therefore, the Directors consider it appropriate to adopt the going concern 
basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements. 34 Annual Report 2017 BGEO Group PLC
PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES
IDENTIFYING, PRIORITISING AND MANAGING OUR RISKS TO SUPPORT OUR GOALS AND STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES
We outline the principal risks and uncertainties that may have an impact on our strategic objectives, business model, operations, future 
performance, solvency and liquidity. These principal risks are described in the table that follows, together with the relevant strategic business 
objectives, key drivers/trends, material controls which have been put in place to mitigate the risks and the mitigation actions we have taken. It is 
recognised that the Group is exposed to risks wider than those listed. We disclose those which we believe are likely to have had the greatest 
impact on our business at this moment in time and which have been discussed in depth at recent Board, Audit or Risk Committee meetings.
The order in which the Principal Risks and Uncertainties appear does not denote their order of priority. It is not possible to fully mitigate all of our 
risks. Any system of risk management and internal control is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business 
objectives and can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
CURRENCY AND MACROECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT
PRINCIPAL RISK/
UNCERTAINTY
Macroeconomic factors relating to Georgia, including depreciation of the Lari against the Dollar, may have  
a material impact on our loan book.
KEY DRIVERS/
TRENDS
The Group’s operations are primarily located, and most of its revenue is sourced from, Georgia. Macroeconomic  
factors relating to Georgia, such as GDP , inflation and interest rates, may have a material impact on the quality of our  
loan portfolio, loan losses, our margins and customer demand for our products and services. Real GDP growth in Georgia 
increased to 4.8% in 2017, compared to 2.8% in 2016 and 2.9% in 2015, according to Geostat. Uncertain and volatile 
global economic conditions could have substantial political and macroeconomic ramifications globally which in turn could 
impact the Georgian economy.
In 2017, the Lari appreciated against the Dollar by 2.1%. The volatility of Lari against Dollar has affected, and may continue to 
adversely affect, the quality of our loan portfolio, as well as increase the cost of credit risk and impairment provisions. This is 
because our corporate, MSME and mortgage loan books are largely Dollar-denominated and the majority of our customers’ 
income is Lari-denominated. The creditworthiness of our customers may be adversely affected by the depreciation of the Lari 
against the Dollar, which could result in them having difficulty repaying their loans. The depreciation of Lari may also adversely 
affect the value of our customers’ collateral.
As at 31 December 2017, in the Banking Business, approximately 83% and 49% of our corporate investment banking  
and retail loans respectively were denominated in foreign currency (predominantly Dollars), while Dollar income revenue 
loans covered 9.5% of retail gross loans and 43.1% of corporate investment banking gross loans. In 2017, our Banking 
Business cost of credit risk was at 2.2% compared to 2.7% in 2016.
MITIGATION The Group continually monitors market conditions and reviews market changes, and also performs stress and scenario 
testing to test its position under adverse economic conditions, including adverse currency movements.
The Asset and Liability Management Committee sets our open currency position limits and the Bank’s proprietary trading 
position limits, which are currently more conservative than those imposed by the National Bank of Georgia (NBG), our 
regulator. The Treasury department manages our open currency position on a day-to-day basis. The open currency 
position is also monitored by the Quantitative Risk Management and Risk Analytics department.
In order to assess the creditworthiness of our customers, we take into account currency volatility when there is a currency 
mismatch between the customer’s loan and revenue. We allocate 75% additional capital to the foreign currency loans of 
clients whose source of income is denominated in Lari.
Our Credit Committees and Credit Risk Management department set counterparty limits by using a credit risk classification 
and scoring system for approving individual transactions. The credit quality review process is continuous and provides 
early identification of possible changes in the creditworthiness of customers, including regular collateral revaluations, 
potential losses and corrective actions needed to reduce risk, which may include obtaining additional collateral in 
accordance with underlying loan agreements.
Since the beginning of 2016, we have focused on increasing local currency lending. We actively work with IFIs to raise 
long-term Lari funding to increase our Lari-denominated loans to customers. Furthermore, in June 2017, we completed 
the inaugural local currency denominated international bond issuance in the amount of GEL 500 million to support local 
currency lending.
Applicable from the beginning of 2017, the NBG expanded the list of assets that banks are permitted to use as collateral 
for REPO transactions, which provides an additional funding source for our Lari-denominated loan book.
As a result, as of 31 December 2017, in the Banking Business, our Lari-denominated loan book increased by 54.6%, while 
our foreign currency-denominated loan book increased by 0.2% in constant currency terms. The trend was supported by the 
Georgian Government’s “de-dollarisation” initiatives: a) a one-off programme, effective from 15 January 2017 until 25 March 
2017, allowing qualified borrowers to convert eligible Dollar-denominated loans into Lari, at a discount compensated by the 
Government, at the client’s election and b) a new regulation, effective from 15 January 2017, restricting issuance of new loans 
in foreign currency with amounts less than GEL 100,000 (equivalent).  35 Annual Report 2017 BGEO Group PLC

REGIONAL INSTABILITY
PRINCIPAL RISK/
UNCERTAINTY
The Georgian economy and our business may be adversely affected by regional tensions and instability.
The Group’s operations are primarily located, and most of its revenue is sourced from, Georgia. The Georgian economy is 
dependent on economies of the region, in particular Russia, Turkey, Azerbaijan and Armenia who are key trading partners.
There has been ongoing geopolitical tension, political instability, economic instability and military conflict in the region, 
which may have an adverse effect on our business and financial position.
KEY DRIVERS/
TRENDS
Russian troops continue to occupy the Abkhazia and the Tskhinvali/South Ossetia regions and tensions between Russia 
and Georgia persist. Russia is opposed to the eastward enlargement of NATO, potentially, including former Soviet 
republics such as Georgia. The introduction of a preferential trade regime between Georgia and the EU in July 2016 and 
the European Parliament’s approval of a proposal on visa liberalisation for Georgia in February 2017, may intensify tensions 
between countries. The Government has taken certain steps towards improving relations with Russia, but, as of the date 
of this Annual Report, these have not resulted in any formal or legal changes in the relationship between the two countries.
Relations between Russia and Turkey remain uncertain, as despite Russia repealing sanctions on Turkey in March 2017, 
certain sanctions and legal limitations on Turkish nationals remain. In April 2017, amendments to the Turkish constitution 
were approved by voters in a referendum. The amendments which grant the president wider powers are expected to 
transform Turkey’s system of government away from a parliamentary system. These amendments could have a negative 
impact on political stability in Turkey, which is already tense after a failed coup against the president in July 2016.
Conflict remains unabated between Azerbaijan and Armenia.
MITIGATION The Group actively monitors regional and local market conditions and risks related to political instability, and performs 
stress and scenario tests in order to assess our financial position. Responsive strategies and action plans are also 
developed.
Despite tensions in the breakaway territories, Russia has continued to open its export market to Georgian exports since 
2013. While lower global commodity prices and macroeconomic factors have affected Georgia’s regional trading partners, 
leading to lower exports within the region, Georgia has benefited from increased exports earnings from non-traditional 
markets such as Switzerland, China, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, South Korea and Singapore.
In April 2017, the IMF approved a new three-year US$ 285 million economic programme, aimed at preserving 
macroeconomic and financial stability and addressing structural weaknesses in the Georgian economy to support  
higher and inclusive growth. During 2017, Georgia delivered real GDP growth of 4.8% from 2.8% in 2016. 
REGULATORY RISK
PRINCIPAL RISK/
UNCERTAINTY
The Group operates across a wide range of industries, principally banking, but also healthcare services, 
pharmacy, insurance, real estate, water and energy utility, hydro power, wine and beverages.
Many of these industries are highly regulated.
The regulatory environment continues to evolve. We, however, cannot predict what additional regulatory changes will be 
introduced in the future or the impact they may have on our operations.
KEY DRIVERS/
TRENDS
Our banking operations must comply with capital adequacy and other regulatory ratios set by our regulator, the NBG, 
including reserve requirements and mandatory financial ratios. Our ability to comply with existing or amended NBG 
requirements may be affected by a number of factors, including those outside of our control, such as an increase in the 
Bank’s risk-weighted assets, our ability to raise capital, losses resulting from deterioration in our asset quality and/or a 
reduction in income levels and/or an increase in expenses, decline in the value of the Bank’s securities portfolio, as well 
as weakening of global and Georgian economies.
Each of our Investment Businesses is subject to different regulators and regulation. Legislation in certain industries, such 
as healthcare, energy and utilities are continuously evolving. Different changes, including but not limited to governmental 
funding, licensing and accreditation requirements and tariff structures may adversely affect our businesses.
MITIGATION Continued investment in our people and processes is enabling us to meet our current regulatory requirements and means 
that we are well placed to respond to any future changes in regulation.
In line with our integrated control framework, we carefully evaluate the impact of legislative and regulatory changes as part 
of our formal risk identification and assessment processes and, to the extent possible, proactively participate in the drafting 
of relevant legislation. As part of this process, we engage in constructive dialogue with regulatory bodies, where possible, 
and seek external advice on potential changes to legislation. We then develop appropriate policies, procedures and 
controls as required to fulfil our compliance obligations.
Our compliance framework, at all levels, is subject to regular review by internal audit and external assurance providers. 36 Annual Report 2017 BGEO Group PLC
PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES CONTINUED
CYBER-SECURITY, INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND FINANCIAL CRIME
PRINCIPAL RISK/
UNCERTAINTY
We are at risk of experiencing cyber-security breaches, unauthorised access to our systems and financial 
crime, or failures in our banking activity processes or systems or human error, which could disrupt our 
customer services, result in financial loss, have legal or regulatory implications and/or affect our reputation.
We are highly dependent on the proper functioning of our risk management, internal controls and systems, and internal 
processes including those related to data protection, IT and information security in order to manage these threats.
KEY DRIVERS/
TRENDS
During 2017, we saw a number of major organisations subjected to cyber-attacks, although fortunately, our operations 
were not materially affected. The external threat profile is continuously changing and we expect threats to continue to 
increase.
Over the past few years, as our operations have expanded, we have seen an increase in electronic crimes, including fraud, 
although losses have not been significant. Money laundering has also increased globally in recent years which the bank 
has certain responsibilities to guard against.
MITIGATION We have an integrated control framework encompassing operational risk management, IT systems, corporate and other 
data security each of which is managed by a separate department. We also have an Anti-Money Laundering (AML) officer 
and controls.
We identify and assess operational risk categories within our risk management framework, identifying critical risk areas 
or groups of operations with an increased risk level and develop policies and security procedures to mitigate these risks.
We have security controls in place including policies, procedures and security technologies. We also regularly carry out  
IT and information security checks internally and with the assistance of external consultants. We have sophisticated 
anti-virus protection and firewalls to help protect against potentially malicious software. We have increased our internal  
and external penetration testing and have back-up disaster recovery and business continuity plans in place across the 
Group. Access control and password protections have been improved through the implementation in 2016 of “Privileged 
Access Monitoring” for employees with the highest privileged access to confidential and customer data. We continue to 
invest in technology to enhance our ability to prevent, detect and respond to increasing and evolving threats.
Our Internal Audit function provides assurance on the adequacy and effectiveness of our risk management, internal 
controls and systems in place. These types of operational risk are on the Audit Committee’s regular agenda and are  
also frequently discussed at Board level.
INVESTMENT BUSINESS STRATEGY
PRINCIPAL RISK/
UNCERTAINTY
Market conditions may adversely impact our Investment Business strategy and all our Investment Businesses 
have their own risks specific to their industry.
Our Investment Businesses have growth and expansion strategies and we face execution risk in implementing these 
strategies. Our Investment Business strategy is to achieve an internal rate of return of at least 25% from investments. 
The Invesment Business will normally seek to monetise its investments, including through initial public offering, strategic 
sale or other appropriate exit, typically within five to ten years of acquisition.
Macroeconomic conditions and the financial and economic environment, and other market conditions in international 
capital markets may limit the Group’s ability to achieve a partial or full exit from its existing or future businesses. It may  
not be possible or desirable to divest, including whether suitable buyers can be found at the appropriate times or cases 
where there may be difficulties in obtaining favourable terms or prices.
KEY DRIVERS/
TRENDS
Each investment business – GGU, m
2
, Aldagi, Teliani, Georgia Healthcare Group – faces their own risks. These include 
risks inherent to their industry, or to their industry particularly in Georgia, and each faces significant competition. They also 
face the principal risks and uncertainties referred to throughout this table, such as macroeconomic and regulatory risk.
MITIGATION The Group has a strong track record of growth and has accessed the capital markets on multiple occasions. Our 
acquisition history has also been successful and we have been able to integrate businesses due to strong management 
with integration experience.
For each business, we focus on building a strong management team and have successfully been able to do so thus far. 
Management succession planning is regularly on the agenda for the Nomination Committee and Board as whole.
We closely monitor the implementation of strategy, financial and operational performance, risk management and internal 
control framework and corporate governance structure of our businesses. We hold management accountable for meeting 
targets.
For each industry in which we operate, we closely monitor industry trends, market conditions and the regulatory 
environment. We have also sought and continue to seek advice from experienced global professionals in our industries. 37 Annual Report 2017 BGEO Group PLC

DEMERGER AND FUTURE PERFORMANCE RISK
PRINCIPAL RISK/
UNCERTAINTY
The Group is implementing a demerger of its Banking Business and Investment Business, subject to 
shareholder approval.
The demerger is dependent on a number of conditions and steps to complete and there is a risk that it may not go  
ahead despite extensive management time having been focused on the initiative.
There is also risk that the demerger will go ahead but that the full anticipated benefits are not realised.
KEY DRIVERS/
TRENDS
On 3 July 2017, the Group announced its intention to demerge the Group into a London-listed banking business and  
a London-listed investment business. On 12 February 2018 the Group announced that the Board had approved the 
implementation of the demerger and gave an update on its structure.
The Board has stated that it believes a demerger of the businesses will deliver additional long-term value to shareholders 
by creating two distinct entities, each of which will have enhanced growth opportunities in the strongly growing Georgian 
economy. The Board has stated that it believes the demerger will benefit the two businesses in the following areas: 
business flexibility, pursuing growth opportunities, regulatory clarity and flexibility, efficient capital structure, improved 
management focus, alignment of incentives, and investor clarity and understanding.
More detail is expected to be included in the circular to be sent to shareholders relating to the demerger.
MITIGATION We continue to monitor the businesses as usual through the processes and risk framework outlined in this Risk Management 
and Principal Risks and Uncertainties section.
The Board and management also receive major progress updates on the demerger. The project team for the demerger, which 
includes some of our executives, steers the process and helps ensure the implementation plans are in place. We are seeking 
advice from experienced professionals in respect of the demerger.
More detail is expected to be included in the circular to be sent to shareholders relating to the demerger. 38 Annual Report 2017 BGEO Group PLC

BANK RISK MANAGEMENT
The Banking Business is the principal driver of the Group’s revenue and operates in the financial services sector – its risk management and internal 
control framework are fundamental to that of the Group.
OVERVIEW
The BGEO Board, supported by our BGEO 
Audit and Risk Committees and management, 
is ultimately responsible for the Group’s risk 
management and internal controls.
Formal policies and procedures have been 
developed at the BGEO level, with the help of 
senior management, to explain the way risks 
need to be systematically identified, assessed, 
quantified, managed and monitored.
Clearly delegated authority levels and reporting 
lines have been established, which together with 
the comprehensive reporting process, form an 
integral part of the BGEO risk management 
framework and internal control processes.
Each business participates in the risk 
management process by identifying the key 
risks applicable to its business.
A detailed description of the BGEO risk 
management control framework can be found 
on pages 32 to 33 of the Strategic Report.
The work undertaken by the Bank’s risk 
management bodies feeds back directly to 
BGEO. Certain banking-related risks have 
been identified in the Group’s Principal Risks 
and Uncertainties, which can be found on 
pages 34 to 37 of the Strategic Report.
Given the significance of the Banking Business, the 
risk management and internal control framework 
are in place at the Bank as described in this 
section.
THE ROLE OF THE BANK IN THE OVERALL 
RISK MANAGEMENT STRUCTURE
Management of risk is fundamental to the 
Banking Business and is an essential element 
of the Group’s operations.
The main risks inherent in the Bank’s  
operations are credit risk, liquidity risk,  
market risk (including currency and foreign 
exchange rate risks), operational risk and legal 
risk. The following is a description of the Bank’s 
risk management policies and procedures in 
respect to those risks. Business risks such as 
changes in the environment, technology and 
industry are monitored through the Group’s 
strategic planning process.
The Bank’s risk management system is based 
on the principle of continually assessing risk 
throughout the life of any operation and 
includes such stages as:
• risk identification
• qualitative and quantitative assessment 
of a particular risk
• determination of an acceptable risk level
• risk monitoring and mitigation
• ongoing monitoring and control allowing 
efficient adjustments in case of any negative 
changes in the conditions on which the 
preliminary risk assessment was made
• analysis of the efficiency of the risk 
management system
BANK RISK MANAGEMENT BODIES
The principal risk management bodies of 
the Bank are the: Supervisory Board, Audit 
Committee, Management Board, Risk 
Committee, Internal Audit, Treasury, Credit 
Committee, Asset and Liability Management 
Committee (the “ALCO”), AML and Compliance 
and the Bank’s Legal department. Each of the 
Supervisory Board, Audit Committee and Risk 
Committee perform similar roles as the BGEO 
Board, BGEO Audit Committee and BGEO Risk 
Committee, only at Bank level. Please refer to 
the diagram at the bottom of this page.
Management Board. The Management  
Board has overall responsibility for the Bank’s 
asset, liability and risk management activities, 
policies and procedures. In order to effectively 
implement the risk management system, the 
Management Board delegates individual risk 
management functions to each of the various 
decision-making and execution bodies within 
the Bank.
Internal Audit department. The Internal  
Audit department is responsible for the regular 
review/audit of the Bank’s operations, activities, 
systems and processes, in order to evaluate and 
provide reasonable, independent and objective 
assurance and consulting services designed to 
add value and improve the Bank’s operations.
The Bank’s Internal Audit department is 
independent of the Bank’s Management  
Board. The Head of the Bank’s Internal  
Audit department is appointed by the Bank’s 
Supervisory Board and reports directly to the 
Bank’s Audit Committee. The Bank’s Internal 
Audit department discusses the results of all 
assessments with the Bank’ s Management Board 
and reports its findings and recommendations to 
the Bank’s Audit Committee.
The purpose of the Internal Audit department 
is to determine whether the Bank’s risk 
management, internal controls and corporate 
governance processes, which are designed 
and implemented by the Management Board, 
are adequate such that:
• material risks including strategic, credit, 
market, liquidity and operational risks, are 
appropriately identified, measured, assessed 
and managed across the Bank including its 
outsourced activities
• interaction with the various internal 
governance groups occurs appropriately 39 Annual Report 2017 BGEO Group PLC

• significant financial, managerial, and 
operating information is accurate, reliable 
and timely
• the Bank and its employees act with 
integrity and their actions are in compliance 
with the policies, standards, procedures and 
applicable laws and regulations
• resources are acquired economically, used 
efficiently, and protected adequately
• programmes, plans and objectives are 
achieved, and
• significant legislative or regulatory issues 
that impact the organisation are recognised 
and addressed in a timely fashion and 
properly.
In order to fulfil its function the Bank’ s Internal  
Audit department has unrestricted access to  
all the Bank’s functions, records, property  
and personnel.
Treasury. Treasury is responsible for managing 
the Bank’s assets and liabilities and its overall 
financial structure and is also primarily 
responsible for managing funding and liquidity 
risks of the Bank.
Credit Committee. The Bank has three credit 
committees (together, the “Credit Committees”), 
each responsible for supervising and managing 
the Bank’s credit risks in respect of loans for 
retail and wealth management clients, corporate 
loans and counterparty loans. These three 
committees are: the Retail Banking Committee, 
the Corporate Banking Credit Committee and 
the Financial and Governmental Counterparty 
Risk Management Committee (FGCRMC). 
FGCRMC manages, monitors and controls 
counterparty risk in relation to financial and 
Governmental counterparties of the Bank. 
Each Credit Committee approves individual 
loan transactions.
Each Credit Committee is comprised of tiers 
of subcommittees. The FGCRMC comprises 
two tiers of subcommittees. The Committee 
consists of six members – Deputy CEO, Chief 
Risk Officer, Deputy CEO, Finance, Deputy 
CEO, Corporate Investment Banking, Head 
of Quantitative Risk Management Department, 
Head of Treasury and Head of Trade Finance. 
A majority of votes is enough for approval. If the 
potential exposure exceeds US$ 10.0 million, 
then the decision is deferred to the ALCO. The 
Credit Committee for retail loans comprises four 
tiers of subcommittees (for risk management 
purposes, loans for wealth management  
clients are classified as retail loans.) The Credit 
Committee for corporate loans comprises three 
tiers of subcommittees. Participation of the 
CEO is required for exposures exceeding 
US$ 10.0 million. All exposures to single  
group borrowers over US$ 25.0 million require 
approval by the Supervisory Board. Lower tier 
subcommittees meet on a daily basis, whereas 
higher tier ones typically meet three to four 
times a week. Each of the subcommittees of 
the Credit Committees makes its decisions  
by a majority vote of its respective members. 
Since 2017, Micro and SME loan applications 
are approved by credit risk managers.
The Problem Assets Committee is chaired  
by one of the following: the Head of the 
Problem Loan Management Department (first 
level pertains to loans of up to GEL 250,000), 
Deputy CEO, Operations (second level pertains 
to the loans in the range of GEL 250,000-
500,000) and Deputy CEO, Chief Risk  
Officer (third level pertains to loans above 
GEL 500,000). The Problem Loan Management 
Department manages the Bank’s exposures 
to problem loans and reports to the Deputy 
CEO, Operations.
 
The Corporate Recovery Committee is chaired 
by the Deputy CEO, Chief Risk Officer and is 
responsible for monitoring all of the Bank’s 
exposures to loans that are managed by  
the Corporate Recovery department. The 
Corporate Recovery department reports to the 
Deputy CEO, Corporate Investment Banking.
Asset and Liability Management 
Committee (ALCO). The ALCO is the core  
risk management body that establishes  
policies and guidelines with respect to capital 
adequacy, market risks and respective limits, 
funding liquidity risk and respective limits, 
interest rate and prepayment risks and 
respective limits, money market general terms 
and credit exposure limits. ALCO designs and 
implements respective risk management and 
stress testing models in practice and regularly 
monitors compliance with the preset risk limits, 
and approves treasury deals with non-standard 
terms. Specifically, ALCO:
• sets money-market credit exposure/lending 
limits
• sets open currency position limits with 
respect to overnight and intraday positions
• establishes stop-loss limits for foreign 
currency operations and securities
• monitors compliance with the established 
risk management models for foreign 
exchange risk, interest rate risk and  
funding liquidity risk
• sets ranges of interest rates for different 
maturities at which the Bank may place  
its liquid assets and attract funding, and
• reviews different stress tests and capital 
adequacy models prepared by the Finance 
Department and FGCRMC
The ALCO is chaired by the CEO and meets 
at any time deemed necessary, with decisions 
made by a majority vote of its members. ALCO 
members include the CEO, Deputy CEO, 
Finance, Deputy CEO, Chief Risk Officer, 
Deputy CEO, Corporate Investment Banking, 
Deputy CEO, Retail Banking, Deputy CEO, 
SOLO & MSME, Deputy CEO, Operations, the 
Head of the Finance department and the Head 
of the Treasury department. The ALCO reviews 
financial reports and indices including the 
Bank’s limits/ratios, balance sheet, statement 
of operations, maturity gap, interest rate gap, 
currency gap, foreign exchange risk, interest 
rate risk and funding liquidity risk reports, total 
cash flow analysis, customer cash flow analysis 
and concentration risk analysis, for the past 
periods as well as future projections and 
forecasts, other financial analysis and further 
growth projections on a monthly basis.
Regulatory capital requirements in Georgia are 
set by the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) and 
are applied to the Bank on a standalone basis. 
NBG requires the Bank to maintain minimum 
Capital Adequacy ratios computed based on 
the Bank’s standalone special purpose financial 
statements prepared in accordance with NBG 
regulations and pronouncements.
In order to transition to Basel III, NBG 
introduced new capital adequacy requirements 
in December 2017. As a result of the changes, 
Bank of Georgia became subject to the 
following minimum capital requirements  
at 31 December 2017:
• Common Equity Tier 1 ratio 8.1%, expected 
to increase to 9.5% on 31 December 2018
• Tier 1 ratio 9.9%, expected to increase  
to 11.4% on 31 December 2018, and
• Total Capital ratio 12.4%, expected to 
increase to 16.0% on 31 December 2018

Transition to Basel III is not expected to affect 
the Bank’s growth prospects or its ability to 
maintain dividend distributions within the 
existing dividend policy payout range.
ALCO is the key governing body for capital 
adequacy management, as well as for respective 
risks identification and management. ALCO 
establishes limits and reviews actual performance 
over those limits for both NBG and Basel I capital 
adequacy regulations. The Finance department  
is in charge of regular monthly monitoring of and 
reporting on NBG and Basel I capital adequacy 
compliance with original pronouncements as  
well as with ALCO policies. Capital adequacy 
management is an integral part of the Bank’s 
monthly reporting, as well as the Bank’s annual 
and semi-annual budget approval and budget 
review processes. The Finance department 
prepares NBG, Basel I and Basel II/III capital 
adequacy actual reports, as well as their 
forecasts and budgets and different stress 
scenarios for both regulations, while ALCO  
and the Management Board regularly review 
them, identify risks, issue recommendations  
and, if applicable, propose action plans.
Legal department. The Legal department’s 
principal purposes are to ensure that the Bank’s 
activities conform to applicable legislation and to 
minimise losses from the materialisation of legal 
risks. The Legal department is responsible for 
the application and development of mechanisms 
for identifying legal risks in the Bank’s activities in 
a timely manner, the investigation of the Bank’s 
activities in order to identify any legal risks, the 
planning and implementation of all necessary 
actions for the elimination of identified legal risks, 
participation in legal proceedings on behalf of  
the Bank where necessary and the investigation 
of possibilities for increasing the effectiveness 
of the Bank’s legal documentation and its 
implementation in the Bank’s daily activities.  
The Legal department is also responsible for 
providing legal support to structural units of  
the Bank and/or its subsidiaries.
Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and 
Compliance. The Bank’s AML and Compliance 
department is responsible for the implementation 
of the Bank’s AML programme (including the 
development of AML policies and procedures, 
transaction monitoring and reporting, and 
employee training) throughout the Bank and its 
subsidiaries. The AML programme is based on 
recommendations, directives and requirements of 
international organisations, including FATF/Basel, 
the European Parliament, the US department  
of treasury on sanctions programmes, as well  
as local regulations. The Bank’s Internal Audit 
department makes annual assessments of the 
Bank’s AML systems and controls and provides 
independent assurance of internal controls.
The Bank has adopted a risk-based approach 
towards ML/FT risks, including a general 
anti-money laundering policy, customer 
acceptance policy and financial sanctions 
compliance policy. The Bank’s risk-based 
approach means that it applies enhanced due 
diligence towards ML/FT risks, it determines 
high-risk categories of products, customers, 
services and jurisdictions.
The Bank is obliged to notify the Financial 
Monitoring Service of Georgia of all transactions 
that are subject to monitoring in accordance 
with Georgian legislation. These reports are 
currently filed in electronic form in an offline 
mode by the AML and Compliance department. 
The reporting process is fully automated and  
is supported by a special software application. 
Furthermore, the Bank operates special  
AML software, which meets the industry 
requirements. The programme covers every 
sanctions list, as well as debarred and banned 
individuals and organisations as identified  
by OFAC, EU, UN and other similar bodies.  
It allows fully-automated monitoring of all 
transactions against special lists. In pursuance 
of identifying suspicious transactions the AML 
and Compliance department has implemented 
a centralised solution that links transactions, 
accounts and customers so that the Bank can 
see the enterprise-wide risk associated with 
each customer.
BODIES IMPLEMENTING THE  
RISK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
The Bank’s risk management system is 
implemented by the Credit Risk Management, 
Quantitative Risk Management and Risk 
Analytics department, Treasury, Operational Risk 
Management, Legal, AML and Compliance and 
Security departments, Finance department and 
other departments. The Credit Risk Management 
(CB Portfolio Analysis), Quantitative Risk 
Management and Risk Analytics department  
and Operational Risk Management departments 
report to the Deputy CEO, Chief Risk Officer and 
the Legal department is under supervision of  
the General Legal Counsel, who directly reports  
to the CEO. The Finance department and the 
Treasury department report to the Deputy CEO, 
Finance. The AML and Compliance department 
reports to Deputy CEO, Operations.
The Quantitative Risk Management and Risk 
Analytics department, in coordination with the 
Treasury, implements the Bank’s market risk 
policies by ensuring compliance with established 
open currency position limits, counterparty limits, 
VAR limits on possible losses and the interest 
rate policy set by the ALCO. 
The Treasury department manages foreign 
currency exchange, money market, securities 
portfolio and derivatives operations and monitors 
compliance with the limits set by the ALCO for 
these operations. The Treasury department is 
also responsible for management of short-term 
liquidity and treasury cash flow and monitors the 
volumes of cash in the Bank’s ATMs and at its 
service centres.
The Credit Risk Management department 
manages credit risks with respect to particular 
borrowers and assesses overall loan portfolio 
risks. It is responsible for ensuring compliance 
with the Bank’s Credit Policies and management 
of the quality of the Bank’s loan portfolio.
The Operational Risk Management department 
identifies and assesses operational risk within 
the Bank’s processes and operations. It also 
detects critical risk areas or groups of operations 
with an increased risk level and develops internal 
control procedures to address these risks, 
through (among other things) business-process 
redesign schemes, including document 
circulation, information streams, distribution of 
functions, permissions and responsibility.
The Legal department monitors all changes  
in relevant laws and regulations, and ensures 
that those changes are properly reflected in  
the Bank’s procedures, instructions, manuals, 
templates and other relevant documentation. 
It also disseminates information on legislative 
changes to all relevant departments within the 
Bank. The Legal department also participates  
in drafting laws and regulatory documents upon 
request of legislators and regulators, certain 
associations and other professional bodies.
The Tax Reporting and Tax Risks Management 
Unit focuses on the Bank’s relationship with the 
tax authorities and provides practical advice 
and monitors tax compliance across the Group.
Each of the foregoing departments is provided 
with policies and/or manuals that are approved 
by the Bank’s Management Board and/or the 
Supervisory Board (as required). The manuals 
and policies include comprehensive guidance 
for each stage of a transaction, including,  
but not limited to, manuals outlining asset  
and liability management policies, foreign 
exchange operations procedures, fixed  
income investment guidelines, Retail Banking 
operations procedures, the deposit policy and 
Credit Policies.
Risk measurement and reporting. The Bank 
measures risk using a method which reflects 
both the expected loss likely to arise in normal 
circumstances and unexpected losses, which 
are an estimate of the ultimate actual loss 
based on different forecasting models. These 
models use probabilities derived from historical 
experience, adjusted from time to time to reflect 
the economic environment. The Bank also runs 
worst case scenarios that could arise in light of 
extreme events.
Monitoring and controlling of risks is primarily 
performed based on limits established by the 
Bank. These limits reflect the business strategy 
and market environment of the Bank, as well as 
the level of risk that it is willing to accept, with 
additional emphasis on selected industries. The 
Bank also conducts ongoing monitoring and 
control, allowing efficient adjustments in case 
of any unexpected changes in the conditions 
on which the preliminary risk assessment was 
made. In addition, the Bank monitors and 
measures overall risk-bearing capacity in 
relation to aggregate risk exposure across  
all risk types and activities.
The Bank maintains a management  
reporting system which requires the Credit  
Risk Management, Quantitative Risk 
Management and Analytics, Finance and 
Treasury departments to prepare certain reports 
on a daily and monthly basis. On a daily basis, 
a statement of operations, balance sheet and 
treasury report (which includes the Bank’s open 
foreign exchange positions, cash flows, limits 
and balances on correspondent accounts with 
other banks) and confirmation that there has 
been compliance with mandatory financial 
ratios must be provided by each department. 
On a monthly basis, a report on the structural 
liquidity gap, a report on interest rate risk, 
monthly financial statements and a quarterly

containing analysis of the Bank’s performance 
against its budget are provided. Information 
compiled from all the businesses is examined 
and processed in order to analyse, control and 
identify early risks. This information is presented 
and explained to the Management Board and 
the head of each business division. The report 
includes aggregate credit exposure, liquidity 
ratios and risk profile changes. Management 
assesses the appropriateness of the allowance 
for credit losses on a monthly basis. The Bank’s 
Management Board and the Supervisory Board 
receive a comprehensive risk report once a 
quarter which is designed to provide all the 
necessary information to assess and draw 
conclusions on the Bank’s risk exposure.
Specifically tailored risk reports are prepared 
and distributed to all levels throughout the 
Bank in order to ensure that all business 
divisions have access to extensive, relevant 
and up-to-date information. A daily briefing is 
given to the Bank’s Management Board and 
all other relevant employees of the Bank on 
the utilisation of market limits, proprietary 
investments and liquidity, as well as any 
other risk developments.
RISK MITIGATION AND EXCESSIVE  
RISK CONCENTRATION
As part of its overall risk management, the 
Bank uses derivatives and other instruments 
to manage exposures resulting from changes 
in interest rates, foreign currencies, credit 
risks, and exposures arising from forward 
transactions. While these derivatives are 
intended for hedging, they do not qualify 
for hedge accounting.
The Bank actively uses collateral to reduce 
its credit risks.
In order to avoid excessive concentrations 
of risks, the Bank focuses on maintaining a 
diversified portfolio. Identified concentrations 
of credit risks are controlled and managed 
accordingly. Concentrations arise when  
a number of counterparties, or related 
shareholders, are engaged in similar business 
activities, or activities in the same geographic 
region, or have similar economic features that 
would cause their ability to meet contractual 
obligations to be similarly affected by changes 
in economic, political or other conditions. 
Concentrations also involve combined, 
aggregate exposures of large and significant 
credits compared to total outstanding balance 
of the respective financial instrument. 
Concentrations indicate the relative sensitivity 
of the Bank’s performance to developments 
affecting a particular industry or geographical 
location. Identified concentrations of credit 
risks are controlled and managed accordingly.
CREDIT RISK
Definition: Credit risk is the risk that a borrower 
or counterparty will be unable to pay amounts in 
full or in part when due. Credit risk arises mainly 
in the context of the Bank’s lending activities.
Mitigation: The general principles of the 
Bank’s credit policy are outlined in the Credit 
Policies. The Credit Policies also outline credit 
risk control and monitoring procedures and the 
Bank’s credit risk management systems. The 
Credit Policies are reviewed annually or more 
frequently, if necessary. As a result of these 
reviews, new loan restructuring tools are 
introduced. The Bank also uses the NBG’s 
provisioning methodology in order to comply 
with NBG requirements.
The Bank manages its credit risk by placing 
limits on the amount of risk accepted with 
respect to individual corporate borrowers or 
groups of related borrowers, liability of insurance 
companies, types of banking operations and by 
complying with the exposure limits established 
by the NBG. The Bank monitors the market 
value of collateral, requests additional collateral 
in accordance with the underlying agreement 
and monitors the market value of collateral 
obtained during its review of the adequacy of the 
allowance for loan impairment. The Bank also 
mitigates its credit risk by obtaining collateral and 
using other security arrangements. The exposure 
to financial institutions is managed by limits 
covering on and off-balance sheet exposures 
and by settlement limits with respect to trading 
transactions such as foreign exchange 
contracts.
The Credit Committees approve individual 
transactions and the Credit Risk Management 
department establishes credit risk categories 
and provisioning rates, which are set as  
per provisioning methodology. The Deputy  
CEO, Chief Risk Officer and the Credit Risk 
Management department review the credit 
quality of the portfolio and set provisioning 
rates, in consultation with the Bank’s CEO  
and Deputy CEO, Finance, on a monthly basis.
The Bank’s credit quality review process 
provides early identification of possible changes 
in the creditworthiness of counterparties, 
including regular collateral revaluations. 
Counterparty limits are established by the use of 
a credit risk classification system, which assigns 
a risk rating to each counterparty. Risk ratings 
are subject to regular revision. The credit quality 
review process allows the Bank to assess the 
potential loss as a result of the risks to which 
it is exposed and to take corrective action.  
The Bank makes available to its customers 
guarantees/letters of credit, which may require 
that the Bank makes payments on their behalf. 
Such payments are collected from customers 
based on the terms of the guarantee/letter of 
credit. They expose the Bank to similar risks  
to loans and these are mitigated by the same 
control processes and policies.
LOAN APPROVAL PROCEDURES
The procedures for approving loans, monitoring 
loan quality and for extending, refinancing and/
or restructuring existing loans are set out in the 
Bank’s Credit Policies that are approved by the 
Supervisory Board and/or the Management 
Board of the Bank. The Credit Committees 
approve individual transactions. The Bank 
evaluates Corporate Investment Banking clients 
on the basis of their financial condition, credit 
history, business operations, market position, 
management, level of shareholder support, 
proposed business and financing plan and  
on the quality of the collateral offered. The 
appropriate level of the relevant Credit 
Committee is responsible for making the 
decision for loan approval based on credit 
memorandum and, where appropriate, the 
Credit Risk Manager’s report. The loan approval 
procedures for Retail Banking loans depend on 
the type of retail lending products.
Applications for consumer loans, including 
credit cards and auto loans up to GEL 20,000 
are approved by the scoring system. 
Applications for mortgage loans of Retail 
Banking clients are completed by the Mortgage 
Loan Officer and submitted to the Credit Risk 
Manager, who evaluates the credit risks and 
determines the amount, terms and conditions 
of the loan, which must be approved at the 
appropriate Credit Committee level. In the case 
of micro financing loans, loan officers evaluate 
loan applications, prepare a project analysis 
and submit proposals to the appropriate Credit 
Committee, which makes the final decision. 
Credit Committee members have equal voting 
authority and decisions are approved by a 
simple majority of votes.
COLLATERAL
The Bank typically requires credit support or 
collateral as security for the loans and credit 
facilities that it grants. The main forms of credit 
support are guarantees and rights to claim 
amounts on the borrower’s current account with 
the Bank or other assets. The main forms of 
collateral for corporate lending are charges over 
real estate properties, equipment, inventory and 
trade receivables and the main form of collateral 
for retail lending is a mortgage over residential 
property. In the case of corporate loans, the 
Bank usually requires a personal guarantee 
(surety) from the borrower’s shareholders.  
Under the Bank’s internal guidelines, collateral 
should be provided (where it is required) to 
cover outstanding liabilities during the entire 
duration of a transaction. As of 31 December 
2017, 83.3% of the Banking Business loans to 
clients were collateralised. An evaluation report 
of the proposed collateral is prepared by the 
Asset Appraisal and Disposal department and 
submitted to the appropriate Credit Committee, 
together with the loan application and Credit 
Risk Manager’s report. When evaluating 
collateral, the Bank discounts the market value 
of the assets to reflect the liquidation value of 
the collateral.
MEASUREMENT
Exposure and limits are subject to annual or 
more frequent review. The Bank’s compliance 
with credit risk exposure limits is monitored  
by the Credit Risk Management department  
on a continuous basis. The Bank establishes 
provisions for impairment losses of financial 
assets on a collective basis and on an individual 
basis when there is objective evidence that  
a financial asset or group of financial assets  
is impaired. The Bank creates provisions by 
reference to the particular borrower’s financial 
condition and the number of days the relevant 
loan is overdue. If in a subsequent period the 
amount of the impairment loss decreases  
and the decrease can be related objectively  
to an event occurring after the impairment was 
recognised, the previously recognised impairment 
loss is reversed by an adjusted provision 
account. The determination of provisions for 
impairment losses is based on an analysis of  
the assets at risk and reflects the amount which, 
in the judgement of the Bank’s management,  
is adequate to provide for losses incurred. 42 Annual Report 2017 BGEO Group PLC
Provisions are made against gross loan  
amounts and accrued interest. Under the  
Bank’s internal loan loss allowance methodology, 
which is based upon IFRS requirements, the 
Bank categorises its loan portfolio into significant 
and non-significant loans. Significant loans  
are defined as loans in excess of US$ 150,000 
and non-significant loans are defined as loans 
less than US$ 150,000. The Credit Risk 
Management Department makes an individual 
assessment of all defaulted significant loans. 
Non-defaulted significant loans are given a 
collective assessment rate. For the purposes  
of provisioning, all loans are divided into  
different groups (such as mortgage, consumer, 
microfinancing loans).
Since 2004, the Bank, jointly with certain other 
Georgian banks and with the Credit Information 
Group, a provider of credit information 
solutions, established JSC Credit Info Georgia 
(CIG) that serves as a centralised credit bureau 
in Georgia. Since 2009, all the participating 
banks, insurance companies and microfinance 
organisations share and contribute positive and 
negative customer credit information to CIG.
Loans up to US$ 500,000 secured by real estate 
are subject to a write-off once overdue for more 
than 365 days. Unsecured loans or the loans 
secured by collateral other than real estate are 
subject to a write-off once overdue for more  
than 150 days. Corporate loans and loans  
above US$ 500,000, secured by real estate, 
may be written off following an assessment  
by the Deputy CEO, Chief Risk Officer and the 
Credit Risk department, in consultation with  
the Bank’s CEO and Deputy CEO, Finance.
The Group has completed its IFRS 9 
implementation programme and adopted IFRS 
9, Financial Instruments from 1 January 2018. 
For further information see page 159 in the 
Consolidated Financial Statements of this 
Annual Report.
LIQUIDITY RISK
Definition: Liquidity risk is the risk that the 
Bank will be unable to meet its payment 
obligations when they fall due under normal 
and stress circumstances.
Monitoring: Liquidity risk is managed through 
the ALCO-approved liquidity framework. 
Treasury manages liquidity on a daily basis.  
In order to manage liquidity risk, it performs 
daily monitoring of future expected cash flows 
on customers’ and banking operations, which 
is a part of the assets/liabilities management 
process. The Finance department prepares  
and submits monthly reports to the ALCO.  
The ALCO monitors the proportion of maturing 
funds available to meet deposit withdrawals 
and the amounts of inter-bank and other 
borrowing facilities that should be in place  
to cover withdrawals at unexpected levels  
of demand.
The liquidity risk management framework 
models the ability of the Bank to meet its 
payment obligations under both normal 
conditions and crisis. The Bank has developed 
a model based on the Basel III liquidity 
guidelines. This approach is designed to  
ensure that the funding framework is sufficiently 
flexible to secure liquidity under a wide range  
of market conditions. The liquidity management 
framework is reviewed from time to time  
to ensure it is appropriate to the Bank’s  
current and planned activities. Such review 
encompasses the funding scenarios modelled, 
the modelling approach, wholesale funding 
capacity, limit determination and minimum 
holdings of liquid assets. The liquidity 
framework is reviewed by the ALCO prior to 
approval by the Bank’s Management Board.
The Treasury and Funding departments  
also undertake an annual funding review that 
outlines the current funding strategy for the 
coming year. This review encompasses trends 
in global debt markets, funding alternatives, 
peer analysis, estimation of the Bank’s 
upcoming funding requirements, estimated 
market funding capacity and a funding risk 
analysis. The annual funding plan is reviewed  
by the Bank Management Board and approved 
by the Bank Supervisory Board as part of the 
annual budget. The Funding and Treasury 
departments also review, from time to time, 
different funding options and assess the 
refinancing risks of such options.
Mitigation: The Bank’s capability to discharge 
its liabilities is dependent on its ability to realise 
an equivalent amount of assets within the same 
period of time. The Bank maintains a portfolio 
of highly marketable and diverse assets that it 
believes can be easily liquidated in the event of 
an unforeseen interruption of cash flow. It also 
has committed lines of credit that it can access 
to meet its liquidity needs. Such lines of credit 
are available through the NBG’s refinancing 
facility. In addition, the Bank maintains a cash 
deposit (obligatory reserve) with the NBG,  
the amount of which depends on the level of 
customer funds attracted. As of 31 December 
2017, in line with the NBG’s requirements, 20% 
of customer deposits in foreign currencies were 
set aside as minimum reserves. In addition, the 
Bank maintains a minimum average balance of 
7% of its customers’ deposits in Georgian Lari 
at its correspondent account at the NBG. For 
wholesale funding and Certificates of Deposits, 
the NBG requires the Bank to set aside 20% of 
its unsubordinated foreign currency wholesale 
funding for borrowings with a remaining 
maturity of less than one year, 10% for 
borrowings with a remaining maturity of one  
to two years and 7% of its unsubordinated 
Georgian Lari wholesale funding for borrowings 
with a remaining maturity of less than one year. 
There is no minimum reserves requirement for 
Georgian Lari Certificates of Deposits.
Funding: In the Georgian marketplace, the 
majority of working capital loans are short-term 
and granted with the expectation of renewal  
at maturity. As such, the ultimate maturity  
of assets may be different from the analysis 
presented elsewhere. In addition, the maturity 
gap analysis does not reflect the historical 
stability of current accounts.
The Bank’s principal sources of liquidity are 
as follows:
• deposits
• borrowings from international credit 
institutions
• inter-bank deposit agreement
• debt issuances
• proceeds from sale of securities
• principal repayments on loans
• interest income
• fee and commission income
As of 31 December 2017, the Group’s total 
consolidated client deposits and notes were 
GEL 6,712.5 million (US$ 2,589.5 million) 
(as compared to GEL 5,382.7 million and 
GEL 4,751.4 million as of 31 December 2016 
and 2015, respectively) and represented 54.0% 
(as compared to 50.9% and 59.1% as of 
31 December 2016 and 2015, respectively)  
of the Group’s total liabilities. In accordance 
with Georgian legislation, the Bank is obliged  
to repay such deposits upon demand of a 
depositor. In the case of early withdrawal, the 
interest on the deposit is foregone or reduced. 
As of 31 December 2017, total amounts due 
to credit institutions and debt securities issued 
were GEL 4,865.0 million (US$ 1,876.8 million) 
(as compared to GEL 4,725.7 million and 
GEL 2,828.9 million as of 31 December 2016 
and 2015, respectively) and represented 39.1% 
(as compared to 44.7% and 35.2% as of 
31 December 2016 and 2015, respectively)  
of the Group’s total liabilities. Amounts due to 
credit institutions and debt securities are taken 
from a wide range of counterparties.
The Bank Management Board believes that the 
Bank’s liquidity is sufficient to meet the present 
requirements. For information on the Group’s 
liquid assets, liabilities and maturity profile of 
the Group’s financial liabilities, as well as further 
information on the liquidity risk of the Group 
see Note 31 of the Notes to the Consolidated 
Financial Statements of this Annual Report.
MARKET RISK
Definition: The Bank is exposed to market 
risk (including currency exchange rate risk 
and interest rate risk), which is the risk that 
the fair value or future cash flows of financial 
instruments will fluctuate due to changes in 
market variables. Market risk exposure arises 
from mismatches of maturity and currencies 
between the assets and liabilities, all of which 
are exposed to market fluctuations.
Mitigation: The general principles of the 
Bank’s market risk management policy are 
set by the ALCO. The Bank aims to limit and 
reduce the amount of possible losses on open 
market positions which may be incurred by  
the Bank due to negative changes in currency 
exchange rates and interest rates. The Bank 
classifies exposures to market risk into either 
trading or non-trading positions. Trading and 
non-trading positions are managed and 
monitored using different sensitivity analyses. 
In order to address these risks, the ALCO 
specifically establishes Value at Risk (VAR)  
limits on possible losses for each type of 
operation (currently the VAR limit is set for 
foreign currency exchange operations only) and 
the Quantitative Risk Management and Risk 
Analytics department monitor compliance with 
such limits.
Currency exchange rate risk: Currency 
exchange rate risk is the risk that the value 
of a financial instrument will fluctuate due to 
changes in foreign currency exchange rates.

Additional
Information
The Bank is exposed to the effects of fluctuation 
in the prevailing foreign currency exchange rates 
on its financial position. The Bank’s currency risk 
is calculated as an aggregate of open positions 
and is controlled by setting a VAR calculation 
(established by the ALCO) with respect to the 
Bank’s currency basket.
The Bank uses the historical simulation method 
based on 400-business-day statistical data.  
Its open currency positions are managed by  
the Treasury department on a day-to-day basis 
and are monitored by the Quantitative Risk 
Management and Risk Analytics department. 
The ALCO sets open currency position limits 
with respect to both overnight and intra-day 
positions and stop-loss limits. Currently, the 
Bank’s proprietary trading position is limited 
by the ALCO to a maximum of 15.0% of the 
Bank’s NBG total regulatory capital. The open 
currency position is also limited by ALCO to  
an annual VAR of GEL 50 million for a one-day 
trading period with a 98.0% “tolerance threshold”.
The ALCO limits are more conservative  
than NBG’s requirements, which allow banks  
to keep open positions of up to 20.0% of 
regulatory capital. The Bank also applies 
sensitivity stress tests to its open currency 
positions to estimate any potential negative 
impact on its net assets and earnings.
Interest rate risk: The Bank has exposure to 
interest rate risk as a result of lending at fixed 
and floating interest rates in amounts and  
for periods which differ from those of term 
borrowings at fixed and floating interest rates. 
Interest margins on assets and liabilities having 
different maturities may increase or decrease  
as a result of changes in market interest rates.
Similarly to other Georgian banks, the majority 
of the Bank’s assets and deposits have fixed 
interest rates. In order to minimise interest 
rate risk, the Bank monitors its interest rate 
(repricing) gap and maintains an interest rate 
margin (net interest income before impairment 
of interest-earning assets divided by average 
interest-earning assets) sufficient to cover 
operational expenses and risk premium.  
Within limits approved by the Bank Supervisory 
Board, the ALCO approves ranges of interest 
rates for different maturities at which the Bank  
may place assets and attract liabilities. The 
Quantitative Risk Management and Risk 
Analytics department analyses duration gap 
and capital sensitivity to interest rate changes.
As of 31 December 2017, the Banking 
Business floating rate borrowings accounted for 
11.5% of the Banking Business total liabilities.
The Bank is also subject to prepayment risk, 
which is the risk that the Bank will incur a 
financial loss because its customers and 
counterparties repay or request repayment 
earlier than expected, such as fixed rate 
mortgages when interest rates fall. The Bank 
reviews the prior history of early repayments  
by calculating the weighted average effective 
rate of early repayments across each credit 
product, individually, applying these historical 
rates to the outstanding carrying amount of 
each loan product as of the reporting date and 
then multiplying the product by the weighted 
average effective annual interest rates for each 
product. This allows the Bank to calculate the 
expected amount of unforeseen losses in the 
case of early repayments.
For further information on the Group’s  
market risk see Note 31 of the Notes to the 
Consolidated Financial Statements of this 
Annual Report.
OPERATIONAL RISK
Definition: Operational risk is the risk of loss 
arising from systems failure, human error,  
fraud or external events. When controls fail to 
perform, operational risks can cause damage to 
reputation, have legal or regulatory implications, 
or lead to financial loss. The Bank cannot 
expect to eliminate all operational risks, but 
through a control framework and by monitoring 
and responding to potential risks, the Bank 
aims to manage the risks. Controls include 
effective segregation of duties, access, 
authorisation and reconciliation procedures, 
staff education and training and assessment 
processes, including the use of internal audit.
Mitigation: The Bank manages its operational 
risks by establishing, monitoring and 
continuously improving its policies and 
procedures relating to the various aspects of 
the Bank’s cash, payments, accounting, trading 
and core processing operations and data 
back-up and disaster recovery arrangements.
The Bank has elaborated a framework, which  
is in compliance with normative acts defined by 
Georgian legislation and international standards. 
Regular review of and amendments to the policy 
are performed by the Risk Committee, which  
is also responsible for setting an overall risk 
appetite.
The Bank has an integrated control framework 
encompassing operational risk management 
and control, AML and Compliance, corporate 
and information security and physical security, 
each of which is managed by a separate 
department.
The Operational Risk Management department 
is responsible for development of policies, 
processes and procedures for managing 
operational risks in all products, activities, 
processes and systems, consistently 
implementing operational risk framework 
throughout the Bank. The department is 
responsible for identification and assessment  
of operational risks, detecting critical risks  
areas or groups of operations with an increased 
risk level, developing escalation process, 
considering business recommendations and 
mitigation action plans.
The Operational Risk Management Committee 
is responsible for setting and overseeing 
qualitative and quantitative parameters of 
operational risk appetite and tolerance.
Operational risks are identified and assessed by 
using several methodologies, such as: internal 
loss database collection and analysis, scenario 
analysis, Risk and Control Self-Assessment 
(RCSA), new products assessment, Key Risk 
Indicators (KRIs) analysis, etc. To mitigate an 
impact of operational risk, the Bank applies  
a number of approaches, including the 
implementation of control elements in a 
business process, segregation of duties,  
and development of preventive control tools 
within operating systems.
The Head of the Operational Risk Management 
department, who reports to the Deputy CEO, 
Chief Risk Officer, is responsible for the oversight 
of the Bank’s operational risks.

RESOURCES AND RESPONSIBILITIES
Sustainability lies at the heart of our business
We understand our corporate responsibility, which is embedded in our culture and believe we can make a difference to society.
The concept of sustainability lies at the heart 
of our business and reflects our contribution 
to sustainable development – development 
that meets the needs of the present without 
compromising the ability of future generations 
to meet their own needs.
We consider sustainability to be integral to 
the growth of our business. Our sustainability 
agenda allows us to be profitable as well as 
environmentally and socially responsible at the 
same time. By implementing a sustainability 
approach in our activities, we foster long-term 
relationships with our main stakeholders  
by providing high return on investment for 
shareholders, satisfying the financial needs 
of customers, developing employees and 
contributing to the economic and social welfare 
of local communities, while taking into account 
our environmental footprint.
In 2012, in order to effectively manage the 
Group’s direct and indirect impact on society 
and the environment, the Board of Directors 
adopted an Environmental and Social Policy. 
This policy describes the Group’s strategy to 
develop solid management controls to conserve 
natural resources, minimise health and safety 
risks, and provide employees with equal 
development opportunities, fair compensation 
and benefits. We are pioneering sustainability 
practices in our operations and are constantly 
seeking new ways to improve our performance. 
The policy was last updated in 2016.
The Group continues to be included in the global 
responsible investment index FTSE4Good. 
The index is designed to demonstrate strong 
Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) 
practices measured against international 
standards.
SOCIAL MATTERS
The Group considers the interests of its  
main stakeholders (customers, shareholders, 
employees, lenders and wider society) when 
developing the strategy and the processes  
to improve its operations. We continually  
strive to positively contribute to society through  
the entire scope of our business activities by 
developing socially-oriented products and 
services, implementing responsible approaches 
to our business operations, carrying out 
sponsorship and charitable activities.
SOCIALLY-ORIENTED PRODUCTS  
AND SERVICES
CORPORATE BANKING
In order to efficiently manage its indirect 
environmental and social impact, the Bank 
prioritised the integration of sustainable finance 
principles into its credit risk management 
procedures. In 2012, in order to effectively 
manage the Bank’s direct and indirect impact 
on society and the environment, the Board of 
Directors adopted an Environmental and Social 
(E&S) Policy. In 2013, the Bank updated its 
Environmental and Social Risk Management 
(ESRM) procedures in order to ensure a proper 
application of appropriate, risk-based and 
sector-specific environmental and social risk 
assessment practices to its commercial  
lending activities and in 2014, the Bank actively 
started to put the procedures into practice.  
The Bank defined priority targets and promotes 
environmental and social risk management 
activities accordingly. Since then, the Bank 
ensures it has a consistent approach to 
evaluating and managing the environmental, 
human health and safety risks of its financed 
projects. These procedures are now being 
integrated into the Bank’s credit risk 
management process and soon will be routinely 
applied to all commercial transactions. In all 
that the Bank does, it strives to find sustainable 
solutions that make business sense to clients 
and minimise negative impacts on the social 
and natural environments.
ESRM procedures were further updated in 
2017. The purpose of the review was to ensure 
that the policy remains fit for purpose and 
reflects experience and changes in the relevant 
legislation. In 2017, the Bank updated the 
assessment procedures of low, medium and 
high risk projects and refined the monitoring 
procedures of the projects.
The main objective of the E&S Policy is to 
increase environmental and social benefits for 
our clients. Through the ESRM procedures,  
the Bank enhances our clients’ opportunities to 
be in compliance with national environmental 
and social regulations and adopt international 
best practices in this area. The Environmental 
and Social Policy and Risk Management 
procedures, along with other tools necessary 
for their implementation, comprise the core 
components of the Bank’s Environmental and 
Social Risk Management System (ESMS). 
Under this concept, the Bank endeavours to 
become an environmentally friendly financial 
institution. In 2014, the Bank won the “Green 
Service” award at the “Georgian Green 
Business Awards” ceremony organised by  
the Ministry of Environmental and Natural 
Resources Protection of Georgia.
In May 2017, the European Bank for 
Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) 
awarded the Bank “The Deal of the Year 2016” 
prize for having financed a project aimed at 
boosting the renewable energy capacity of  
one of the hydropower plants in Georgia. The 
EBRD’s Green Trade Facilitation Programme 
(TFP) allows partner banks to use existing TFP 
facilities to finance exports, imports and local 
distribution of imported green technologies  
and services in line with the EBRD’s Green 
Economy Transition approach.
Furthermore, to ensure a more effective 
operation and maintenance of the ESRM  
Policy, the Social and Environmental Risk Unit 
was created in September 2016. Until then,  
the Environmental and Social Risk Coordinator 
was responsible for the implementation of  
the Policy. In 2017, we selected a Social and 
Environmental Risk Specialist who will oversee 
the practical, day-to-day implementation of the 
Bank’s ESMS.
We implement the following procedures to ensure 
the operation and maintenance of the ESMS:
• We refrain from financing environmentally 
or socially sensitive business activities 
mentioned in the exclusion lists of 
Development Finance Institutions such  
as EBRD, IFC, DEG, FMO and ADB  
among others
• We aim to assess the relative level of 
environmental and social risk associated 
with clients’ businesses. We require  
certain customers to implement specific 
environmental or social action plans to avoid 
or mitigate their environmental and social 
impact and adhere to specific monitoring 
and reporting requirements that we set in 
order to minimise environmental and social 
risk. These requirements are included as 
covenants in agreements between certain 
of our customers and the Bank
• We aim to regularly monitor environmental 
and social risks associated with the Bank’s 
activities, and assess clients’ compliance 
with the terms of respective agreements
Through ensuring comprehensive environmental 
and social assessment and action plans, as a part 
of stable due diligence, the Bank encourages its 
customers to fulfil their environmental and social 
obligations and establishes a framework for  
them to achieve good environmental and social 
standards. In many cases, the Bank’ s proper and 
timely management of customers’ environmental 
and social risks has helped them to avoid financial 
and legal sanctions during inspections conducted 
by state enforcement agencies.
Environmental and social issues are tracked  
at project sites in cooperation with the facility  
staff, providing ongoing advice and guidance on 
good practice and standards and monitoring 
compliance with the requirements. For 
environmental and social due diligence of certain 
high risk projects, the Bank contracts independent 
external experts. As part of monitoring, the Bank 
requires each high risk client to provide the Bank 
with an annual report on their environmental and 
social performance and the implementation of 
applicable Environmental and Social Action  
Plans. Alternatively, the Bank’ s staff visits high risk 
clients on a regular basis. In 2017, the Bank held 
extensive Environmental and Social Due Diligence 
(ESDD), where the Bank monitored clients and 
developed action plans for noncompliant clients. 
Thanks to the Bank’ s efforts, some clients 
conducted an environmental audit and obtained 
the necessary environmental impact permits to 
continue their business operations. Those clients 
started to identify, avoid, mitigate and manage 
environmental and social risks and their impact  
on the natural and social environment. In addition, 
as a result of ESDD some clients took out loans  
to enhance their companies’ power and ability  
to reduce negative impacts on the environment 
and positively benefit their communities.  
Others implemented environmental and  
social management systems in accordance  
with international standards.

ESMS, provide a means for the public to submit 
queries or concerns related to the Bank’s E&S 
Policy, and have these inquiries responded to by 
the Bank in a timely manner. In the Association 
Agreement between the European Union and 
Georgia, Georgia has committed to progressively 
approximate its legislation in the relevant sectors 
with that of the EU and to implement it 
effectively. Through this approximation process, 
Georgia is actively developing and amending  
its national legislation in the relevant sectors.  
As a result, the Bank regularly checks legal 
developments and updates with regard to 
environmental, health and safety, and labour 
issues and places great emphasis on the 
improvement of ESDD opportunities. The Bank’s 
staff are very focused on introducing clients to 
information about relevant (existing and new) 
regulations and laws during ESDD with the aim 
to strengthen public knowledge and capacity in 
the area of environmental and social protection.
Training activities play an important role in 
enhancing the implementation of the policy. In 
2017, the Bank provided training opportunities 
for the Head of Social and Environmental Risk 
and the staff involved in environmental and social 
risk management process. The Head of Unit 
participated in the 11th Annual Performance 
Standards Community of Learning organised by 
IFC. The Community of Learning is a knowledge-
sharing forum aimed at strengthening the 
implementation of environmental and social 
standards by financial institutions in emerging 
markets. The event provided a chance to 
exchange experience, learn from investment 
case studies, and engage in dialogue among 
environmental and social risk management 
specialists from all over the globe. Trainings was 
also held for staff and focused on strengthening 
social and environmental due diligence and risk 
management. More generally, the Bank has 
delivered several training sessions in this area 
and consequently more than 100 employees 
were trained during the last three years. Leading 
experts and state inspectors were invited as 
trainers. We intend to continue the trainings in 
the future.
The Bank is committed to respecting the 
principles of sustainable development, protecting 
the environment, and is willing to improve the level 
of public health safety as an essential element for 
sustainable development and economic growth.
The Bank will continue to conduct business 
with due consideration to environmental and 
social protection and contribute to the creation 
of a sustainable society. The Bank will further 
help its clients benefit from a proper and diligent 
implementation of the E&S Policy.
Bank of Georgia also continues to support 
Georgia’s emerging economy by financing 
industries that are of strategic importance  
for the development of the country.
ENERGY
Electricity consumption growth in Georgia  
has averaged 3.6% over the last five years.  
The Bank finances electricity generation  
and transmission companies to support  
the country’s sustainable growth. In 2017,  
the Bank, in collaboration with two other  
local banks, provided a long-term credit facility 
to the electricity distributor in Tbilisi. The total 
financing amounted to GEL 36.0 million.
The Bank financed the construction of a hydro 
power plant (HPP) in Svaneti, in the North West 
of Georgia. The plant has an installed capacity 
of 10.0MW and will contribute on average  
43.0GWh to local energy generation annually. 
Out of the total investment of US$ 10.2 million, 
the Bank financed US$ 9.1 million with EBRD’s 
credit line to SMEs that comply with DCFTA 
requirements. The Bank channels the facility  
to support the companies that are willing to 
upgrade their facilities and invest in modern  
and environmentally-friendly technologies.
HEALTHCARE
In 2017, the Bank financed the Georgian-
German Oncology Research Centre LLC, known 
as “Mardaleishvili Medical Centre”, which is one 
of the leading diagnostic clinics in Georgia. With 
the financing provided by the Bank, the company 
will open a state-of-the-art diagnostic centre in 
Tbilisi, equipped with the latest medical facilities 
acquired from General Electric.
The Bank financed the rehabilitation of Zugdidi’s 
hospital for infectious diseases – the only clinic 
where patients can receive Hepatitis C and  
HIV treatment in Western Georgia’s Samegrelo 
region. The hospital has been fully rehabilitated 
in line with modern standards. With a 25-bed 
capacity, the clinic also serves patients from 
Abkhazia, occupied region of Georgia. The 
treatment of Hepatitis C and HIV is supported 
by the Global fund.
TOURISM
T ourism remains one of the most rapidly 
developing sectors of the Georgian economy.  
The Bank actively provides financing for hotel 
constructions throughout the country. The Bank 
has financed the construction of a hotel in 
Akhasheni, in Georgia’ s Kakheti region to the 
East. The hotel is scheduled to open in the first 
half of 2018 and will be run by local management. 
The hotel is located in the heart of a vineyard and 
will be a part of the Wine Route. This will make 
the hotel a popular destination not only among 
the tourists, but also the local population.
The Bank has recently financed a land acquisition 
in one of the most popular Winter resorts in 
Georgia. The acquired area is reserved for  
a full-scale Winter ski resort development.
In 2017, a contract was signed with Georgian 
Airports Union for the construction of a new 
terminal in Kutaisi International Airport. T otal 
project size is GEL 23 million and the Bank issued 
a guarantee in the amount of GEL 4.6 million  
for financing the construction works. With this 
project, the capacity of Kutaisi International Airport 
will double. In addition to the Bank’ s financial 
support, the Group’ s real estate business m

started developing hotels and signed an exclusive 
agreement with Wyndham Group to develop 
Wyndham’ s three-star Ramada Encore hotel in 
Georgia. First Ramada Encore opened in Tbilisi in 
February 2018. m

 is also developing a four-star 
Ramada hotel in Tbilisi and a three-star Ramada 
Encore in Kutaisi where the international airport 
serves low-cost airlines and makes the city 
popular with tourists visiting Georgia.
EDUCATION
In 2017, the Bank issued financing for a Georgian 
university of GEL 10 million and US$ 4 million. 
Due to increasing demand, the university decided 
to build its fourth campus, which will increase  
its capacity from 7,000 to 12,000 students.
The project includes the construction and 
refurbishment of a ten-floor building with  
a net usable area of 25,000 square metres, 
including 112 new auditoriums, an exam centre, 
a conference hall for 500 guests, a library, a 
swimming pool, a fitness centre among others.
INFRASTRUCTURE
Infrastructure development remains one of the 
most important objectives for Georgia. In 2017, 
the Bank financed several important projects and 
among them is Caucasus Roads Project (CRP) 
– a leading Georgian construction company with 
its main focus on core infrastructure. The Bank 
has partnered with CRP for many years and 
supported the company’s various projects. In 
2017, CRP won a public tender for the design, 
construction and rehabilitation of the Tskneti-
Samadlo and Tskneti-Akhaldaba roads, affected 
by the natural disaster in Tbilisi on 13 June 2015. 
The Bank supported the project by issuing a 
letter of guarantee for US$ 3 million to finance  
the works.
In 2017, the Bank financed several small and 
medium-sized roads, water supply systems  
and other construction projects. The Bank 
issued guarantees for around GEL 130 million  
to support two new projects announced by the 
Department of Roads of the Ministry of Regional 
Development and Infrastructure of Georgia.  
One of the projects is the construction of Batumi 
Bypass Road with a contractual value of around 
GEL 330 million, and another is the construction 
of the E-60 highway section from Zemo Osiauri 
to Chumateleti (central Georgia) with a 
contractual value of GEL 130 million. Both 
projects are part of improving Georgia’s transit 
capacity and increasing the potential of the  
“Silk Road”. In collaboration with EBRD, the 
Bank financed more than 50 kilometres of road 
rehabilitation with GEL 2.7 million in Western 
Georgia’s Samegrelo and Imereti regions.
PRODUCTION AND EXPORT
In 2017, the Bank financed a textile 
manufacturing plant in Western Georgia’s 
Adjara region. The plant produces apparel for 
internationally recognised brands, employing 
more than 2,500 workers from the local 
population.
The Bank supported Atlantic Group, a French 
manufacturer of heating systems and home 
appliance products, with around US$ 2 million 
credit line. The company entered the Georgian 
market in 2017 and intends to commence a 
production process in Kutaisi Free Industrial Zone.
RETAIL BANKING
Bank of Georgia continues to innovate and 
generate a wide range of socially-oriented 
financial products and services that provide 
additional value to individuals and small and 
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and meet 
their respective needs.
EXPRESS BANKING
The Georgian banking sector still experiences 
difficulties in overcoming economic and 
geographical barriers in expanding its financial 
services in remote regions and among 
low-income segments of the population.
Our Express Banking service plays an important 
role in addressing this issue. 46 Annual Report 2017 BGEO Group PLC
• As at 31 December 2017, a network of 156 
Express branches and 2,842 Express Pay 
terminals are located all over the country, 
including in remote mountain regions.
• Express financial products, such as Express 
Card, Express Deposit and Express Loan 
are uncomplicated, easily accessible and 
affordable to a segment of the population 
that would not have access to banking 
products and services otherwise. By 
31 December 2017, the Bank had attracted 
524,366 clients, of which 52,399 became 
clients of the Bank in 2017.
As a part of the Express Banking service, we 
prioritise the development of self-service skills. 
We plan to expand services offered by Express 
Pay terminals. All of these changes will provide 
a more accessible banking service to our clients. 
In 2017, the Bank developed web-based 
application processing tools that enable 
completion of a full lending cycle remotely.
In 2017, we enhanced the functions of  
an Express Student Card. It now offers  
special discounts on public transport and  
free distance banking services, among other 
benefits. Moreover, students can get special 
#StudentBreak discounts in various stores,  
cafes and entertainment centres. Students  
are automatically involved in the PLUS Loyalty 
Scheme – the Bank’s initiative that offers different 
status levels to customers and reward points 
that accumulate based on the client’s business 
with the Bank and can be redeemed into partner 
companies’ products and/or services, at the 
client’s request. PLUS points can also be 
converted into mobile phone top-ups and used 
to pay public transport, utility bills and other 
products. The programme encourages the 
student population to use financial services and 
supports them financially during their studies.
In 2017, Express Bank launched a Student Loan, 
a product with a nine-month grace period on 
principle payments. The application process for  
a Student Loan is fully web-based and once it’s 
approved, the funds get automatically transferred 
to the account of the selected university.
Youth support. We have developed a wide 
range of financial products to support young 
people in Georgia. For example, via special 
conditions of the Child Deposit we provide parents 
with the opportunity to secure their children’ s 
future. Starting from a minimal amount of GEL 10, 
a deposit can be opened for at least two years at 
any time from a child’ s birth until the age of 18. 
The annual interest rate (10.2% for Georgian Lari 
and 1.0%-3.5% for foreign currency) is added  
to the initial deposit. In 2017, we opened 
approximately 11,855 Child Deposit accounts.
The Bank also offers special products that  
allow young people to get a higher education. 
Examples of such products are student loans 
with favourable terms that do not require any 
financial guarantees and collateral. Total portfolio 
of student loans amounted to GEL 790,456 by 
the end of 2017, while loans with a total value  
of GEL 400,852 were issued in 2017.
In 2016, the Bank partnered with the 
International Educational Centre (IEC) and 
created a new opportunity for students to study 
abroad. Students can apply for the loans to 
finance the tuition, living and insurance expenses 
abroad. The loans have a grace period of 
maximum 27 months. With a recommendation 
letter from IEC, the Bank finances the students 
without requesting a confirmation of income. In 
2017, the Bank extended the contract with IEC 
and will continue to support students’ education.
Another example of the Bank’s products  
aimed at supporting young people is a  
social-educational project “sCool Card” – a 
multifunctional card for school children. The main 
objective of the project is to teach children about 
financial culture and build their knowledge around 
financial services at an early stage. sCool Card is 
available at no cost and all of the transactions 
and services are also free of charge. sCool Card 
provides special benefits for children in Georgian 
public and private schools. The benefits include 
free public transport in Tbilisi (metro, buses) and 
Batumi (buses), discounts for entertaining centres 
popular among children, bookstores, toyshops, 
children cafes, as well as the accumulation of 
points (sCoola) with each transaction.
In a further effort to help children better 
understand banking products, the Bank 
opened a sCool Card Business School, where 
experienced staff provide free training about 
topics such as: “The importance of money”, 
“Bank and me”, “Family budget”, “I am a 
manager”, etc. Bank of Georgia and the sCool 
Card are the finalists of the Child Friendly 
Banking Award 2017, The Global Inclusion 
Awards 2017 (Berlin, Germany).
SME SUPPORT
We continue to provide financing to SMEs,  
a backbone of the Georgian economy that 
helps to ensure the sustainable development  
of Georgia. In addition to our own micro-
financing and SME loan programmes, we also 
participate in various programmes that support 
entrepreneurs. Since 2015, the Bank has 
partnered with the non-profit Agricultural 
Projects Management Agency (APMA), which 
supports SMEs in the agricultural sector. 
Together, we have co-financed agricultural 
loans at fixed annual interest rates, which are 
partially subsidised by APMA. In 2017, the total 
amount of loans that the Bank issued to SMEs 
amounted to GEL 1.3 billion, of which GEL 85 
million was issued through the Preferential 
Agriculture Lending Programme. In 2017, the 
Bank continued to reinforce financing micro 
business owners and considers this segment 
as one of the main areas of its portfolio growth.
The Bank has dedicated staff and established 
processes for its new product “micro-express 
loans” that targets the micro business segment 
and offers loans under GEL 10,000. Increasing 
the automation and digitilisation is one of the 
cornerstones of the Bank’s micro lending 
strategy. In 2016, the Bank partnered with  
the European Bank for Reconstruction and 
Development (EBRD) to offer the market a 
much needed local currency funding. Bank of 
Georgia is committed to further extending its 
financing to SMEs. Furthermore, the Bank is 
keen to develop financial products and lending 
practices to specifically service women-led 
SMEs, which will ultimately increase their 
involvement in developing Georgia’s private 
sector. The loan facility signed with EBRD 
enables the Bank to issue longer-term local 
currency loans and to provide essential financial 
support for micro, small and medium-sized 
enterprises in adhering to DCFTA requirements, 
as well as underserved women entrepreneurs.
In addition to assisting the SMEs financially,  
the Bank launched an SME portal in September 
2017. The portal provides financial and 
business-related advice to entrepreneurs in 
order to upgrade their financial literacy and 
management skills and ensure the sustainable 
development of their businesses. The portal 
provides entrepreneurs with information on 
trainings and equips them with knowledge and 
skills in accounting, legal documents, business 
development, sales and marketing.
Environmental and social risk management 
processes of SME clients are embedded 
throughout the Bank’s activities. By ensuring  
that comprehensive environmental and social 
risk assessments and the necessary action plans 
are undertaken, we encourage our SME clients 
to be in compliance with national environmental 
and social legislation. During site visits, we 
provide our clients with advice and guidance  
on good practice and standards in these areas. 
We update them on environmental, health and 
safety, as well as labour issues and monitor  
their compliance with environmental and social 
legislation. In many cases of noncompliance,  
our proper and timely management of the 
environmental and social risks of our SME clients 
has helped them to address issues that would 
otherwise have resulted in financial and legal 
sanctions from the state enforcement agency.
AFFORDABLE HOUSING
Currently, the Georgian real estate market is 
vulnerable to various economic and financial 
uncertainties. Numerous construction projects 
remain unfinished for long periods of time, while 
there is a strong growing demand for housing 
from the Georgian population. In response to 
this increasing demand, the Group’s real estate 
development business, m
2
 Real Estate was 
established in order to offer affordable housing 
to the emerging middle class in Georgia and to 
young families especially. Nowadays, m
2
 is a 
major player in Georgia’s real estate market, 
offering its customers turnkey apartments with 
fine-tuned infrastructure: fire-alarm systems  
in accordance with international standards, 
round-the-clock security service, maintenance 
of elevators, as well as common and green 
areas. m
2
 Real Estate has completed seven 
projects so far and has delivered them to its 
customers within, and frequently, ahead of  
the agreed deadlines.
The company plans the design and construction 
processes so that each square metre is 
distributed efficiently. m
2
 uses energy efficient 
construction components, thus bringing energy 
efficiency of its buildings up to 43%, which in turn 
translates into lower utility expenses incurred by 
the tenants. The level of energy savings in m
2
’s 
buildings is significantly above that of the average 
residential properties in Tbilisi. m
2
 tailors the 
apartments to its customers’ needs and wishes, 
allowing them to choose interior design and 
materials for a fit-out themselves. Since only  
a few customers can afford to buy large flats  
with an area exceeding 100 square metres, the 
company continuously works to optimise the size 
of its apartments to meet the current demand

without compromising convenience and usability 
of the apartments. In June 2017, m
2
 acquired BK 
construction LLC, a local real estate construction 
company, which is expected to reduce m
2
’s 
construction costs and improve the design 
management process through vertical integration.
A large segment of m
2
’s customers is made up 
of young Georgian families (more than 50% of 
the company’s customers are 23-42 years old). 
We believe that by continuing to offer affordable 
housing products, we are helping them to 
significantly enhance the quality of their lives 
and enjoy modern living standards.
SPONSORSHIP AND CHARITY
As part of our sponsorship and charitable 
activities, the Group continues to focus on 
promoting and enhancing access to education, 
conserving nature, supporting people with 
disabilities and special needs, developing social 
enterprises and facilitating innovative projects 
that focus on social goods. The Group’s 
Sponsorship and Charity Policy encourages 
partnerships with various foundations and 
Non-governmental Organisations (NGOs) to 
deliver sustainable results and bring positive 
change. Sponsorship and charity funds are 
channelled through the Bank’s Tree of Life 
Foundation that, in its turn, distributes funding by 
means of grant competitions in order to ensure 
transparent and fair methods of financing. The 
Group also implements its own social projects.
Tree of Life has allocated around 
GEL 2.5 million to support education, nature 
conservation, people with disabilities and 
special needs, social platforms, and 
development of social entrepreneurship.
Bank of Georgia together with the Tree of Life 
Foundation established a charity platform 
www.donate.ge, which connects the people  
in need with those who are willing to donate 
items, clothes, books, etc. The platform offers 
collection, sorting and delivery of items.
Bank of Georgia recognises the impact it  
can have on the country’s social-economic 
development. Therefore, the Bank launched  
a grant programme to support socially driven 
enterprises in Georgia. In 2017 and 2016, Bank 
of Georgia supported five social enterprises 
with up to GEL 200,000 and GEL 50,000 per 
project, respectively. At the same time, the 
Bank provided pro-bono services by helping 
the businesses in areas such as marketing, 
public relations, information technology, etc. 
The Bank partners with various NGOs to 
maximise its role in the social cause.
GGU regularly runs charitable activities for the 
social service agency Child and Environment and 
international humanitarian network Catharsis in 
Tbilisi. GGU covers the annual water supply 
expenses for Child and Environment – the 
agency that cares for homeless children and 
children with disabilities. Twice a year GGU 
sponsors the project Dinner for Everyone, which 
is organised by Catharsis for approximately 
3,000 people.
Aldagi supports many socially vulnerable people 
by one-time help upon special requests. The 
company traditionally provides a home for at 
least one family every Christmas. Aldagi’s 
employees are engaged in various programmes 
that supply socially vulnerable people with food 
and first aid kits.
As part of its sponsorship activities, Teliani 
Valley focuses on promoting a healthy lifestyle. 
As the sponsors of the Georgian Rugby Union 
and National Olympic Committee, the company 
aims to attract more youngsters to healthy 
activities. The company is a main sponsor of 
the Georgian Tag Rugby initiative that is the 
biggest platform for raising awareness of a 
healthy lifestyle among school children.
GHG supported the construction of a children’s 
hospice, which aims to create a friendly and 
comfortable atmosphere, where, in addition  
to caring personnel, a great importance is 
attached to the environment and the interior. 
GHG traditionally participates in the state 
Children’s Oncology Programme, under  
which the company offers cancer-related 
conditions treatment for children with different 
cancer disorders (leukaemia, tumours, and 
lymphomas) in GHG’s Iashvili Paediatric Tertiary 
Referral Hospital, a multi-profile paediatric 
medical establishment.
Promoting and enhancing access to 
education. Bank of Georgia University has 
offered a top quality master’ s degree programme 
since its foundation in 2014. The university 
welcomed its fourth intake of MBA students in 
2017 and simultaneously launched a bachelor’ s 
degree programme. The cost of studies in 2017 
were again largely subsidised by the Bank with 
GEL 350,250. Up to 20 students study at no 
cost, while 40 students benefit from a 0% loan 
with grace period until graduation. Bank of 
Georgia University provides its students with 
hands-on experience by offering them the 
possibility to observe various business  
processes at the Group’ s companies.
In 2013, the Bank became the first Georgian 
company to cooperate with one of the most 
prestigious scholarship programmes in the 
world – the Chevening scholarship. This 
cooperation provides Georgian students with 
an opportunity to pursue education in the UK. 
In 2017, the Group provided GBP 89,532 to 
finance a master’s degree programme for three 
students. The partnership with Chevening will 
continue next year and the Group is looking 
forward to selecting students who will continue 
their studies in the UK.
In 2014, the Bank signed a partnership 
agreement with the prestigious US Fulbright 
scholarship scheme. Thanks to the Bank of 
Georgia’s contribution, a selected number of 
students from Georgia are able to enrol in a 
two-year master’s degree programme at a US 
university. In 2017, the funding provided to the 
students for their two-year degrees amounted 
to US$ 50,000. Since 2014, the Bank has 
granted US$ 250,000 to the US Fulbright 
scholarship programme.
For the last four years the Bank has been 
supporting a public speaking competition 
organised by the English Speaking Union 
Georgia. The competition allows high school 
senior year or university freshman students to 
prepare a speech on a pre-selected topic and 
present it in front of a competent jury. The winner 
is granted a fully paid trip to London to attend a 
global public speaking competition. We aim to 
support this competition in 2018 as well.
The Bank has been supporting every single  
TEDx Tbilisi conference since they were first 
organised in 2012. A TEDx conference is a locally 
organised TED format event, where communities, 
organisations and individuals join to initiate a 
conversation and connect with each other on 
different topics, which are important to society.
In 2017, m
2
 Real Estate’s subsidiary BK 
Construction signed a memorandum of 
cooperation with the Ministry of Education 
and Science of Georgia. According to the 
memorandum, m
2
 will build an institute for 
vocational education in the Municipality of 
Zestaponi (Western Georgia). The institute  
will offer more than 20 short-term vocational 
courses in engineering to more than 200 
students annually. The studies will include both 
theoretical and practical courses. The latter will 
be conducted on m
2
’s construction sites. Most 
of the alumna will be employed by m
2
 and its 
subsidiary BK Construction.
Supporting people with disabilities. Since 
2014, the Bank has focused its efforts on 
supporting people with disabilities – one of  
the most vulnerable social groups in Georgia. 
In 2017, the Bank donated GEL 78,200 to  
the Tree of Life Foundation for this cause. The 
Foundation distributed the funds through grant 
competitions – one intended for the relevant 
NGOs that work with people with disabilities 
and another with the specific aim of promoting 
social entrepreneurship. In order to qualify for 
the competition, the proposals had to focus on 
the creation of a small enterprise with a social 
component aimed at improving the livelihood of 
people with disabilities.
The Bank continues to focus on the adaptation 
of its own infrastructure. In 2017, an additional 
nine service centres became available for 
people with disabilities.
m
2
 is in the process of constructing a new 
specialised family-type home for children with 
severe disabilities. The project is built in Tbilisi 
within the framework of Protection of Children 
with Disabilities – a project run by the United 
States Agency for International Development 
(USAID). The project is being carried out by the 
Ministry of Labour, Health and Social Affairs, 
USAID and United Nations Children’s Fund 
(UNICEF) since 2015. The goal of the specialised 
home is to ensure that the children receive care in 
a family-like environment and are provided with all 
the services necessary for their adequate growth, 
individual development and smooth integration 
into society. After construction and renovation 
works are completed, seven children with severe 
forms of disability will be moved to live in the 
house. It is worth noting that all m
2
 buildings are 
friendly to people with special needs.
Conserving nature. Another priority of the 
Group’s charitable activities is the preservation  
of wildlife diversity. In 2017, the Bank granted 
US$ 100,000 to the Caucasus Nature Fund 
(CNF)* to provide support to the Protected Areas 
of Georgia. Bank of Georgia allocated GEL 1 
million for restoration of the forests destroyed  
by the wildfires in the summer of 2017. 48 Annual Report 2017 BGEO Group PLC

In 2017, Bank of Georgia launched a car 
pooling app “Gzad” for its employees. The 
application enables them to share a ride to  
and from the Bank, which in turn helps reduce 
air pollution and ease the traffic in Tbilisi.
In 2017, GGU granted GEL 250,000 to restore 
a forest in Borjomi Gorge after a massive 
wildfire in August 2017.
In 2017, m
2
 committed to restoring a landscape 
and a burnt territory of 20,000 square metres  
on Tbilisi’s Mtatsminda slope. The works are 
conducted jointly with Tbilisi City Hall, Caucasus 
Environmental NGO Network (CENN), Regional 
Environmental Centre for the Caucasus (REC 
Caucasus), the Greens Movement of Georgia 
(GMG), botanical institute of Ilia State University 
and the Ministry of Environment and Natural 
Resources of Georgia. m

 was also one of the 
sponsors of the all-time football stars charity 
game held at Tbilisi Dinamo Arena, dedicated  
to the restoration of the forest burnt in Borjomi 
Gorge in August 2017.
Air quality is an immediate and acute problem  
in Georgian cities, affecting people’s quality 
of life. In order to increase awareness of 
climate change and contribute to a healthier 
environment, m
2
 actively promotes electric 
vehicles. As part of its spring campaign, the 
company offered its customers electric scooters 
as a gift. Moreover, throughout 2017 m
2
 
contributed to developing infrastructure for 
electric vehicles by financially supporting a 
start-up company E-space with the installation of 
up to 50 charging stations in the country (Tbilisi, 
Batumi, Kutaisi, Rustavi, Kvareli and Telavi).
GHG contributed GEL 500,000 to rehabilitate 
the damaged area and to help restore the 
remarkable nature in Borjomi. With the support 
of the CNF, the company is involved in the 
Project on Maintenance of Caucasus Natural 
and Cultural Heritage. The fund is meant  
for effective long-term management of the 
protected territories of Armenia, Azerbaijan and 
Georgia. In 2017 GHG donated GEL 52,800  
to support the project.
EMPLOYEE MATTERS
A key factor to our success is a cohesive and 
professional team, capable of accomplishing the 
Group’ s objectives. We are committed to attracting 
and identifying the best professionals, caring and 
planning for their needs, investing in their 
development and fostering their commitment.
The Human Capital Management (HCM) 
department and the management system it 
implements play a vital role in managing our 
most valuable resources – our employees. The 
HCM department develops Human Resource 
(HR) policies and procedures which determine 
key principles, areas, approaches and methods 
that are crucial for building HCM systems for all 
our businesses.
Examples of some of our HR policies and 
procedures include, but are not limited to:
• employee planning and recruiting
• staff administration
• compensation and benefits
• code of conduct
• employee development and training
• human rights
• grievances
• retrenchment
• anti-nepotism
The Bank’ s HCM department works closely with 
HR managers and executives from our subsidiaries 
in order to ensure proper implementation of the 
main principles and the provision of necessary 
support in all HR-related matters.
We recognise the importance of observing 
human rights and are committed to 
implementing socially responsible business 
practices. Our Human Rights Policy establishes 
priorities and puts control procedures in place 
to provide equal opportunities and prevent 
discrimination or harassment on any grounds, 
including disability. Our Human Rights Policy 
applies to all employees and includes 
procedures in relation to employment 
processes (including recruitment procedures 
and procedures governing the continuity of 
employment of employees who become 
disabled during the course of their 
employment), training and development.
We are committed to employee engagement. 
We believe that the knowledge of our Group is 
key and we strive to provide our employees with 
a continuous flow of information, which includes 
but is not limited to information about our 
corporate culture, the Group’s strategy and 
performance, risks relating to its performance, 
such as financial and economic factors, and our 
policies and procedures. We provide information 
in a number of ways, including via managers, 
presentations, intranet, email and regular town 
hall and off-site meetings. We also value the 
views of our employees. We consult with them 
regularly and have implemented feedback 
systems, such as frequent employee satisfaction 
surveys, which ensure that opinions of our 
employees are taken into account when making 
decisions which are likely to affect their interests. 
Employee feedback also helps to improve our 
customer-focused approach.
In order to ensure pay is competitive, the Bank 
monitors employee pay satisfaction via labour 
market compensation surveys in the banking 
industry. The results of the 2017 survey confirm 
that the Bank remains a competitive employer.
In 2017, the Bank conducted Barrett 
Organisational Values assessment. The  
results enable us to measure and manage 
organisational culture. In 2017, we focused on 
identifying the personal, current and desired 
organisational cultures in the Bank. Cultural 
alignment ensures positive outcomes such  
as job satisfaction, employee retention and 
engagement. Based on the survey results, our 
cultural entropy is currently 7% (cultural entropy 
score ≤10% is considered healthy). We are in 
the process of creating a holistic view of the 
cultural factors in performance indicators.
TALENT ATTRACTION
Sustained development of the Group’s 
businesses requires the strengthening of the 
teams of our subsidiaries both by using the 
Group’s own significant internal resources 
through staff development and rotation and by 
attracting external candidates. Our recruitment 
policy and relevant control procedures ensure

an unbiased hiring process that provides equal 
employment opportunities for all candidates.
According to the HR Policy, internal candidates 
have priority when filling vacant positions, 
especially in situations where there are 
vacancies in top and middle management. 
Thus, in 2017, 266 Group employees were 
promoted to managerial positions.
In order to attract young talent, we actively  
partner with leading Georgian business schools 
and universities, participate in job fairs and run 
extensive internship programmes aimed at the 
professional development of young professionals. 
In 2012, Bank of Georgia established a new 
format for its traditional internship programme and 
constantly develops it. The programme attracts 
promising graduates and provides them with the 
opportunity to participate in professional trainings. 
Interns are directly coached by the Bank’ s 
executives and middle managers to help them  
on their path to gaining their first management 
positions in the near future. In 2016, the Company 
successfully completed a talent acquisition project 
for its Investment Officer position and launched it 
in 2017 as well. The project selects a number of 
young and talented candidates for various 
assignments within BGEO Group. In 2017, the 
number of young professionals (under 30 years 
old) represented 32% of the total headcount.
In 2017, GGU, in collaboration with Georgia’ s 
Innovation and T echnology Agency, organised a 
project for talented and motivated young people 
with technical academic backgrounds for the 
second consecutive year since its initial launch in 
2016. Participants had the opportunity to work  
on and introduce technological solutions to real 
challenges that the company is facing in the fields 
of water supply and sewerage systems. T welve 
authors of the best projects were offered a job 
and they are successfully continuing their  
work and development within the company.
GGU has been working in collaboration with 
the country’s leading universities, professional 
colleges and their career services to attract  
new talent. The collaborations are bound by the 
memoranda with Free University and, the latest, 
with San Diego State University, according to 
which the students will engage in GGU’s 
traineeship programmes and benefit from 
practical experience received at the company.
In 2017, a GHG’s human resources department 
organised job fairs for students in leading 
medical universities and nursing colleges in  
Tbilisi and other regions. The company’s 
healthcare services business attracted more 
than 300 students to its nursing course. GHG 
has memoranda of understanding with various 
nursing colleges and universities. In 2017, GHG’s 
Evex Learning Centre conducted six-month free 
nursing courses for 278 students from nursing 
colleges. 72 graduates were offered jobs at the 
company’s healthcare services facilities.
In 2017, GHG signed a special memorandum 
with “Panatsea” – the biggest nursing college in 
Tbilisi, whose students will undergo 18 months 
of practical training at GHG’s hospitals. The top 
five students will get a grant from Evex.
TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT
To manage our employees in a way that best 
supports our business strategy, we seek to  
help them contribute to business performance 
through personal and professional development. 
Following our aspiration to develop strong 
leaders, we have developed an extensive 
leadership development programme.
The Group’s corporate learning system is 
comprised of a wide range of internal and 
external training sessions specifically designed 
to meet the needs of front and back office 
employees at the Group’s subsidiaries including 
banking, energy and utilities, real estate 
development, healthcare and insurance. Middle 
– and senior-level employees are given the 
opportunity to receive external training in well 
known training institutions outside of Georgia.
In 2014-2015, Bank of Georgia launched a 
Leadership Development Executive Coaching 
programme. It provides an individual approach 
towards developing leadership skills. The 
programme continued to run successfully 
throughout 2017 and further expanded  
to lower leadership levels, having benefited  
its participants with a personally tailored 
development experience. Employees involved 
in the programme gained a greater awareness 
of their leadership strengths and opportunities 
for future growth. Based on its previous years’ 
experience, the Bank has refined its Leadership 
Development System together with the 360 
degree feedback process.
The Bank highly values the talent of its  
employees and provides various talent retention 
activities engaging them through leadership 
development and various professional certification 
programmes. BOG creates different development 
opportunities for employees in terms of career 
and personal growth. Internal promotions are  
part of the talent attraction and retention system 
and also create a basis for employee loyalty  
and retention. The Bank also offers competitive 
remuneration and benefit packages for its 
employees and supports work-life balance by 
providing additional paid days off, in addition to 
those in the Labour Code of Georgia. The Bank 
also encourages engagement and dedication of 
its talented employees with awards made to the 
Best Employee and T eam of the Year.
Each of the Group’s businesses has developed 
an extensive training programme for front office 
employees in order to provide them with relevant 
skills, such as effective communication and 
building strong and valued client relationships. 
For example, the Bank’s mentoring programme 
is part of a front office training process. Every 
new employee is provided with regular advice, 
guidance and practical instructions from an 
appointed mentor, who later participates in  
the new employee’s performance evaluation. 
Through this programme, we aim to provide 
individual support to our employees in achieving 
their professional goals.
In 2017, the Bank launched an online  
Learning Management System (LMS), enabling 
employees to easily and comfortably access 
corporate learning opportunities. The Bank also 
started updating the managerial induction and 
onboarding programmes, which will cover 
employees at all levels.

the Group companies. In BOG, the Corporate 
and Information Security department is in charge 
of implementing and monitoring controls related 
to anti-bribery issues. The department has the 
procedures in place, which define the process of 
establishing relationships with vendors, undertaking 
public tenders, etc. The Corporate and Information 
Security department provides annual online 
training for employees on anti-bribery issues, 
which are also included in induction trainings.
As an organization that is fully committed to 
prevention of bribery and corruption, the Bank 
ensures that appropriate internal controls are in 
place and operating effectively.
Anti-bribery and anti-corruption policy 
enforcement processes include:
• Operating an internal whistleblowing and

hospitality, offered to, or received by the  
Bank personnel;
• Voluntary disclosure of corrupt conduct;
• Third party screening to identify the level of 
risk third parties might pose;
• Informing the banks/partners/counterparties 
about anti-corruption and anti-bribery 
principles before commencement of 
business relations;
• Ensuring that anti-bribery and anti-corruption 
clauses are incorporated in the agreements 
with customers and third parties
• Ensuring that anti-bribery and anti-corruption 
matters are included in contractual 
agreements with partners /counterparties
• Online training programs aiming raising 
awareness in corruption and bribery issues 
among employees
As part of the Group’s third party screening to 
identify the level of risk the third parties might 
pose, the Group carries out the following due 
diligence processes: indirect investigations  
which includes general research of the activities 
undertaken by the proposed business partners, 
their reputation and information whether the 
company is a related party.
OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY
Ensuring the safety of the workplace and 
providing healthy working conditions are among 
the Group’s fundamental HR management 
principles. The Group pays particular attention to 
preventive measures, such as conducting regular 
staff training and medical check-ups, certifying 
workplaces and promoting a healthy lifestyle.
In order to enhance the awareness of employees 
and contractors regarding health and safety risks 
associated with construction work, the company 
conducts regular training and educational 
seminars. In 2015, 2016 and 2017, the number 
of health and safety training hours amounted to 
approximately 110, 70 and 86, respectively.

 Real Estate publishes brochures and 
booklets with warnings and special rules to be 
followed when working on sites. Respective 
control procedures include quarterly audits  
by external health and safety consultants and 
internal monthly inspections of m
2
 Real Estate 
worksites. In addition, m
2
 has a comprehensive 
reporting procedure for health and safety 
concerns. With regard to emergency 
preparedness and response, m
2
 follows an 
Emergency Management Plan. This outlines 
possible scenarios during emergency situations 
and determines specific strategies for the 
company’s employees, contractors and visitors 
on how to react when in a crisis situation.
ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS
The Group recognises that its operations  
have both an indirect and direct impact on  
the environment, and therefore seeks to 
establish management approaches which will 
help it become a more environmentally-friendly 
institution. Being the leading financial institution 
in Georgia, the Bank, through the projects it 
finances, produces significant indirect impacts 
on the environment. In order to properly 
manage this impact, the Bank has implemented 
Environmental and Social Policy and Risk 
Management procedures, as detailed in the 
“Social matters” section.
As for the direct environmental impact,  
we believe that the impact of the banking  
and insurance businesses is not significant. 
Nevertheless, we undertake a number of 
measures to reduce electricity, paper, water and 
fuel consumption. “Green Boxes” are placed  
on every floor of the Bank’s headquarters and 
are designated to collect paper for recycling 
purposes. In 2017, the lighting system in all of 
the Bank’s service centres was replaced with 
energy efficient LED lamps, which consume far 
less electricity than traditional economical ones. 
30W lamps were replaced with more energy 
efficient 12W lamps, and 40-60W light bulbs 
with 11W. Furthermore, installation of modern 
computer technology resulted in reduction of 
energy consumption from 500-800W per unit  
to 150-300W. Centralised uninterruptible power 
supply is being installed in the Bank’s service 
centres, which will save considerable energy 
resources compared to individual systems.
The most significant direct impact on the 
environment within the Group is created by 
our real estate development business, m
2
  
Real Estate. The company addresses industry-
specific environmental issues and undertakes 
appropriate measures to manage them. The 
company’s projects are constructed with 
impeccable attention to energy efficient  
design for sustainable development, which 
achieves energy savings over the long term.
Aiming to increase efficient use of energy,  
water and materials, m
2
 installs energy efficient 
lighting systems and uses low emissivity 
window glasses and other modern insulation 
materials to cover a facade of the buildings. 
This reduces a U-value of constructed buildings 
to 0.21W/m
2
K. As a result, it is expected that 
utility costs in these buildings will be cut by  
up to 43%, compared to average residential 
buildings in Georgia.
GGU is currently in the process of implementing 
an Environmental and Social Management 
System (ESMS) in accordance with the roadmap 
schedule presented in the Environmental & Social 
Policy Framework, adopted by the company in 
2016. ESMS is in compliance with the Georgian 
legislation and IFC performance standards 
(Environmental, Health and Safety guidelines  
for Water and Sanitation). As part of the ESMS, 
environmental and social audit of the company 
has been performed. The audit report covers the 
environmental issues that are mainly associated 
with water treatment, water distribution, 
sanitation (sewerage system) and wastewater 
treatment and discharge, as well as occupational 
health and safety issues related to accidents  
and injuries, chemical exposure, noise, etc. To 
manage and mitigate the risks associated with 
GGU’s business, the company has elaborated 
ESMS procedures and topical management 
plans, which are implemented according to the 
Environmental and Social Action Plan (ESAP)  
in the set timeframe. ESMS will facilitate the 
process of obtaining the ISO14000 standard for 
environmental management and the ISO26000 
standard for social responsibility.
GHG’s most significant environmental impact  
is associated with the generation of medical 
waste. The company developed medical waste 
management record keeping standards. GHG’s 
personnel is responsible for filling out daily and 
weekly forms, such as: waste registration form, 
waste information form and hazardous waste 
transportation form. Special storing rooms  
were set up in GHG’s hospitals, to place waste 
before final disposal. To prevent human and 
environmental harm, the company’s clinics 
collect and dispose of medical and biological 
waste through an outsourced service 
specialising in medical waste disposal. For  
waste collection, GHG uses plastic bags that 
have sufficient strength and are secured with 
staples to safely retain waste. Also, the company 
does not fill more than two-thirds of the bags’ 
capacity. Further, steam sterilisation is used to 
decontaminate biological and bio hazardous 
waste, including blood. All used sharps are 
placed only in the labelled, hermetic single-use 
special containers made of hard plastic. Waste is 
collected from GHG’s sites daily, or twice a day 
when required. The maximum on-site storage 
time of waste is up to 24 hours.
METHODOLOGY
We have reported on all of the emission sources 
required under the Companies Act 2006 (Strategic 
Report and Directors’ Report) Regulations 2013 
(Scopes 1 and 2) and additionally have reported on 
those emissions under Scope 3 that are applicable 
to our business. All reported sources fall within  
our Consolidated Financial Statements, which 
can be found on pages 118 to 212. We do not 
have responsibility for any emission sources that 
are not included in our Consolidated Financial 
Statements.
In preparing our emissions data, we have  
used the World Resources Institute/World 
Business Council for Sustainable Development 
(WRI/WBCSD) Greenhouse Gas Protocol: 
A Corporate Accounting and Reporting 
Standard (revised edition) and emissions factors 
from the UK Government’s Greenhouse Gas 
Conversion Factors for Company Reporting 
2016. For wastewater treatment and discharge 
operations we used conversion factors from 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse 
Gas Inventories.

OVERVIEW OF FINANCIAL RESULTS
Record annual results driven by strong performance across all businesses
In its final year before the forthcoming demerger, supported by the continued macroeconomic performance of Georgia, BGEO Group has 
delivered another year of strong earnings momentum. Growth and returns in both the Banking Business and the Investment Businesses, now 
renamed Georgia Capital, continue to be high. Following the completion of the demerger, we are confident both companies are independently 
extremely well positioned to continue their excellent recent track record for many years to come.
In line with IFRS requirements, the Group reviewed the classification of its operating segments at 31 December 2017. Given the expectation, in line 
with Georgia Capital’s strategy it is highly probable the Group will own less than a 50% stake in GHG at the end of 2018*. As a result, and in line with 
IFRS, the Group classified GHG as “disposal group held for sale” and its results of operations are reported under “discontinued operations” line as 
a single amount in the consolidated income statement. Comparative periods have been restated accordingly to reflect reclassification of GHG from 
“continuing operations” into “discontinued operations.” Assets and liabilities held by GHG are also presented separately in the consolidated balance 
sheet as of 31 December 2017 under “assets of disposal group held for sale” and “liabilities of disposal group held for sale.”

BANKING BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS
OUTSTANDING PROFITABILITY AND 
BALANCE SHEET GROWTH MOMENTUM
• The Banking Business generated a 
record profit of GEL 369.5 million in 2017 
(up 25.0% y-o-y), while ROAE reached 
25.2% in 2017 (up 300 bps y-o-y)
• Asset quality improved during 2017. 
NPLs to gross loans ratio decreased to 3.8% 
at 31 December 2017 (4.2% at 31 December 
2016). NPL coverage ratio was strong at 
92.7% at 31 December 2017 (86.7% at 
31 December 2016), while the NPL coverage 
ratio adjusted for discounted value of 
collateral stood at 130.6% at 31 December 
2017 (132.1% at 31 December 2016).  
The asset quality improvement positively 
impacted the cost of risk ratio, which stood 
at 2.2% in 2017 (2.7% in 2016)
• Retail Banking (“RB”) continued to 
deliver strong growth across all its 
business lines. Retail Banking revenue 
reached GEL 614.7 million in 2017, up 
24.4% y-o-y. The number of Retail Banking 
clients reached 2.3 million at the end of 
2017, up 8.1% from 2.1 million at the  
end of 2016
• Our Retail Banking product to client ratio 
increased to 2.2 in 2017 from 2.0 in 2016. 
In 4Q17 we completed the transformation  
of our Retail Banking operations from a 
product-based model into a client-centric 
model, as well as the implementation of the 
client-centric model in our branches. As of 
31 December 2017, we had 86 transformed 
branches. We continue to see outstanding 
growth in sales volumes and the number  
of products sold to our clients in these 
branches, contributing to 29.3% y-o-y 
growth in the retail loan book
• The loan book growth on a constant-
currency basis reached 17.4% at 
31 December 2017. As a result, Retail 
Banking’s loan book share in the total  
loan portfolio was 68.0% at 31 December 
2017 (60.9% at 31 December 2016).  
The Retail Banking net loan book reached  
GEL 5,044 million at 31 December 2017,  
up 29.3% y-o-y. The growth on a constant- 
currency basis was 30.6% y-o-y
• Retail Banking client deposits increased 
to GEL 3,267.3 million at 31 December 
2017, up 35.4% y-o-y. Growth on a 
constant-currency basis was 37.4% y-o-y
• Corporate Investment Banking (“CIB”) 
resumed growth in 4Q17 after delivering 
on its risk de-concentration and loan 
portfolio repositioning targets in 3Q17. 
CIB’s net loan book amounted to  
GEL 2,260.1 million at 31 December 2017, 
down 5.6% y-o-y, but up 13.4% q-o-q. The 
top ten CIB client exposure was 10.7% at 
31 December 2017, down from 11.8% at 
31 December 2016. Consequently, CIB’s 
profit increased to GEL 105.9 million in 2017 
(up 19.9% y-o-y) and CIB ROAE reached 
17.6% in 2017 (up from 14.7% in 2016)
• Investment Management’s Assets Under 
Management (“AUM”) increased to  
GEL 1,857.5 million, up 17.9% y-o-y, 
reflecting higher bond issuance activity  
by our brokerage arm Galt & Taggart
• IFRS 9 implementation delivered – no 
impact on capital adequacy ratios.  
The Group has completed its IFRS 9 
implementation programme and adopted 
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments from 1 January 
2018. The Banking Business will recognise 
the estimated impact from IFRS 9 adoption 
of approximately GEL 31.5 million, gross of 
income tax, as a reduction to shareholders’ 
equity at the transition date on 1 January 
2018. As allowed by IFRS 9, the Group will 
not be restating prior-period data. IFRS 9 
does not have any impact on regulatory 
capital and capital adequacy ratios. 
Through-the-cycle cost of risk is expected 
to remain unchanged. NPL coverage ratio, 
adjusted for additional IFRS 9 allowance, 
was 102.9% as at 31 December 2017
• Amendments to Capital Adequacy 
requirements. In order to transition to 
 Basel III, the National Bank of Georgia 
(“NBG”) introduced new capital adequacy 
requirements in December 2017. As a result 
of the changes, Bank of Georgia became 
subject to the following minimum capital 
requirements at 31 December 2017:
 – Common Equity Tier 1 ratio 8.1%, 
expected to increase to 9.5% on 
31 December 2018
 – Tier 1 ratio 9.9%, expected to increase 
to 11.4% on 31 December 2018
 – Total Capital ratio 12.4%, expected to 
increase to 16.0% on 31 December 
2018
 At 31 December 2017, both of Bank of 
Georgia’s Common Equity Tier 1 and Tier 1 
ratios were 12.4%, while Total Capital ratio 
was 17.9%. Transition to Basel III is not 
expected to affect the Bank’s growth 
prospects or its ability to maintain dividend 
distributions within the existing dividend 
policy payout range. 54 Annual Report 2017 BGEO Group PLC
OVERVIEW OF FINANCIAL RESULTS CONTINUED
INVESTMENT BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS
• Our utility and energy business, GGU, 
delivered a stable performance in 2017. 
GGU continued its investments in water 
pipeline infrastructure, leading to continued 
growth in the regulated asset base and 
reduction of the respective water losses. 
Due to successfully implemented efficiency 
projects, GGU was able to significantly 
reduce its own electricity consumption in 
2017. GGU also continued the construction 
works on the 50MW Mestiachala HPPs in 
North-Western Georgia, while the 44.3MW 
Zoti HPPs entered their construction phase
• In December 2017, the Georgian National 
Energy and Water Supply Regulatory 
Commission (“GNERC”) approved new 
tariffs for water and waste-water services, 
which have been updated according to the 
new Regulatory Asset Base methodology 
adopted by GNERC in August 2017. The 
new tariffs have been set for a three-year 
regulatory period, effective from 1 January 
2018. As a result, tariffs in Tbilisi have 
increased by 23.8% for residential 
customers and decreased by 0.4% for  
legal entities

more to the retail market. New product 
development initiatives and enhancements 
of existing products resulted in more than 
19,000 livestock insurance policies and 
3,334 travel and trip insurance policies 
sold across the country in 2017
• In 2017 Aldagi signed major third-party 
partnership agreements with two 
Georgian banks, JSC Liberty Bank and 
JSC Credo Bank to successfully diversify  
its multi-channel distribution network, which 
will enable Aldagi to successfully tap into 
Georgia’s underpenetrated retail insurance 
segment
• Our beverage business, Teliani, achieved 
significant milestones during 2017 and 
launched its mainstream beer and 
lemonade production in June 2017 and 
August 2017, respectively. Teliani is on 
track to brew Heineken and Krusovice beers 
in 2018 under a ten-year exclusive license 
agreement to produce Heineken brands  
in Georgia, and to sell into the Caucasus 
region countries. Teliani also continued to 
diversify its distribution portfolio, with the 
addition of the exclusive right to import and 
distribute Lavazza coffee in Georgia, and 
winning other non-alcoholic beverage 
distribution contracts in 2017
• In February 2018, we acquired a 100% 
equity stake in a leading Georgian craft 
beer producer, Black Lion LLC (Black 
Lion). Black Lion is the largest producer of  
a premium class craft beer in Georgia that 
launched sales in the beginning of 2016 and 
sold approximately 300,000 litres of craft 
beer in 2017, primarily targeting restaurants 
and bars in Tbilisi
• Our healthcare business, GHG, continued 
to deliver on its strategic priorities across 
its businesses. Healthcare services EBITDA 
margin continued to be high at 26.4% in 
2017, notwithstanding the dilutive effect  
of the significant roll-out of the two major 
hospital renovations and the ongoing roll-out 
of a nationwide chain of polyclinics 
(outpatient clinics). In the pharmacy 
business we have made significant progress 
towards the integration of our two recently 
acquired businesses, whilst avoiding any 
significant business disruption. As a result, 
the EBITDA margin of 8.6% for the year has 
already successfully exceeded our target of 
“more than 8%” margin
• In January 2018, GHG’s medical 
insurance arm signed a new medical 
insurance agreement with the Georgian 
Ministry of Internal Affairs, the country’s 
largest insurance client by number of 
insured customers of c.65,000. As a result, 
the number of GHG’s insured individuals 
reached approximately 155,000 55 Annual Report 2017 BGEO Group PLC

PERFORMANCE HIGHLIGHTS
In the Banking Business, 2017 was characterised 
by strong franchise growth in the Retail Banking 
operations, particularly in the fourth quarter, 
reflecting the continued strong performance of 
our business in all segments, and an increase  
in retail lending. In addition, we completed our 
three-year programme to reduce concentration 
risk in the Corporate Investment Banking and 
consequently, started to deliver corporate lending 
growth in the last quarter of the year.
• Strong Banking Business revenue. We 
recorded revenue of GEL 909.3 million 
(up 17.5% y-o-y). Y-o-y revenue growth  
in 2017 was primarily driven by a strong 
increase in net banking interest income, 
which resulted from strong loan book 
growth, and increase in net other banking 
income. Additionally, net fee and 
commission income contributed to increase 
of Banking Business revenues in 2017
• Net banking interest income. Our net 
banking interest income was up 21.4% y-o-y 
in 2017. The increase was primarily driven by 
the strong growth of our Retail Banking loan 
book, which experienced 30.6% constant 
currency growth during 2017
• Our NIM was 7.3% in 2017. While both 
loan yield and cost of funds stayed flat and 
liquid assets yield was up 20 bps compared 
to 2016, NIM was down 10 bps y-o-y as  
a result of the NBG’s decision in 2Q16 
mandating an increase in minimum reserve 
requirements
• Loan yield. Currency blended loan yield was 
stable at 14.2% in 2017 (flat y-o-y). While local 
and foreign currency loan yields decreased 
y-o-y, the overall stable trend in the loan yield 
primarily reflected a continued shift towards 
high-yielding local currency denominated 
loans in the total loan portfolio mix
• Liquid assets yield. Our liquid assets yield 
was 3.4% in 2017 (up 20bps y-o-y). The 
foreign currency denominated liquid assets 
yield increased by 40pbs y-o-y in 2017 as a 
result of the US Federal Reserve’s decisions in 
December 2016, March 2017 and June 2017 
to raise interest rates by 75 bps in aggregate, 
which triggered similar increases on interest 
rates paid by a) The National Bank of Georgia 
(the “NBG”) on the Bank’s obligatory reserves 
(foreign currency only) and b) correspondent 
banks on deposits placed by the Bank. On 
the other hand, local currency denominated 
liquid assets yield decreased by 20 bps y-o-y 
in 2017. The currency blended liquid assets 
yield increased only by 20 bps y-o-y in 2017 
on the back of decreasing yields on higher 
return local currency denominated liquid 
assets, while the total liquid assets portfolio 
composition remained largely the same during 
the period 56 Annual Report 2017 BGEO Group PLC

• Cost of funds. Cost of funds stood at 4.7% in 2017 (flat y-o-y). Despite the significant increase in cost of debt securities issued in 2017 following 
the issuance of GEL 500 million 11.0% Lari-denominated notes in 2Q17 (up 60bps y-o-y in 2017), cost of funds remained largely flat as a result 
of a decrease in the cost of client deposits and notes (down 30 bps y-o-y in 2017)
• Continued shift to the GEL-denominated loan book, which increased to 38.3% of the total book at 31 December 2017, compared  
to 28.7% a year ago. The dollarisation of our loan book has decreased since last year as the demand for local currency denominated loans 
outpaced the demand for foreign currency denominated loans. The trend was supported by the Georgian Government’s de-dollarisation 
initiatives: a) a one-off programme, effective from 15 January 2017 to 25 March 2017, allowing qualified borrowers to convert eligible 
 Dollar-denominated loans into GEL, at a discount compensated by the Government, at the client’s election and b) a new regulation,  
effective from 15 January 2017, restricting issuance of new loans in foreign currency with amounts less than GEL 100,000 (equivalent)
• Net loans to customer funds and DFI ratio. Customer funds (client deposits and notes) increased by 23.0% y-o-y to GEL 7,078.1 million driven 
by strong deposit generation in both the Retail and Corporate Investment Banking operations. Retail Banking client deposits and notes grew by 
35.4% y-o-y to GEL 3,267.3 million, while CIB client deposits grew by 13.0% y-o-y to GEL 3,457.3 million. As a result, our Net loans to customer 
funds and DFI ratio, which is closely monitored by management, remained strong at 92.4% (94.9% at 31 December 2016) despite the strong 
growth of the loan book
• Net fee and commission income. Net fee and commission income performance is mainly driven by the strong performance in our settlement 
operations supported by the success of our Express Banking franchise. This was partially offset by a decline in CIB’s fees from guarantees and 
letters of credit reflecting the de-concentration of our corporate risk
• Net banking foreign currency gain. In line with the volatility of the GEL exchange rate, the net banking foreign currency gain was up 3.4% y-o-y 
in 2017. RB and CIB businesses together contributed 87.4% to the total 2017 net banking foreign currency gain
• Net other banking income. Net other banking income increased to GEL 19.7 million in 2017 (up 61.7% y-o-y). The y-o-y increase in 2017 was 
largely driven by a) GEL 1.5 million net gains on derivative financial instruments recorded in 2017, and b) GEL 7.3 million revaluation gain from 
investment properties recorded in 2017

• Operating expenses increased to GEL 342.9 million in 2017 (up 17.6% y-o-y). The growth in operating expenses minimally outpaced  
growth in revenues, and consequently y-o-y operating leverage was negative in 2017 at 0.1 percentage points. 2017 y-o-y changes in operating 
expenses were driven by:
 – an increase in salaries and employee benefits by 17.7% y-o-y in 2017, which mainly reflects the strong organic growth of Retail Banking 
operations; and
 – an increase in administrative expenses by 22.1% y-o-y in 2017, primarily driven by increased marketing, personnel training, rent and repair 
and maintenance costs. The increase was attributable to the combined effect of the larger branch network and the higher average quarterly 
and annual exchange rate during 2017 as the vast majority of branch rental agreements are denominated in Dollars
• Cost of risk ratio. The Banking Business cost of risk ratio was 2.2%, down 50 bps y-o-y, primarily driven by 160 bps decrease in the CIB cost  
of risk ratio driven by overall improvement in the CIB loan portfolio quality, offset by 20 bps increase in the RB cost of risk ratio
• Quality of the Banking Business loan book remains strong as evidenced by the following closely monitored metrics: 57 Annual Report 2017 BGEO Group PLC

Information
• Income tax (expense) benefit. The 2017 
y-o-y movement in income taxes mostly 
reflects the impacts of changes in corporate 
taxation model, approved by the Parliament 
of Georgia in May 2016, which resulted  
in the write-off of Banking Business net 
deferred tax liabilities in 2016
• BNB – the Group’s banking subsidiary  
in Belarus – generated a profit of  
GEL 10.3 million in 2017 (up from  
GEL 2.7 million in 2016). BNB’s earnings  
were positively impacted by decreased  
levels of cost of risk in 3Q17 and 4Q17.  
While Belarus experienced weak  
macroeconomic conditions in 2016 and  
1Q17, starting from 2Q17 the Belarus  
economy started to show early signs of  
stabilisation. As a result, BNB’s cost of  
credit risk significantly improved in 2017
• BNB’s loan book reached GEL 399.5 million 
at 31 December 2017, up 10.3% y-o-y, 
mostly reflecting an increase in corporate 
and consumer loans. Client deposits were 
GEL 310.1 million at 31 December 2017,  
up 32.8% y-o-y. The y-o-y increase in client 
deposits was primarily attributable to the 
agreement signed with BelSwissBank in 
June 2017, which allowed BNB to manage 
and service current and term deposit 
accounts and card operations of 
BelSwissBank’s customers
• BNB continues to remain strongly 
capitalised, with Capital Adequacy Ratios 
well above the requirements of its regulating 
Central Bank. At 31 December 2017,  
total CAR was 13.9%, well above the 10% 
minimum requirement of the National Bank 
of the Republic of Belarus (“NBRB”), while 
Tier I CAR was 8.1%, above NBRB’s 6% 
minimum requirement. Return on Average 
Equity (“ROAE”) was 14.6% in 2017 (2.8% 
in 2016). Strong capitalisation and improved 
profitability allowed BNB to make a dividend 
payment in the amount of GEL 1.2 million in 
3Q17, the first capital return to the Bank 
since the BNB acquisition in 2008
• As a result, the Banking Business profit 
reached GEL 369.5 million in 2017 (up 
25.0% y-o-y), while ROAE increased  
to 25.2% in 2017 (up 300 bps y-o-y)
Our Banking Business balance sheet 
remains highly liquid (NBG Liquidity ratio  
of 34.4%) and strongly capitalised (Tier I ratio, 
NBG Basel II of 10.3% and NBG Basel III of 
12.4%) with a well diversified funding base 
(Client deposits and notes to total liabilities  
of 62.3%).
• Liquidity. Liquid assets increased to  
GEL 4,346.5 million at 31 December 2017, 
up 17.3% y-o-y, largely driven by proceeds 
from the GEL 500 million Lari-denominated 
bonds in June 2017 and increase in local 
currency bonds, which are used by the 
Bank as collateral for short-term borrowings 
from the NBG. Management successfully 
continued to deploy excess liquidity, 
accumulated as a result of proceeds from 
issuance of local currency Eurobonds during 
the second half of the year. As a result,  
the NBG liquidity ratio stood at 34.4% at 
31 December 2017, compared to 37.7%  
at 31 December 2016, and above the 
regulatory minimum requirement of 30.0%
• In addition, in May 2017, NBG introduced  
a Liquidity Coverage Ratio requirement for 
commercial banks, which became effective 
from 1 September 2017. Banks are required 
to maintain a liquidity coverage ratio, which 
is defined as the ratio of high quality liquid 
assets to net cash outflow over the next 30 
days. The ratio should be in excess of 100% 
for assets denominated in all currencies, 
cumulatively, at all times. In addition, liquidity 
coverage ratio is applicable to local and 
foreign currency denominated assets, 
separately, and should be in excess of  
75% and 100%, respectively, at all times. 
NBG liquidity coverage ratio was 112.4%  
at 31 December 2017 (129.8% at 
30 September 2017)
• Diversified funding base. Debt securities 
issued grew by 61.6% y-o-y primarily  
due to the issuance of GEL 500 million 
Lari-denominated bonds in June 2017, 
which positively contributed to GEL  
liquidity, allowing the Banking Business to 
significantly reduce short-term borrowings 
from the NBG (down 26.9% y-o-y)
• Loan book. Our net loan book and finance 
lease receivables reached GEL 7,741.4 
million at 31 December 2017, up 15.9% 
y-o-y. As of 31 December 2017, retail book 
represented 68.0% of the total loan portfolio 
(60.9% at 31 December 2016). While  
both local and foreign currency portfolios 
experienced y-o-y growth, the local currency 
loan portfolio demonstrated an outstanding 
increase of 54.6% y-o-y, partially driven by 
the Georgian Government’s de-dollarisation 
initiatives and our goal to increase the share 
of local currency loans in our portfolio

OVERVIEW OF FINANCIAL RESULTS CONTINUED
In 2017, we changed the Group accounting policy in relation to subsequent measurement for office buildings and service centres. Effective 
31 December 2017, we switched to the cost model, whereby office buildings and service centres are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation 
and accumulated impairment. Prior to this change, we applied the revaluation model, where office buildings and service centres were carried at their 
fair value less any subsequent accumulated depreciation and subsequent accumulated impairment losses. Valuations were performed once every 
three years. We believe that cost model provides more reliable and more meaningful presentation to our investors as it (1) enhances comparability  
for the investors since the application of cost model is a market practice and global standard across the banking industry (2) more closely aligns  
the accounting with the business model around these asset categories. The switch to cost model resulted in GEL 33.3 million decrease to Banking 
Business equity attributable to shareholders. We have accordingly restated the balance sheet accounts for affected periods, while the change did 
not have any material impact on the income statement. Banking Business ratios have been updated for the prior periods.
On 13 September 2017, Moody’s upgraded JSC Bank of Georgia’s local-currency deposit rating to Ba2 from Ba3, and the Bank’s foreign-
currency deposit rating to Ba3 from B1. The Bank’s senior unsecured foreign-currency rating was also upgraded to Ba2 from Ba3 with a stable 
outlook. The Bank’s credit rating action followed Moody’s upgrade of Georgia’s sovereign local and foreign currency issuer ratings to Ba2 from  
Ba3 on 11 September 2017.
Amendments to Capital Adequacy requirements. To transition to Basel III, National Bank of Georgia (“NBG”) introduced new capital adequacy 
requirements in December 2017. Bank of Georgia is required to maintain the following minimum capital requirements:
• Common Equity Tier 1 (“CET 1”) ratio at 4.5%
• Tier 1 ratio at 6%
• Total Capital ratio at 8%
The combined buffer requirement has also been introduced and Bank of Georgia is required to hold the following:
• Capital Conservation Buffer set at 2.5%
• Countercyclical Buffer set at 0%
• Systemic Capital Buffer of 0% for 2018, which will increase to 1% on 31 December 2018 and by an additional 0.5% annually until it reaches 
2.5% on 31 December 2021
NBG also introduced Pillar 2 requirements. The new regulation applicable to Bank of Georgia includes:
• Currency Induced Credit Risk (“CICR”) buffer, which substitutes current additional 75% weighting of FX denominated exposure. A 56% of CICR 
buffer should be held on CET1 level, 75% on Tier 1 level and 100% on total capital
• Net GRAPE buffer expected to be set at 2.2% according to NBG’s annual General Risk Assessment Program (“GRAPE”). The GRAPE buffer will 
be reviewed annually and phased-in on different levels of capital according to the below schedule:
Feb-18 31-Dec-18 31-Dec-19 31-Dec-20 31-Dec-21
CET 1 0% 15% 30% 45% 56%
Tier 1 0% 20% 40% 60% 75%
Total Capital 100% 100% 100% 100% 100%
• Credit Portfolio Concentration buffer, effective from 1 April 2018 and phased in over the four year period on different levels of capital according  
to the above schedule
• Net Stress Test buffer effective from 1 January 2020
In view of the above, the following overall capital requirements apply to Bank of Georgia at 31 December 2017:
• CET 1 ratio 8.1%, expected to increase to 9.5%* on 31 December 2018
• Tier 1 ratio 9.9%, expected to increase to 11.4%* on 31 December 2018
• Total Capital ratio 12.4%, expected to increase to 16.0%* on 31 December 2018
Bank of Georgia’s capital ratios calculated as of 31 December 2017 were at 12.4% CET1 and Tier 1 and 17.9% Total Capital.
Transition to Basel III is not expected to affect the Bank’s growth prospects or its ability to maintain dividends distributions within the existing dividend 
policy payout range.

PERFORMANCE HIGHLIGHTS
• Retail Banking delivered another outstanding annual result across all of its segments and generated total revenue of GEL 614.7 million 
in 2017 (up 24.4% y-o-y)
• RB’s net banking interest income experienced 28.6% y-o-y growth in 2017 as a result of the strong growth in the Retail Banking loan portfolio. 
Higher net banking interest income also reflects the benefits from the increase in the local currency loan portfolio, which generated 14.5 ppts 
higher yield than the foreign currency loan portfolio during 2017
• The Retail Banking net loan book reached GEL 5,044.4 million, up 29.3% y-o-y. Our local currency denominated loan book grew at a faster 
pace (up 68.7% y-o-y) than the foreign currency denominated loan book (up 3.8% y-o-y). As a result, the loan book dollarisation decreased to 
48.8% at 31 December 2017 from 60.8% at 31 December 2016
• The loan book growth was a product of continued strong loan origination levels delivered across all major Retail Banking segments:

OVERVIEW OF FINANCIAL RESULTS CONTINUED
• Retail Banking client deposits increased 
to GEL 3,267.3 million, up 35.4% y-o-y, 
despite a decrease in the cost of deposits  
of 40 bps y-o-y in 2017. The dollarisation 
level of our deposits decreased to 72.1%  
at 31 December 2017 from 75.0% at 
31 December 2016. This is in line with  
the current decreasing trend of cost on  
FC denominated deposits (down 60 bps 
y-o-y in 2017). The spread between the cost 
of RB’s client deposits in GEL and foreign 
currency widened to 2.2 ppts (GEL: 4.5%; 
FC: 2.3%) compared to 1.6 ppts in 2016 
(GEL: 4.5%; FC: 2.9%). Local currency 
denominated deposits increased at a faster 
pace to GEL 910.9 million (up 51.0% y-o-y), 
as compared to foreign currency 
denominated deposits that grew to  
GEL 2,356.4 million (up 30.2% y-o-y)
• Retail Banking NIM was 8.5%, down  
70 bps y-o-y. The lower NIM was a result  
of a 70 bps decrease in loan yield, as cost 
of funds remained flat in 2017
• Strong growth in Retail Banking net fee 
and commission income. The 10.6% y-o-y 
growth in 2017 was driven by an organic 
increase in our fee and commission income 
and the strong underlying growth in both  
our Express Banking and Solo platforms
• RB cost to income ratio remained well 
controlled at 38.3% in 2017 (down  
170 bps y-o-y). The significant y-o-y 
improvement resulted from the increasing 
utilisation of our Solo lounges coupled  
with the growth of the Express Banking 
franchise, which has the most cost-efficient 
model among our four Retail Banking 
segments
• RB cost of credit risk was GEL 110.8 
million in 2017 (up 46.4% y-o-y). The cost 
of risk ratio was 2.5% in 2017, up from 
2.3% in 2016 due to higher cost of risk 
levels in 1H17, mainly reflecting a) an 
increased pace of loan growth in express 
and micro express loan portfolio during 
1H17, which are characterised with the 
highest cost of risk ratios in the RB’s loan 
portfolio and the highest loan yields and b) 
impact from a major fire at one of the largest 
shopping centres located in downtown 
Tbilisi, which destroyed the inventory of 
some of RB’s Micro and SME clients and 
negatively affected their creditworthiness  
in 1Q17
• The number of Retail Banking clients 
reached 2.3 million, up 8.1% y-o-y, while  
the number of total cards outstanding 
amounted to 2,227,000, up 8.3% y-o-y
• to deliver strong growth as we further 
develop our strategy, as demonstrated  
by the following performance indicators
 – Growth in the client base was due  
to the increased offering of cost-
effective remote channels. The strong 
increase to 2,315,038 customers  
in 2017 (up 8.1% y-o-y) reflects the 
sustained growth in our client base over 
recent periods and was the main driver 
of the increase in our Retail Banking net 
fee and commission income
 – The number of outstanding cards 
increased in 2017. The increase reflects 
the launch of new loyalty programme 
Plus+ in July 2017 (see details below). 
Since the programme launch Bank 
customers who sign up for the 
programme are issued Plus+ cards.  
We had 250,307 active Plus+ cards 
outstanding at 31 December 2017 61 Annual Report 2017 BGEO Group PLC

 – The utilisation of Express Pay 
terminals continued to grow in 2017. 
The volume of transactions increased to 
GEL 4,748.0 million in 2017 (up 49.9% 
y-o-y), while the number of transactions 
was down y-o-y in 2017. This trend  
was largely driven by management’s 
decision to introduce transaction fees  
on non-banking transactions processed 
through Express Pay terminals in 4Q16. 
However, while this introduction negatively 
affected the number of transactions, the 
decrease was more than offset by the 
fees charged to clients leading to a 31.2% 
y-o-y increase in 2017 in fee income from 
Express Pay terminals
 – Digital penetration growth. The number 
of transactions and the volume of 
transactions carried out through our 
mobile banking app continue to show 
outstanding growth, primarily due to the 
introduction of our new mobile banking 
application in May 2017. The new 
fully-transformed, user-friendly, multi-
feature mobile banking application 
continues to gain popularity. Since its 
launch on 29 May 2017, and over the 
course of the following seven months, 
approximately 261,000 downloads were 
made by the Bank’s customers, while  
the previous application had less than 
120,000 downloads since its launch. 
During the same period c.3.88 million 
online transactions were performed  
using the new application
 – Significant growth in loans issued  
and deposits opened through Internet 
Banking. During 2017, we started to 
actively offer loans and deposit products 
to our customers through Internet 
Banking. As a result, 5,798 loans were 
issued with the value of GEL 15.1 million 
and 7,458 deposits were opened with 
the value of GEL 19.1 million through 
Internet Bank in 2017 (445 loans with  
the value of GEL 1.9 million and 3,546 
deposits with the value of GEL 7.3 million 
in 2016)
• On 15 September 2017, Bank of Georgia 
signed an agreement with Tbilisi City  
Hall for the exclusive right to operate  
the public transport payment system in 
Tbilisi. In accordance with the agreement, 
Bank of Georgia will continue as the sole 
provider of payment support services to the 
public transportation network, and operate 
retail branches in Tbilisi metro stations for 
the next ten years. Bank of Georgia will 
implement a modern payments system  
for public transport network in Tbilisi, 
including payment processing using  
Visa and MasterCard cards, and create a 
digital platform for ticket reservations and 
purchases through mobile applications.  
This further strengthens the Bank’s leading 
position in the express segment by 
maintaining branch network presence 
across Tbilisi’s public transport network
• We launched the new loyalty programme 
Plus+ on 5 July 2017. Plus+ is part of  
RB’s customer-centric approach and offers 
different status levels to customers and 
reward points that accumulate based on  
the client’s business with the Bank. Points 
can be redeemed into partner companies’ 
products and/or services. We launched the 
programme as part of our efforts to increase 
the Mass Retail segment’s product to client 
ratio from current 1.8 to 3.0
• Solo, our premium banking brand, 
continues its strong growth momentum 
and investment in its lifestyle brand.  
The number of Solo clients reached 
32,104 at 31 December 2017 (19,267 at 
31 December 2016), up 287.6% since its 
re-launch in April 2015. We are on track to 
achieving our target of 40,000 Solo clients 
by the end of 2018. We have now launched 
12 Solo lounges, of which nine are located 
in Tbilisi, the capital of Georgia, and three  
in major regional cities of Georgia. In 2017, 
annualised profit per Solo client was  
GEL 1,704 compared to a profit of GEL 78 
and GEL 71 per Express and mass retail 
client, respectively. Product to client ratio for 
Solo was 6.1, compared to 3.4 and 1.8 for 
Express and mass retail, respectively. While 
Solo clients currently represent 1.4% of  
our total retail client base, they contributed 
24.3% to our retail loan book, 37.4% to our 
retail deposits, 13.9% and 16.9% to our  
net interest income and to our net fee and 
commission income, respectively, in 2017. 
The fee and commission income from Solo 
segment increased from GEL 8.3 million  
in 2016 to GEL 14.4 million in 2017. Solo 
Club, launched in 2Q17, a membership 
group within Solo which offers exclusive 
access to Solo products ahead of other 
Solo clients at a higher fee, continues to 
gain popularity. At 31 December 2017, Solo 
Club had 1,882 members, up 23.2% q-o-q
• MSME banking delivered solid growth. 
The number of MSME clients reached 
165,781 at 31 December 2017, up 30.7% 
y-o-y. MSME’s loan portfolio was  
GEL 1,739.2 million at 31 December 2017 
(up 29.2% y-o-y). The MSME segment 
generated revenue of GEL 125.3 million  
in 2017 (up 51.0% y-o-y)
• As a result, Retail Banking profit reached 
GEL 249.7 million in 2017 (up 19.3% 
y-o-y). Retail Banking continued to 
deliver an outstanding ROAE, which 
reached 31.6% in 2017 (31.2% in 2016) 62 Annual Report 2017 BGEO Group PLC

• CIB resumes growth after achieving 
targets on loan portfolio risk de-
concentration initiatives. During 4Q17 CIB 
started to rebound and resume growth after 
delivering on its risk de-concentration and 
loan portfolio repositioning targets in 3Q17
 – Net loan book amounted to GEL 2,260.1 
million at 31 December 2017, down 
5.6% y-o-y and up 13.4% q-o-q. The 
y-o-y decrease was largely driven by 
winding down lending relationships with 
several large borrowers in 2017 as a 
result of risk de-concentration and loan 
portfolio repositioning targets. Starting 
from 4Q17 the CIB gradually resumed 
growth, resulting in a q-o-q increase  
in loan portfolio. The concentration of  
top ten CIB clients stood at 10.7% at 
31 December 2017, down from 11.8% 
at 31 December 2016
 – CIB’s net banking interest income 
increased by 6.2% y-o-y in 2017.  
The y-o-y growth in 2017 net banking 
interest income reflects an increase in the 
currency blended loan yields, as well as 
the significant decline in cost of funds
 – CIB’s net fee and commission income 
was GEL 22.7 million in 2017, compared 
to GEL 28.0 million in 2016. The y-o-y 
decline in 2017 was driven by decrease 
in net fee and commission income from 
guarantees and letters of credit. The 
26.0% y-o-y increase in guarantees and 
letters of credit portfolio in 2017 was 
offset by a decline in yields on these 
products during the same periods as a 
result of increased competition on the 
market and increased exposure to lower 
yielding cross-guarantees of highly rated 
institutions to manage the risk, driving 
the y-o-y decline in the net fees and 
commission income from guarantees 
and letters of credit in 2017
• In 2017, dollarisation of our CIB deposits 
decreased to 63.1% as at 31 December 
2017 from 74.8% a year ago, which was 
partially due to the State Treasury of 
Georgia’s decision to place part of their GEL 
funds on deposits with local commercial 
banks in 3Q17. Another driver of GEL-
denominated deposits increase was the 
significant decrease in interest rates on 
foreign currency deposits (2.7% in 2017, 
down from 3.1% in 2016). In contrast, the 
cost of deposits in local currency in 2017 
reached 6.6%, up from 6.3% in 2016, and 
remained well above foreign currency 
deposit yields. Consequently, total deposits 
amounted to GEL 3,457.3, up 13.0% y-o-y. 
On a constant currency basis, total deposits 
were up 14.5% y-o-y
• CIB recorded a NIM of 3.4% in 2017 
(down 20 bps y-o-y). Loan yield was up  
30 bps y-o-y and cost of funds was down 
10 bps y-o-y. The y-o-y decrease in NIM 
was primarily driven by the increased share 
of liquid assets in the total interest earning 
assets portfolio during the period
• Net banking foreign currency gain. In line 
with the volatility of the GEL exchange rate, 
CIB net banking foreign currency gain was 
GEL 46.3 million in 2017 (down 4.9% y-o-y)
• Net other banking income. Net other 
banking income increased significantly to 
GEL 14.3 million in 2017 (up 40.2% y-o-y). 
The y-o-y increase in 2017 was largely 
driven by revaluation gain of investment 
properties recorded in 4Q17
• Cost of credit risk. Cost of credit risk 
decreased significantly in 2017 (down 
37.8% y-o-y), primarily driven by overall 
improvement in the CIB loan portfolio 
quality, as a result of successful risk 
de-concentration and loan portfolio 
repositioning initiatives
• CIB’s cost to income ratio increased to 
32.0%, up from 29.5% in 2016. CIB’s 
operating expenses were up 10.9% y-o-y in 
2017. The increase was primarily driven by 
14.3% y-o-y increase in 2017 in staff costs, 
as a result of CIB’s efforts to restructure its 
corporate recovery and sales teams. The 
benefits of these undertakings are positively 
reflected in CIB’s lower cost of risk ratio of 
1.5% in 2017 (down from 3.1% in 2016)

Discussion of Investment Business results
The Group’s Investment Business is primarily comprised of five segments: Utility and Energy Business (GGU), Real Estate Business (m
2
), 
Property and Casualty Insurance Business (Aldagi), Beverage Business (Teliani) and Healthcare Business (GHG). The Group has renamed its 
Investment Business as Georgia Capital.
In line with IFRS requirements, the Group reviewed the classification of its operating segments at 31 December 2017. Given the expectation,  
in line with Georgia Capital’s strategy, it is highly probable the Group will own less than a 50% stake in its healthcare business GHG at the end 
2018*. As a result, and in line with IFRS, the Group classified GHG as “disposal group held for sale” and its results of operations are reported under 
“discontinued operations” line as a single amount in the consolidated income statement. Comparative periods have been restated accordingly to reflect 
reclassification of GHG from “continuing operations” into “discontinued operations”. Assets and liabilities held by GHG are also presented separately in 
the consolidated balance sheet as of 31 December 2017 under “assets of disposal group held for sale” and “liabilities of disposal group held for sale”.
PERFORMANCE HIGHLIGHTS
• As a result of strong performance across 
all segments, the Investment Business 
recorded EBITDA from continuing 
operations of GEL 106.6 million in 2017 
(up 55.7% y-o-y). Investment Business 
EBITDA, adjusted to include EBITDA  
of the discontinued operations, was  
GEL 220.0 million in 2017 (up 48.2% 
y-o-y)
• Aldagi recorded gross insurance profit of 
GEL 27.0 million in 2017 (up 7.1% y-o-y). 
The growth in revenues from introduction  
of new products, enhancements of existing 
products and strong growth in the retail 
segment more than outpaced the increased 
levels of insurance claims expense, driving 
gross profit up 7.1% y-o-y
• Gross real estate profit increased 
significantly as a result of m
2
’s strong 
sales record and revaluation gains from 
commercial properties during 2017.  
629 apartments were sold with a total sales 
value of US$ 49.1 million in 2017 compared to 
407 apartments sold with a total sales value of  
US$ 34.4 million in 2016. In 2017, gross real 
estate profit was GEL 35.4 million, which was 
attributable to record sales of apartments and 
GEL 22.6 million gain from revaluation of 
investment properties, of which, GEL 21.4 
million was the revaluation of three investment 
properties under construction (high street retail)
• GGU delivered stable organic growth 
with a 52% EBITDA margin in 2017 (54% 
in 2016). The y-o-y increase in gross utility  
and energy profit in 2017 was driven by higher 
water supply revenues across both commercial 
and residential customers, which was slightly 
offset by decreased revenues from electric 
power generation and sales as a result of 
exceptionally low levels of water inflow during 
the year. In addition, 2016 results include 
consolidation of GGU’ s gross utility and energy 
profit since 21 July 2016, while 2017 results 
include a full year of operations
• Gross other investment profit increased 
by 43.4% y-o-y in 2017. The growth was 
largely attributable to significant growth in 
T eliani’ s gross profit due to the launch of 
mainstream beer and lemonade production in 
2017, as well as outstanding performance of 
the wine business, where revenues reached 
GEL 60.3 million in 2017 (up 102.5% y-o-y), 
excluding the IFRS 15 impact. Additionally, 
T eliani’ s 2017 gross profit was positively 
impacted by continued diversification of its 
distribution portfolio, whereby T eliani tapped 
into the exclusive right to import and distribute 
Lavazza coffee in Georgia and won other 
non-alcoholic beverage distribution contracts in 
2017. We expect to begin reporting separately 
the results of our beverage business operations 
in 2018
• Increase in operating expenses was 
significantly impacted by T eliani’ s launch of 
beer operations and consolidation of GGU’ s 
results for a full year
• Net non-recurring items in 2016 primarily 
relates to GEL 31.8 million gain from the 
purchase of GGU, while no such material 
non-recurring items were noted in 2017
• 2017 profit from discontinued operations, 
which relates to results of GHG’s 
operations, decreased y-o-y by 21.2%. 
The decline was mainly due to the absence 
of GEL 24.0 million one-off income tax gains 
recorded in 2016 from the change in 
Georgian corporate tax legislation
*  The Group held 57% of GHG’s equity stake as of 31 December 2017 (65% as of 31 December 2016).
**   The gross real estate profit trend between 2017 and 2016 is not comparable given the early adoption of IFRS 15 from 1 January 2017. Prior to 1 January 2017, m
2
 recognised revenues from sales of 
residential units upon completion and handover of the units to customers in line with IAS 18, while under IFRS 15 revenue is recognised according to the percentage of completion method. Accordingly,  
we will not comment on y-o-y comparisons.

Natural monopoly in the water business, 
with upside in electricity generation. Our 
utility and energy business is operated through 
the Group’s wholly-owned subsidiary Georgia 
Global Utilities (GGU). GGU has two main 
business lines – water utility and electric power 
generation. In its water utility business, GGU  
is a natural monopoly that supplies water and 
provides a wastewater service to 1.4 million 
people (more than one-third of Georgia’s 
population) in three cities: Tbilisi, Mtskheta  
and Rustavi.
Portfolio of three hydropower generation 
facilities (an additional facility under 
management) with a total capacity of 
149.3MW. Average annual production is 
c.400GWh, depending on the level of rainfall 
during the year. GGU’s average annual 
electricity self-consumption is up to 300GWh 
with a decreasing trend, which provides GGU 
with sufficient internally generated power for 
water transportation purposes and additional 
revenue from third-party electricity sales. Over 
the course of the last three years, GGU has 
managed to achieve efficiencies in its own 
energy consumption, thus freeing up electricity 
for third-party sales. The involvement in 
hydropower production also provides  
revenue diversification.
Investment in additional capacity for 
electricity generation with the goal to 
establish a renewable energy platform.  
GGU is developing hydro power plants (HPP) 
as well as solar and windpower sources in 
Georgia. During 2Q17, GGU commenced 
construction of 50MW Mestiachala HPPs in the 
North-Western part of Georgia (Svaneti region) 
with a target to have the HPPs operational in 
December 2018. In 4Q17, GGU commenced 
construction of a 2.5MW Bodorna HPP on  
its own infrastructure near Tbilisi, which is 
expected to become fully operational from 
September 2018. Additionally, a 44.3MW Zoti 
HPPs, located in the Western part of Georgia 
(Guria region), officially entered its construction 
phase based on the construction agreement 
signed with the Government of Georgia during 
4Q17. GGU targets completion of Zoti HPP 
construction in 4Q20. 100MW wind projects 
are currently at the feasibility stage and once 
complete, GGU expects to commence 
construction works.
Room for efficiencies in water business from 
improving the worn-out infrastructure. The 
poor condition of pipeline infrastructure is the 
main reason for leaks and accidents, causing 
on average 70% water loss annually, out of 
which 50% is attributable to technical losses 
and 20% to commercial losses. The current 
level of water losses is higher than the 
international peer average and represents  
a strong potential efficiency upside for the 
business. GGU owns and operates a water 
supply network of around 3,150km and about 
2,000km of wastewater pipelines. It also has  
55 pumping stations, 101 service reservoirs 
with a total capacity of 305,000 m
3
 and a  
water treatment plant. Around 560 million m
3
  
of potable water is supplied from water 
production/treatment facilities annually. By 
investing in the pipeline infrastructure, the 
depreciated asset base is replaced over time, 
leading to continuous growth in the regulated 
asset base. Moreover, through the reduction  
of the water supplied to its customers and 
respective water losses, GGU expects to 
reduce its own electricity consumption,  
which can be sold to third parties.
Water tariff and regulation. In December 
2017, GNERC (Georgian National Energy and 
Water Supply Regulatory Commission), the 
independent body that regulates GGU’s water 
and wastewater tariffs, has approved new tariffs 
for GGU for a three-year regulatory period, 
effective from 1 January 2018. This is the  
first time the tariff has been set based on the 
new water and wastewater services tariff 
methodology adopted by GNERC in August 
2017, which is based on international best 
practice and represents a hybrid method  
of “cost plus” and “incentive based” 
methodologies. Revenue is determined  
based on a company’s Regulatory Asset Base 
(RAB) and compensates for investment and 
maintenance of new and existing regulatory 
assets, stimulates efficiency in the network 
through incentivising reduction in controllable 
operating expenses and delivers fair returns  
to investors in the utility business. The return  
on investment, referred to as WACC in the 
methodology, for the first regulatory period  
is set at 15.99% (up from 13.54% in 2017).  
As a result, new water and wastewater tariffs 
for residential customers in Tbilisi, the largest 
contributor to water utility revenue, increased 
by 23.8% to GEL 3.89 (per month, per capita) 
for non-metered customers and to GEL 0.33 
(per m
3
) for metered customers. New tariffs  
for GGU’s commercial customers, all of which  
are metered, decreased by 0.4% to GEL 4.40 
(per m
3
).
Strong and stable cash flow generation  
has enabled GGU to distribute dividends  
of GEL 28.0 million (US$ 11.0 million) from 
its water utility business to the Investment 
Business during 4Q17. This was the first 
dividend distribution since the acquisition of a 
controlling stake in GGU in July 2016, which 
has decreased the Group’s net investment in 
GGU, excluding the renewable energy 
business, to US$ 84.0 million.
GWP , a wholly-owned subsidiary of GGU, 
which operates the water business in Tbilisi, 
has a credit rating of BB – with stable 
outlook from Fitch.

PERFORMANCE HIGHLIGHTS
• GGU recorded total revenue of  
GEL 135.0 million in 2017 (up 6.1% y-o-y)
 – Revenue from the water supply to  
legal entities and individuals reached  
GEL 118.9 million in 2017 (up 8.7% 
y-o-y). Water supply revenue represented 
88.1% of the total revenue in 2017 
(86.0% in 2016). Revenue from legal 
entities is generally the largest element  
of GGU’s total revenue and their water 
consumption pattern is reflected in 
GGU’s revenues. The y-o-y increase in 
revenue from water supply to both legal 
entities and individuals in 2017 reflects 
enhanced measurement results based 
on an efficient new metering programme 
(the new metering programme entails 
replacement of amortised or obsolete 
meters for legal entities, metering of 
residential customers and detection  
of illegal connections)
 – Revenue from electricity power  
sales amounted to GEL 9.8 million in 
2017 (down 3.5% y-o-y). 2017 was 
characterised by exceptionally low levels 
of water inflows in Zhinvali reservoir  
(the lowest over the past five years), 
resulting in low electricity generation  
and respective decline in revenue from 
electricity power sales, compared to 
2016
 – The significant y-o-y decrease in the 
technical support revenue in 2017 was 
due to the early adoption of IFRS 15 
from 1 January 2017 which led to 
deferral of revenues from technical 
support services. The accounting 
change was applied prospectively  
from 1 January 2017 in line with IFRS
• GGU’s operating expenses continued to 
be well contained in 2017 and amounted 
to GEL 64.2 million in 2017 (up 8.6% 
y-o-y):
 – Salaries and employee benefits were  
up 14.1% y-o-y in 2017. The increase 
was primarily driven by recruitment of 
additional and more qualified personnel 
in the technical support department as 
well as increased performance-related 
compensation in water utility segment as 
a result of successfully delivering on all 
key operational and financial targets  
for 2017
 – Starting from 1Q17, as part of an 
ongoing process of reviewing receivable 
provisioning methodology, GGU revisited 
certain estimates to enhance the method 
of provision estimation. Under the 
enhanced method GGU was able to 
identify the customers who were able  
to pay all their monthly bills on time,  
i.e. who tended to have no overdue bill 
balance. This change in accounting 
estimate had a positive impact on the 
provision of doubtful receivables in 1Q17, 
resulting in lower receivables provision 
expenses in 2017
 – Electricity and transmission costs were 
up 3.1% y-o-y in 2017 due to the 
increased electricity transmission fee 
(guaranteed capacity fee) effective from 
1 January 2017. The low y-o-y growth is 
attributable to the savings from electricity 
consumption throughout the year
 – The y-o-y increase in 2017 in general 
and administrative expenses is primarily 
driven by the expenditures on a new

marketing campaign targeted at raising 
the awareness of the importance of 
potable water resources in the 
population
 – Operating taxes were up 34.6% y-o-y  
in 2017, reflecting an increase in GGU’s 
property tax base due to the company’s 
continued investments in its own 
infrastructure
 – Professional fees increased in 2017 
primarily due to the advisory services 
received from independent subject 
matter experts in relation to the 
assessment of certain operational 
parameters
 – The y-o-y decline in income taxes in 
2017 reflects the impact of changes  
in the corporate income tax model
• As a result of the developments 
described above, GGU reported EBITDA 
of GEL 70.8 million in 2017 (up 3.9% 
y-o-y) and a profit of GEL 35.2 million  
in 2017 (flat y-o-y)
• GGU has an outstanding receivables 
collection rate within the 95-98% range from 
water supply. During 2017, the collection 
rate for legal entities and households was 
98% and 95%, respectively. As a result, 
GGU had only GEL 6.9 million overdue 
receivables outstanding at 31 December 
2017. While the Georgian water utility  
sector has historically had low receivables 
collection rates, as a result of GGU’s 
arrangement with electricity suppliers since 
2011, which allows disconnection of 
non-paying water customers from the 
electricity network, GGU’s collection rates 
remain very strong at around 96%. In return, 
electricity suppliers receive flat monetary 
compensation from GGU
• In 2017, GGU drew down less expensive 
funding from international financial 
institutions in order to finance capital 
expenditures and refinance more expensive 
funding from local financial institutions

• The increase in property, plant and equipment 
is primarily due to the additional investments 
into the company’s infrastructure carried out 
during 2016 and 2017 in order to upgrade  
the network, further reduce water losses  
and achieve cost efficiencies. Additionally,  
c.GEL 40.0 million increase is attributable  
to the development and construction of 
renewable energy projects
• c.GEL 7.4 million y-o-y decrease  
in investment property is related to 
reclassification of investment properties  
into property, plant and equipment,  
as well as the sale of a land plot
• The significant increase in other non-current 
assets is driven by additional prepayments 
to suppliers in relation to the development 
and construction of 50MW Mestiachala 
HPPs
• The increase in borrowings and cash  
and cash equivalents at 31 December  
2017 is due to additional funding obtained 
from international financial institutions and 
local banks in order to support the capital 
expenditures for developments of water 
supply network and renewable energy 
projects
• During 2017, GGU secured long-term 
financing from international financial 
institutions (IFIs) for efficiency-related capital 
expenditures purposes. In 3Q17, GWP 
signed long-term loan facility agreements 
with the European Investment Bank (EIB), 
The Netherlands Development Finance 
Company (FMO) and German Investment 
Corporation (DEG) and attracted  
c.EUR 81.5 million in total, of which, c.40% 
is denominated in local currency. This was 
the first IFI financing for GGU’s water utility 
arm and a significant milestone for GGU,  
as it enables the company to develop  
and modernise the water infrastructure by 
tapping efficiencies in the network. GGU 
utilised the IFI funding from October 2017
• In 4Q17, GGU distributed dividends totalling 
GEL 28.0 million (US$ 11.0 million) from  
its water utility business to the Investment 
Business

PERFORMANCE HIGHLIGHTS
• During 2017 m
2
 continued to unlock 
value through real estate development.
• Gross profit from the sale of apartments is  
by its nature variable and depends on the 
number of projects underway at a given time. 
We also adopted a new accounting treatment 
in 2017, which applies a completely different 
basis for recognising revenue. Accordingly, 
y-o-y comparisons are not meaningful and  
will not be commented upon
• During 2017, m
2
 sold a total of 629 
apartments with total sales value of  
US$ 49.1 million, compared to 407 
apartments sold with total sales value  
of US$ 34.4 million during 2016
• Net revenue from operating leases increased 
by 19.1% y-o-y in 2017, supported by  
the growth in the commercial real estate 
portfolio. Consequently, the portfolio of 
yielding assets represented 22.0% of m
2
 
Real Estate’s total assets at 31 December 
2017, compared to 11.2% a year ago
• During 2017, m
2
 recorded a gain from  
the revaluation of investment property 
under construction of GEL 21.4 million. 
As a result, its portfolio of yielding 
assets, including the revaluation gain, 
increased by 85.8% y-o-y to GEL 77.2 
million at 31 December 2017. Revaluation 
of commercial property increased materially 
in 2Q17 primarily due to the GEL 21.4 million 
revaluation of three investment properties 
under construction (high street retail). m
2
 
previously measured investment property 
under construction at cost, as allowed  
by IFRS, on the basis that fair value 
determination was difficult due to lack of 
comparable data and reliability of alternative 
fair value measurements. During 2Q17, 
management reassessed the approach  
and concluded that given a) the recent 
transactions of properties under construction 
on the local market, b) management’s track 
record in building and renting out commercial 
properties and c) availability of increased 
statistical information, reliable measurement 
of fair value was warranted. Accordingly, 
management hired an independent, 
internationally recognised, valuation 
company to determine the fair values of 
properties under construction in 2017 and 
recorded a total revaluation gain of GEL 22.6 
million on investment properties during 2017
• As a result, m
2
 recognised total gross 
profit of GEL 33.9 million in 2017, while 
profit totalled GEL 23.7 million
• The y-o-y movement in income tax  
expense relates to previous period tax  
return adjustment as a result of submission 
of final 2016 tax returns during 3Q17
* Prior to 2017, m
2
 Real Estate results presented were segment results, i.e. including Group elimination and consolidation adjustments. Effective 2017, and similar to other 
Investment Business entities, we are reporting standalone results for m
2
 Real Estate.
** The net revenue trend between 2017 and 2016 is not comparable given the early adoption of IFRS 15 from 1 January 2017. Prior to 1 January 2017, m
2
 recognised revenues  
from sales of residential units upon completion and handover of the units to customers in line with IAS 18, while under IFRS 15 revenue is recognised according to the percentage 
of completion method. Accordingly, we will not comment on y-o-y comparisons. 70 Annual Report 2017 BGEO Group PLC

GEL 350.8 million (down 5.7% y-o-y), 
comprising of 9.9% cash, 10.0%

35.4% of the total balance sheet
• m

 has a land bank with a total value of  
GEL 72.9 million on its balance sheet. We 
do not expect the land bank to grow, as the 
company’s strategy is to utilise its existing 
land plots within three to four years and,  
in parallel, start development of third-party 
land plots under franchise agreements
• In December 2017, m
2
 acquired a 60% 
stake from a third-party in an upcoming 
lifestyle boutique hotel in Tbilisi for a total 
cash consideration of US$ 6.0 million, of 
which US$ 4.1 million was paid to acquire  
a 50% stake from a third-party and US$ 1.9 
million was injected into the hotel’s capital  
in exchange for an additional 10% stake
OPERATING HIGHLIGHTS
2017 was record-breaking for m
2
 with regard to 
the number of apartments sold, square metres 
sold and sales revenue. In 4Q17, all remaining 
apartments of the Optima line project on 
Moscow Avenue were sold. Moreover, m
2
 
continued to build up its portfolio of yielding 
assets, including hotels, to match the growing 
demand for accommodation generated by the 
robust growth of the tourism sector. In 3Q17  
m
2
 commenced construction works on a 
mixed-use development on Melikishvili Avenue, 
where it plans to open a four-star Ramada 
hotel, which is expected to be the first 
construction project undertaken in-house by  
m
2
 subsidiary, BK Construction LLC. Existing 
income-generating properties are successfully 
leased at an 88% occupancy rate with an 
average yield of 9.1%. m
2
 continued its 
outstanding performance in construction with 
more than 180,000 square metres (more than 
95,700 square metres of net sellable area) 
currently under construction across four 
ongoing projects, all of which are on schedule.
As noted above, in 4Q17 m
2
 acquired a 
controlling stake in an upcoming lifestyle 
boutique hotel in a prime location of Tbilisi. The 
hotel is expected to add at least 100 rooms to 
m
2
’s portfolio and the construction works are 
being carried out by m
2
’s construction arm. The 
skeleton of the building is already finished and 
the full construction completion is expected in 
the first quarter of 2019.
In December 2017, m
2
 signed its largest ever 
franchise agreement as part of its “asset light” 
strategy to construct and develop a residential 
complex under the m
2
 brand name on a 
third-party land plot in a densely populated 
Tbilisi suburb. m
2
 plans to build a residential 
complex, with a total of 190,000 square metres 
and 3,600 residential units, in ten phases over 
the course of four to five years and generate 
construction fees, sales commissions and 
share profits from the project’s overall 
economics.
Finally, in December 2017, m
2
’s construction 
arm was awarded its first major third-party 
construction agreement to construct the shell 
and core of a new shopping mall and business 
centre located in Tbilisi’s Saburtalo district. Total 
amount of the contract is US$ 11.6 million and 
is planned to be carried out over the 16 months 
following the planned project commencement 
in January 2018.

PERFORMANCE HIGHLIGHTS
• Aldagi recorded net underwriting profit of 
GEL 28.6 million in 2017 (up 10.8% y-o-y) 
as a result of the following:
 – Net earned premiums. Net premiums 
earned reached GEL 62.8 million in 2017 
(up 24.6% y-o-y). The y-o-y increase in 
2017 was supported by organic growth of 
the motor insurance, property insurance 
and credit life insurance business lines 
(representing approximately 35.0%, 24.0% 
and 10.0% of Aldagi’ s total insurance 
portfolio, respectively), which contributed 
to approximately 23.0%, 21.0% and 
15.0% y-o-y increase in net premiums 
earned in 2017, respectively. New product 
introductions and enhancements of 
existing products described under 
Operating Highlights below resulted  
in a further 4.0% y-o-y increase to net 
premiums earned in 2017. Net premiums 
earned from agricultural insurance 
increased by approximately 44.0%  
on a y-o-y basis in 2017, leading to  
a 54.0% market share in this product 
(37.0% market share in 2016)
 – Net insurance claims. The net 
insurance claims amounted to  
GEL 25.1 million in 2017 (up 40.5% 
y-o-y). The y-o-y increase in net 
insurance claims expenses in 2017 were 
primarily driven by property insurance 
claims following a major fire incident in 
1H17 and a number of accidents from 
flooding and bad weather conditions in 
4Q17. Additionally, the motor insurance 
business experienced an overall increase 
in loss severity and frequency in 2017. 
 – These increases were partially 
compensated by improved loss ratios in 
liability insurance, life insurance and other 
insurance products in 2017. Finally, the 
increase in insurance claims expenses 
was also driven by the business shift 
towards the retail segment, which is 
historically characterised by a higher  
loss ratio than the corporate segment
 – Net acquisition costs were  
GEL 9.1 million in 2017 (up 34.9% y-o-y). 
The y-o-y increase was attributable to the 
introduction of new insurance product 
lines and enhancements of existing ones 
in 2017, which led to higher average 
commission rates. Overall, commission 
ratio was up by 1 ppts y-o-y in 2017.
• Aldagi’s key ratios remain healthy despite 
increased number of accidents during 
2017 as evidenced by the following closely 
monitored metrics:
KEY RATIOS
2017 2016
Combined ratio 75.2% 72.6%
Expense ratio 35.2% 37.2%
Loss ratio 40.0% 35.4%
• Net investment profit. Investment income 
amounted to GEL 3.0 million in 2017 (down 
4.9% y-o-y). Y-o-y decrease in investment 
income in 2017 was primarily driven by the 
dividend payouts of GEL 7.1 million in 3Q16 
and GEL 7.0 million in 2Q17, which were 
partially compensated by 20.4% y-o-y 
increase in AUM fees in 2017. Investment 
yield remained high at 10.0% in 2017
• Salaries and employee benefits reached 
GEL 8.7 million in 2017 (up 10.0% y-o-y) 
primarily as a result of the new Strategic 
Development department as described 
under Operating Highlights below, as well  
as the organic growth of the property and 
casualty insurance business and the related 
increase in headcount
• Corporate income tax expense. The y-o-y 
decrease in income taxes in 2017 reflects 
the absence of one-off impact from changes 
in the corporate taxation model, which were 
recorded in 2016 (GEL 0.8 million write-off  
in 2016)
• Aldagi’s operating profit reached  
GEL 19.1 million in 2017, up 9.9% y-o-y. 
Aldagi’s net profit was GEL 16.3 million  
in 2017 (up 18.6% y-o-y)
• Aldagi continued to have a very strong 
balance sheet. As of 31 December 2017, 
total assets reached GEL 135.2 million. The 
y-o-y growth in assets was largely driven  
by 23.9% y-o-y increase in net insurance 
premiums receivable and 57.1% y-o-y 
increase in ceded share of technical 
provisions. The 14.5% y-o-y increase in  
total liabilities was driven by two large claims 
incurred as a result of a) a major fire incident 
in 1Q17 and b) floods in 4Q17, both of which

• Insurance companies in Georgia are  
subject to regulatory requirements. Since 
31 December 2016, Aldagi is required to 
maintain a solvency ratio in excess of 100%. 
At 31 December 2017, Aldagi’s solvency 
ratio was 180% as compared to 160% at 
31 December 2016
OPERATING HIGHLIGHTS
Aldagi achieved significant milestones in  
2017 as the company managed to exceed its 
annual targets for new product developments. 
Along with tapping into regional markets 
through launching livestock insurance, Aldagi 
introduced online travel insurance with a  
unique combination coverage and competitive 
pricing. Aldagi’s product development initiatives 
resulted in more than 19,000 livestock 
insurance and 3,334 travel and trip insurance 
policies sold across the country.
Aldagi set-up a Strategic Development 
department in 2017 in order to focus on 
improving market intelligence through more 
direct communication and targeting of the 
Georgian insurance market’s emerging trends 
and demands. These efforts led to a major 
milestone, whereby Aldagi signed an exclusive 
memorandum with Public Service Hall in  
3Q17, which allows customers of the Public 
Service Hall to electronically acquire affordable 
insurance products for any type of property 
registered in the public registry.
Aldagi targets solidifying its market leadership 
position in digital insurance over the next five 
years by having all its processes/ procedures, 
including issuance of e-policies, remote claims 
regulation and building web/mobile customer 
profiles, executed principally through digital 
channels. As at 31 December 2017, Aldagi had 
11,044 online agents, who sell and promote 
retail insurance products through unique 
web-portal onjob.ge, a digital platform that 
helps Aldagi attract new customers.
Through extensive cooperation with the 
Insurance State Supervision Service of Georgia 
(ISSSG), the insurance market regulator in 
Georgia, the Parliament of Georgia approved 
Border Motor Third Party Liability Insurance 
(MTPL insurance for vehicles visiting Georgia 
either on a temporary or transit basis) in 
December 2017. Compulsory MTPL insurance 
will become mandatory from 1 March 2018. 
Aldagi expects that MTPL insurance will increase 
the size of the existing property and casualty 
market by approximately GEL 30-50 million 
(15-25% of the existing P&C insurance market). 
Aldagi is working closely with ISSSG to support 
drafting of the new law requiring mandatory local 
MTPL for all vehicles registered in Georgia. The 
new law is expected to be launched in 2019 and 
will be a major boost to retail market penetration. 
The current low level of insurance market 
penetration of 1.1% in Georgia (of which, 0.6% 
relates to P&C insurance market penetration and 
0.5% to medical insurance market) provides 
highly untapped retail growth potential.
• Based on the latest available market data as 
of 30 September 2017, Aldagi continues to 
be the most profitable insurance company  
in the local market with 89.4% share of the 
insurance industry profit
• Aldagi continues to lead the market with  
a powerful distribution network of 284 
points of sale and 547 sales agents at 
31 December 2017
• At 31 December 2017, Aldagi had 47,702 
insured customers (up 36.5% y-o-y).  
The y-o-y increase in number of insured 
customers was driven by organic growth of 
motor insurance and introduction of new 
product lines in 2017. The number of new 
insurance policies written reached 155,332 
in 2017 (112,430 policies written in 2016)
Aldagi signed major third-party partnership 
agreements with two Georgian banks,  
JSC Liberty Bank and JSC Credo Bank  
to successfully diversify its multi-channel 
distribution network. The partnership 
agreement between Aldagi and JSC Liberty 
Bank, the third largest bank in Georgia by total 
assets and with the largest branch and service 
outlet network in the country, will enable Aldagi 
to enhance distribution capabilities of its motor 
third-party liability insurance business. The 
three-year partnership agreement with JSC 
Credo Bank marks the continuation of already 
established successful relationship between the 
companies. Aldagi will have rights to offer its 
retail insurance products to the bank’s retail  
and small and medium-sized business clients 
through its wide network of branches, which 
will enable Aldagi to successfully tap Georgia’s 
underpenetrated retail insurance segment.

PERFORMANCE HIGHLIGHTS
• GHG delivered gross revenue of  
GEL 747.8 million in 2017 (up 75.3% 
y-o-y). The y-o-y revenue growth in 2017 
was mainly attributable to the pharmacy 
business (GPC and Pharmadepot were 
acquired in and consolidated from May 
2016 and January 2017, respectively)
• GHG achieved a well diversified revenue 
mix, spread across all three segments of the 
Georgian healthcare ecosystem. In 2017, 
34% of the GHG’s revenue came from the 
healthcare services business, 59% from 
pharmacy business and the remaining 7% 
from medical insurance business. The high 
level of diversification was achieved through 
GHG’s entrance and further expansion into 
the pharmacy business, which is funded 
almost entirely out-of-pocket and therefore, 
helped GHG to further diversify its revenue 
by payment sources. As a result, 54% of 
total revenue was received from out-of-
pocket payments, 24% from Georgia’s 
Universal Health Programme and 22%  
from other sources in 2017
• In 2017, GHG continued to focus on 
extracting operating efficiencies and 
synergies across the business lines.  
The gross margin in the pharmacy business 
continued to improve in 2017, mainly as  
a result of realising previously announced 
procurement synergies as the largest 
purchaser of pharmaceuticals in Georgia. 
The loss ratio of medical insurance business 
remained largely flat y-o-y in 2017. As 
anticipated, healthcare services business 
margins are temporarily reduced due to 
launches of new healthcare facilities and 
services, which are currently in their rapid 
build-out phase. In 2018, the main goal will 
be the continued successful roll-out of newly 
launched hospitals and services, while, at 
the same time, focusing on implementing 
efficiency measures across healthcare 
facilities, as well as GHG-wide
• GHG reported strong EBITDA of  
GEL 108.1 million in 2017 (up 38.6% 
y-o-y). The EBITDA margin for the 
* GHG is classified as a disposal group held for sale and as a discontinued operation within BGEO’s 2017 results.

healthcare services business was 26.4% in 
2017 (30.2% in 2016). The temporary y-o-y 
reduction in the EBITDA margin in 2017 was 
due to the launch of new healthcare facilities 
and services, which are currently in their 
initial roll-out phase. Excluding the dilutive 
effects of roll-outs, the healthcare services 
business EBITDA margin was 29.2%  
in 2017. GHG expects further margin 
improvements gradually
• GHG’s profit amounted to GEL 45.9 
million in 2017 (up 16.1% y-o-y on  
a normalised* basis). The healthcare 
services business was the main driver of 
2017 profit by contributing GEL 27.4 million, 
followed by the pharmacy business with a  
GEL 21.2 million contribution
• GHG’s balance sheet increased  
substantially over the last 12 months, 
reaching GEL 1,167.8 million as at 
31 December 2017 (up 27.6% y-o-y).  
The 27.6% y-o-y growth in total assets  
was largely driven by the increase in 
property and equipment, reflecting 
investments in the renovation of hospitals, 
roll-out of polyclinics and the consolidation 
of the pharmacy business, Pharmadepot. 
The pharmacy businesses consolidation 
primarily affected inventories and  
goodwill. Out of the GEL 118.8 million 
inventory balance at 31 December 2017, 
GEL 98.9 million was attributable to the 
pharmacy business, while the balance  
of goodwill from the acquisitions of the 
pharmacy businesses amounted to  
GEL 77.8 million at 31 December 2017. 
Borrowed funds increased y-o-y as a result 
of the following factors: 1) From the first 
quarter of 2017, GHG sourced longer-term 
and less expensive funding from both  
local commercial banks and Development 
Financial Institutions (“DFIs”) and used the 
proceeds for the development of healthcare 
facilities; 2) At the beginning of 2017,  
GHG raised GEL 33.0 million from a  
local commercial bank to pay the first 
tranche of consideration payable for the 
Pharmadepot acquisition; 3) In 4Q17  
GHG raised additional funds from local 
commercial banks to finance ongoing 
capital expenditures, as well as to pay the 
second tranche of consideration payable  
for the Pharmadepot acquisition in the 
beginning of January 2018. The y-o-y 
increase in accounts payable is also 
attributable to the pharmacy business. Out 
of the GEL 92.9 million accounts payable 
balance, GEL 63.4 million relates to the 
pharmacy business. The y-o-y increase in 
other liabilities related to recognition of put 
option liability (GEL 55.0 million present 
value liability) to purchase the remaining 
33% shares of Pharmadepot
• During 2017, GHG continued to invest in  
the development of its healthcare facilities. 
Healthcare services business spent a total 
of GEL 89.3 million in 2017 on capital 
expenditures, primarily on the extensive 
renovations of Deka and Tbilisi Referral 
(formerly Sunstone) hospitals, as well as 
enhancing the service mix and introducing 
new services to cater for previously unmet 
patient needs. Of this, maintenance capex 
was GEL 9.6 million in 2017
• In July 2017, the healthcare services 
business acquired referral and community 
hospitals in the Khashuri and Kareli regions 
(together the “Hospitals”), respectively.  
The acquisition is in line with the healthcare 
services business’s strategy to expand its 
presence across the country, especially  
in underrepresented regions of Georgia. 
Following the acquisition of the Hospitals, the 
number of referral and community hospitals 
increased to 16 and 21, respectively. The 
Hospitals are located in the Khashuri and 
Kareli regions, which have a combined 
population of c.100,000 people, and operate 
with 65 and 25 beds, respectively. These 
acquisitions further enable GHG to direct 
patients to its referral hospitals, primarily in 
Kutaisi and Tbilisi, thus providing potential  
for revenue synergies. The integration of  
both hospitals is already completed
• In 4Q17 GHG launched a district polyclinic 
in Marneuli and acquired two district 
polyclinics in Tbilisi, with a total of c.50,000 
registered patients. Polyclinics acquisitions 
and launches are consistent with the 
Group’s strategy to grow its healthcare 
services business through rolling out  
a network of polyclinics across Tbilisi  
and in other major cities in Georgia. As a  
result, GHG currently operates a total of  
12 polyclinic clusters, of which eight are 
located in Tbilisi and four in the regions
• GHG’s healthcare services market share 
based on the number of beds was 24.5%  
at 31 December 2017
*  Comparison on a normalised basis – 2016 net profit was normalised and adjusted for one-off non-recurring gain/loss due to deferred tax adjustments (in the amount of  
GEL 24.0 million gain in 2016). The full year 2016 profit is also adjusted for one-off currency translation loss in June (in the amount of GEL 2.1 million), which resulted from  
settlement of the Dollar-denominated payable for the acquisition of GPC, GHG’s pharmacy business. 76 Annual Report 2017 BGEO Group PLC
Dear Shareholders,
The Board recognises the contribution the corporate governance 
practices of the Group can make to the Group’s overall success. As the 
regulatory and governance environment continues to change, we will 
continue to seek to build upon the standards we have set thus far.
Our corporate governance framework extends to the culture we  
have sought to create and maintain throughout the Group which is 
characterised by integrity, honesty, transparency and fairness. This has 
enabled us to attract and retain the most talented individuals available 
whose efforts have contributed to the Group’s success. The Board will 
continue to lead by example in the year ahead, ensuring we act ethically 
in our relationships with the Group’s stakeholders and continue to 
develop talent in our management team.
SEPARATION OF THE BANK AND INVESTMENT BUSINESSES 
AND REVIEW OF CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE
We have discussed the effects the potential changes might have on  
our governance structures. Further, in the report of the Nomination 
Committee you will read about the work that has been done 
repositioning our senior management team ahead of the demerger.
CULTURE AND GOVERNANCE 
Most recently, the Board spent time considering the FRC’s proposals for 
a revised corporate governance code, and initiatives regarding increased 
employee and stakeholder engagement and is considering any changes 
that may be necessary. 
BOARD EVALUATION
The Board’s belief in the strength of our culture and corporate 
governance is supported by the results of our externally facilitated Board 
evaluation. The external evaluation, which was performed by Lintstock, 
concluded that the Board continues to operate and perform effectively.  
In particular, it was highlighted that the Board has a good balance and 
mix of expertise and experience which provides diversity of view and 
perspective. The progress we felt we have made against our 2017 
objectives, and our objectives as a Board for 2018 can be found on 
page 87 in the Corporate Governance Framework.
BOARD CHANGES AND DIVERSITY
After a six-month period as an advisor to the Board and a member of  
the Audit Committee, Jonathan Muir was appointed as an independent 
Non-Executive Director. Jonathan’s appointment has enhanced a diverse 
and balanced Board and we look forward to his continuing contribution 
this year.
We also took the opportunity to review our Diversity Policy and, 
consistent with the Board’s determination to lead the Group by example, 
have amended the policy which is now applicable to all employees.
GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK
Our corporate governance framework, policies and practices are 
described in this section of the Report. This framework provides for  
the development, review, implementation and continued oversight  
of a system of controls, policies and procedures that uphold our high 
governance standards. 
This section also covers some of the work we have carried out this year 
in effecting this framework and preparing the Group for next stages of  
its development.

BOARD
BGEO GROUP PLC BOARD OF DIRECTORS
The Board is responsible collectively for the long-term success of the 
Group and for the creation and delivery to shareholders of sustainable 
value through the management of the Group’s businesses. The Board 
establishes the Group’s core values and leads by example; sets and 
oversees the execution of the Group’s strategy within a framework  
of strong and effective risk management and internal controls; and 
encourages a culture of corporate governance in line with best practice, 
amongst its many other responsibilities.
The Board is composed of eight Directors, seven of whom are 
Independent Non-Executive Directors. Each of the Chairman, CEO and 
Non-Executive Directors have clearly defined roles within our Board 
structure. A description of these roles can be found on our website, at 
http://bgeo.com/page/id/66/roles-and-responsibilities.
CHAIRMAN
The principal role of the Chairman, Neil Janin, is to lead the Board 
effectively and provide direction and focus to its discussions. The 
Chairman is the guardian of the Board’s decision-making processes  
and also promotes high standards of integrity, probity and corporate 
governance throughout the Group and at Board level. He facilitates 
effective contributions by the Non-Executive Directors, promotes a 
culture of openness and debate, and encourages constructive relations 
between Executive and Non-Executive Directors. The Chairman works 
closely with the CEO, to ensure that the actions and strategies proposed 
and agreed by the Board are implemented effectively. The Chairman’s 
other significant commitments are indicated in his biography on page 77.
CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER (“CEO”)
The Group CEO, Irakli Gilauri, leads the management team, manages  
the business of the Group, develops and oversees the implementation  
of all Board approved actions, the strategic direction of the Group and  
its commercial objectives. The CEO also supports the Chairman to 
ensure that appropriate governance standards are spread throughout 
the Group. The CEO oversees the executive management team, which 
assists him in managing the business. Further details on the executive 
management team can be found on page 80.
SENIOR INDEPENDENT DIRECTOR (“SID”)
The Senior Independent Director, David Morrison, provides a sounding 
board for the Chairman, acts as an intermediary for the other Directors 
when necessary and is available to shareholders if they have concerns 
that have not been addressed through the normal channels.
Directors are expected to provide rigorous and constructive challenge on 
matters that, owing to their strategic, financial or reputational implications 
or consequences, are considered significant to the Group.
SEPARATION OF THE CHAIRMAN AND CEO ROLES
There is a clear division of responsibilities between the Chairman  
and the CEO. The separation of authority is set out in writing and  
agreed by the Board. This enhances independent oversight of executive 
management by the Board and helps to ensure that no one individual  
on the Board has unfettered power, influence or authority. The division  
of responsibilities can be found on the Company’s website at

GROUP COMPANY SECRETARY
The Company Secretary is responsible for providing guidance to  
the Board collectively and to the Directors individually with regard  
to their duties, responsibilities and powers, and for ensuring the proper 
administration of the proceedings and matters relating to the Board,  
the Company and the shareholders of the Company in accordance with 
applicable legislation, regulation and procedures.
The Board has access to the advice and services of the Company 
Secretary, who advises the Board and the Board Committees on relevant 
matters, including compliance with the Group’s policies and procedures, 
the Listing Rules, legislation and regulations relevant to the Company and 
the UK Corporate Governance Code and other governance standards.
BOARD COMMITTEES
The Board has delegated authority to the Board Committees to carry out 
certain tasks on its behalf, in order to operate efficiently and give the right 
level of attention and consideration to relevant matters, and to ensure 
there is independent oversight of financial, audit, internal control and risk 
issues, review of remuneration as well as oversight and review of Board 
and executive succession planning, while reserving the authority to 
approve certain key matters, as documented in the Company’s matters 
reserved for the Board, which is reviewed annually by the Board. The key 
responsibilities of the Board Committees are summarised in the individual 
Committee Reports.
In 2017 the Board had four Committees comprised solely of Independent 
Non-Executive Directors (with the exception of the Audit Committee, on 
which Jonathan Muir served as a member prior to his appointment as an 
Independent Non-Executive Director on 20 June 2017):
• the Nomination Committee
• the Audit Committee
• the Risk Committee and
• the Remuneration Committee
Later in this section, there are reports from the Chairman of each 
Committee which describe the Committee’s activities in 2017 and 
priorities for 2018.
AUDIT COMMITTEE
The Audit Committee assists the Board in relation to the oversight of the 
Group’s financial and reporting processes. It monitors the integrity of the 
financial statements and is responsible for governance around both the 
internal audit function and external auditor, reporting back to the Board. 
It reviews the effectiveness of the policies, procedures and systems in 
place related to, among other operational risks, compliance, IT and 
information security (including cyber-security) and works closely with  
the Risk Committee in connection with assessing the effectiveness of the 
risk management and internal control framework. The Audit Committee 
oversees and challenges management on its internal control and risk 
management systems in relation to the financial reporting process.
Full details of the internal control and risk management systems are set out 
within the Audit Committee Report on pages 91 to 94.
RISK COMMITTEE
The main role of the Risk Committee is in relation to the oversight of risk. 
It reviews the Group’s risk appetite in line with strategy, identifies and 
monitors risk exposure and the risk management infrastructure, oversees 
the implementation of strategy to address risk, and in conjunction with 
the Audit Committee, assesses the strength and effectiveness of the risk 
management and internal control framework.
Read the Risk Committee Report on pages 95 to 96.
NOMINATION COMMITTEE
The Nomination Committee ensures that the Board continues to  
have the right balance of skills, experience, independence and Group 
knowledge necessary for the Board to set and monitor the strategic 
direction of the Group and discharge its responsibilities in accordance 
with the highest standards of governance and the diversity aspirations  
of the Board. It is responsible for both Director and management 
succession planning.
Read the Nomination Committee Report on pages 89 to 90.
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
The Remuneration Committee reviews and recommends to the  
Board the Directors’ Remuneration Policy to ensure that remuneration 
packages are designed to promote the long-term success of BGEO 
and to see that management is appropriately rewarded for its
contribution to the Group’s performance in the context of wider market 
conditions and shareholder views. The Committee determines the 
remuneration packages of the Executive Directors, the Chairman and 
executive management along with their terms of employment and 
assesses the performance of executive management against KPIs.
It is also responsible for designing and overseeing the administration  
of Group employee share schemes.
Read the Remuneration Committee Report on pages 98 to 113.
TERMS OF REFERENCE AND REPORTING TO THE BOARD
Each Committee has agreed Terms of Reference, which are reviewed 
annually by each Committee and any changes are approved by the 
Board.
Each Committee’s Terms of Reference can be found on the Company’s 
website at http://bgeo.com/page/id/70/terms-of-reference.
All Non-Executive Directors have a standing invitation to attend 
Committee meetings (rather than just limiting attendance to Committee 
members).
THE ROLE OF THE BOARD
The Board’s principal duty is to promote the long-term success of  
the Group by directing management towards creating and delivering 
sustainable shareholder value. We do this by setting the Group’s strategy 
and overseeing its implementation by management. The Board is 
accountable to shareholders for the financial performance of the Group.
We believe that the success of the implementation of the Company’s 
strategy requires the alignment of strategy with the Group’s internal 
governance framework. We view a strong system of risk management 
and internal controls as essential to governance in allowing us to pursue 
our strategy in a way that risk appetite can be set and risks identified, 
assessed, managed and reported effectively. You can read more about 
our risk management on pages 32 to 43.
By setting the tone at the top, establishing the core values of the Group 
and demonstrating our leadership, management is able to implement key 
policies and procedures we have created in a manner that clearly sets an 
expectation that every employee acts ethically and transparently in all of 
his or her dealings.
We also monitor management’s execution of strategy and financial 
performance. While our ultimate focus is long-term growth, the Group 
also needs to deliver on short-term objectives and we seek to ensure 
that management strikes the right balance between the two. 86 Annual Report 2017 BGEO Group PLC
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK CONTINUED
We are mindful of our wider obligations and consider the impact our 
decisions will have on the Group’s various stakeholders, such as our 
employees, our shareholders, our customers and clients, the environment 
and our community as a whole. You can read more about our sustainability 
initiatives on pages 44 to 51.
In order to ensure that we meet our responsibilities, specific key 
decisions have been reserved for approval by the Board. A full formal 
schedule of matters specifically reserved for the Board can be found on 
our website, at http://bgeo.com/page/id/67/schedule-of-matters-
reserved-for-the-board.
OPERATION OF THE BOARD
We schedule Board meetings for at least four times a year in Georgia,  
for a period of two days each time. We also hold meetings at our London 
offices, with Directors either attending in person or via teleconference. 
Matters which require decisions outside the scheduled meetings are 
dealt with through additional ad hoc meetings and conference calls.  
In addition, in 2017, majority of the Board attended our annual investor 
day. In total, we met formally as a Board ten times during the year. The 
Board also passed written resolutions on three separate occasions.
A number of the Non-Executive Directors also carry out site visits  
several times a year. Examples in 2017 include visits to bank branches, 
Solo lounges, real estate sites under construction, a wind turbine test, 
water pumping and service facilities, hospitals, pharmacies and clinics.
At each scheduled meeting, we receive reports from the Chairman, 
BGEO CEO, CFO, and the Bank CEO and Bank CFO on the performance 
and results of the Group. The CEOs of our principal subsidiaries and  
the Deputy CEOs of the Bank regularly update the Board on the 
performance, strategic developments and initiatives in their respective 
segment throughout the year. The Bank’s Chief Risk Officer, Group 
General Counsel and Group Head of Investor Relations regularly present 
to the full Board. The Board receives updates from Group operating 
functions on internal control and risk management, compliance, internal 
audit, human resources and corporate responsibility matters.
Similarly, the Chairman, with support from the Company Secretary, 
ensures that time is available during and outside of Board meetings to hold 
sessions with the Non-Executive Directors without Executives present.
There is an annual schedule of rolling agenda items to ensure that all 
matters are given due consideration and are reviewed at the appropriate 
point in the financial and regulatory cycle. These include the budget, 
quarterly, half-year and full year results, the Annual Report and Accounts, 
approval of the final dividend and the Notice of AGM.
A typical quarterly in-person meeting will include discussion on the 
following topics:
• Updates from Committee Chairmen on matters discussed at the 
respective Committee meeting held the day before
• The macroeconomic environment
• Financial performance
• Business segment performance and developments
• A deeper dive into strategy and performance at one or more business 
units
• New strategic initiatives and progress against strategy
• Regulatory, legislative and other corporate governance updates
• Developments in relation to principal risks and risk management
Board and management succession planning and talent management are 
typically discussed at least twice a year. A comprehensive assessment  
of the risk management framework and system of internal controls is 
performed at least twice a year through the Risk and Audit Committees  
or the full Board.
Board meetings are, however, flexible to ensure that pressing matters, 
when they arise, are addressed as quickly as possible. In the most 
recent year, the separation of the Bank and Investment Business has 
been on the agenda at every meeting since March 2017.
The Chairman and CEO seek input from the Non-Executive Directors 
ahead of each Board meeting. The Senior Independent Director helps  
to ensure that any particular matters raised by Non-Executive Directors 
are included on the agenda for discussion by the Board. In addition, the 
Chairman meets with the CEO after each meeting to agree the follow-up 
actions and to discuss how effective the meeting was.
The Senior Independent Director also serves as a sounding board to the 
Chairman and the CEO.
The Chairman and CEO maintain frequent contact (in person or otherwise) 
with each other and the other Board members throughout the year outside 
of the formal meetings.

BOARD SIZE, COMPOSITION AND DIVERSITY
We consider that a diversity of skills, backgrounds, knowledge, experience, 
outlook and approach, geographic location, nationalities and gender is 
important to effectively govern the business.
The Board and its Nomination Committee work to ensure that the Board 
continues to have the right balance of skills, experience, independence 
and Group knowledge necessary to discharge its responsibilities.
As noted later in this Report, the Board believes that its size and 
composition are appropriate. In particular, the Board has determined  
that each of the Non-Executive Directors is independent in character  
and judgement. Each of our Non-Executive Directors occupies, and/or 
has previously occupied, senior positions in a broad range of relevant 
associated industries, bringing valuable external perspective to the 
Board’s deliberations through their experience and insight enabling them 
to contribute significantly to decision-making. No individual or group of 
individuals is able to dominate the decision-making process and no 
undue reliance is placed on any individual.
TENURE AND INDEPENDENCE
The average tenure of our Non-Executive Directors is approximately 4.5 
years. We value diversity in all forms. Currently six different nationalities 
are represented on our Board of eight Directors. More information on  
our approach to diversity can be found on page 89.
We have assessed the independence of each of the seven Non-Executive 
Directors and are of the opinion that each acts in an independent and 
objective manner and therefore, under the Code, is independent and  
free from any relationship that could affect their judgement. Each 
Non-Executive Director has an ongoing obligation to inform the Board  
of any circumstances which could impair his or her independence.
The Board is mindful of developing diversity and is aware of various 
diversity reports and initiatives in the UK, such as the Hampton Alexander 
Review “FTSE Women Leaders – Improving Gender Balance in FTSE 
Leadership: 2017 Review” published in November 2017 and has noted 
the recommendations on women on Boards that a target of 33% female 
Board representation is achieved by FTSE 350 companies by 2021. The 
Board has stated its aim to increase the number of women on the Board 
to two by mid-2018 and further increase this number thereafter.
SUCCESSION PLANNING AND BOARD APPOINTMENTS
We believe that effective succession planning mitigates the risks 
associated with the departure or absence of well qualified and experienced 
individuals. We recognise this, and our aim is to ensure that the Board and 
management are always well resourced with the right people in terms of 
skills and experience, in order to effectively and successfully deliver our 
strategy. We also recognise that continued tenure brings a depth of 
Group-specific knowledge that is important to retain. Our succession 
planning model occasionally involves the recruitment of independent 
external advisors to our Board and Committees. In this way, we receive 
objective insight into our decision making and can judge whether  
an individual advisor has the requisite skills – and knowledge and 
understanding of the Group – to be appointed as an Independent 
Non-Executive Director.
During the year, Jonathan Muir, who had been appointed as an advisor on 
1 January 2017 to the Board and as a member of the Audit Committee, 
was appointed as Non-Executive Director on 20 June 2017. Upon his 
appointment to the Board his advisory agreement was terminated.
As mentioned earlier in this Report, the Board Nomination Committee  
is responsible for both Director and executive management succession 
planning. There is a formal, rigorous and transparent procedure for the 
appointment of new Directors to the Board.
EVALUATION OF BOARD PERFORMANCE
The Board continually strives to improve its effectiveness and recognises 
that its annual evaluation process is an important tool in reaching that 
goal. Our external evaluator Lintstock was engaged in 2017 to carry out 
a comprehensive evaluation of our Board, Committees and Directors. 
Lintstock has no other connection to the Company although it also 
performs the separate external Board and Committee evaluation of  
our subsidiary Georgia Healthcare Group PLC.
The outcomes of the evaluation were discussed in detail in a meeting of 
the Board and the Board set its priorities for the following year. The 2017 
evaluation confirmed that the Board and its Committees continue to 
perform effectively.
Overall, the Board is considered strong, bringing a good balance 
and mix of expertise and experience and offering real diversity of  
view and perspective.
Progress was felt to have been made against the objectives we set for 
2017. In particular:
• We dedicated significant time to evaluating progress across all of  
our Investment Businesses and we are pleased with the progress 
being made in driving improvements to our financial performance  
and implementing our strategy across the Group.
• We continue to dedicate time to discuss risk management and 
internal control and we were satisfied with how these systems 
were improved.
Based on the results of the evaluations and continued discussions,  
the Board has set the following objectives for 2018:
• Overseeing the proposed demerger
• Overseeing that the proposed demerger and activities surrounding  
it cause minimum disruption to the running of the separate surviving 
groups and their business units
• Strategic focus of the Bank
• Investigating potential new acquisitions in the Investment Business
• IT strategy
NON‑EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS’ TERMS OF APPOINTMENT
On appointment, our Non-Executive Directors are given a Letter of 
Appointment that sets out the terms and conditions of their directorship, 
including the fees payable and the expected time commitment. Each 
Non-Executive Director is expected to commit approximately 25-35 days 
per year to the role. An additional time commitment is required to fulfil 
their roles as Board Committee members and/or Board Committee 
Chairmen, as applicable. We are satisfied that all Non-Executive Directors 
dedicate the amount of time necessary to contribute to the effectiveness 
of the Board. The Letters of Appointment for our Non-Executive Directors 
are available for inspection at our registered office during normal business 
hours and also at the Company’s Annual General Meeting for 15 minutes 
prior to and during that Meeting.
NON‑EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS’ EXTERNAL APPOINTMENTS
Any external appointment or other significant commitment of the 
Non-Executive Directors requires the prior approval of the Board. Our 
Non-Executive Directors hold external directorships or other external 
positions but the Board believes they still have sufficient time to devote 
to their duties as a Director of the Company and that the other external 
directorships positions held provide us with valuable expertise.
BOARD INDUCTION, ONGOING TRAINING  
AND PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT
On appointment, each Director takes part in an induction programme, 
during which he or she meets members of executive management, 
receives information about the role of the Board and individual Directors, 
each Board Committee and the powers delegated to these Committees. 
The new Director is also advised of the legal and other duties and 
obligations of a Director of a premium listed company.
We are committed to the continuing development of our Directors  
in order that they may build on their expertise and develop an ever- 
more detailed understanding of the business, markets and regulatory 
environment in which Group companies operate and of our evolving 
corporate governance framework.
All of our Directors participated in ongoing training and professional 
development throughout 2017, which included briefings, site visits, 
development sessions and presentations by our Group Company 
Secretary, members of management, external speakers and our 
professional advisors. During the year our Group Company Secretary 
provided updates on legislative changes including the Non-Financial 
Reporting Directive, Diversity initiatives including the Hampton-Alexander 
Review (which the Company participated in), and refresher training on 
Directors’ duties and conflicts of interest (section 172 and 175 duties 
under the Companies Act respectively).  88 Annual Report 2017 BGEO Group PLC
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK CONTINUED
In addition, amendments to the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency 
Rules and the FRC’s guidance on reporting were presented. The Group 
Company Secretary also briefed the Board on proposed changes to  
the UK Corporate Governance Code. The Board also received detailed 
training on and revised our policies and procedures to further address 
the guidance on the EU Market Abuse Regulation, and guidance on the 
EU Audit Reform, which have led to a revision of our Non-Audit Services 
Policy.
INDEPENDENT PROFESSIONAL ADVICE
We also ensure that all of our Directors have access to the advice of the 
Group Company Secretary as well as independent professional advice, 
at the Company’s expense, on any matter relating to their responsibilities.
RE‑ELECTION OF DIRECTORS
In line with the Code’s recommendations, Jonathan Muir will stand  
for election at the AGM in 2018, being the first AGM following his 
appointment to the Board. All of our Directors seek re-election every year 
and therefore all other Directors will stand for re-election at the Company’s 
AGM. The Board has set out in the Notice of the AGM the qualifications 
of each Director and support for re-election.
GROUP COMPANY SECRETARY
The Board appointed Rebecca Wooldridge as the new Group Company 
Secretary in September 2017. She was previously Deputy Company 
Secretary, and is an experienced corporate governance lawyer who 
previously worked at a FTSE 100 top 20 company and before that as 
corporate lawyer at a leading London City law firm.
ACCOUNTABILITY
INTERNAL CONTROLS AND RISK MANAGEMENT
The Group has a comprehensive system of internal controls in place, 
designed to ensure that risks are mitigated and that the Group’s objectives 
are attained. The Board recognises its responsibility to present a fair, 
balanced and understandable assessment of the Group’s position and 
prospects. It is accountable for reviewing and approving the effectiveness 
of internal controls operated by the Group, including financial, operational 
and compliance controls, and risk management. The Board recognises  
its responsibility in respect of the Group’s risk management process and 
system of internal control, and, oversees the activities of the Group’s 
external auditors and the Group’s risk management function which have 
been delegated to the Audit and Risk Committees.
A review of the Group’s risk management approach is further discussed 
in the Strategic Report on pages 18 to 29. For detail on the management 
and mitigation of each principal risk see pages 41 to 43. The Group’s 
viability statement is detailed on pages 33. Please refer to pages 91 to 
96 for further detail in relation to the Audit and Risk Committee’s roles.

NOMINATION COMMITTEE REPORT
Dear Shareholders,
In 2017, we maintained our focus on succession planning and talent 
development programmes. We believe that the skills, experience, 
knowledge and attributes of the members of our Board and executive 
management are the fundamental drivers for successful delivery of our 
strategic and financial objectives.
In December 2016, the Company appointed Jonathan Muir as an 
advisor to the Board and member of the Audit Committee, such advisory 
role being for an interim period during which both sides assess suitability 
for Board membership without voting rights on Board matters. The 
Committee reviewed his performance, fit and suitability over the first  
six months of the year and were very pleased to see the value of his 
contribution to the Board and the Audit Committee. The Committee 
therefore recommended that the Board appoint him as an Independent 
Non-Executive Director and a member of the Nomination Committee. 
Consequently, Mr Muir was appointed to the Board and Nomination 
Committee on 20 June 2017 and continues to sit on the 
Audit Committee.
During the year the Committee also reviewed the time commitment  
and length of service of the Non-Executive Directors and facilitated the 
evaluations of the Board and Committees. The Committee reported to  
the Board that it considered the overall size and composition of the Board 
to continue to be appropriate for the Company. Taking into account the 
Company’s strategic direction and considering the required skills and 
competencies required of the Board, the Committee recommends that 
each Non-Executive Director and the Executive Director be re-appointed 
at the 2018 AGM.
We also reviewed our Board Diversity Policy and decided that the 
principles should be applied at all levels of the Group with appropriate 
adjustments. Accordingly, an all employee Diversity Policy was updated 
and approved.
Following an annual external evaluation, the results confirmed that the 
Board and Committees operate effectively and we took the feedback 
from these evaluations into account for our succession planning 
exercise.
In addition, in light of the Group’s demerger, the Committee undertook a 
significant amount of work to separate some of the Investment Business’s 
and Banking Business’s functions and to reposition the management 
team.
Prior to recruiting new members, members of the Committee performed 
a skills matrix exercise, which included skills, competencies, cognitive 
and personality diversity, gender and nationality diversity, to better 
understand the present composition of the Board, identify gaps and  
help with succession planning and recruiting.
Members of the Nomination Committee interviewed potential candidates 
and this process is ongoing. The Committee sees the demerger as an 
opportunity to strengthen the demerged Boards and continues to be 
mindful of its current diversity targets. We hope to show results.
We would also like to draw your attention to the changes in senior 
management, considered by the Committee, which we are pleased  
in many cases to have developed from within the Group.
I invite you to read more about our work in the following report.
Neil Janin
Chairman of the Nomination Committee
7 March 2018
THE ROLE OF THE NOMINATION COMMITTEE
The role of the Nomination Committee is to assist in ensuring that  
the Board comprises individuals who are best able to discharge the 
responsibilities of Directors, having regard to the highest standards of 
governance, the strategic direction of the Group and diversity aspirations 
of the Board. We also help to ensure that the Group appoints excellent 
executive managers capable of successfully executing the Group’s 
strategic objectives.
In summary, the Nomination Committee is responsible for:
• Reviewing the composition of the Board and Board Committees  
to ensure they are appropriately constituted and balanced in terms  
of size, skills, experience, independence and knowledge.
• Identifying suitable candidates for appointment to the Board based on 
criteria which takes into account the skills, experience and diversity 
required by the Board, and the attributes required of Directors.
• Developing succession plans for the Chairman, CEO, Non-Executive 
Directors and key executive managerial roles.
• Evaluating the suitability of Directors standing for election and 
re-election at the AGM.
• Evaluating the independence of the Non-Executive Directors and time 
required from Non-Executive Directors.
• Organising the process for the annual Board and Committee 
effectiveness reviews and implementing any plan required to address 
issues identified.
The Nomination Committee undertook its annual review of its Terms of 
Reference in September, and the full Terms of Reference are available  
on our website, http://bgeo.com/uploads/pages/bgeo-nomination-
committee-terms-of-reference-46.pdf.
COMPOSITION AND MEMBERS’ MEETING ATTENDANCE
The composition of the Nomination Committee and the members’ 
meeting attendance for the year 2017 are set out in the Board and 
Committee Meeting Attendance table on page 86.
In order to get the right balance of skills and knowledge on our Board, 
the Nomination Committee keeps Board composition under review 
throughout the year. Each year, we ask our Board members to provide 
feedback on the skills, expertise and performance of the other Board 
members as well as re-evaluate their own skills. For each Non-Executive 
Director, the Nomination Committee reviews the time commitment 
required by him or her, taking into account any external directorships, 
length of service as well as independence of character and integrity. It 
then recommends to the Board whether each Non-Executive Director 
should be re-appointed.
DIVERSITY POLICY
Our Board embraces diversity in all its forms. Diversity of skills, 
background, experience, knowledge, outlook, approach, gender, 
nationality and ethnicity, amongst other factors, will be taken into 
consideration when seeking to appoint a new Director to the Board. 
Similarly, we are clear that diversity of outlook and approach, while 
inevitably being difficult to measure, may be equally as important. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Board appointment will always  
be made based on merit.
Planning for our future in the best interests of our shareholders
NEIL JANIN
CHAIRMAN OF THE NOMINATION COMMITTEE 90 Annual Report 2017 BGEO Group PLC
We continue to be mindful of developing best practice in diversity.  
We have noted the voluntary target in the Hampton-Alexander Review 
that FTSE 350 companies should aim for a minimum of 33% women’s 
representation on their Boards by 2020. The Board has stated its aim  
to increase the number of women on the Board to two by mid-2018  
and further increase this number thereafter and hence will continue to 
prioritise this aim. Please also see “Succession Planning” below and  
also the Chairman’s Statement on this matter on page 7.
We have made considerable progress in 2017 in embedding the 
importance of diversity at all levels of the Company, including the 
development of an all-employee Diversity Policy. This is an important 
step, not just in terms of making sure that our recruitment and retention 
procedures are fit-for-purpose but also in articulating our conviction  
that further improving diversity is good for the long-term strength of 
our Company. The Diversity Policy was implemented by providing it  
to the HR team and incorporation into our HR policies. The HR team  
also e-launched the Learning Management System which enables  
all employees to easily access corporate learning opportunities. This  
has led to encouraging results during the year; we have seen 54% of 
promotions awarded to female employees and 60% of those employees 
who enrolled on our Leadership Programmes have been female. We 
have also increased our maternity leave benefits and now provide a 
one-off bonus for newborn or adopted children. 
Other initiatives have focussed on the inclusion aspect of diversity,  
with 40 employees currently learning sign language to ensure smooth 
dialogue with deaf and hard of hearing individuals. In June 2017 we  
held a children’s event, the Day of Protection of the Rights of Persons 
with Disabilities in Georgia, which was hosted by Bank employees who 
assisted and provided care to the event’s beneficiaries. Further diversity 
focussed programmes are intended to take place in 2018 and will be 
included in next year’s Annual Report.
The Company participated in the Hampton-Alexander Review regarding 
executives and those reporting to them, and were pleased to receive a 
“high performing” rating in the report released in November 2017.
SUCCESSION PLANNING
The Chairman’s letter above sets out the succession planning and 
ongoing recruitment efforts in respect of the demerger and new Boards  
of each of the two demerged businesses. The skills matrix exercise 
performed in 2017 helped us to review the skills, competencies, cognitive 
and personality diversity, gender and nationality diversity of the present 
Board and to identify gaps and areas for improvement, including from a 
diversity perspective, and help with succession planning and recruiting.
We did not engage a search consultancy since we were provided with  
a broad range of candidates from our extended network and also from 
targeting advertising on websites which produced candidates with 
particular identified skills.
In 2017 the Nomination Committee recommended, and the Board 
appointed, Jonathan Muir as member of the Board. Candidates who  
are shortlisted for appointment to the Board are generally seen first by a 
combination of the Chairman, the BGEO CEO and Senior Independent 
Non-Executive Director although other members of the Nomination 
Committee may also be involved at this stage. If the selection process 
progresses further, each potential candidate is invited to meet other 
members of the Nomination Committee as well as members of 
management. We then decide whether to recommend the candidate  
for appointment as an advisor to the Board. It is our usual practice to 
appoint a Board candidate as an advisor prior to offering an appointment 
to the Board as an extended trial of the candidate, who is only paid the 
equivalent to a Director’s fee and whose remit is restricted to Board and 
Committee matters. An advisor to the Board may be recommended for  
a Committee appointment. Following this trial period, the Nomination 
Committee will agree whether to recommend the advisor for 
appointment to the Board. The Board will ultimately resolve whether  
to make the recommended appointment.
As noted in the letter above, Jonathan Muir underwent this process and 
the Nomination Committee recommended him for appointment to the 
Board and Nomination Committee alongside his continuing membership 
of the Audit Committee, and the Board approved such appointments.
The agreement with Mr Muir under which he had previously acted as an 
advisor to the Board was terminated upon his appointment as a Director 
of the Company. The fee payable to him under that agreement was 
equivalent to the fee he receives as a Non-Executive Director.
The Nomination Committee is always mindful of its Diversity Policy when 
recruiting. We had considered female candidates for the role early in the 
process, but ultimately determined that Mr Muir was the best candidate 
for the role based on merit.
SENIOR MANAGEMENT APPOINTMENTS
As mentioned in the letter to shareholders above, we separated the 
Investment Business’s and Banking Business’s Chief Financial Officer 
functions and repositioned some of the Group’s management team 
ahead of the demerger. It is proposed that those with “Group” titles  
will take on the equivalent role in the demerged Investment Business. 
Accordingly, regulatory approval was received and the Group made the 
following appointments:
• Giorgi Alpaidze was appointed Group CFO and will become the CFO 
of Georgia Capital plc following completion of the Group’s proposed 
demerger
• David Tsiklauri was appointed Chief Financial Officer of the Bank and 
will become the CFO of the Banking Business following completion  
of the Group’s demerger
• Levan Kulijanishvili was appointed Deputy CEO, Operations of the 
Bank
• Vasil Khodeli was appointed Deputy CEO, Corporate Investment 
Banking of the Bank
The Committee oversaw these appointments and notes the high quality 
of senior management that the current Group, and each business 
emerging from the demerger will have which will give our businesses a 
distinctive advantage. The Committee also notes that the fact that all 
these important appointments were internal shows the strength of our 
talent pipeline and evidences our commitment to personal development.
TALENT DEVELOPMENT
We are committed to talent development programmes and initiatives within 
the Group. We increase the skills of our existing executive managers and 
develop a pipeline of new executive, senior and middle managers through 
coaching, mentoring and leadership programmes. We continue to expand 
our programme year on year to include management at lower levels. 
Career progression is tangible if our managers have the right mindset and 
work ethic. The Board also met with members of middle management 
throughout the year.
Our talent development programmes continue to be characterised  
by transparency, viewing oneself as part of a team of leaders, helping 
others to succeed and honest feedback. They are also focused on the 
promotion of teamwork and development of teams, aiming to teach 
managers to:
• Have the courage to give and seek feedback;
• Realise that a stronger me plus a stronger you makes a stronger us;
• Value meritocracy over favouritism;
• Encourage dissent and dialogue instead of authoritative decision- 
making; and
• Favour cooperation over individualistic or “heroic” behaviour.
EXTERNAL EVALUATION
Lintstock performed the effectiveness review of the Committee. The 
evaluation concluded that the Committee continues to operate and 
perform effectively. Lintstock also performed a case study on the 
demerger which included how Board members thought Boards and 
Committees should be composed in the future, which allowed the Board 
to discuss this matter freely and assisted the Nomination Committee in 
helping to shape the new Boards.
Our priorities for 2018 are:
• the composition of the Board and Committees of the proposed 
demerged entities; and
• the senior management of the proposed demerged entities.

AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT
Dear Shareholders,
This report provides insight into the functioning of the Audit Committee 
(the “Committee”) and its activities during the reporting period including 
an overview of the key areas of activity and principal topics covered at 
each meeting of the Committee.
For the financial year 2017 these activities included a review of the 
performance and effectiveness of the Company’s external auditor, the 
Company’s internal controls, including internal audit, risk management 
and combined assurance systems, and a review of the effectiveness  
of the Committee. The Committee also continued to exercise its 
responsibilities for ensuring the integrity of the Company’s published 
financial information and reviewing the judgments made by management 
and the assumptions and estimates on which they are based.
KEY ACTIVITIES
INTERNATIONAL REPORTING STANDARDS
The Committee has considered at a number of its meetings the action 
being taken to prepare for the implementation of the new international 
reporting standards, in particular IFRS 9, but also IFRS 16, and the 
exercise of appropriate financial judgements that will be required, together 
with the implementation of new systems to support the changes.
The Committee also oversaw the early-adoption of IFRS 15 effective 
from 1 January 2017 and received regular updates from management 
on effective implementation.
ACCOUNTING STANDARDS APPLICATION
The Committee has reviewed with management and the external 
auditors considerations and decisions relating to the proper application 
of accounting standards to the treatment of the Investment Business  
in the Company’s accounts, the valuation of investment property and 
similar issues.
PROPOSED DEMERGER
The financial impact and accounting implications of the proposed 
separation of the Company’s Banking and Investment Businesses has 
been an important subject considered by the Board and the Committee 
has devoted significant attention to the topic at each of its meetings in 
the latter part of the year.
COMMITTEE AND MANAGEMENT CHANGES
During the year there were some changes to the Committee and senior 
management team.
• Jonathan Muir was officially appointed to the Board on 20 June 2017 
as an Independent Non-Executive Director. Jonathan had served as 
an advisor to the Board since January 2017 and during that time had 
already served as a member of the Audit Committee (proposed Board 
members of our Company typically serve as an advisor for an interim 
period during which they advise the Board, the Board assesses 
suitability and both sides assess fit).
DAVID MORRISON
CHAIRMAN OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE
• In preparation for the proposed demerger, Giorgi Alpaidze was 
appointed as Group Chief Finance Officer. He was previously the 
Head of the Group’s Finance, Funding and Investor Relations  
and has extensive international experience in banking, accounting 
and finance.
• Following nine years as Head of Internal Audit, David Davitashvili 
moved into an operational role and a new Head of Internal Audit,  
Nino Gordeladze, was appointed from 3 January 2018.
Further details are in the following report.
David Morrison
Chairman of the Audit Committee
7 March 2018
COMPOSITION AND OPERATIONS OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE
The composition of the Committee complies with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code (the “Code”), which provides that the Committee 
should comprise at least three Independent Non-Executive Directors. 
The Committee members are David Morrison (Chairman), Kim Bradley, 
Hanna Loikkanen, Tamaz Georgadze and Jonathan Muir, all of whom  
are independent. The Board is satisfied at least one member of the Audit 
Committee has recent and relevant financial experience and that the 
Audit Committee as a whole has competence relevant to the sector in 
which the Company operates.
Jonathan Muir was appointed as a member of the Committee on 
1 January 2017, and was appointed to the Board on 20 June 2017 
whereupon his role as an advisor to the Board was terminated. Mr Muir 
is a member of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of England and 
Wales and has both accounting and auditing experience.
The Audit Committee works to a planned programme of activities focused 
on key events in the annual financial reporting cycle and standing items 
that it considers regularly under its Terms of Reference (reviewed and 
updated on 11 December 2017). It also reacts to business developments 
as they arise.
Attendance at meetings by Committee members can be found on page 
86 of the Corporate Governance Framework. The Company Secretary is 
Secretary to the Committee and attends all meetings. The meetings are 
also attended by:

and directly with the external auditor and Head of Internal Audit. From 
time to time, other members of management are invited to attend these 
meetings in order to provide a deeper level of insight into key issues and 
developments.
Mr Morrison attends the AGM to respond to any shareholder questions 
that may be raised on the Audit Committee’s activities.
KEY PURPOSE AND RESPONSIBILITIES
On behalf of the Board, the Audit Committee safeguards high standards 
of integrity and oversees conduct in financial reporting, internal control 
and risk management (together with the Risk Committee) and internal 
audit. It also supervises the work of our external auditor. 
Upholding integrity, transparency and accountability 92 Annual Report 2017 BGEO Group PLC
AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT CONTINUED
The Audit Committee reports to the Board on how it discharges its 
responsibilities and makes recommendations to the Board, all of which 
have been accepted during the year. The Committee’s Terms of Reference, 
which outline its primary roles and responsibilities, are available in the 
governance section of the Company’s website at http//bgeo.com/
uploads/pages/bgeo-audit-committee-terms-of-reference-65.pdf.
BUSINESS DEVELOPMENTS
The Committee considered the financial implications of a number of 
business developments during the course of the year, including the 
proposed demerger and related retrospective changes in segment 
reporting, the introduction of a new deposit insurance scheme in 
Georgia, the introduction of a new Tier 1 model by the National Bank, 
developments in relation to a large loan exposure and its provisioning, 
and various acquisitions and disposals.
FINANCIAL REPORTING
A principal responsibility of the Audit Committee is to consider the 
significant areas of complexity, management judgement and estimation 
that have been applied in the preparation of the financial statements. We 
spent significant time reviewing the action being taken to prepare for the 
implementation of the new international reporting standards, in particular 
IFRS 9, but also IFRS 16, and the exercise of appropriate financial 
judgements that will be required, together with the implementation  
of new systems to support the changes.
The Committee received detailed reporting from the external auditor in 
respect of key areas of audit focus during the year. The Committee and 
the external auditor, without management present, discussed the key 
areas of audit focus, the suitability of the accounting policies which have 
been adopted and whether management’s key reporting estimates and 
judgements were appropriate. Taking into account the external auditor’s 
assessment of risk, but also using our own independent knowledge of 
the Group, we reviewed and challenged where necessary, the actions, 
estimates and judgements of management in relation to the preparation 
of the financial statements.
Other than the introduction of the new reporting standards, the significant 
accounting matters and financial judgements considered by the Audit 
Committee in relation to the financial statements are addressed below.
Matter considered Action taken
Allowance for loan losses Reviewed reports from management; 
liaised with Risk Committee on 
provision levels and impairments; 
discussed provisioning models and 
levels with external auditors, and 
considered impairment/provisioning 
levels of several large loan exposures 
and related accounting matters for 
one such exposure.
Valuation of investment 
properties
Considered the reports of 
management, prepared based  
on the third-party valuation and  
the view of the external auditors.
Accounting for the  
proposed demerger
Reviewed with management and  
our external auditor the financial 
reporting implications following the 
announcement of our plans to pursue 
a demerger and our plan to reduce 
our stake in GHG to below 50%  
in 2018.
Change in accounting policy 
for measurement of office 
buildings and service centres
Reviewed management’s paper 
setting out the rationale for and 
impact of the proposed change  
in accounting policy from the 
revaluation to cost model and 
considered the external auditor’s 
views. The Committee approved the 
policy on the basis that it provides 
more relevant information to users  
of the financial statements
Matter considered Action taken
Early adoption of IFRS 15 Received regular updates from 
management about the early 
adoption and implementation of  
IFRS 15 across all Group entities. 
Considered reports from the external 
auditors on the application of IFRS 
15 across the Group and noted their 
conclusion that the standard had 
been applied appropriately.
Investment property  
under construction
Considered and, after discussion 
with the external auditor, agreed  
a change in estimate to measure 
certain investment property under 
construction at fair value at an earlier 
stage of development as a result of 
more reliable valuable information 
being available
INTERNAL AUDIT
The Audit Committee is responsible, on behalf of the Board, for overseeing 
the Internal Audit function, which serves as the Group’s independent 
assurance over the adequacy and effectiveness of the systems and 
processes of risk management and control across the Group.
The Audit Committee monitors the scope, extent and effectiveness of 
the Group’s Internal Audit function. We review and approve the Internal 
Audit Policy and oversee the Internal Audit Plan, which is designed using 
a risk-based approach aligned with the overall strategy of the Group.
In 2017, the Internal Audit assignments focused on financial reporting, 
operational controls, information technology, information security 
systems and risk management processes. Each review was discussed 
and presented to the Committee. In addition, the Group engaged 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP to audit the Group’s internal controls 
associated with the information technology and security systems which 
also helped identify areas for improvement.
Throughout the year, we received regular reports from Internal Audit  
on its audit activities and significant findings as well as the corrective 
measures recommended to management. We also reviewed and 
monitored management’s responsiveness to the corrective measures 
through follow-up reports provided by Internal Audit.
The Head of Internal Audit has direct access to the Audit Committee  
and the opportunity to discuss matters with the Audit Committee without 
other members of management present. We also monitor the staffing of 
the Internal Audit department as well as the relevant qualifications and 
experience of the team. As mentioned earlier, a new Head of Internal 
Audit was appointed on 3 January 2018.
We reviewed the effectiveness of the Internal Audit department by 
considering the progress of internal audit against the agreed plan, taking 
into account the need to respond to changes in the Group’s business and 
the external environment. We also considered the quality of the reporting 
by Internal Audit to the Audit Committee and the ability of Internal Audit  
to address unsatisfactory results. On this basis, we concluded that the 
Internal Audit function is effective and respected by management, and 
that it conforms to the standards set by the Institute of Internal Auditors. 93 Annual Report 2017 BGEO Group PLC

EXTERNAL AUDIT
With respect to our responsibilities for the external audit process on 
behalf of the Board, we:
• approved the annual audit plan, which included setting the areas  
of responsibility, scope of the audit and key risks identified;
• oversaw the audit engagement, including the degree to which  
the external auditor was able to assess key accounting and 
audit judgement;
• reviewed the findings of the external audit with the external auditor, 
including the level of errors identified during the audit;
• monitored management’s responsiveness to the external auditor’s 
findings and recommendations;
• reviewed the qualifications, expertise and resources of the 
external auditor;
• monitored the external auditor’s independence, objectivity and 
compliance with ethical, professional and regulatory requirement;
• reviewed audit fees;
• monitored the rotation of key partners in accordance with 
applicable legislation; and
• recommended the appointment, re-appointment or removal,  
as applicable, of the external auditor.
AUDIT TENDER AND LEAD AUDIT PARTNER ROTATION
EY was appointed by the Board as our Group statutory auditor in 2012, 
following a competitive tender process and subsequently re-appointed 
by shareholders at our 2013 AGM. The Group will be required to put  
the external audit contract out to tender no later than 2022. We believe 
retaining EY as our auditor (subject to shareholder approval) is in the  
best interests of shareholders given EY’s continued independence, 
objectivity and performance on the audits they have completed,  
following assessment of their effectiveness by the Committee.
The Company complied with the mandatory audit processes and the 
Committee complied with the responsibility provisions set out in terms  
of the Competition and Markets Authority Statutory Audit Services Order 
2014 (“CMA Order”) relating to (a) putting the audit services engagement 
on tender every ten years; and (b) strengthening the accountability of  
the external auditors to the Committee, including requiring that only the 
Committee is permitted to agree to the external auditors’ fees and scope 
of services; influence the appointment of the audit engagement partner; 
make recommendations regarding the appointment of auditors; and 
authorise the auditors to carry out non-audit services.
We continue to review the auditor appointment and consider the 
opportune time to tender the audit. At this time the Committee intends  
to put the Audit to tender in 2022, although they may revisit this in light 
of the proposed demerger or otherwise and will continue to evaluate 
their options including a tender in 2018 for the financial year 2019 and 
further the Bank of Georgia Group PLC and Georgia Capital PLC expect 
separately to consider whether they will tender for audit services for  
the financial year 2019. The Committee confirms compliance with the 
provisions of the CMA Order for the year ended 31 December 2017.  
EY appointed John Headley as our lead audit partner in 2016. The 
external auditor is required to rotate the audit partner responsible  
for the Group at least every five years.
AUDITOR INDEPENDENCE
The Audit Committee is responsible for the development, implementation 
and monitoring of the policies and procedures on the use of the external 
auditor for non-audit services, which help to ensure that the external 
auditor maintains the necessary degree of independence and objectivity.
Further to its work on this in 2016, the Committee continues to take 
account of the European Union Audit Directive and Regulation in 
conjunction with the FRC’s Ethical Standard for Auditors, effective for the 
Company from 1 January 2017, in respect of prohibitions, as well as the 
provisions set out in the 2016 version of the Code in relation to non-audit 
services, and updates the Group’s non-audit services policy accordingly. 
Any non-trivial work other than for audit or interim statements to be 
undertaken by the external auditor now requires authorisation by the 
Audit Committee except in very narrow circumstances. The Group’s 
Policy on Non-Audit Services was revised and approved in December 
2017 and can be found on our website at http://bgeo.com/uploads/
pages/bgeo-nonaudit-services-policy-65.pdf.
The Audit Committee has formally assessed the independence of EY, 
which included review of: (i) a report from EY describing their arrangements 
to identify, report and manage any conflicts of interest, and their policies 
and procedures for maintaining independence and monitoring compliance 
with relevant requirements; and (ii) the value of non-audit services provided 
by EY. EY has also confirmed its independence throughout the year, within 
the meaning of the regulations on this matter and in accordance with their 
professional standards. As indicated in Note 28 of the audited IFRS 
financial statements for 2017 the total fees paid to EY for the year ended 
31 December 2017 were GEL 4.61 million of which GEL 603,000 related 
to work other than the audit or review of the interim accounts. 
Both EY and the Audit Committee do not consider that this work 
compromises the independence of the external auditor.
EFFECTIVENESS
We have an established framework for assessing the effectiveness  
of the external audit process. This includes:
• a review of the audit plan, including the materiality level set by the 
auditor and the process they have adopted to identify financial 
statement risks and key areas of audit focus;
• regular communications between the external auditor and both the 
Committee and management, including discussion of regular papers 
prepared by management and EY;
• regular discussions with EY (without management present) and 
management (without EY present) in order to discuss the external 
audit process;
• a review of the final audit report, noting key areas of auditor 
judgement and the reasoning behind the conclusions reached;
• a review of EY’s 2017 Transparency Report and the annual FRC Audit 
Quality Inspection Report of EY; and
• a formal questionnaire issued to all Committee members and also to 
the executive management of the Group leading the audit which covers 
among other items the quality of the audit and audit team, the audit 
planning approach and execution, the presence and capabilities of the 
lead audit partner, the audit team’s communication with the Committee 
and management and the auditor’s independence and objectivity
Following our assessment of the external auditor, we formed our own 
judgement (which was consistent with management’s view) and reported 
to the Board that:
• the audit team was sound and reliable, providing high-quality 
execution and service;
• the quality of the audit work was of a high standard;
• EY’s independence and objectivity were affirmed;
• EY was in a position to challenge management on its approach to 
key judgements; and
• appropriate discussions were held with the Audit Committee during 
the audit planning process.
EY was reappointed by shareholders at the 2017 AGM and the Board 
was authorised to set the remuneration of the auditor by 100% and 
99.7% votes in favour respectively.
The Committee has recommended to the Board that EY be reappointed 
under the current external audit contract and EY has expressed its 
willingness to continue as auditor of the Group. Separate resolutions 
proposing EY’s re-appointment and determination of EY’s remuneration 
by the Committee will be proposed at the 2018 AGM.
WHISTLEBLOWING, CONFLICTS OF INTEREST, ANTI‑BRIBERY 
AND ANTI‑CORRUPTION AND DATA PROTECTION POLICIES 
AND PROCEDURES
The Audit Committee ensures that there are effective procedures relating 
to whistleblowing. In particular, we have developed a Whistleblowing Policy 
which allows staff to confidentially raise any concerns about business 
practices. We keep this policy under review and receive regular updates 
from management as to any issues raised by employees. The Group 
implementation of Whistle B, an advanced independent whistleblowing 
reporting channel and case management tool to replace its existing 
whistleblowing platform, was completed in 2017. 94 Annual Report 2017 BGEO Group PLC
AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT CONTINUED
We have developed a Conflicts Authorisation Policy through which we 
assess actual and potential conflicts of interest and assist the Board in 
its review of the permissibility of such conflicts.
The Audit Committee keeps under review the Group’s Anti-Bribery  
and Anti-Corruption Policy and procedures and receives reports from 
management on a regular basis in relation to any actual or potential 
wrong-doing. There were no significant findings in 2017 but both policies 
were updated and implemented during the year. The Audit Committee 
considered the applicability and implications for the Group of the new 
General Data Protection Regulation effective from May 2018. An action 
plan is being put in place.
RISK MANAGEMENT AND INTERNAL CONTROLS
Although the Board assumes the ultimate responsibility for the Group’s 
risk management and internal control framework, its work is supported 
by both our Committee and the Risk Committee.
Since the Bank is the Group’s largest business and operates in the 
complex financial services sector, its risk management framework  
and internal control processes are key to that of the Group.
In relation to risk management and internal financial control, the Audit 
Committee assists the Board in fulfilling its responsibility to review the 
adequacy and effectiveness of the controls over financial reporting and 
certain types of operational risk: IT and information security (including 
cyber-security), corporate security and similar areas of operational risk 
and internal and external fraud or misconduct. The Committee also 
monitors the Group’s compliance with the corporate governance policies 
and procedures related to anti-bribery and anti-corruption, conflicts of 
interest and whistleblowing.
The Audit Committee is supported by a number of sources of internal 
assurance within the Group in order to discharge its responsibilities.  
This includes reports from and regular discussions with the Group 
executives with whom it regularly meets. We receive Internal Audit’s 
reports on the control environment and, as mentioned earlier in this 
report, we approve the Internal Audit Plan which is risk-based and 
aligned with the Group’s strategy.
For 2017, the Internal Audit Plan included a thorough risk management 
and internal control assessment, including compliance with corporate 
governance policies and procedures. During 2017 and up to the date of 
this Annual Report and Accounts, Internal Audit did not find any significant 
weaknesses in risk management or internal controls. We challenged the 
reports by management and Internal Audit and requested data regarding 
compliance with key policies and procedures related to operational risk.
With respect to external assurance, the Audit Committee reviews the 
external auditor’s reports to the Audit Committee, which include the 
external auditor’s observations on risk management and internal financial 
controls identified as part of its audit. Without management present, the 
Committee and EY discussed the key areas of audit focus, the suitability 
of the accounting policies which have been adopted and whether 
management’s key reporting estimates and judgements were appropriate.
In 2017, our risk management and internal control processes continued 
to evolve in line with the strategy of the Group. Set out below are a few 
examples of changes made in 2017.
FINANCE
The Finance department continued to build on the progress they made  
in 2016 in creating uniform accounting policies across the Group, 
completed a project to standardise the Group’s ledgers and improved 
Group covenant management while also leading the finance workstream 
of the proposed demerger.
INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND INFORMATION 
SECURITY SYSTEMS
Following the information technology and information security systems 
audit undertaken by Price Waterhouse Coopers LLP improvements have 
been made to policies and procedures.
The Audit Committee has also considered and confirmed to the Board 
that its work is performed in accordance with the provisions in the Code 
and the Financial Reporting Council’s (FRC) associated Guidance on  
Risk Management, Internal Control and Related Financial and Business 
Reporting. Based on the above, we are satisfied that our overall internal 
control framework is effective.
CONTINUING EDUCATION AND TRAINING
Throughout the year, the Audit Committee received presentations and 
training from the Company Secretary in respect of the guidance from the 
Financial Reporting Council (which included the letter to Audit Committee 
Chairs), the Non-Financial Reporting Directive and the Audit Directive and 
Regulation in conjunction with the FRC’s Ethical Standard for Auditors. 
The whole Board also received training on the current and proposed 
changes to the UK Corporate Governance Code affecting the Audit 
Committee and other areas.
VIABILITY STATEMENT
In accordance with the Code, the Directors are required to assess  
the viability of the Group. In collaboration with the Risk Committee, and 
also considering the recommendations of the FRC guidance, we spent 
time considering the timeframe over which the viability statement should 
be made as well as an assessment underlying the period of coverage, 
which we agreed should be three years. In addition to aligning with the 
period covered by the Group’s strategy and financial forecasts, this 
three-year period seems particularly appropriate for a Company whose 
business model continues to evolve in a rapidly developing frontier 
market like Georgia’s. In particular, we looked closely at: the Group’s 
principal risks and uncertainties, including those that will threaten its 
business model, future performance and solvency or liquidity; the current 
financial position of the Group, including future cash flows, allocated 
capital expenditure and funding requirements; future prospects; and 
downside stress testing. We discussed our analysis with the Risk 
Committee, management and full Board.  
FAIR, BALANCED AND UNDERSTANDABLE REPORTING
The Committee reviewed the 2017 Annual Report and Accounts to 
consider whether it is fair, balanced and understandable and provides 
the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s 
performance, business model and strategy.
We did this by satisfying ourselves that there was a robust process  
of review and challenge at different levels within the Group to ensure 
balance and consistency. We reviewed several drafts of the 2017 Annual 
Report and Accounts and directly reviewed the overall messages and 
tone of the Annual Report with the CEOs and CFO. We also considered 
other information regarding the Group’s performance and business 
presented to the Board during the period, both from management and 
the external auditor. After consideration of all of this information, we are 
satisfied that, when taken as a whole, the Annual Report and Accounts 
is fair, balanced and understandable, and provides the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s performance, business 
model and strategy.
COMMITTEE EFFECTIVENESS REVIEW
As part of their evaluation of the Board and Committees, Lintstock 
assisted the Board in reviewing the Committee’s performance over the 
financial year. This external review found that the Committee’s performance 
was rated highly by respondents and highlighted particular areas that had 
helped improve the Committee’s discussion such as the formation of an 
IFRS desk by the Finance department and a new format for reviewing 
audit issues.
Our priorities for 2018 include, among others, continued focus on:
• the implementation of legal and governance structures and financial 
reporting of the proposed demerger of the Group;
• risks around the proposed demerger of the Group;
• the successful implementation of IFRS 9, and preparation for IFRS 16 
implementation in 2019; and
• implementing the improvements in IT audit internal controls. 95 Annual Report 2017 BGEO Group PLC

CHAIRMAN OF THE RISK COMMITTEE
RISK COMMITTEE REPORT
Dear Shareholders,
In 2017 the Risk Committee built on the progress made last year in 
strengthening our risk management framework and internal controls.  
The Committee has assisted the Board in providing oversight of the 
Group’s overall risk appetite in a dynamic risk environment and has 
helped ensure that we achieve our strategic objectives through effective 
risk management.
As reported last year, part of our strategy to achieve a 20%+ Return on 
Equity in the Banking Business included enhancing an already prudent risk 
management process. This has led to a decrease in our Banking Business 
cost of risk ratio for 2017 to 2.2%.The Committee also reviewed the NPL 
and asset management group’s policies, procedures and organisations 
and management’s suggested improvements designed to both accelerate 
and maximise the recovery on NPLs and asset liquidation, as well as 
enhanced analytic tools reflecting the opportunity cost of equity associated 
with recovery timeframes.
The Committee was particularly pleased to oversee the Group’s successful 
efforts in reducing borrower concentration. This included discussions and 
review of strategies and actions by management covering lending and 
NPL, to improve asset quality through structure renegotiations, principal 
reductions and other qualitative measurements.
The Committee also continues to monitor the de-dollarisation programme 
which has particular relevance to borrowers of Dollars who earn revenues 
in Georgian Lari, and the mitigation of the impact of any depreciation of 
the Lari.
We followed through with each of the priorities we set for 2017. As 
above, we continued to focus heavily on our loan portfolio and strategy 
to mitigate risks associated with the dollarisation of our loan book, the 
depreciation of the Lari and the concentration of borrowers. Furthermore, 
other main areas of risk mitigation on which the Committee focused in 
the year were:
1. expansion of the business continuity programme by developing 
proactive plans for business units – this covered the entities that  
were part of the Banking Business;
2. review of the risk mitigation tools and control functions that are  
used to assess the effectiveness of existing controls;
3. in credit underwriting, extension of the use of data analytics and 
implemented model validation process;
4. use of quantitative assessment of credit for corporate borrowers;
5. devised counterparty limit monitoring and management based on  
our existing credit scoring model; and
6. aggregating the Group’s foreign currency exposure management.
I invite you to read more about our work in the following report.
Kim Bradley
Chairman of the Risk Committee 
7 March 2018 
KEY PURPOSE AND RESPONSIBILITIES
The purpose of the Risk Committee is to assist the Board in fulfilling its 
responsibilities in relation to the oversight of risk and to provide advice  
in relation to current and potential future risk exposures. This includes 
reviewing the Group’s risk appetite and risk profile, the desired culture 
and how it has been embedded, assessing the effectiveness of the  
risk management framework and systems of internal control, and the 
Company’s capability to identify and manage new types of risk.
The key responsibilities of the Risk Committee are to:
• support the Board to ensure that risk appetite and exposure are 
addressed as part of strategy;
• oversee the risk management infrastructure,process and 
effectiveness;
• support the Board in monitoring risk exposure and the 
implementation of our strategy to address risk;
• oversee, support and evaluate the risk management roles of our 
executive management risk team;
• encourage and ensure open and broad discussion on perceived risk 
concerns and responsive efforts to mitigate when necessary;
• assess the adequacy and quality of the risk management function in 
conjunction with the Audit Committee and the effectiveness of risk 
reporting within the Group; and
• in collaboration with the Audit Committee, review the principal risks 
and uncertainties disclosures in the Half-Year and Annual Reports.
The principal risk categories overseen by the Risk Committee include 
currency and macro-economic, regional instability, regulatory, cyber-
security, information systems and financial crime, Investment Business 
strategy, demerger and future performance risk and certain operational 
risks (other than those overseen by the Audit Committee) within the Group.
We reviewed the Committee’s Terms of Reference and updated them in 
September 2017 to reflect current best practice.
The Risk Committee’s full Terms of Reference are available on our 
website at http://bgeo.com/uploads/pages/bgeo-risk-committee-terms-
of-reference-98.pdf.
COMPOSITION OF THE RISK COMMITTEE AND MEETINGS
Our Risk Committee is comprised solely of Independent Non-Executive 
Directors. The Committee members are Kim Bradley (Chairman), Al 
Breach, Tamaz Georgadze and Hanna Loikkanen.
Each member’s attendance is shown in the Board and Committee 
attendance table on page 86.
During 2017, the Chief Risk Officer, BGEO Group CFO, Bank CEO, Bank 
CFO and Jonathan Muir regularly attended our meetings. From time to 
time, other members of management are invited to attend meetings in 
order to provide a deeper level of insight into key issues and developments. 
In addition, non-Committee Board members are also invited to attend.
At each meeting, the Risk Committee receives detailed reporting  
which provides an analysis of: the Group’s overall risk profile using both 
quantitative models and risk analytics, loan portfolio dynamics, key risk 
exposures and management actions, performance against risk appetite, 
the emerging and potential risks the Group may face, the drivers of risk 
throughout the Group as well as analysis of down side stress testing 
scenarios. The underlying assumptions, methodology applied and results 
of such stress testing are challenged by the Risk Committee.
Meetings of the Risk Committee take place prior to the Board meeting  
in order for the Risk Committee to report its activities and matters of 
particular relevance to the Board.
Safeguarding shareholder value 96 Annual Report 2017 BGEO Group PLC
RISK COMMITTEE FOCUS DURING 2017
We continued to focus on our remit as set out above. As mentioned in 
last year’s Annual Report, our 2017 priorities were to continue focusing 
on the reduction of our overall corporate credit exposure and Dollar-
denominated loan book, and insuring that our risk teams within the  
Bank as well as our Investment Business executed on their objectives.
On the macro economic front, we focused on various interest rate  
and currency scenarios given the strengthened Dollar and interest rate 
increases by the Federal Reserve. We also monitored potential policy 
shifts towards the region following the 2016 US elections.
Further focus of the Risk Committee in 2017 is set out in the Chairman’s 
Statement above.
OUR LOAN BOOK
Macroeconomic conditions in Georgia during the year were affected by 
low economic growth within the region, commodity price fluctuations 
and the depreciation of the Lari, particularly against the Dollar. The Group 
saw an increase in NPLs and changes in debt-service coverage ratios 
with respect to Dollar-denominated loans covered by Lari income as a 
result of these conditions, which in turn increased our cost of credit risk.
We monitored this very closely and conducted credit-specific reviews  
on the top 20 corporate exposures, both in formal Committee meetings 
and on informal interim calls with management. We worked closely with 
management throughout the year to formulate strategies to mitigate risk 
which included the continued drive to increase local currency loans and 
analysis of retail borrowers’ debt bearing capacity amongst other topics. 
Retail Banking successfully increased its local currency loans by nearly 
68.7% between 2016 and 2017.
Despite approximately 83.1% of our corporate investment loan book  
being denominated in Dollars, more than 43% of corporate investment 
customers with Dollar loans have income in Dollars. The vast majority of 
our corporate customers were able to continue servicing their loans. The 
Committee regularly monitors the corporate loan book. In 2017, we have 
achieved a significant improvement in the de-dollarisation of our Banking 
Business loan portfolio, with the share of local currency loans increasing by 
9.6 percentage points and reaching 61.7%. The Georgian government’s 
de-dollarisaton initiatives and our ability to attract local currency funding 
have been primary drivers of this. We do not expect the de-dollarisation  
to continue at the same rate, but we do expect local currency loans to 
increase at a faster rate than foreign currency denominated loans, as  
other government initiatives (e.g. pension reform) come into force and  
we continue to attract local currency funding from institutional investors. 
Throughout the year, we reviewed management’s quantitative 
assessments of credit for corporate borrowers and monitored the 
implementation by management of the corporate loan book risk 
deconcentration strategy. We were pleased that management continued 
to deliver on this strategy by reducing the concentration of our top ten 
Corporate and Investment Business clients to 10.7% at the end of 2017, 
down from 11.8% at the end of 2016. On the overall balance sheet level, 
the risk de-concentration strategy involves a focus on retail versus 
corporate credit growth as well as our previously communicated steps to 
increase overall NPL coverage ratio. At corporate level, specifically, our 
de-concentration measures include reducing our corporate guarantee 
exposure to certain sectors and focus on further developing our corporate 
credit syndication activities. This strategy takes time and corporate credit 
risk reduction will remain one of our risk priorities in 2018.
We closely monitored NPL levels and management actions to assure 
adequate coverage of our loan loss exposure. Our NPL coverage ratio 
was successfully increased from 86.7% at 31 December 2016 to 92.7% 
at 31 December 2017.
RISK MANAGEMENT
In 2017, we continued to assist the Board in setting the Group’s risk 
appetite and exposure in line with the Group’s strategic objectives and  
in making any necessary modifications as strategy evolves and when the 
risk environment changes. We also monitored the Group’s risk exposure 
and actions to address risk, which included oversight and support of our 
executive management risk team.
We continued to work closely with the Audit Committee to ensure that 
our risk management framework and systems of internal control operate 
effectively and in compliance with the Code and FRC guidance. We also 
worked through the processes supporting the assessment of the Group’s 
longer-term solvency and liquidity which underlie the viability statement. 
During the year, management reviewed the risk mitigation tools and 
control functions and reported to the Committee (and to the Audit 
Committee) on their assessment of the effectiveness of these controls. 
Key changes during 2017 to our control framework included the 
management and monitoring of counterparty limits, based on our 
previously implemented credit scoring model, the aggregation of the 
Group’s foreign currency exposure management and the extension  
of artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms in our model 
validation process for credit underwriting.
In 2017, we discussed how we could improve the approach to 
incorporating the cost of risk into the pricing of corporate credits.  
The management team developed a new model which allowed this  
to be estimated over a 12-month period and adjusted if necessary 
throughout the period and revised the limits for single borrower 
exposures. We also considered how our stress testing could be 
augmented to factor in extended periods of stress and expanded  
the business continuity programme by developing proactive business 
continuity plans to cover other Banking Business companies.
During the year, we also monitored the implementation of the Bank 
Compliance Policy, the development of our Data Protection Policy and 
reviewed management’s anti-money laundering assessments in respect 
of correspondent banks.
We also carried out a robust review of the principal risks and uncertainties 
disclosure and other relevant risk management disclosures and reported 
to the Board with our recommendation on their inclusion in this Annual 
Report and the Half-Year Report.
We continued to assist formulating the Group viability statement in 
conjunction with the Audit Committee and management. The viability 
statement can be found on page 33.
COMMITTEE EFFECTIVENESS REVIEW
Lintstock, an external evaluator, performed the review of the Committee, 
focusing on its overall performance and with all Board members identifying 
and discussing their views on what they would consider as the most 
significant risks to the Company. The effectiveness evaluation concluded 
that the Committee continues to operate and perform effectively.
Our main priorities for 2018 are to formalise the Bank’s risk appetite in 
meeting our strategic objectives to confirm the Bank’s tolerance levels  
for all risk types. During the year, the processes whereby the Bank’s risk 
function provides services to Group companies was identified and we 
will continue to redesign these processes to accommodate the new 
structure of the Group following the demerger.
An overview of our risk management framework is set out 
on pages 32 to 33.
A description of these principal risks and uncertainties, in addition  
to recent trends and outlook, as well as mitigation efforts can be  
found on pages 34 to 37.
An overview of the Bank risk management framework is set out 
on pages 38 to 43.

SHAREHOLDER ENGAGEMENT
The Company has a comprehensive shareholder engagement 
programme and maintains an open and transparent dialogue with 
existing and potential shareholders, a responsibility that the Company 
takes very seriously.
The Board’s primary contact with institutional shareholders is through  
the Chairman, Independent Non-Executive Directors, CEO and Head  
of Investor Relations, each of whom provide a standing invitation to 
shareholders to meet and discuss any matters they wish to raise.  
Our Committee Chairmen also make themselves available to answer 
questions from investors.
We formally communicate with our shareholders via our AGM, Annual 
Report and Accounts, Half-Year Report and Interim Management 
Statements. These are supported by a combination of presentations  
and telephone briefings. Over the course of the year, we met with some 
400 institutional investors, and participated in more than 20 investor 
conferences and road shows. Throughout the year, our Directors and 
management met with shareholders in Georgia, the United Kingdom, 
Europe, the United States, Singapore and South Africa.
In November 2017, BGEO hosted an investor day in Tbilisi, which  
was open to all investors and analysts. This investor day provided  
the opportunity for investors to receive an update from the Board and 
executive management on strategy and performance as well as meet 
informally with Board members and raise matters of interest. BGEO  
was pleased to host approximately 60 investors and analysts at the 
investor day.
In addition to our shareholders, we meet and present to analysts 
throughout the year, hold regular meetings with the Group’s existing 
lenders and actively engage with potential lenders to discuss our funding 
strategy. Our Group Company Secretary also has ongoing communication 
with the shareholders’ advisory groups.
The Chairman has overall responsibility for ensuring that the Board 
understands the views of major stakeholders. The full Board is regularly 
kept informed of these views by the Chairman as well as executive 
management and the Investor Relations team and, to the extent deemed 
appropriate, issues raised at these meetings have been adopted by  
the Group. Informal feedback from analysts and the Group’s corporate 
advisors is also shared with the Board.
Our website, www.bgeo.com, provides our stakeholders with access  
to the Group’s results, press releases, investor presentations, analyst 
reports, details on our corporate governance and corporate and social 
responsibility framework, our leadership, as well as other information

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT
Dear Shareholders,
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present our Directors’ 
Remuneration Report for 2017 comprising this statement, the 
Remuneration Report for the year ended 31 December 2017 which  
is subject to an advisory vote at the forthcoming AGM, and our 
Remuneration Policy as approved at the 2017 Annual General Meeting 
which applies to the Company’s remuneration arrangements for the 
period up until the Company’s 2020 AGM. The Remuneration Committee 
was encouraged by the strong shareholder approval of the Remuneration 
Policy, with over 94% of voting in favour of the Policy at the 2017 AGM.
This letter summarises the remuneration decisions taken in the year and, 
in the remainder of the report, I aim to set these decisions in the context 
of the Company’s performance this year.
During the year, the Committee continued to seek to align remuneration 
targets with the Company’s strategic priorities and shareholder returns. 
In preparation for the demerger of the Company and the Investment 
Business, the Committee has reviewed and enhanced the self-
development and mentoring of KPIs and the scope of the management 
performance evaluation.
The Committee also made its annual determination of the discretionary 
remuneration for our CEO, Irakli Gilauri, and the executive management 
team. I would remind shareholders that the majority of Mr Gilauri’s salary 
is awarded in deferred shares which vest over a period of five years. This 
structure provides alignment with the Company and its shareholders over 
the long term.
WHAT IS IN THIS REPORT?
This Directors’ Remuneration Report describes the implementation of BGEO Directors’ Remuneration Policy and discloses the amounts 
earned relating to the year ended 31 December 2017.
The report complies with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006 and Schedule 8 of The Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups 
(Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008. The report has been prepared in line with the recommendations of the Code and the requirements  
of the UKLA Listing Rules.
The Directors’ Remuneration Policy was approved by shareholders in a binding vote at the 2017 AGM and took formal effect from the date  
of approval and will apply until the 2020 AGM, at which time we will be required to submit our Directors’ Remuneration Policy for approval  
by shareholders. Our Directors’ Remuneration Policy has again been included in this report (set out on pages 105 to 111) for the purposes  
of clarity and transparency.
The Annual Report on Remuneration (set out on pages 98 to 113) (which includes the Annual Statement by the Chairman of the 
Remuneration Committee set out on this page will be subject to an advisory vote at the 2018 AGM.
2017 was a year of exceptional performance for the Group. The banking 
business outperformed against all of its targets and many of the group’s 
investments demonstrated outstanding performance. Mr Gilauri met or 
exceeded expectations in respect of his KPIs and oversaw a significant 
new strategic initiative in relation to the demerger, whilst still ensuring 
significant growth in total shareholder return. The Committee and the 
Board rated Mr Gilauri’s overall performance in 2017 as exceptional and 
consequently the Committee were of the strong opinion that he deserved 
the maximum bonus that we awarded him.
We also considered the performance against KPIs of the appropriate 
bonuses of senior management. 
The Committee also received training from the Company Secretary on the 
recent developments in remuneration in the industry and in governance.
The priorities for 2018 will be setting remuneration for the Company 
in respect of the demerger of the Bank and the Investment Business.  
If the planned demerger goes ahead, it is envisaged that the separate 
companies would seek shareholder approval for their remuneration 
policies at the general meetings after the demerger in 2019. In the 
meantime, the companies intend to keep to the principles set out in the 
current shareholder approved policy with appropriate changes. Further 
details will be set out in the shareholder circular regarding the demerger.

Notes:
1. Expressed in Dollars but paid in British Pounds and Lari, as applicable, converted into the respective currency as at the date of payment. Accordingly, there may be variations  
in the numbers above and those provided in the accounts.
2. Deferred share salary. The figures show the value of the BGEO shares underlying nil-cost options granted in respect of the relevant year. For both 2017 and 2016, the award  
was 90,000 BGEO shares. A new service agreement that Mr Gilauri signed on 24 August 2015 came into effect on 1 May 2016. For 2016, the value of the deferred share salary 
payable is calculated as follows: (a) from 1 January 2016 until 1 May 2016 (when the prior service agreement was in effect), the share price used is at the date the prior service 
agreement was signed, being US$ 21.71 per share (based on the official share price of GBP 14.06 per share converted into Dollars using an exchange rate of 1.5443, being the 
official exchange rate published by the Bank of England on the same date); and (b) from 1 May 2016 until 31 December 2016 (when the new service agreement was in effect), the 
share price used is at the date the new service agreement was signed, being US$ 25.43 per share (the official share price of GBP 16.16 per share as at 24 August 2015 converted 
into Dollars using an exchange rate of 1.5738, being the official exchange rate published by the Bank of England on the same date). For 2017, the new service agreement 
continues and therefore the figures in part (b) of the previous sentence apply. Under the deferred share programme, the option awards in respect of deferred share salary are 
formally granted in January of the year following the year to which the award relates (the “work year”) even though the number of deferred salary shares is fixed in the contract.  
The terms and conditions applying to deferred share salary are described in section 1(a) of the 2017 Policy available at http://bgeo.com/uploads/annualreports/2016-804.pdf and 
consistent with the Policy table on page 100 and Note 1 to the Policy table on pages 101 to 102.
3. Discretionary deferred share remuneration. The figures show the value of BGEO shares underlying nil-cost options granted in respect of bonus awards in the relevant year.  
For 2017, options were awarded over 45,548 BGEO shares. The discretionary remuneration in respect of 2017 is deferred and vests over three years in equal amounts in each  
of the second, third and fourth years following the work year. The value was calculated by reference to the share price on 8 December 2017 (the working day before the meeting  
at which the award was determined) which was US$ 44.89 (based on the official share price of GBP 33.56 per share converted into Dollars using an exchange rate of 1.3376, 
being the official exchange rate published by the Bank of England on the same date). For 2016, options were awarded over 37,450 BGEO shares. The value was calculated  
by reference to the share price on 28 February 2017 which was US$ 34.91(based on the official share price of GBP 28.05 per share converted into Dollars using an exchange  
rate of 1.2445, being the official exchange rate published by the Bank of England on the same date). The discretionary remuneration in respect of 2016 is deferred and vests  
over three years in equal amounts, beginning in January of the second year following the work year. Both the 2017 and 2016 awards are subject to the leaver provisions described 
on pages 105 to 106 of the 2017 Policy available at http://bgeo.com/uploads/annualreports/2016-804.pdf. The means of determining the number of shares underlying this 
remuneration and the terms and conditions are described in Note 2 of the 2017 Policy on page 102 and available at http://bgeo.com/uploads/annualreports/2016-804.pdf.  
The basis for determining Mr Gilauri’s 2017 discretionary award is described on the next two pages.
4. Benefits. The figures show the gross taxable value of health, life and personal accident insurance.
5. Pensions. The figures show the aggregate employer contributions for the relevant years into the Group’s defined contribution pension scheme. Under the Group’s defined 
contribution pension scheme, normal retirement age is 65.
6. Dividend equivalents. The figure shows the dividend value paid in respect of nil-cost options exercised in the relevant years.
7. Mr Gilauri was reimbursed for reasonable business expenses, on provision of valid receipts.
8. No money or other assets are received or receivable by Mr Gilauri in respect of a period of more than one financial year, where final vesting is determined by reference to 
achievement of performance measures or targets relating to the relevant period.  100 Annual Report 2017 BGEO Group PLC
The following table sets out details of total remuneration for Mr Gilauri for the period from 1 January 2012 to 31 December 2017 and his discretionary

BASIS FOR DETERMINING MR GILAURI’S DISCRETIONARY DEFERRED SHARE REMUNERATION IN RESPECT OF 2017
Mr Gilauri’s KPIs include both objective and non-tangible components. The objective elements largely track the Group’s KPIs as he is expected to 
deliver on the Group’s strategy, but the KPIs also include non-tangible factors such as leadership, strategy development and implementation, as well 
as corporate and social responsibility. Strict weighting is not imposed on the KPIs below for the reasons mentioned in Note 2 of the 2017 Policy 
table on page 102 available at http://bgeo.com/uploads/annualreports/2016-804.pdf.
The following table sets out the objective KPIs set for Mr Gilauri in respect of 2017 as well as Mr Gilauri’s performance against them.

Continued enhancement Strong additions to the Investment 
Business management teams
Enhancement includes 
recruitment and appointment  
of Shota Berekashvili and
Giorgi Natroshvili as Deputy CEO 
Construction Management and 
CFO of m

 respectively. Ahead  
of the demerger Mr Gilauri has 
also positioned the Investment 
Business well, including with the 
appointment of Giorgi Alpaidze  
as Group CFO, to become CFO  
of the Investment Business.
GROUP‑WIDE
Management team Coaching and mentoring Met expectations Mr Gilauri has enhanced the 
management development 
programmes. He has rolled out 
across the Group the Leadership 
Organisational Learning and 
Graham Ward Ph.D. programmes  
in respect of senior management 
and further expanded to lower 
leadership levels.
Self-development Continued self-development Met expectations Mr Gilauri has continued to 
prioritise his self-development 
through feedback received from 
the Board and his peers.
In terms of objective KPIs, Mr Gilauri met or exceeded all KPIs, as described on the previous page. In addition to the pre-set KPIs, Mr Gilauri’s key 
accomplishments in 2017 include:
• The outperformance of the Banking Business against the targets set out above;
• The good performance of many of the Group’s investments together with the ongoing strategic development of all businesses; and
• Overseeing a period of significant growth in total shareholder return.
In addition to these preset KPIs, Mr Gilauri has instigated and been preparing the Group for the demerger of the Banking and Investment Businesses 
which the Committee recognises as a huge project and a pivotal point in the Group’s development. The project involves a massive reorganisation of 
the businesses and people in addition to stringent regulatory requirements. The project ran on schedule through the second half of 2017 and was 
generally well received by shareholders and stakeholders.

2017 BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS
2017 business highlights include:
• Outperformance of the banking business against its targets;
• Excellent performance of many of the group’s investments together; and
• Ongoing strategic development of all underlying businesses;
For 2017, the Committee found that Mr Gilauri’s overall performance was exceptional. As a result, the Committee determined that Mr Gilauri should 
be awarded discretionary deferred share remuneration at maximum opportunity (75% of total salary, being total cash salary and total deferred share 
salary as listed in the table above) based on the share price when it made its determination. The Committee therefore agreed to award Mr Gilauri 
45,548 shares.
MR GILAURI’S 2018 KPIS – DISCRETIONARY DEFERRED SHARE REMUNERATION
For 2018, in respect of objective KPIs, we plan to continue measuring Mr Gilauri’s performance against KPIs which reflect the separation of our 
Banking and Investment Businesses as well as the strategy of the Group as a whole.
BANKING BUSINESS
• Return on Average equity as targeted
• Total banking business loan book growth as targeted
• NIM as targeted
• Cost/Income as targeted
• Dividend Payout Ratio – 25-40%
Longer Term Indicator 
• Product to client ratio in mass retail as targeted
• Bank’s visibility/importance as a private banking hub as targeted
• Cost of risk and NPL Coverage Ratio in line with strategy
INVESTMENT BUSINESS – 2018 INDICATOR
• Growth of NAV of portfolio companies in line with strategy
• Achieve strategic priorities of portfolio companies in line with strategy
• Active and disciplined pursuit of new investment opportunities
• Diversify funding base for portfolio companies
Longer Term Indicator 
• Progress towards exit on investments in line with strategy
• Average return on combined exits in line with strategy
OTHER KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS
• Active mentoring and development of Senior Management
• Personal development
In the event of the demerger, it was expected that the Investment Business KPIs would remain with Irakli Gilauri and the Banking Business KPIs 
would transfer to the CEO of the Bank, but the Remuneration Committees of Bank of Georgia PLC and Georgia Capital would have the discretion 
to consider appropriate adjustments to the KPIs.

Notes:
1. Deferred share salary. The figures show the value of the BGEO shares underlying nil-cost options granted in respect of year ended 31 December 2016. The award was  
90,000 BGEO shares and the value of the deferred share salary is calculated as follows: (a) from 1 January 2016 until 1 May 2016 (when the prior service agreement was  
in effect), the share price used is at the date the prior service agreement was signed, being US$ 21.71 per share (based on the official share price of GBP 14.06 per share 
converted into Dollars using an exchange rate of 1.5443, being the official exchange rate published by the Bank of England on the same date); and (b) from 1 May 2016 until 
31 December 2016 (when the new service agreement was in effect), the share price used is at the date the new service agreement was signed, being US$ 25.43 per share  
(the official share price of GBP 16.16 per share as at 24 August 2015 converted into Dollars using an exchange rate of 1.5738, being the official exchange rate published  
by the Bank of England on the same date).The terms and conditions applying to deferred share salary for 2016 are described in section 1(a) of the 2014 Policy available at  
http://bgeo.com/uploads/pages/remuneration-policy-86.pdf.
2. Discretionary deferred share remuneration. For 2016, options were awarded over 37,450 BGEO shares. The value is calculated by reference to the share price on 28 February 
2017 which was US$ 34.91 (based on the official share price of GBP 28.05 per share converted into Dollars using an exchange rate of 1.2445, being the official exchange rate 
published by the Bank of England on the same date). The means of determining the number of shares underlying this award and the terms and conditions are described in section 
1(b) of the 2014 Policy available at http://bgeo.com/uploads/pages/remuneration-policy-86.pdf.

Notes:
1. On 4 September 2015, Mr Janin was appointed as an Independent Non-Executive Director of GHG PLC. He also served as Chairman of both its Nomination and Remuneration 
Committees (resigning in May 2017) and was appointed to its Clinical Quality and Safety Committee in February 2017 until resigning his membership in June 2017. Mr Janin serves 
on the Supervisory Board and Committees of JSC Georgia Healthcare Group. In 2017 and 2016, Neil Janin received remuneration of US$ 102,119 and US$ 111,000 respectively, 
from GHG PLC and JSC Georgia Healthcare Group, in respect of his services.
2. On 4 September 2015, Mr Morrison was appointed as an Independent Non-Executive Director of GHG PLC. He also serves as Chairman of its Audit Committee and is a member of 
its Nomination Committee. He stepped down from its Clinical Quality and Safety Committee in February 2017. Mr Morrison serves on the Supervisory Board and Committees of JSC 
Georgia Healthcare Group. In 2017 and 2016 respectively, Mr Morrison received remuneration of US$ 156,000 and US$ 156,000, from GHG PLC and JSC Georgia Healthcare Group 
together, in respect of his services.
3. Mr Muir was appointed to the Board of BGEO on 20 June 2017 and therefore the fees reflected in respect of 2017 have been pro-rated from the date of appointment until 
31 December 2017.
4. The maximum amount for BGEO base fees, including the Chairman, as provided for in BGEO’s Articles of Association, is GBP 750,000. 
The new Directors’ Remuneration Policy was approved at the AGM of 1 June 2017 by shareholders and includes revised fees for Non-Executive 
Directors and a top-up payment in 2017 to allow the Non-Executive Directors to reach the level of fees indicated for the financial year. The increased 
proportion payable by the Bank reflects the increased work performed for the Georgian entities. See the Non-Executive Directors’ Remuneration 
Policy reproduced later in this section on page 113.
In 2017, no payments were made to past Directors, nor were payments made for loss of office.

Notes:  
1. In the Annual Report for the year ended 31 December 2016, we presented Mr Gilauri’s unvested and unexercised shares inclusive of all options granted in respect of that work 
year. In the above table, we have presented only the number of unvested and unexercised shares as at 31 December 2016 and 31 December 2017. Further details of the awards 
made and determined in respect of those work years up to 6 March 2018 are in Notes 2 and 3 below.
2. In 2017, Mr Gilauri received awards of 90,000 salary deferred shares and 37,450 discretionary deferred shares for the 2016 work year. In March 2017, Mr Gilauri exercised options 
in respect of 126,000 BGEO shares, of which 25,200 were withheld to satisfy tax liabilities. The net gain on exercise of these share options was US$2,395,190.
3. In January 2018 Mr Gilauri was granted 90,000 nil cost options in respect of deferred salary shares for the 2017 work year pursuant to the executive equity compensation plan. On 
20 February 2018, Mr Gilauri exercised options in respect of 125,983 BGEO shares, of which 25,197 BGEO shares were withheld to satisfy tax liabilities. Whilst the Remuneration 
Committee has determined the award for discretionary deferred share compensation, being options over 45,548 shares to be received as per Note 3 to the single total figure of 
remuneration table above, this will be reported in the 2018 Annual Report and Accounts and is not included in the table above, which is as at 31 December 2017.
4. At 2017 year-end, NeilCo Limited, a company wholly-owned by Mr Janin, held 10,000 BGEO shares.
5. At 2017 year-end, Gemsstock Growth Fund, which Mr Breach manages, held 20,000 BGEO shares. On 28 February 2018, Al Breach personally purchased 7,600 BGEO shares. 
The Remuneration Policy is heavily weighted towards remuneration in deferred salary shares and deferred discretionary shares. In respect of 2017, 
85% of Mr Gilauri’s compensation was in the form of deferred shares. The long vesting periods, particularly for deferred salary shares (five years), 
result in executive management having large holdings of shares. Accordingly, the Group does not apply a shareholding guideline or impose a holding 
period on Mr Gilauri’s shares. The Policy naturally results in our executives holding a significant number of unvested shares and achieves a delay 
between performance and vesting. We believe these results are consistent with the principles of the Investment Management Association.
As at the date of this Annual Report, Mr Gilauri’s vested and unvested shareholding is 680,868 BGEO shares, representing approximately 1.73%  
of the share capital of BGEO. The vesting period for the majority of unvested shares exceeds three years.
None of Mr Gilauri’s connected persons have interests in any BGEO shares.
The Group does not require Non-Executive Directors to hold a specified number of shares in BGEO. Notwithstanding this, some Non-Executive 
Directors have chosen to become shareholders.
Several of our Directors chose to subscribe for shares in the GHG IPO on 12 November 2015. The following table sets forth the respective holdings 
of GHG shares of each Director as at 31 December 2017.

MR GILAURI’S INTERESTS IN GROUP DEBT SECURITIES, REAL ESTATE AND AMEX CARD
Directors and executive management of the Group from time to time will purchase securities or real estate from Group entities on an arm’s length 
basis. In the interest of transparency, such transactions entered into by our sole Executive Director, Mr Gilauri, are described below.
Mr Gilauri participated in the US$ 25 million three-year bond offering by m
2
 Real Estate. Both bonds are listed on the Georgian Stock Exchange. As 
at the date of this Annual Report, Mr Gilauri holds US$ 41,240 worth of m
2
 Real Estate bonds. Mr Gilauri also purchased US$ 3,372 worth of Teliani 
Valley shares.
On 24 December 2015 and 3 October 2016, Mr Gilauri purchased an apartment in the m
2
 Real Estate Skyline project to the amount of US$ 519,220 
and US$ 416,239, respectively. Mr Gilauri purchased these apartments on an arm’s length basis.
During the year, Mr Gilauri, obtained and fully repaid an Amex card loan in the amount of GEL 136,761 granted at market terms.
DETAILS OF NON‑EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS’ TERMS OF APPOINTMENT
Letters of Appointment are entered into by BGEO with each Non-Executive Director, generally for a three-year term and subject to our succession
plan which permits service for a six-year period. However, at the discretion of the Board, if the Non-Executive’s continued membership is in the best
interests of the Group, he may be re-offered membership to the Board pursuant to a letter of appointment for an additional one-year term, which 
may be renewed no more than two times. All Non-Executive Directors are proposed for annual re-election at the AGM.
The Letters of Appointment require Non-Executive Directors to provide one month’s notice prior to termination and the Company may terminate their 
appointment on one month’s notice, or less in certain circumstances.
The table below shows each Non-Executive Director’s date of appointment to the Board of BGEO.

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION POLICY
Our Directors’ Remuneration Policy was approved by our shareholders in June 2017 (the “2017 Policy”) with a vote of 94% in favour. The 
Remuneration Committee appreciated the support of shareholders in approving the Policy and the Annual Report on Remuneration will outline  
how we have implemented the Policy in 2017.
The principles of our Policy as it applies to Executive Directors are: (i) heavily weighting salary to long-term deferred share remuneration rather than 
cash; and (ii) paying performance-based remuneration in the form of deferred shares only and no cash. Pension and benefits are only a very small 
part of the remuneration package (less than 5%).
These key principles have remained the same since 2010. Our simple and strategically aligned remuneration structure means that Executive 
Directors are completely focused on delivering shareholder value.
Mr Gilauri continues to be BGEO’s sole Executive Director. Mr Gilauri entered into a new three-year service agreement with JSC Bank of Georgia  
(the “Bank”) on 24 August 2015, which became effective on 1 May 2016, consistent with the terms of the 2014 Policy. In connection with the Board 
adopting the new Policy, Mr Gilauri agreed to amend this service agreement to extend the reflected vesting period for discretionary shares to three years 
after award, which he has also voluntarily agreed to apply to the 2016 work year and which is reflected in an amendment to his service agreement.
As to remuneration of our Non-Executive Directors, our Policy moderately increased the fees (solely cash) payable commensurate with the increased 
volume of work and time commitment required in respect of the growing business, now diversified in various sectors. Fees for Non-Executive Directors 
had remained static since listing in 2012 while the business had tripled in size and expanded into different industries through our Investment Business.
The Policy took effect from the date of the 2017 AGM and is intended to apply until the earlier of Mr Gilauri entering into a new service agreement 
with any principal subsidiary of BGEO, the terms of which differ from the Policy, or the 2020 AGM, at which time we will seek shareholder approval. 
Please also refer to the 2016 Annual Report for the full text of the approved Directors’ Remuneration Policy, which is also available on our website, 
http://bgeo.com/annualreports.

SALARY IN THE FORM OF CASH AND LONG-TERM DEFERRED SHARES
PURPOSE AND  
LINK TO STRATEGY
OPERATION OPPORTUNITY
• To reflect the role and required 
duties, skills, experience and 
individual contribution to the 
Group.
• To recruit and retain talent.
• To promote long-term value 
creation and share price 
growth.
• To encourage long-term 
commitment to the Group.
• To closely align the Executive 
Director and shareholders’ 
interests.
• The level of base salary for an Executive Director is  
fixed in his or her service agreement. The level of salary  
is reviewed by the Remuneration Committee when a 
service agreement is up for renewal.
• Salary is comprised principally of long-term deferred 
shares (deferred share salary), complemented by a 
modest cash sum, which when combined with the 
remainder of the components of the remuneration 
package, is competitive enough to attract, retain and 
develop high-calibre talent who buy into a remuneration 
structure that supports reward over the long term.
• Deferred share salary is awarded in the form of nil-cost 
options awarded at the beginning of the year following 
the calendar year when the Executive worked to earn 
such salary (the “work year”).
• Deferred share salary in respect of a work year will vest 
as follows: 20% in each of the second, third and fourth 
years following the work year, and 40% in the fifth year 
following the work year. At vesting (upon exercise of  
the nil-cost options), the Executive Director receives  
(in addition to the vested shares) cash payments equal  
to the dividends paid on the underlying shares between 
the date the award was made and the vesting date.
• No malus or clawback provisions apply to base salary, 
because “natural” malus and clawback are built into the 
structure as described in the Notes to the Policy table. 
• There is no set maximum monetary  
value for the salary of Executive Directors. 
However, the maximum level of salary  
set for an Executive Director will be no 
more than the Remuneration Committee 
considers reasonable based on his or her 
duties, skills and experience, provided that 
his or her salary will not exceed the salary 
currently awarded to Executives at the 
equivalent level of seniority.

PERFORMANCE-BASED REMUNERATION – DISCRETIONARY DEFERRED SHARES
PURPOSE AND  
LINK TO STRATEGY
OPERATION OPPORTUNITY
• To motivate and reward an 
Executive Director that meets 
or exceeds the KPIs set for him 
or her.
• Performance-based 
remuneration solely in the form 
of deferred shares (no cash):
 – Closely aligns the interests 
of an Executive Director with 
shareholders
 – Minimises risk taking for 
short-term gain
 – Encourages long-term 
commitment to the Group.
• Performance-based remuneration is awarded entirely  
in the form of nil-cost options over BGEO shares which 
are deferred (no cash bonus).
• Deferred shares in respect of a work year vest 33.33%  
in each of the second, third and fourth years following 
the work year. At vesting (upon exercise of the nil-cost 
options), the Executive Director receives (in addition to 
the vested shares) cash payments equal to the dividends 
paid on the underlying shares between the date the 
award was made and the vesting date.
• KPIs for the Executive Director are set at the start of each 
work year and reflect the Executive Director’s targeted 
contribution to the Group’s overall key strategic and 
financial objectives for the work year. KPIs may also 
include non-tangible factors such as self-development, 
mentoring and social responsibility.
• Early in the year following the work year, the 
Remuneration Committee will determine whether an 
award is merited based on the Executive Director’s 
achievement of the KPIs set for the work year and the 
performance of the Group during the work year. In 
appropriate cases where a strategic change or change  
in business circumstances has made one or more KPI  
an inaccurate gauge of performance, the Remuneration 
Committee may base its assessment on alternative 
measures. The outcome of the Executive Director’s 
performance and the Committee’s determination will  
be reported in the Directors’ Remuneration Report  
for the work year in consideration.
• There is no contractual right to discretionary remuneration 
and the Remuneration Committee reserves the right to 
award no discretionary deferred share remuneration if the 
Group’s performance is unsatisfactory.
• Malus applies under the circumstances as set out in the 
Notes to this Policy table.
• For an Executive Director (other than 
Mr Gilauri), maximum opportunity in 
respect of the previous work year is 
125% of total salary.
• For Mr Gilauri, maximum opportunity  
in respect of the previous work year is 
fixed at 75% of total salary.
• However, for an Executive Director (other 
than Mr Gilauri) whose performance has 
resulted in outstanding benefits for 
shareholders, the Remuneration 
Committee has reserved the right to 
increase the maximum opportunity in 
respect of the previous work year to 
150% of total salary.
PENSION 
PURPOSE AND  
LINK TO STRATEGY
OPERATION OPPORTUNITY
The provision of a retirement 
benefit helps to attract and  
retain high-calibre talent.
Pension contributions not exceeding a percentage of the 
Executive Director’s gross monthly cash salary are payable 
into a defined contribution scheme.
Additional contributions of the Executive 
Director will be matched in a proportion of 
1.2 to 1, but only up to a maximum of 1%  
of gross monthly salary where the Executive 
Director makes additional contributions of up 
to 5% of gross monthly salary.
BENEFITS 
PURPOSE AND  
LINK TO STRATEGY
OPERATION OPPORTUNITY
Non-cash benefits are in line with 
Georgian market practice and are 
designed to be sufficient to attract 
and retain high-calibre talent.
Benefits consist of: life insurance; health insurance; 
incapacity/disability insurance; directors’ and officers’  
liability insurance; physical examinations; tax gross-ups; 
company car and driver; mobile phone (including agreement 
charges and costs of calls made during business trips 
abroad); personal security arrangements (if requested by  
the Executive Director); and assistance with completing  
tax returns (where required).
A tax equalisation payment may be paid to an Executive 
Director if any part of his or her remuneration becomes 
subject to double taxation.
The Remuneration Committee determines the 
maximum amount payable. The maximum 
amount payable depends on the cost of 
providing such benefits to an employee in  
the location at which the Executive Director  
is based. Shareholders should note that  
the cost of providing comparable benefits  
in different jurisdictions may vary widely. 
Disclosure of amounts paid will be provided 
in the implementation report and will be 
explained where the cost of benefits is 
significant.

NOTES TO THE 2017 POLICY – EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
(1) Salary
Deferred share salary is the most important element of the Executive Director’s fixed annual remuneration and is commensurate with his or her role 
within the Group. By heavily weighting salary to deferred share remuneration that vests over five years rather than cash, the Executive Director’s 
day-to-day actions are geared towards achievement of the Group’s strategic goals and sustained Group performance over the long term. The deferred 
share salary component is neither a bonus nor an LTIP: it is salary fixed at the outset of each three-year service agreement and is therefore not subject 
to performance targets or measures. That salary (40% of which vests a full five years after the work year) increases or declines in value depending on 
Group performance over the five-year vesting period, aligning the Executive Director’s interests directly and naturally with those of shareholders.
Specific malus and clawback are not applied to salary. Natural clawback and malus are built in to the structure, given that shares are deferred over  
a long period and are subject to a number of vesting conditions which, if breached, would result in the Executive Director’s salary shares fully lapsing, 
unless the Board otherwise agrees. An Executive Director’s service agreement may be terminated for “cause”, a definition which is broadly defined 
and extends beyond standard malus and clawback triggers to include, for example, gross and wilful misconduct having a material adverse effect  
on the Group, fraud, material repeated failure to perform duties, breach of obligations or conviction of a felony. An Executive Director’s unvested 
shares may also lapse if they terminate their service agreement early (in the absence of repeated material wrong-doing by the company). By way of 
example, an Executive Director terminated by the Board for “cause” in 2018 would normally give up (because their shares would fail to vest): their 
entire deferred share salary for 2018 and 2017 and 80%, 60% and 40% of their deferred share salary for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. As a 
result, an Executive Director is motivated to perform to the best of their ability and to act in the long-term interest of – and remain with – the Group  
to ensure that salary shares vest.
(2) Performance-based remuneration
The Group does not operate an LTIP because it believes there is sufficient long-term incentive built into its deferred share salary and discretionary 
deferred share remuneration. No cash bonuses are paid to Executive Directors. Instead, individual and Group performance are rewarded through an 
award of discretionary deferred share remuneration that vests over three years beginning in the second year following the work year. As discretionary 
deferred share remuneration is awarded to reward past performance over the work year, it is not subject to any performance measures over the 
period from award to vesting.
After the end of each work year, the Remuneration Committee will determine the aggregate number of shares (based on the share price at the time 
of the award), if any, available to award in respect of discretionary deferred share remuneration for all members of executive management, including 
Executive Directors, in relation to the defined maximum opportunity and based on the Group’s performance and the individual’s KPIs.
The Remuneration Committee does not utilise strict weighting of performance measures to ensure that flexibility is encouraged if, for example, 
strategic objectives evolve as the Group does or business circumstances change during the year. The Remuneration Committee believes that this 
flexibility ensures that the Board can work with an Executive Director so that they do not take excessive risk to achieve KPIs when, for example, 
markets have turned. Even in a “good” year for an Executive Director (e.g. achievement of most KPIs), if this coincides with a “bad” year for the 
Group (e.g. poor financial performance), the Remuneration Committee has the discretion to award little or no discretionary remuneration to the 
Executive Director.
If at any time after awarding discretionary deferred share remuneration, it has been determined that there was a material misstatement in the financial 
results for the work year in respect of which the award was formally granted, the Board has the right to cause some or all of the Executive’s unvested 
discretionary deferred shares at the time of its determination, not to vest and to lapse. Similar to deferred share salary, natural clawback and malus 
this measure. Discretionary deferred shares are also subject to vesting conditions which, if breached, would result in the Executive Director’s salary 
shares fully lapsing, unless the Board otherwise agrees.
(3) Discretion
The Committee retains certain discretion in relation to discretionary share remuneration. This includes:
• The determination of the award, if any;
• Selection of KPIs, which may vary from year to year in order to align with strategy and financial objectives; and
• Any adjustments required to an Executive Director’s KPIs during the work year when, for example, there has been a change in strategy or 
business circumstances which results in one or more of the KPIs becoming an inaccurate gauge of performance.
EQUITY COMPENSATION TRUST AND DILUTION LIMITS
An equity compensation trust (“Trust”), was established for the purposes of satisfying deferred share remuneration awarded to Executive Directors 
and members of executive management. In 2017, the Group provided additional funding of US$ 30,543,886 to enable Sanne Fiduciary Services 
Limited (“Sanne”), acting as trustee of the Trust, to purchase shares in the market to satisfy awards in respect of the 2016 and 2017 work years.  
In 2017 a total of 784,084 shares were purchased in the market for the Trust. We intend for Sanne to continue purchasing additional shares in the 
market, but may need to issue new shares, in order to ensure that there are a sufficient number of shares committed to the Trust in order to satisfy 
awards. The Group continues to commit to shareholders that new shares issued in satisfaction of deferred share remuneration from the time of the 
Company’s listing on the premium segment of the LSE will not exceed 10% of BGEO’s ordinary share capital over any ten-year period.
LEGACY ARRANGEMENTS
It is a provision of this Policy that the Group will honour all pre-existing obligations and commitments that were entered into prior to this Policy taking 
effect. The terms of those pre-existing obligations and commitments may differ from the terms of the Policy and may include (without limitation) 
obligations and commitments under service agreements, deferred share remuneration schemes and pension and benefit plans.
CONSIDERATION OF SHAREHOLDER VIEWS
The Remuneration Committee considers shareholder feedback received on our remuneration structure each year as well as guidance from shareholder 
representative bodies, as we view shareholder input as key when shaping remuneration policy. In 2014, 2015 and 2016 we met with a number of our 
significant shareholders to discuss our remuneration structure and engaged directly with several shareholder advisory groups. The feedback we received 
was positive and our shareholders were widely supportive of our executive remuneration structure, understanding that although it varies from a typical 
UK remuneration structure in that we do not operate an LTIP or give cash bonuses, the absence of cash bonuses and the dominance of deferred share 
remuneration in the overall remuneration package create a direct and natural alignment of shareholder and executive management interests. 108 Annual Report 2017 BGEO Group PLC
CONSIDERATION OF EMPLOYMENT CONDITIONS ELSEWHERE IN THE GROUP
When determining an Executive Director’s remuneration, the Remuneration Committee considers: (i) the pay and employment conditions of executive 
management (other than Directors); (ii) any changes in pay and employment conditions across the Group as a whole; (iii) whether employees across 
the Group are personally satisfied with the way they are remunerated; and (iv) any feedback received during the year from the Human Resources 
department, executive management and other employees on the executive remuneration structure.
We frequently benchmark remuneration at all levels within the Group in order to ensure that our remuneration is competitive, so as to attract the right 
candidates and remain competitive in order to motivate, satisfy and retain our talent.
The remuneration of employees in the Group, other than Executive Directors and executive management, is benchmarked against the Georgian 
labour market as this is the most relevant comparator. Each year, the Bank participates in the largest salary survey in Georgia. Survey results are 
used to offer competitive remuneration packages when recruiting as well as benchmark the salaries of the Group’s employees on an annual basis in 
order for the Group to upwardly adjust the remuneration of current employees and remain competitive. Our employees’ remuneration packages are 
comprised of cash salary, bonus opportunity, benefits as well as the opportunity to participate in the pension scheme on the same terms as 
applicable to Mr Gilauri and executive management.
For a FTSE 250 company of our size and depth, our Executive Directors and executive management must have the skills, experience, work ethic 
and attitude required to successfully execute our strategy, meet our objectives and create value for shareholders over the long term. In order to 
recruit and retain this talent, we must benchmark the value of remuneration against other FTSE companies of similar size and sector in the UK. 
Our executives are not paid cash bonuses and therefore remuneration in the form of deferred shares will comprise nearly all of total remuneration.
As it is not possible for a direct comparison to be made between executive remuneration and remuneration of other employees in the Group, the 
most important consideration for us is whether other employees are satisfied with their remuneration packages. In 2015, 2016 and 2017 employee 
surveys were conducted by the Human Resources department, targeting a large number of employees of varying skill, seniority, department, among 
other factors. The results confirmed that employees consulted were satisfied with the manner in which they were compensated. Our retention rate of 
employees is high and in 2017 the survey also confirmed that we remain a competitive employer.
COMPARISON WITH REMUNERATION POLICY FOR EMPLOYEES GENERALLY
As mentioned above, the components of the remuneration package for Executive Directors (as provided for by the Policy) are broadly the same as 
those for non-Board members of the executive management team. Members of senior management below the executive management level and 
middle management receive their entire salary in cash and do not receive a deferred share salary. Their bonuses may be either in the form of cash 
and/or shares which vest over a three-year period following the award. All other employees within the Group receive a cash salary and may be 
eligible to receive cash bonuses, portions of which may be deferred until the publication of the audited annual results for the work year and/or based 
on continuous employment with the Group. The deferred portion of the cash bonus may also be reduced if it is revealed, upon completion of  
the annual audit, that the annual results published by the department where the employee works were incorrect in any material respect. Natural 
clawback, including normal lapse of shares upon termination for “cause” also applies. All employees receive a competitive benefit package in line 
with Georgian market practice and are entitled to participate in the pension scheme on the same terms as applicable to Executive Directors.
TOTAL REMUNERATION OPPORTUNITY FOR OUR SOLE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR
The chart below shows the remuneration which Mr Gilauri, our sole Executive Director, could receive in respect of 2018 under the Policy at three 
different performance levels. It should be noted that, at the maximum level, 91% of Mr Gilauri’s 2018 remuneration will be in the form of deferred 
shares for which the average vesting period exceeds four years. At the minimum level, 84% of Mr Gilauri’s 2018 remuneration will be in the form  
of deferred shares. A full explanation of the demerger and any changes to the total remuneration of the sole executive director will be provided in  
the circular to be announced shortly after the release of this report.

Notes:
1. Salary is comprised of cash and deferred share salary. Mr Gilauri’s total cash salary in 2018 in respect of his service agreements with the Group will be US$ 437,450. The value of the deferred 
share salary payable is US$ 2,288,700, calculated by reference to the share price as at the date Mr Gilauri’s most recent service agreement with the Group was signed on 24 August 2015, being 
US$ 25.43 per share (the official share price of GBP 16.16 per share converted into Dollars using an exchange rate of 1.5738, being the official exchange rate published by the Bank of England 
on the same date). The price is the value at which the shares were committed to the Trust and underlies the determination of remuneration expense in the Group’s accounts. Deferred share 
salary in respect of 2018 will be formally granted in 2019 and will vest in January 2020, 2021, 2022 and 2023. For the purposes of this graph, we have added the value of pension and benefits 
(only about 0.1% of total salary) to cash salary. The value used is the same as 2017 as we assume pension and benefits in 2018 will be substantially the same.
2. The means of determining the number of shares underlying the discretionary deferred share remuneration and terms and conditions applicable to this remuneration are described in the Policy 
table. Discretionary deferred shares in respect of 2018 will be formally granted in 2019 and will vest in January 2020, 2021 and 2022.
3. Minimum opportunity reflects a scenario whereby Mr Gilauri receives only fixed remuneration which is salary (cash and deferred shares), pension contributions and benefits and the Remuneration 
Committee considers that the Group’s and/or Mr Gilauri’s performance in 2017 does not warrant any award of discretionary deferred shares.
4. On-target opportunity reflects a scenario where Mr Gilauri receives fixed remuneration and discretionary deferred shares with a value of US$ 1,431,255, being 70% of the maximum opportunity 
(as described in 5 below). In this scenario, the Remuneration Committee considers that the Group’s and Mr Gilauri’s performance in 2018 are in line with the Group’s expectation, which is 
excellent performance.
5. Maximum opportunity reflects a scenario where Mr Gilauri receives fixed remuneration (as described in iii above) and discretionary deferred shares with a value of US$ 2,044,650, being 75% 
 of total salary. In this scenario, the Remuneration Committee considers that the Group’s and Mr Gilauril’s performance in 2018 warrant the highest possible level of discretionary deferred  
share remuneration.
6. The value of deferred shares does not take into account any increase or decrease in share price over the vesting period or any dividend equivalents payable on vesting (upon exercise of the 
nil-cost options).

NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION POLICY
Our 2017 Policy proposed the increase of Non-Executive Directors fees which had remained static since BGEO’s listing in February 2012. Since 
listing, the market capitalisation of BGEO has more than tripled and the Group’s business has expanded in both size and scope. Each Non-
Executive Director also serves as a member of the Supervisory Board of the Bank and since 2016, each has devoted an increasing amount of time 
to the Investment Business arm through JSC BGEO Group. The Policy reflects a moderate increase in fees to reflect the volume of work and time 
commitment required for the complexity of our Group. The Policy will apply in each year that the Policy operates from the date of approval of the 
Policy. In the second half of 2017 a top-up payment was made to Non-Executive Directors to increase the level of fees to those in the 2017 Policy.
PURPOSE AND  
LINK TO STRATEGY
OPERATION OPPORTUNITY
• To attract and retain high 
performing Non-Executive 
Directors with the requisite 
skills, knowledge, experience, 
independence and other 
attributes to add value to  
the Group.
• To reflect the time commitment 
dedicated by Non-Executive 
Directors.
• All fees are paid in cash.
• Fees will be reviewed the year we propose a new  
Policy to shareholders, taking into account the time 
commitment, responsibilities and the technical skills 
required to make a valuable contribution to the Board, 
and by reference to comparators, benchmarking, results 
of the annual review and other guidance.
• Additional fees are payable to compensate for the skill 
provided and time spent discharging JSC BGEO Group, 
Bank Supervisory Board and Committee duties.
• There is no remuneration in the form of deferred share 
salary or discretionary deferred share remuneration, 
pensions, benefits or any variable or performance-linked 
remuneration or incentives.
• Non-Executive Directors are reimbursed for reasonable 
business expenses, including travel and accommodation, 
which are incurred in the course of carrying out duties 
under their Letters of Appointment, on provision of valid 
receipts. The maximum amount payable depends on the 
cost of providing such expenses in the location at which 
the Non-Executive Director is based. Shareholders 
should note that the cost of providing comparable 
expenses in different jurisdictions may vary widely.
• Aggregate (BGEO and subsidiaries)  
base fees for Non-Executive Directors 
(excluding the Chairman and Senior 
Independent Director) are US$ 109,500.
• The Chairman and Senior Independent 
Director receive higher base fees which 
reflect increased responsibilities and time 
commitment. The Chairman will receive 
an aggregate flat fee of US$ 313,900  
and our Senior Independent Director  
will receive an aggregate base fee of  
US$ 146,000.
• Committee fees range from US$ 6,570  
to US$ 17,520.
POLICY ON THE APPOINTMENT OF EXTERNAL HIRES AND INTERNAL APPOINTMENTS
The Policy provides for a new Executive Director’s remuneration package to be comprised of the elements set out below.
ELEMENT POLICY AND OPERATION
Overall • The Committee intends that the components of remuneration set out in the above Policy tables, and the approach to those 
components as set out in the Policy tables, will (subject to the remainder of this recruitment policy) be equally applicable  
to the annual package provided to new recruits. Any new Executive Director would be paid no more than the Committee 
considers reasonably necessary to attract a candidate with the relevant skills and experience, taking into account (where 
appropriate) either the annual total monetary value or the total number of shares awarded to executives at an equivalent 
level of seniority.
• Relocation benefits and buy-out awards may also be required to recruit the right candidate, subject to the conditions and 
restrictions outlined below.
• For internal promotions, any commitments made prior to the appointment may continue to be honoured as the executive is 
transitioned to new remuneration arrangements. Any pay element awarded in respect of the prior role may either continue on its 
original terms or be adjusted to reflect the new appointment, as appropriate, within the parameters set out in the Policy tables.
• The rationale for the compensation package offered will be explained in the Annual Report on Remuneration published 
after commencement of the appointment.
Base salary • In accordance with the Policy and the Overall summary above.
Discretionary 
deferred shares
• In accordance with the Policy and the Overall summary above.
• Malus and/or clawback would operate in respect of discretionary share remuneration.
Pension • Pension provision would be in line with normal policy and the Overall summary above.
Benefits • In accordance with the Policy and the Overall summary above.
• Relocation support for an incoming Executive Director and, where relevant, his or her family may be provided depending 
on the individual’s circumstances. BGEO has not set a maximum aggregate amount that may be paid in respect of any 
individual’s relocation support, but it will aim to provide support of an appropriate level and quality on the best terms that 
can reasonably be obtained.
• The Group may make a contribution towards legal fees in connection with agreeing employment terms. The Group may 
also agree to pay certain expenses and taxes should an Executive Director be asked to relocate to a different country, 
such that they pay no more than would have been required in the home location.
Buy-out awards • In addition to other elements of remuneration described above, buy-out awards may be made to reflect value forfeited 
through an individual leaving their current employer.
• If a buy-out award is required, the Committee would aim to reflect the nature, timing and value of awards forgone in any 
replacement awards.
• Awards will only take the form of deferred shares. The value of these deferred shares would be capped to be no higher, 
on recruitment, than the awards which the individual had to surrender in order to be recruited and the vesting period  
of such deferred shares would be a similar timeframe to the awards being bought out. The application of performance 
conditions and/or clawback provisions may also be considered, where appropriate. 110 Annual Report 2017 BGEO Group PLC
SERVICE AGREEMENTS AND POLICY ON PAYMENTS FOR LOSS OF OFFICE FOR OUR DIRECTORS
The following paragraphs (1) to (2) summarise the termination and payments for loss of office provisions pursuant to Mr Gilauri’s service agreements 
with BGEO and the Bank. In 2017, and as of the date of this Annual Report, Mr Gilauri remained the sole Executive Director on the BGEO Board.
The termination provisions of Non-Executive Director Letters of Appointment is described in paragraph (3) and our approach to termination and 
payments for loss of office for future Executive Directors is described in paragraph (4). The Directors’ service agreements and Letters of Appointment 
are kept for inspection by shareholders at BGEO’s registered office.
(1) BGEO service agreement dated 15 December 2011
Mr Gilauri’s service agreement with BGEO is for an indefinite term (subject to annual re-election at the AGM) and is terminable by either party on four 
months’ written notice. Where the service agreement is terminated on notice, BGEO may put Mr Gilauri on garden leave for some or all of the notice 
period and continue to pay his cash salary under the BGEO service agreement, provided that any accrued and unused holiday entitlement shall be 
deemed to be taken during the garden leave period.
BGEO may terminate Mr Gilauri’s employment early with immediate effect and without notice and pay in lieu of notice in the case of, among other 
circumstances, his dishonesty, gross misconduct, conviction of an offence (other than traffic-related) or becoming of unsound mind. BGEO may also 
terminate the agreement with immediate effect by payment in lieu of notice, in which case the payment in lieu of notice shall be solely in respect of 
cash salary due under the BGEO service agreement as at the date of termination of employment.
(2) Bank service agreement dated 24 August 2015
Mr Gilauri’s service agreement with the Bank is for an initial term of three years expiring on 1 May 2019 and was amended on 16 March 2017 
to extend the vesting period of discretionary deferred shares to three years, which is applicable in respect of the 2016 work year onwards.
The service agreement may be renewed by agreement between the parties or terminated prior to the expiry of the term by either Mr Gilauri or the 
Bank. The Bank may terminate the service agreement immediately without notice (subject to the terms set out below), whereas Mr Gilauri may 
terminate the agreement upon three months’ written notice or such shorter period as is agreed with the Supervisory Board of the Bank and CEO  
of the Bank.
SEPARATION PAYMENTS
(i) Mr Gilauri will be entitled to only: accrued and unpaid cash salary; holiday pay; reimbursement of business expenses; accrued but not yet paid 
dividend equivalents; and benefits upon termination of the service agreement in the following circumstances:
• By the Bank for “cause” (cause being defined as gross and wilful misconduct in the course of his duties having a material adverse effect on the 
Group, fraud, material repeated failure to perform his duties or breach of his obligations or conviction of a felony, among other circumstances); 
• By reason of death or disability (in which case he receives life or disability insurance benefits); or
• By Mr Gilauri other than for “good reason”.
See the discussion below for the treatment of unvested share awards in the above circumstances.
“Good reason” is defined as an uncorrected material breach of a material provision of the service agreement by the Bank which is not cured within 
45 days upon Mr Gilauri serving notice of breach, or material and unremedied illegal or unethical behaviour by Bank employees which has been 
notified to the Board by Mr Gilauri and the Board failing to react and cooperate with Mr Gilauri in addressing the behaviour.
(ii) Mr Gilauri will be entitled to: a separation payment of 12 months’ cash salary; accrued and unpaid cash salary; holiday pay; and reimbursement  
of business expenses upon termination of the service agreement in the following circumstances:
• By Mr Gilauri for “good reason”;
• By the Bank for any other reason excluding: (a) voluntary termination by Mr Gilauri; (b) termination for cause; or (c) death or permanent disability 
(fully covered by insurance); or
• If the service agreement is not renewed on substantially similar terms on expiry.
If the service agreement is terminated for any of the reasons set out directly above, the Bank may assign Mr Gilauri garden leave for a period of up to 
four months following the termination of his employment during which time the Bank will compensate him only in the form of his regular cash salary 
with all other benefits, bonuses, incentives or reimbursements excluded. Mr Gilauri will be required to adhere to non-compete and non-solicitation 
restrictions for a period of six months following termination. In addition, the Bank may impose a two-year non-compete period, subject to a materiality 
threshold, in exchange for accelerated vesting of his deferred share remuneration (as described below).
DEFERRED SHARE REMUNERATION ON TERMINATION
Mr Gilauri will be entitled to an award of his deferred share salary in respect of any incomplete calendar year which he has worked. He may also be 
awarded discretionary deferred share remuneration if:
• His service agreement expires and is not renewed upon substantially similar terms;
• He does not accept a new service agreement, but continues as a member of the BGEO Board and/or becomes a member of the JSC BGEO 
Group Board, as the case may be; or
• His service agreement is terminated before its expiry date but he continues as a member of the BGEO Board and/or becomes a member of the 
JSC BGEO Group Board, as the case may be.
Mr Gilauri will not be entitled to any deferred share salary for calendar years covered by the agreement period during which he has not worked.

Unvested deferred share remuneration granted in respect of the 2015 work year and all prior work years will vest upon termination of the service 
agreement, save for in the following circumstances:
• If Mr Gilauri’s service agreement is terminated for cause, unless otherwise agreed with the Board, his unvested deferred share remuneration  
will lapse.
• If Mr Gilauri terminates his service agreement for any reason other than good reason, unless otherwise agreed with the Board in favour of 
Mr Gilauri, 50% of his unvested deferred share remuneration will vest immediately and the remaining 50% will, at his discretion, either continue to 
vest as normal or he may acquire some or all of his unvested deferred share remuneration at the price per share recorded in the IFRS accounts 
on the respective grant dates plus a 10% annual increase from the respective grant date until the date of purchase (if any) by Mr Gilauri.
Unvested deferred share remuneration granted in respect of the 2016 work year and beyond
Any unvested deferred share remuneration will, unless otherwise agreed with the Board, lapse on the termination date if Mr Gilauri’s service 
agreement is terminated by:
• The Bank for cause; or
• Mr Gilauri for any reason other than for good reason.
Any unvested deferred share remuneration will vest immediately if:
• The Bank terminates the service agreement other than for cause;
• Mr Gilauri terminates the service agreement for good reason;
• The service agreement expires and neither is a renewed agreement on substantially similar terms offered nor does BGEO and/or JSC BGEO 
Group Board membership continue;
• Mr Gilauri ceases to be an Executive Director by reason of death, disability, injury, redundancy or retirement at normal retirement age; or
• There is a change of control of the Bank, BGEO or any intermediary holding company of the Bank (as appropriate)
If Mr Gilauri’s service agreement expires and he refuses to continue as a member of the BGEO and/or JSC BGEO Group Board, 50% of his unvested 
deferred share remuneration will vest immediately and the remaining 50% will, at his discretion, either continue to vest as normal or he may acquire 
some or all of the underlying shares of his unvested deferred share remuneration at the price per share recorded in the IFRS accounts on the respective 
grant dates plus a 10% annual increase from the respective grant date until the date of purchase (if any) by Mr Gilauri. In consideration for this vesting 
treatment, Mr Gilauri will be bound by a two-year non-compete period during which he may not be employed by, provide consultancy services to or 
otherwise found or be a partner or associate of a commercial bank in Georgia (save that he may hold less than 5% of shares of a publicly listed bank).
If Mr Gilauri’s service agreement expires and: (i) is not renewed upon substantially similar terms, or (ii) he does not accept a new service agreement, 
but he continues as a member of the BGEO and/or JSC BGEO Group Board, 50% of his unvested shares vest immediately and the remaining 50% 
shall continue to vest as normal. If he subsequently ceases to be a member of the Bank and/or BGEO Board, at Mr Gilauri’s discretion, unvested 
shares either continue to vest as normal or he may acquire some or all of the underlying shares for the specified price as described above.
MALUS
If at any time after awarding discretionary deferred share remuneration, it has been determined that there was a material misstatement in the financial 
results for the work year in respect of which the award was formally granted, the Board has the right to cause some or all of the Executive’s unvested 
discretionary deferred shares at the time of its determination, not to vest and to lapse.
(3) Termination of Non-Executive Directors’ appointments
The Letters of Appointment for Non-Executive Directors provide for a one-month notice period although BGEO may terminate the appointment with 
immediate effect without notice or pay in lieu of notice if the Non-Executive Director has committed any serious breach or non-observance of his or 
her obligations to BGEO, is guilty of fraud or dishonesty, brings BGEO or him/herself into disrepute or is disqualified as acting as a Non-Executive 
Director, among other circumstances. Upon termination, the only remuneration a Non-Executive Director is entitled to is accrued fees as at the date 
of termination together with reimbursement of properly incurred expenses incurred prior to the termination date. 
(4) Approach to termination and payments for loss of office for new Executive Directors
Any payment upon termination of a new Executive Director’s service agreement would not exceed 12 months’ cash salary under the relevant service 
agreement, plus any accrued and unpaid cash salary, benefits and holiday pay and reimbursement of any business expenses. The Group may 
assign the Executive Director garden leave for a period of up to four months following the termination of their employment during which they will be 
compensated only in the form of regular cash salary with all other benefits, bonuses, incentive or reimbursements excluded. The Executive Director 
may also be required to adhere to non-compete and non-solicitation restrictions for a period of six months following termination.
It is expected that the vesting provisions listed below will apply to deferred share remuneration in the case of termination of a new Executive 
Director’s service agreement.
• Unvested deferred share remuneration would lapse upon termination of the service agreement by BGEO or material subsidiary of BGEO for 
cause or if the Executive Director terminated their employment for any other reason than good reason.
• Unvested deferred share remuneration would continue to vest in the normal way during the respective vesting period(s) upon termination by 
BGEO or material subsidiary of BGEO without cause; if the Executive Director’s service agreement expired and they were not offered a new 
service agreement on substantially similar terms on expiration; or if the Executive Director ceased to be an Executive Director by reason of injury, 
disability, redundancy or retirement (at normal retirement age).
• Unvested deferred share remuneration would vest immediately upon death of the Executive Director; termination of the service agreement by the 
Executive Director for good reason; or a change of control.
Notwithstanding the above vesting terms for current and future Executive Directors, the Board reserves the right to permit unvested deferred share 
remuneration to vest irrespective of the Executive Director’s departure when such Executive Director departs on good terms with the Group.
Share ownership guidelines
The Company has not put in place share ownership guidelines due to the significant portion of the CEO’s remuneration being in deferred shares. 112 Annual Report 2017 BGEO Group PLC
IMPLEMENTATION OF REMUNERATION POLICY FOR 2018
Details of how the Policy will be implemented for the 2018 financial year are set out below. A full explanation of the demerger and any changes to the 
implementation of the Remuneration Policy will be provided in the circular to be announced shortly after the release of this report.
FOR IRAKLI GILAURI
FIXED PAY
Total cash salary (combined BGEO and Bank) US$ 437,500
Total deferred share salary (Bank) US$ 2,288,700
Pension and other benefits No change from the stated Policy; value is expected to be substantially 
similar to 2017. Please refer to demerger information as above.
There are circumstances in which unvested deferred shares may lapse, and narrow circumstances in which such shares may vest immediately are 
set out in the Policy.
2018 DISCRETIONARY DEFERRED SHARE REMUNERATION
Opportunity Maximum is 75% of total salary (total cash salary and total deferred share salary as listed in the table above).
Deferral terms Early in 2019, the Committee will determine whether an award is merited based on the Executive Director’s 
achievement of the KPIs set for the work year and the performance of the Group during the work year. If Mr Gilauri 
is awarded discretionary deferred shares, the award will vest 33.33% in each of 2020, 2021 and 2022.
At vesting (upon exercise of the nil-cost options), Mr Gilauri will receive (in addition to the vested shares) cash 
payments equal to the dividends paid (if any) on the underlying shares between the date the award was made and 
the vesting date.
Performance measures 
and targets
For 2018, the Committee has determined that the performance measures will be based on KPIs, subject to the 
terms of the Policy.
BANKING BUSINESS
• Return on Average equity as targeted
• Total banking business loan book growth as targeted
• NIM as targeted
• Cost/Income as targeted
• Dividend Payout Ratio – 25-40%
Longer Term Indicator 
• Product to client ratio in mass retail as targeted
• Bank’s visibility/importance as a private banking hub as targeted
• Cost of risk and NPL Coverage Ratio in line with strategy
INVESTMENT BUSINESS – 2018 INDICATOR
• Growth of NAV of portfolio companies in line with strategy
• Achieve strategic priorities of portfolio companies in line with strategy
• Active and disciplined pursuit of new investment opportunities
• Diversify funding base for portfolio companies 
Longer Term Indicator 
• Progress towards exit on investments in line with strategy
• Average return on combined exits in line with strategy
OTHER KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS
• Active mentoring and development of Senior Management
• Personal development
In the event of the demerger, it was expected that the Investment Business KPIs would remain with Irakli Gilauri 
and the Banking Business KPIs would transfer to the CEO of the Bank, but the Remuneration Committees of 
Bank of Georgia PLC and Georgia Capital would have the discretion to consider appropriate adjustments to  
the KPIs.

Information
Natural clawback and further malus are built in to the structure of Mr Gilauri’s remuneration above, given that both salary shares and discretionary 
shares are deferred and are subject to a number of vesting conditions which, if breached, would result in Mr Gilauri’s salary shares fully lapsing, 
unless the Board otherwise agrees. His service agreement may be terminated for “cause”, a definition which is broadly defined and extends beyond 
standard malus and clawback triggers to include, for example, gross and wilful misconduct having a material adverse effect on the Group, fraud, 
material repeated failure to perform his duties, breach of his obligations or conviction of a felony. His unvested shares may also lapse if he terminates 
his service agreement early (in the absence of repeated material wrong-doing by the Company). Further malus applies to discretionary deferred 
shares if it is determined that there was a material misstatement in the financial results. In this case, the Board has the right to cause some or all of 
the award for that financial year or for any subsequent financial year that is unvested at the time of its determination, not to vest and to lapse, as set 
out in the Policy.
NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR REMUNERATION
The table below shows the fee structure for Non-Executive Directors for 2018.
All fees to Non-Executive Directors are paid in cash and reflect work performed for BGEO, JSC BGEO Group, the Bank Supervisory Board 
and its subsidiaries.
Role 2018 fees
Chairman (aggregate all-inclusive fee) US$ 313,900
Senior Independent Director base fee (aggregate) US$ 146,000
Non-Executive Director (excluding Chairman and  
Senior Independent Director) base fee (aggregate)
US$ 109,500
Additional Committee fees Range from US$ 6,570 to US$ 17,520, depending on whether the 
Non-Executive serves as Chairman or Member of a Committee.
Notes:
1. The term aggregate refers to work in respect of BGEO, JSC BGEO Group and the Bank.
2. The allocation of base fees to BGEO does not and will not exceed the maximum amount of GBP 750,000 as set out in our Articles.

year. As required, we have prepared the accompanying consolidated and 
separate statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union and applicable law.
We must not approve the accompanying consolidated and stand alone

that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s and the Group’s 
transactions, to disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the Company and the Group, and to enable us to

Company’s website. Legislation in the UK governing the preparation  
and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in 
other jurisdictions.
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
• The consolidated and stand-alone financial statements, prepared in 
accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union, give a true 
and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or 
loss of the Company and the Group taken as a whole.

Report include a fair review of the development and performance  
of the business and the position of the Company and the Group,

needed to assess the Group’s position and performance, business model 
and strategy.

RESULTS AND DIVIDENDS
The Group Board expects to recommend a regular annual dividend  
for 2017 totalling c.GEL 120 million. This is in the range of our regular 
dividend payout ratio target of 25-40% paid from the Banking Business 
profits. Since 2010, the Group has grown its annual dividend per share by 
40% CAGR on a GEL basis, and by 32% CAGR on a USD basis. If the 
expected demerger is successfully implemented as planned, it is intended 
that Bank of Georgia PLC (the then new parent company of the Banking 
Business), will instead, shortly after the demerger is completed, declare 
and pay a dividend in a similar or the same aggregate amount to 
shareholders then on the record. In the event that the demerger is for any 
reason not completed it is intended, subject to shareholder approval, that 
the Board would implement the payment of this dividend, which would 
represent a payment of GEL 3.1 per share, payable in British Pounds 
Sterling at the prevailing rate, a 19.2% increase over the 2016 dividend.
As BGEO is a holding company, BGEO relies primarily on dividends and 
other statutorily (if any) and contractually permissible payments from its 
subsidiaries to generate the funds necessary to meet its obligations and 
pay dividend to its shareholders. 
ARTICLES OF ASSOCIATION
BGEO’s Articles of Association may be amended by a special resolution 
at a general meeting of shareholders. The process for the appointment 
and removal of Directors is included in our Articles of Association.  
The BGEO Articles of Association are available on BGEO’s website: 
http://bgeo.com/uploads/pages/bgeo-group-plc-articles-of-
association-91.pdf.
SHARE CAPITAL AND RIGHTS ATTACHING TO THE SHARES
Details of the movements in share capital during the year are provided  
in Note 21 to the consolidated financial statements on page 189. As at 
the date of this Annual Report, there was a single class of 39,384,712 
ordinary shares of one pence each in issue, each with one vote. The 
rights and obligations attaching to BGEO’s ordinary shares are set out  
in its Articles of Association. Holders of ordinary shares are entitled, 
subject to any applicable law and BGEO’s Articles of Association, to:
• have shareholder documents made available to them including the 
notice of any general meeting;
• attend, speak and exercise voting rights at general meetings, either  
in person or by proxy; and
• participate in any distribution of income or capital.
At the 2017 AGM, the Directors were given a) the power to allot shares 
up to a maximum nominal amount of GBP 131,564.40 representing 
approximately a third of the Company’s issued share capital as at 
31 March 2017, in addition to b) the power to allot equity securities up  
to an aggregate nominal amount of GBP 131,564.40, in connection with 
an offer by way of a rights issue: (i) to holders of shares in proportion (as 
nearly as may be practicable) to their existing holdings; and (ii) to holders 
of other equity securities as required by the rights of those securities or,  
if the Directors consider it necessary, as permitted by the rights of those 
securities, such amount to be reduced by the aggregate nominal amount 
of shares allotted or rights to subscribe for or to convert any securities 
into shares granted under paragraph (a), and subject to the Directors 
having the right to make such exclusions or other arrangements as  
they may deem necessary or expedient in relation to treasury shares, 
fractional entitlements, record dates or legal, regulatory or practical 
problems in, or under the laws of, any territory. These authorities will 
expire at the conclusion of the 2018 AGM (or, if earlier, at the close of 
business on 1 September 2018) and approval will be sought at that 
meeting to renew a similar authority for a further year.
In addition, at the 2017 AGM, shareholders authorised the Board to allot 
shares up to a maximum nominal amount of GBP 19,734.66 for cash 
without first offering them to existing shareholders in proportion to their 
existing holdings in connection with a rights issue or otherwise up to a 
maximum nominal amount of GBP 19,734.66.
None of the ordinary shares carry any special rights with regard to 
control of BGEO.
The Company’s Articles of Association provide that, unless the Directors 
determine otherwise, a shareholder shall not be entitled to vote, either 
personally or by proxy, at any general meeting or to exercise any other 
right conferred by membership if:
• any call or other sum payable to the Company in respect of that 
share remains unpaid; or
• such shareholder, having been duly served with a notice to provide the 
Company with information under section 793 of the UK Companies 
Act, has failed to do so within 14 days of such notice, for so long as 
the default continues.
There are no other restrictions on transfers of shares other than certain 
restrictions which may from time to time be imposed by laws or regulations.
BGEO SHARE BUYBACK AND CANCELLATION PROGRAMME
Authority to make market purchases of up to 3,946,932 (approximately 
10%) of BGEO’s shares up to a maximum consideration of US$50 million 
over a two-year period was granted to the Directors at the 2017  
AGM (the Buyback). This authority will expire at the conclusion of  
the Company’s AGM in 2018 or, if earlier, at the close of business  
on 1 September 2018. Authority to make market purchases of up to 
3,950,032 (approximately 10%) of BGEO’s shares had previously been 
granted to the Directors at the 2016 AGM, which expired at the 2017 
AGM. The Company entered into an agreement with Numis Securities 
Limited (Numis) on 7 March 2017 to enable Numis to purchase Shares 
over a two-year period in accordance with the terms of the general 
authority granted to the Company by shareholders at the 2017 AGM and 
subject to its shareholders’ approval of a similar buyback resolution at 
the 2018 AGM in respect of any purchases to be made after the date of 
that meeting. Any shares repurchased have been or will be immediately 
cancelled. Any purchase of shares pursuant to the agreement with 
Numis have been or will be carried out on the London Stock Exchange.  116 Annual Report 2017 BGEO Group PLC
The Buyback is a result of the Group’s very strong capital position, 
excess levels of liquidity and high level of internal capital generation. 
Furthermore, the Board believes the Buyback is likely to promote the 
success of the Company, is for the benefit of the shareholders as a 
whole and will result in an increase in the EPS.
During 2017, US$ 5.0 million was returned to shareholders by way of the 
buyback and cancellation of 115,608 shares representing 0.29% of the 
issued share capital as at the date of this Annual Report.
EQUITY SETTLED OPTION PLAN (‘ESOP’) FUNDING
The Company operates an employee benefit trust (EBT) (the “ESOP”), 
which holds ordinary shares on trust for the benefit of employees and 
former employees of the Group, and their dependents, and which is 
used in conjunction with the Group’s employee share schemes. Whilst 
ordinary shares are held in the EBT, the voting rights in respect of these 
ordinary shares are exercised by the trustees of the EBT.
In 2017 the Group provided additional funding to enable Sanne Fiduciary 
Services Limited, acting as trustee of the Trust, to purchase more shares 
in the market to satisfy upcoming employee share scheme awards. 
During the year, Sanne Fiduciary Services Limited, acting as trustee to the 
ESOP , purchased 784,084 shares in the market for a total consideration 
of US$ 34.1 million.
In accordance with a request issued by BGEO, Sanne Fiduciary Services 
Limited has waived its right to receive any dividends. This waiver will 
remain in place indefinitely, unless otherwise instructed by BGEO.
The Group previously committed that new shares issued in satisfaction 
of deferred share compensation from the time of the Company’s listing 
on the premium segment of the LSE will not exceed 10% of BGEO’s 
ordinary share capital over any ten-year period.
PROPOSED DEMERGER
A summary of the proposed demerger can be found on page 19 in the 
Strategic Report.
POWERS OF DIRECTORS
The Directors may exercise all powers of BGEO subject to applicable 
legislation and regulation and BGEO’s Articles of Association.
CONFLICTS OF INTEREST
In accordance with the Companies Act 2006, the Directors have adopted 
a policy and procedure for the disclosure and authorisation (if appropriate) 
of conflicts of interest, and these have been followed during 2017. BGEO’s 
Articles of Association also contain provisions to allow the Directors to 
authorise potential conflicts of interest so that a Director is not in breach  
of his or her duty under company law.
DIRECTORS’ INTERESTS
The Directors’ beneficial interests in ordinary shares of BGEO as at 
31 December 2017 are shown on page 102, together with any changes 
in those interests between the financial year-end and the date on which 
this Directors’ Report was approved by the Board.
INDEMNITY
Subject to applicable legislation, every current and former Director or 
other officer of BGEO (other than any person engaged by the Company 
as auditor) shall be indemnified by BGEO against any liability in relation  
to BGEO, other than (broadly) any liability to BGEO or a member of the 
Group, or any criminal or regulatory fine. Accordingly, the Company has 
provided for both indemnities and directors’ and officers’ insurance to 
the Directors in connection with their duties and responsibilities.
RELATED PARTY DISCLOSURES
Details of related party disclosures are set out in Note 34 to the 
consolidated financial statements on page 210.
SIGNIFICANT AGREEMENTS 
On 23 October 2015, BGEO entered into a Relationship Agreement with 
GHG and JSC BGEO Investments which regulates the degree of control 
that BGEO and its associates may exercise over the management and 
business of GHG. The principal purpose of the Relationship Agreement 
is to ensure that GHG and its subsidiaries are capable at all times of 
carrying on their business independently of BGEO and its associates. 
The Relationship Agreement took effect on 12 November 2015 and will 
continue until the earlier of: (i) GHG shares ceasing to be admitted to 
listing on the Official List; and (ii) BGEO, together with its associates, 
ceasing to own or control (directly or indirectly) 20% or more of the 
voting share capital of GHG. If BGEO ceases to be a controlling 
shareholder (as defined in the Listing Rules), it may terminate the 
Relationship Agreement by giving one month’s written notice to GHG.
Under the Relationship Agreement, for so long as BGEO and its 
associates together hold 20% or more of the voting share capital  
of GHG, BGEO and its associates shall amongst other things:
• Conduct all transactions, agreements or arrangements entered into 
between: (i) BGEO and its associates, and (ii) GHG or any of its 
subsidiaries on an arm’s length basis and on normal commercial 
terms and in accordance with the related party transaction rules set 
out in the Listing Rules;
• Not take any action that has or would have the effect of preventing 
GHG or any of its subsidiaries from complying with their obligations 
under the Listing Rules;
• Not propose or procure the proposal of any resolution of the 
shareholders (or any class thereof) which is intended, or appears to 
be intended, to circumvent the proper application of the Listing Rules; 
and/or
• Abstain from voting on any resolution required by LR 11.1.7R(3)  
of the Listing Rules to approve a transaction with a related party 
involving BGEO.
The Relationship Agreement entitles BGEO to appoint one person to  
be a Non-Executive Director of GHG for so long as it (together with its 
associates) holds at least 20% of the voting share capital of GHG. The 
Relationship Agreement also provides that (subject to permitted exceptions) 
neither BGEO nor its associates shall compete with the business of GHG 
nor use any names associated with GHG and that GHG shall not use any 
names associated with BGEO or its associates. A copy of the Relationship 
Agreement is available to view at the Company’s registered office.
JSC ABC PHARMACIA ACQUISITION
On 6 January 2017, Georgia Healthcare Group, through one of its 
subsidiaries, acquired 67% of the shares of JSC ABC Pharmacy, a 
pharmaceuticals company operating in Georgia from individual investors 
for GEL 73.8 million (see page 162, Note 5 regarding Business 
Combinations in the Financial Statements ). The outstanding amount is 
due within tranches within 5 years and the Group has a call option and 
the managing shareholders a put option in regard of the 33% non-
controlling interest in the combined pharmacy business, GEPHA.

treatment facilities, including the Gardabani Sewage Treatment Plant  
and the rehabilitation of the Gardabani Wastewater Treatment.

Information
At no time during 2017 did any Director hold a material interest in any 
contracts of significance with BGEO or any subsidiary of the Group.  
The Company is not party to any significant agreements (apart from  
the Relationship Agreement) that would take effect, alter or terminate 
following a change of control of the Company. 
There are no agreements between the Company and any Director or 
employee that would provide compensation for loss of office or loss  
of employment that occurs because of a takeover bid. However, under 
the plans and provisions of the Company’s share schemes (including  
for deferred share salary and discretionary share compensation) and 
certain service agreements entered into between the Company and the 
Executives (as described in further detail in the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report) and between the Company and certain senior managers, certain 
awards granted to the Executive and senior management will vest on a 
takeover or other change of control.

OVERVIEW OF OUR AUDIT APPROACH
Key audit matters • Monitoring of credit quality and appropriateness of allowance for loan losses
• Revenue recognition, including the application of IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from contracts with customers’ to the 
Banking Business, JSC m
2
 Real Estate, Georgia Healthcare Group PLC and Georgian Global Utilities Ltd
• Valuation of land and office buildings, hospitals and clinics, infrastructure assets and investment properties
Audit scope We performed an audit of the complete financial information of five components and audit procedures on specific 
balances for a further one component.
The components where we performed full or specific audit procedures accounted for 98% of Profit before 
non-recurring items and tax, 91% of Revenue and 96% of Total assets.
Materiality Overall Group materiality of GEL 25 million which represents 5% of pre-tax profit adjusted for non-recurring items.
KEY AUDIT MATTERS
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current 
period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) that we identified. These matters included 
those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement 
team. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do 
not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

MONITORING OF CREDIT QUALITY AND 
APPROPRIATENESS OF ALLOWANCE  
FOR LOAN LOSSES
LOAN LOSS ALLOWANCE GEL 279.3M, 
(2016: GEL 255.3M), INCLUDING GEL 
2.4M ATTRIBUTABLE TO FINANCE LEASE 
RECEIVABLE (31 DECEMBER 2016: GEL 2.5M)
The allowance for loan losses is highly judgmental 
and changes in assumptions could have a material 
impact on reported profits.
The allowance for loan losses is calculated using  
a combination of a collective provisioning model 
and specific loan provisions based on discounted 
cash flow analyses. Both collective and specific 
provisions depend on a number of assumptions 
and judgments, the most important of which are 
management’s assessment of credit risk, estimates 
of future cash flows and valuations of collateral.
As a consequence of the judgment involved in 
establishing the allowance, there is a greater risk  
of misstatement in this balance, either by fraud  
or error, including through the potential override  
of controls by management.
The level of risk is consistent with the prior year.
Refer to the Audit Committee Report (page 92); 
Accounting policies (page 147); and Note 11 to  
the Consolidated Financial Statements.
• We performed a walkthrough of the loan loss allowance 
process and assessed the design and operating 
effectiveness of key controls.
• We tested key controls over the collective loan loss provision, 
which included controls over the identification of loans to be 
included in the collective assessment, collective provisioning 
model inputs, key model assumptions and calculations.
• We tested key controls over the specific loan loss 
provision, which addressed aspects such as the 
classification of borrowers into their respective risk grades, 
calculation of days past due, and the recalculation of the 
loan loss allowance, including the valuation of collateral.
• For the collective loan loss provision, we critically assessed 
the appropriateness of the collective provisioning 
methodology as well as the assumptions and data inputs 
into the model with reference to our understanding of the 
business, relevant accounting standards and market 
practices, recalculated the collective loan loss provision on 
a sample basis and analysed the sensitivity of provisions to 
changes in key model inputs.
• For specific loan loss provisions, we assessed the 
recoverability of loan exposures on a sample basis and 
ensured the appropriateness of the provision as at the 
balance sheet date, including reviewing the Group’s 
documented credit assessment of the borrowers, 
challenging assumptions relating to future cash flow 
projections and the valuation of collateral held.
• We verified the appropriate restriction of the property 
pledged as collateral to the Georgian public real estate 
register.
• For real estate collateral where the valuation changed by 
more than 10% compared to the prior year and for new 
real estate collateral we reviewed the details of the current 
year valuation and validated the reasonableness of the new 
value by benchmarking major inputs to publicly available 
market data.
• For equipment pledged (which is considered by the Group 
as a source of cash flows for loan repayment in certain 
cases for individually significant borrowers) we reconciled 
the values to the supporting documentation and compared 
to market values of such equipment.
• We compared the valuation of collateral to the actual 
values of sales of similar repossessed properties by  
the Group.
• We analysed a sample of restructured loans and the 
Group’s documented assessment to provide assurance 
that any loans that have been subject to forbearance have 
been appropriately classified and reported.
Although the loan loss 
allowance is by nature 
highly judgmental, based 
on the results of our  
audit procedures, we 
concluded that the loan 
loss allowance is in the 
middle of a reasonable 
range as at 31 December 
2017. 120 Annual Report 2017 BGEO Group PLC

REVENUE RECOGNITION, INCLUDING THE 
APPLICATION OF IFRS 15 ‘REVENUE FROM 
CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS’ TO THE 
BANKING BUSINESS, JSC M
2
 REAL ESTATE, 
GEORGIA HEALTHCARE GROUP PLC AND 
GEORGIAN GLOBAL UTILITIES LTD
GROSS REVENUE GEL 2,482M, 
INCLUDING GEL 763M ATTRIBUTABLE 
TO DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS (2016: 
GEL 1,816M, INCLUDING GEL 422M 
ATTRIBUTABLE TO DISCONTINUED 
OPERATIONS)
The separate listing of Georgia Healthcare Group 
PLC (GHG) and the announced demerger of 
Banking and Investment Businesses of the Group 
could potentially result in pressure on management 
to report strong financial performance, including 
revenue growth.
The Group has early adopted IFRS 15 for the 
current year. As allowed by the standard, it is 
applied prospectively from 1 January 2017,  
with no restatement of comparatives.
In applying IFRS 15, judgement is required to be 
exercised by management in determining the point 
at which it is appropriate to recognise revenue, and 
in particular the nature of performance obligations 
and the allocation of the contract price to those 
obligations. Specific considerations include:
• The timing of recognition of revenue in respect 
of card servicing fees, bundled products and 
customer loyalty schemes in the Banking 
Business
• The treatment of corrections and rebates in 
GHG’s hospital business
• The measurement of revenue in respect of 
loyalty schemes and exchange transactions  
in GHG
• The manner in which revenue is recognised over 
the period of construction/sale of apartments in 
JSC m
2
 Real Estate
• The timing of recognition of revenue arising 
from up-front connection and water meter 
installation fees in GGU
The total adjustment in respect of the above as  
at 1 January 2017 was a deferral of revenue of 
GEL 29m. As with any major new accounting 
standard, there is a risk that the Group does  
not apply IFRS 15 appropriately.
The Group’s accounting systems are not 
configured to allow automated IFRS 15 accounting 
for revenue and the adjustments to conform to the 
requirements of IFRS 15 are booked as an overlay.
These factors mean that there is a greater risk of 
misstatement in revenue balances, either by fraud 
or error, including through the potential override of 
controls by management.
The risk has increased in the current year as a 
result of the announced demerger and the early 
adoption of IFRS 15.
Refer to the Audit Committee Report (page 92); the 
Accounting policies (pages 152-154); and Notes 3, 
6, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26 to the Consolidated Financial 
Statements.
• We gained an understanding of the revenue processes  
and assessed the design and operating effectiveness  
of key controls.
• We performed substantive testing of revenue transactions 
at the Banking and the Investment Businesses including 
key items testing and representative sampling where we 
agreed transactions to the underlying documentation, 
testing manual and topside adjustments and cut-off  
testing (by selecting a sample of transactions either  
side of year-end).
• We agreed transactions on a sample basis in each of the 
in-scope components to supporting evidence, including 
underlying contracts and cash receipts to determine 
whether revenue had been recognised in accordance  
with the Group’s accounting policies and IFRS. Where 
appropriate, we re-computed revenue and compared  
to reported amounts. The samples used for this testing 
were increased to reflect that revenue recognition is a 
significant risk.
• We performed contract reviews with respect to products  
of the Banking Business, m
2
 Real Estate, GGU and GHG 
and validated the identification of performance obligations.
• We performed substantive audit procedures over the  
IFRS 15 adjustments, covering the timing of satisfaction  
of performance obligations, allocation of transaction price 
to each performance obligation and estimation of variable 
consideration amounts, if applicable, including analytical 
procedures, testing of key items and representative sample 
testing.
• We performed analytical procedures for revenue at legal 
entity level to consider unusual trends that could indicate 
material misstatements, including monthly fluctuations 
analysis and analysis of changes in key drivers of revenue.
• We performed journal entry testing in order to identify and 
test the risk of misstatement arising from management 
override of controls.
• We considered whether the presentation and disclosure  
of revenue in the financial statements is in accordance  
with relevant accounting standards.
Based on the results of 
our audit procedures, we 
concluded that revenue 
for the year ended 
31 December 2017  
has been recognised in 
accordance with IFRS.
In particular, we 
concluded that the  
Group applied IFRS 15 
appropriately in all 
material respects as  
at 1 January 2017, 
31 December 2017  
and for the year ended 
31 December 2017.

VALUATION OF LAND AND OFFICE 
BUILDINGS, HOSPITALS AND CLINICS, 
INFRASTRUCTURE ASSETS AND 
INVESTMENT PROPERTIES
NET BOOK VALUE OF GEL 1,352M, 
INCLUDING GEL 429M ATTRIBUTABLE  
TO ASSETS OF DISPOSAL GROUPS  
AND DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS  
(2016: GEL 1,188M)
The Group applies the revaluation model for  
the measurement of its infrastructure assets and 
hospitals and clinics and the fair value model for 
investment properties.
During the year, the Group voluntarily changed the 
accounting policy for subsequent measurement  
of its office buildings and service centres (including 
related land) from the revaluation model to the cost 
model. The Group restated each of the affected 
historical financial statement line items for the prior 
periods as if the cost model in respect of that class 
of property and equipment had been always applied.
Individual items of investment properties and GHG 
hospitals and clinics were revalued as at the year end.
The fair value of the GGU infrastructure assets  
as at 31 December 2017 was determined using 
the income approach. Based on the analysis 
performed by the independent valuer, management 
concluded that this fair value for the period since 
the last valuation date did not significantly change.
Real estate valuations are inherently uncertain and 
subject to an estimation process. Furthermore, the 
Group’s real estate properties and infrastructure 
assets are located primarily in Georgia, where the 
secondary market is relatively illiquid, particularly  
in respect of hospitals and clinics. Although the 
valuations are performed by appropriately qualified 
valuers, there remains a risk that individual assets 
might be inappropriately valued.
The risk reduced slightly in the current year as a 
result of the change in the accounting policy in 
respect of subsequent measurement of office 
buildings and service centres from the revaluation 
model to the cost model.
Refer to the Audit Committee Report (page 92); 
Accounting policies (pages 149,150, 157 and 158); 
and Notes 3, 12 and 13 to the Consolidated Financial 
Statements.
• We engaged our real estate specialists to evaluate the 
appropriateness of the Group’s valuations of investment 
properties of the Banking Business and m
2
, infrastructure 
assets of GGU and hospitals and clinics of GHG, including 
the following:
 – we evaluated the competence, professional 
qualifications and objectivity of the external valuers 
engaged by the Group;
 – through reading the valuation reports and discussion 
with management and the valuers, we obtained an 
understanding of the objectives and scope of the 
valuers’ work, the methods and assumptions that they 
had used and the conclusions that they had reached;
 – we challenged the methods and assumptions used  
in the valuation reports, including consideration as to 
whether there was contrary market intelligence that had 
not been taken into account in the valuers’ analyses;
 – for a sample of 69 items for which specific valuations 
were performed, we verified the data, and assessed the 
appropriateness of the methods and assumptions, logic 
and reasoning applied by the valuers. To the extent 
possible we compared this information to norms and 
benchmarks in the Georgian market; and
 – in respect of the valuation of infrastructure assets  
we involved our valuation specialists and challenged 
management’s key assumptions, their consistency  
with GGU’s business plans and externally available 
information. We tested the underlying calculations, 
verified the validity of the data inputs and the 
appropriateness of assumptions applied.
• We ensured the appropriate recognition of the results of the 
valuations in accordance with IAS 16 ‘Property, Plant and 
Equipment’ and IAS 40 ‘Investment Property’.
• We challenged management’s justification for a change  
in the accounting policy in respect of subsequent 
measurement of office buildings and service centres, 
analysed it for conformity with the requirements of IFRSs 
and ensured the appropriateness of proposed accounting 
treatment, including the adjustments made by management 
to restate the prior periods’ balances in that respect.
Based on the results of 
our audit procedures,  
we concluded that:
• The voluntary change 
in the accounting 
policy for subsequent 
measurement of office 
buildings and service 
centres from the 
revaluation model  
to the cost model is 
justified as it results in 
financial statements 
providing more 
relevant and reliable 
information to users, in 
particular, it improves 
the comparability of 
the financial 
information with other 
banking groups.
• In respect of the 
valuation of investment 
properties, hospitals 
and clinics and 
infrastructure assets, 
certain assumptions 
and, consequently, the 
valuations as a whole 
were towards the less 
conservative end of, 
but within a reasonable 
range as at 
31 December 2017.
In the prior year, our auditor’s report included a key audit matter in relation to the accounting for one-off and complex transactions including business 
combinations. In the current year, there were no such transactions comparable by size, significance or complexity to those occurring in the prior year, 
and, accordingly, we have not included this risk above as it was no longer a risk that had a significant effect on our overall audit strategy, the allocation 
of resources in the audit and the direction of the efforts of the audit team.
AN OVERVIEW OF THE SCOPE OF OUR AUDIT
TAILORING THE SCOPE
Our assessment of audit risk, our evaluation of materiality and our allocation of performance materiality determine our audit scope for each entity 
within the Group. Taken together, this enables us to form an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We take into account size, risk profile, 
the organisation of the Group and effectiveness of Group-wide controls, changes in the business environment and other factors such as recent 
Internal Audit findings when assessing the level of work to be performed at each entity.
In assessing the risk of material misstatement to the Group financial statements, and to ensure we had adequate quantitative coverage of significant 
accounts in the financial statements, of the 30 reporting components of the Group, we selected six components covering entities within the UK and 
Georgia, which represent the principal business units within the Group. 122 Annual Report 2017 BGEO Group PLC
Of the six components selected, we performed an audit of the complete financial information of five components (“full scope components”) which 
were selected based on their size or risk characteristics. For the remaining one component (“specific scope component”), we performed audit 
procedures on specific account balances within that component that we considered had the potential for the greatest impact on the significant 
accounts in the financial statements either because of the size of these accounts or their risk profile.
The reporting components where we performed audit procedures accounted for 98% (2016: 95%) of the Group’s Profit before non-recurring items 
and tax, 91% (2016: 91%) of the Group’s Revenue and 96% (2016: 95%) of the Group’s Total assets.

1. We audited the complete financial information.
2. We audited specific account balances within these components. The audit scope of these components may not have included testing of all significant accounts of the 
components but will have contributed to the coverage of significant accounts tested for the Group.
3. We performed other procedures, including analytical review and testing of consolidation journal entries and intercompany eliminations to respond to any potential risks of material 
misstatement to the Group financial statements.
4. Profit before non-recurring items and tax.
The components for which we performed full or specific scope procedures are set out below:

 Real Estate Specific Georgia/component team
CHANGES FROM THE PRIOR YEAR
For the year ended 31 December 2017, we changed the scope for Georgian Global Utilities limited and JSC BGEO Group from specific scope to full 
scope because of the increase in the size and risk characteristics of these components.
INVOLVEMENT WITH COMPONENT TEAMS
In establishing our overall approach to the Group audit, we determined the type of work that needed to be undertaken at each of the components  
by us, as the primary audit engagement team, or by component auditors from other EY global network firms operating under our instruction. Of the 
five full scope components, audit procedures were performed on three of these directly by the primary audit team. For the specific scope component 
where the work was performed by component auditors, we determined the appropriate level of involvement to enable us to determine that sufficient 
audit evidence had been obtained as a basis for our opinion on the Group as a whole.
The Group audit team continued to follow a programme of planned visits that has been designed to make sure that the Senior Statutory Auditor 
visits the principal components of the Group. The Senior Statutory Auditor is based in the UK, but since Group management and operations reside 
in Georgia, the Group audit team operates as an integrated primary team including members from the UK, Georgia, Russia and the CIS. The Senior 
Statutory Auditor visited Georgia five times during the current year’s audit and there was regular interaction between team members in each 
jurisdiction. During the current year’s audit cycle, visits were undertaken by the Senior Statutory Auditor and other members of the primary audit 
team to the components in Georgia.
These visits involved discussing the audit approach with the component teams and any issues arising from their work, as well as meeting with local 
management. In addition, the primary team participated in planning and closing meetings and reviewed selected audit working papers. The primary 
team interacted regularly with the component teams where appropriate during various stages of the audit and were responsible for the scope and 
direction of the audit process. This, together with the additional procedures performed at Group level, gave us appropriate evidence for our opinion 
on the Group financial statements.
OUR APPLICATION OF MATERIALITY
We apply the concept of materiality in planning and performing the audit, in evaluating the effect of identified misstatements on the audit and in 
forming our audit opinion.

MATERIALITY
The magnitude of an omission or misstatement that, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to influence the economic 
decisions of the users of the financial statements. Materiality provides a basis for determining the nature and extent of our audit procedures.
We determined materiality for the Group to be GEL 25 million (2016: GEL 20 million), which is approximately 5% (2016: 5%) of profit before tax and 
non-recurring items. We consider that this adjusted profit figure best represents the results of the underlying operations of the Group and as such 
provides us with an appropriate basis for determining the nature, timing and extent of risk assessment procedures, identifying and assessing the risk 
of material misstatement and determining the nature, timing and extent of further audit procedures.
Materiality
 Profit before tax: GEL 482.0m (continuing operations: 
GEL 435.8m, discounted operations: GEL 46.2m)
 Non-recurring items: GEL 9.7m (continuing operations 
GEL 4.9m, discounted operations: GEL 4.8m)
Totals GEL 491.8m (materiality basis)
Materiality of GEL 25.0m (approx. 5% of materiality basis)
Starting basis
Adjustments
We determined materiality for the Parent Company to be GEL 20 million (2016: GEL 20 million), which is approximately 2% (2016: 2%) of equity.  
We consider that, in respect of the Parent Company, equity is most relevant to the stakeholders and is best representative of the economic size of 
the entity and as such provides us with an appropriate basis for determining the nature, timing and extent of risk assessment procedures, identifying 
and assessing the risk of material misstatement and determining the nature, timing and extent of further audit procedures.

PERFORMANCE MATERIALITY
The application of materiality at the individual account or balance level. It is set at an amount to reduce to an appropriately low level the probability 
that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceeds materiality.
On the basis of our risk assessments, together with our assessment of the Group’s overall control environment, our judgment was that performance 
materiality was 50% (2016: 50%) of our planning materiality, namely GEL 12.5 million (2016: GEL 10.0 million).
Audit work at component locations for the purpose of obtaining audit coverage over significant financial statement accounts is undertaken based  
on a percentage of total performance materiality. The performance materiality set for each component is based on the relative scale and risk of  
the component to the Group as a whole and our assessment of the risk of misstatement at that component. In the current year, the performance 
materiality allocated to components was as follows:
• BGEO Group PLC   GEL 10.0m
• JSC BGEO Group   GEL 10.0m
• JSC Bank of Georgia   GEL 10.0m
• Georgia Healthcare Group PLC  GEL 3.75m
• Georgian Global Utilities Ltd   GEL 3.125m
• JSC m

 Real Estate   GEL 2.5m
REPORTING THRESHOLD
An amount below which identified misstatements are considered as being clearly trivial.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them all uncorrected audit differences in excess of GEL 1.25 million (2016: GEL 1 million), 
which is set at 5% of planning materiality, as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.
We evaluate any uncorrected misstatements against both the quantitative measures of materiality discussed above and in light of other relevant 
qualitative considerations in forming our opinion. 124 Annual Report 2017 BGEO Group PLC

The Directors are responsible for the other information.
Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do 
not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the 
other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially 
misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether there is a material 
misstatement in the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude 
that there is a material misstatement of the other information, we are required to report that fact.
We have nothing to report in this regard.
In this context, we also have nothing to report in regard to our responsibility to specifically address the following items in the other information and  
to report as uncorrected material misstatements of the other information where we conclude that those items meet the following conditions:
• Fair, balanced and understandable set out on page 114 – the statement given by the Directors that they consider the annual report and financial 
statements taken as a whole is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s 
performance, business model and strategy, is materially inconsistent with our knowledge obtained in the audit; or
• Audit Committee reporting set out on pages 91 to 94 – the section describing the work of the Audit Committee does not appropriately address 
matters communicated by us to the Audit Committee; or
• Directors’ statement of compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code set out on page 76 – the parts of the Directors’ statement 
required under the Listing Rules relating to the company’s compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code containing provisions specified 
for review by the auditor in accordance with Listing Rule 9.8.10R(2) do not properly disclose a departure from a relevant provision of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code.
OPINIONS ON OTHER MATTERS PRESCRIBED BY THE COMPANIES ACT 2006
In our opinion, the part of the Directors’ remuneration report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:
• the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is 
consistent with the financial statements; and
• the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.
MATTERS ON WHICH WE ARE REQUIRED TO REPORT BY EXCEPTION
In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and the Parent Company and its environment obtained in the course of the audit, we 
have not identified material misstatements in the Strategic Report or the Directors’ Report.
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from 
branches not visited by us; or
• the Parent Company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ remuneration report to be audited are not in agreement with the 
accounting records and returns; or
• certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.
RESPONSIBILITIES OF DIRECTORS
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement set out on page 114, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial 
statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the Directors determine is necessary to enable the 
preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the Directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s and the Parent Company’s ability to continue as a going 
concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Directors either 
intend to liquidate the Group or the Parent Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
AUDITOR’S RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether 
due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a 
guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise 
from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic 
decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

EXPLANATION AS TO WHAT EXTENT THE AUDIT WAS CONSIDERED CAPABLE OF DETECTING IRREGULARITIES, INCLUDING FRAUD
The objectives of our audit:
• in respect to fraud, are: to identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements due to fraud; to obtain sufficient 
appropriate audit evidence regarding the assessed risks of material misstatement due to fraud, through designing and implementing appropriate 
responses; and to respond appropriately to fraud or suspected fraud identified during the audit. However, the primary responsibility for the 
prevention and detection of fraud rests with both those charged with governance of the entity and management; and
• in respect to irregularities, considered to be non-compliance with laws and regulations, are: to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence 
regarding compliance with the provisions of those laws and regulations generally recognised to have a direct effect on the determination of 
material amounts and disclosures in the financial statements (‘direct laws and regulations’), and perform other audit procedures to help identify 
instances of non-compliance with other laws and regulations that may have a material effect on the financial statements. We are not responsible 
for preventing non-compliance with laws and regulations and our audit procedures cannot be expected to detect non-compliance with all laws 
and regulations.
Our approach was as follows:
• We obtained a general understanding of the legal and regulatory frameworks that are applicable to the company and determined that the relevant 
laws and regulations related to elements of company law and tax legislation, and the financial reporting framework. Our considerations of other 
laws and regulations that may have a material effect on the financial statements included permissions and supervisory requirements of the 
Prudential Regulation Authority (‘PRA’), the Financial Conduct Authority (‘FCA’) and the UK Listing Authority (‘UKLA’), and the various Georgian 
legal and regulatory requirements applying to the components of the Group, of which the most material are the regulations of the National Bank 
of Georgia relating to the Banking Business, water regulations and healthcare regulations.
• We obtained a general understanding of how the Group complies with these legal and regulatory frameworks by making enquiries of management, 
internal audit, and those responsible for legal and compliance matters. We also reviewed correspondence between the Group and its regulators; 
reviewed minutes of the Board and Executive Risk Committee, and gained an understanding of the Group’s approach to governance, demonstrated 
by the Board’s approval of the Group’s governance framework, and the Board’s review of the Group’s risk management framework (‘RMF’) and 
internal control processes.
• For direct laws and regulations, we considered the extent of compliance with those laws and regulations as part of our procedures on the related 
financial statement items.
• For both direct and other laws and regulations, our procedures involved: making enquiry of those charged with governance and senior management 
for their awareness of any non-compliance of laws or regulations, inquiring about the policies that have been established to prevent non-compliance 
with laws and regulations by officers and employees, inquiring about the company’s methods of enforcing and monitoring compliance with such 
policies, inspecting significant correspondence with the regulators.
• We instructed component teams to communicate to the primary team any identified instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. 
There were no such instances identified and communicated by and to components.
• The Group operates across various industries some of which, including banking, insurance, public utilities and healthcare, are highly regulated 
environments. As such, the Senior Statutory Auditor considered the experience and expertise of the engagement team to ensure that the team 
had the appropriate competence and capabilities which included the use of specialists where appropriate.
• We assessed the susceptibility of the Group’s financial statements to material misstatement, including how fraud might occur, by considering the 
controls that the Group has established to address risks identified by the entity, or that otherwise seek to prevent, deter or detect fraud. We also 
considered areas of significant judgment, complex transactions, performance targets, economic or external pressures and the impact these have 
on the control environment. Where this risk was considered to be higher, we performed audit procedures to address each identified fraud risk 
which included management, internal audit and legal enquiries, testing of internal control, journal entry testing, analytical procedures, tests of 
detail and focused testing as referred to in the Key Audit Matters section above. These procedures were designed to provide reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements were free from fraud or error.
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting Council’s website at  
https://www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor’s report.
OTHER MATTERS WHICH WE ARE REQUIRED TO ADDRESS
Following the tender process and the subsequent recommendation of the Audit Committee to the Board, we were appointed by the Board on 
16 April 2012 to audit the financial statements for the first accounting period ending 31 December 2012 and subsequent financial periods. We  
were re-appointed by shareholders at the Company’s 2013 Annual General Meeting and at each subsequent Annual General Meeting. The period  
of total uninterrupted engagement is six years, covering the first financial period ending 31 December 2012 and subsequent annual periods ending 
31 December 2013 to 31 December 2017.
The non-audit services prohibited by the FRC’s Ethical Standard were not provided to the Group or the Parent Company and we remain independent 
of the Group and the Parent Company in conducting our audit.
Our audit opinion is consistent with the additional report to the Audit Committee.

Notes:
1. The maintenance and integrity of the BGEO Group PLC’s website is the responsibility of the Directors; the work carried out by the auditors does not involve consideration of these 
matters and, accordingly, the auditors accept no responsibility for any changes that may have occurred to the financial statements since they were initially presented on the website.
2. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions. 126 Annual Report 2017 BGEO Group PLC

1. PRINCIPAL ACTIVITIES
BGEO Group PLC (“BGEO”) (formerly known as Bank of Georgia Holdings PLC) is a public limited liability company incorporated in England and 
Wales with registered number 07811410. BGEO holds 99.55% of the share capital of the JSC Bank of Georgia (the “Bank”) as at 31 December 
2017, representing the Bank’s ultimate parent company. Together with the Bank and other subsidiaries, BGEO makes up a group of companies 
(the “Group”) that provide banking, insurance, real estate, utility, leasing, beverage production and distribution, brokerage and investment 
management services to corporate and individual customers. The Group currently consolidates the healthcare and pharmacy business, which has 
been classified as discontinued operations of the Group. The list of the companies included in the Group is provided in Note 2. The shares of BGEO 
(“BGEO Shares”) are admitted to the premium listing segment of the Official List of the UK Listing Authority and admitted to trading on the London 
Stock Exchange PLC’s Main Market for listed securities, effective 28 February 2012. The Bank is the Group’s main operating unit and accounts for 
most of the Group’s activities.
On 3 July 2017 BGEO announced its intention to demerge BGEO Group PLC into a London-listed banking business (the “Banking Business”), 
Bank of Georgia Group PLC, and a London-listed investment business (the “Investment Business”), Georgia Capital PLC, by the end of the first  
half of 2018.
JSC Bank of Georgia was established on 21 October 1994 as a joint stock company (“JSC”) under the laws of Georgia. The Bank operates under  
a general banking license issued by the National Bank of Georgia (“NBG”; the Central Bank of Georgia) on 15 December 1994.
The Bank accepts deposits from the public and extends credit, transfers payments in Georgia and internationally and exchanges currencies.  
Its main office is in Tbilisi, Georgia. At 31 December 2017, the Bank has 286 operating outlets in all major cities of Georgia (31 December 2016: 278; 
31 December 2015: 266). The Bank’s registered legal address is 29a Gagarini Street, Tbilisi 0160, Georgia.
The Group completed legal restructuring in August 2015, undertaken in accordance with the National Bank of Georgia’s intention to regulate banks 
in Georgia on a standalone basis and thereby limit investments in non-banking subsidiaries by locally regulated banking entities.
BGEO’s registered legal address is 84 Brook Street, London, W1K 5EH, England.

These financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention except for:
• the measurement at fair value of financial assets and investment securities, derivative financial assets and liabilities, investment properties, and 
revalued property and equipment;

GOING CONCERN
The Board of Directors of BGEO has made an assessment of the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern and is satisfied that it has the 
resources to continue in business for a period of at least 12 months from the date of approval of the financial statements. Furthermore, management 
is not aware of any material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt upon the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern for the foreseeable 
future. Therefore, the financial statements continue to be prepared on the going concern basis.

3. SUMMARY OF SELECTED SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION
The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Group and its subsidiaries as at 31 December 2017. The Group 
consolidates a subsidiary when it controls it. Control is achieved when the Group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement 
with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee. Specifically, the Group controls an investee if and 
only if the Group has:
• power over the investee (i.e. existing rights that give it the current ability to direct the relevant activities of the investee);
• exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee; and
• the ability to use its power over the investee to affect its returns.
When the Group has less than a majority of the voting or similar rights of an investee, the Group considers all relevant facts and circumstances in 
assessing whether it has power over an investee, including:
• the contractual arrangement with the other vote holders of the investee;
• rights arising from other contractual arrangements; and
• the Group’s voting rights and potential voting rights.
The Group re-assesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more of the three 
elements of control. Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when the Group obtains control over the subsidiary and ceases when the Group loses control 
of the subsidiary. Income and expenses of a subsidiary acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the statement of comprehensive income 
from the date the Group gains control until the date the Group ceases to control the subsidiary.
Profit or loss and each component of other comprehensive income are attributed to the equity holders of the parent of the Group and to the non-
controlling interests, even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance. When necessary, adjustments are made to the financial 
statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies into line with the Group’s accounting policies. All intra-Group assets and liabilities, equity, 
income, expenses and cash flows relating to transactions between members of the Group are eliminated in full on consolidation.
A change in the ownership interest of a subsidiary, without a loss of control, is accounted for as an equity transaction. If the Group loses control over 
a subsidiary, it:
• derecognises the assets (including goodwill) and liabilities of the subsidiary;
• derecognises the carrying amount of any non-controlling interests;
• derecognises the cumulative translation differences recorded in equity;
• recognises the fair value of the consideration received;
• recognises the fair value of any investment retained;
• recognises any surplus or deficit in profit or loss; and
• reclassifies the parent’s share of components previously recognised in other comprehensive income to profit or loss or retained earnings,  
as appropriate, as would be required if the Group had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities.
BUSINESS COMBINATIONS AND GOODWILL
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate of the consideration 
transferred measured at acquisition date fair value and the amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree. For each business combination, the 
Group elects whether to measure the non-controlling interests in the acquiree at fair value or at the proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable 
net assets and other components of non-controlling interests at their acquisition date fair values. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred 
and included in administrative expenses.
When the Group acquires a business, it assesses the financial assets and liabilities assumed for appropriate classification and designation in accordance 
with the contractual terms, economic circumstances and pertinent conditions as at the acquisition date. This includes the separation of embedded 
derivatives in host contracts by the acquiree.
If the business combination is achieved in stages, any previously held equity interest is re-measured at its acquisition date fair value and any resulting 
gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss. It is then considered in the determination of goodwill.
Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the acquirer will be recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. Contingent consideration classified 
as an asset or liability that is a financial instrument and within the scope of IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, is measured  
at fair value with changes in fair value recognised either in profit or loss or as a change to other comprehensive income. If the contingent consideration  
is not within the scope of IAS 39, it is measured in accordance with the appropriate IFRS. Contingent consideration that is classified as equity is not 
re-measured and subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity.
Goodwill is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred and the amount recognised for non-controlling 
interests, and any previous interest held, over the net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. If the fair value of the net assets acquired is  
in excess of the aggregate consideration transferred, the Group re-assesses whether it has correctly identified all of the assets acquired and all of the 
liabilities assumed and reviews the procedures used to measure the amounts to be recognised at the acquisition date. If the re-assessment still results 
in an excess of the fair value of net assets acquired over the aggregate consideration transferred, then the gain is recognised in profit or loss.
After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired 
in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the 
combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those units.
Where goodwill has been allocated to a cash-generating unit and part of the operation within that unit is disposed of, the goodwill associated with 
the disposed operation is included in the carrying amount of the operation when determining the gain or loss on disposal. Goodwill disposed in 
these circumstances is measured based on the relative values of the disposed operation and the portion of the cash-generating unit retained.

INVESTMENTS IN ASSOCIATES
Associates are entities in which the Group generally has between 20% and 50% of the voting rights, or is otherwise able to exercise significant 
influence, but which it does not control or jointly control. Investments in associates are accounted for under the equity method and are initially 
recognised at cost, including goodwill. Subsequent changes in the carrying value reflect the post-acquisition changes in the Group’s share of net 
assets of the associate. The Group’s share of its associates’ profits or losses is recognised in the consolidated income statement, and its share of 
movements in reserves is recognised in other comprehensive income. However, when the Group’s share of losses in an associate equals or exceeds 
its interest in the associate, the Group does not recognise further losses, unless the Group is obliged to make further payments to, or on behalf of, 
the associate.
Unrealised gains on transactions between the Group and its associates are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in the associates; 
unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred. When available-for-sale 
investment becomes an associate, the investment is re-measured to fair value and any gain or loss previously recognised in other comprehensive 
income is reclassified in profit or loss.
INVESTMENTS IN SUBSIDIARIES AND ASSOCIATES IN PARENT COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
For the purposes of parent company financial statements, investments in subsidiaries and associates are accounted at cost. Investments in subsidiaries 
and associates are accounted in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations when they are classified as 
held for sale or distribution. Dividends from a subsidiary or an associate are recognised in the parent company financial statements when the parent’s 
right to receive the dividend is established.
FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT
The Group measures financial instruments, such as trading and investment securities, derivatives and non-financial assets such as investment 
properties, at fair value at each balance sheet date. Also, fair values of financial instruments measured at amortised cost are disclosed in Note 32.
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at  
the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes 
place either:
• in the principal market for the asset or liability; or
• in the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability.
The principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible by the Group. The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the 
assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market participants act in their economic best 
interest. A fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes into account a market participant’s ability to generate economic benefits by using 
the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would use the asset in its highest and best use.
The Group uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available to measure fair value, 
maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs.
All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised within the fair value hierarchy, 
described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole:
• Level 1 − Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
• Level 2 − Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is directly or indirectly observable.
• Level 3 − Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is unobservable.
For assets and liabilities that are recognised in the financial statements on a recurring basis, the Group determines whether transfers have occurred 
between Levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorisation (based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a 
whole) at the end of each reporting period.
FINANCIAL ASSETS
INITIAL RECOGNITION
Financial assets in the scope of IAS 39 are classified as either financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, loans and receivables, or available-for-
sale financial assets, as appropriate. The Group determines the classification of its financial assets upon initial recognition.
DATE OF RECOGNITION
All regular way purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on the trade date, i.e. the date that the Group commits to purchase or sell the 
asset. Regular way purchases or sales are purchases or sales of financial assets that require delivery of assets within the period generally established 
by regulation or convention in the marketplace.
LOANS AND RECEIVABLES
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. They are not 
entered into with the intention of immediate or short-term resale and are not classified as trading securities or designated as investment securities. 
Such assets are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method. This calculation includes all fees paid or received between parties to the 
contract that are an integral part of the effective interest rate, transaction costs and all other premiums and discounts. Gains and losses are recognised 
in the consolidated income statement when the loans and receivables are derecognised or impaired, as well as through the amortisation process. 146 Annual Report 2017 BGEO Group PLC
3. SUMMARY OF SELECTED SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE FINANCIAL ASSETS
Available-for-sale financial assets are those non-derivative financial assets that are designated as available-for-sale or are not classified in any  
other categories. After initial recognition, available-for-sale financial assets are measured at fair value with gains or losses being recognised in other 
comprehensive income until the investment is derecognised or until the investment is determined to be impaired at which time the cumulative gain or 
loss previously reported in other comprehensive income is reclassified to the consolidated income statement. However, interest calculated using the 
effective interest method is recognised in the consolidated income statement.
DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
In the normal course of business, the Group enters into various derivative financial instruments including forwards, swaps and options in foreign 
exchange and capital markets. Such financial instruments are initially recognised in accordance with the policy for initial recognition of financial 
instruments and are subsequently measured at fair value. The fair values are estimated based on quoted market prices or pricing models that take 
into account the current market and contractual prices of the underlying instruments and other factors. Derivatives are carried as assets when their 
fair value is positive and as liabilities when it is negative. Gains and losses resulting from these instruments are included in the consolidated income 
statement as net foreign currency gain (loss).
MEASUREMENT OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AT INITIAL RECOGNITION
When financial instruments are recognised initially, they are measured at fair value, adjusted, in the case of instruments not at fair value through profit 
or loss, for directly attributable fees and costs.
The best evidence of the fair value of a financial instrument at initial recognition is normally the transaction price. If the Group determines that the fair 
value at initial recognition differs from the transaction price, then:
• if the fair value is evidenced by a quoted price in an active market for an identical asset or liability (i.e. a Level 1 input) or based on a valuation 
technique that uses only data from observable markets, the Group recognises the difference between the fair value at initial recognition and the 
transaction price as a gain or loss; or
• in all other cases, the initial measurement of the financial instrument is adjusted to defer the difference between the fair value at initial recognition 
and the transaction price. After initial recognition, the Group recognises that deferred difference as a gain or loss only when the inputs become 
observable, or when the instrument is derecognised.
OFFSETTING
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the consolidated statement of financial position when there is a legally 
enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or to realise the asset and settle the 
liability simultaneously.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand, amounts due from central banks, excluding obligatory reserves with central banks, and 
amounts due from credit institutions that mature within 90 days of the date of origination and are free from contractual encumbrances and readily 
convertible to known amounts of cash.
BORROWINGS
Issued financial instruments or their components are classified as liabilities, where the substance of the contractual arrangement results in the Group 
having an obligation either to deliver cash or another financial asset to the holder, or to satisfy the obligation other than by the exchange of a fixed 
amount of cash or another financial asset for a fixed number of own equity instruments. Such instruments include amounts due to credit institutions 
and amounts due to customers (including promissory notes issued). These are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration received less 
directly attributable transaction costs. After initial recognition, borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest 
method. Gains and losses are recognised in the consolidated income statement when the borrowings are derecognised as well as through the 
amortisation process.
If the Group purchases its own debt, it is removed from the statement of financial position and the difference between the carrying amount of the 
liability and the consideration paid is recognised in the consolidated income statement.
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of an asset that necessarily takes a substantial period of time to 
get ready for its intended use or sale are capitalised as part of the cost of the asset. All other borrowing costs are expensed in the period in which 
they occur. Borrowing costs consist of interest and other costs that an entity incurs in connection with the borrowing of funds.
SUBORDINATED DEBT
Subordinated debt represents long-term funds attracted by the Bank on the international financial markets or domestic market. The holders of 
subordinated debt would be subordinate to all other creditors to receive repayment of debt in case of the Bank’s liquidation. Subordinated debt  
is carried at amortised cost.
LEASES
I. FINANCE – GROUP AS LESSOR
Leases that transfer substantially all the risks and benefits incidental to ownership of the lease item to the lessee are classified as finance leases.  
The Group recognises finance lease receivables in the consolidated statement of financial position at a value equal to the net investment in the lease, 
starting from the date of commencement of the lease term. In calculating the present value of the minimum lease payments, the discount factor used 
is the interest rate implicit in the lease. Initial direct costs are included in the initial measurement of the finance lease receivables. Lease payments 
received are apportioned between the finance income and the reduction of the outstanding lease receivable. Finance income is based on a pattern 
reflecting a constant periodic rate of return on the net investment outstanding.
II. OPERATING – GROUP AS LESSEE
Leases of assets under which the risks and rewards of ownership are effectively retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases. Lease 
payments under an operating lease are recognised as expenses on a straight-line basis over the lease term and included in other administrative and 
operating expenses.

III. OPERATING – GROUP AS LESSOR
The Group presents assets subject to operating leases in the consolidated statement of financial position according to the nature of the asset.  
Lease income from operating leases is recognised in the consolidated income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term as other 
income. The aggregate cost of incentives provided to lessees is recognised as a reduction of rental income over the lease term on a straight-line 
basis. Initial direct costs incurred specifically to earn revenues from an operating lease are added to the carrying amount of the leased asset.
IMPAIRMENT OF FINANCIAL ASSETS
The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is any objective evidence that a financial asset or group of financial assets is impaired.
A financial asset or a group of financial assets is deemed to be impaired if, and only if, there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or 
more events that has occurred after the initial recognition of the asset (an incurred ‘loss event’) and that loss event (or events) has an impact on the 
estimated future cash flows of the financial asset or the group of financial assets that can be reliably estimated. Evidence of impairment may include 
indications that the borrower or a group of borrowers is experiencing significant financial difficulty, default or delinquency in interest or principal 
payments, the probability that they will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation and where observable data indicate that there is a 
measurable decrease in the estimated future cash flows, such as changes in arrears or economic conditions that correlate with defaults.
AMOUNTS DUE FROM CREDIT INSTITUTIONS, LOANS TO CUSTOMERS AND FINANCE LEASE RECEIVABLES
For amounts due from credit institutions, loans to customers and finance lease receivables carried at amortised cost, the Group first assesses 
whether objective evidence of impairment exists individually for financial assets that are individually significant, or collectively for financial assets  
that are not individually significant. If the Group determines that no objective evidence of impairment exists for an individually assessed financial 
asset, whether significant or not, it includes the asset in a group of financial assets with similar credit risks characteristics and collectively assesses 
them for impairment. Assets that are individually assessed for impairment and for which an impairment loss is, or continues to be, recognised are  
not included in a collective assessment of impairment.
If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss has been incurred, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the asset’s 
carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows (excluding future expected credit losses that have not yet been incurred).  
The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of an allowance account and the amount of the loss is recognised in the consolidated 
income statement. Interest income continues to be accrued on the reduced carrying amount based on the original effective interest rate of the asset. 
Loans together with the associated allowance are written off when there is no realistic prospect of future recovery and all collateral has been realised 
or has been transferred to the Group. If, in a subsequent year, the amount of the estimated impairment loss increases or decreases because of an 
event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised impairment loss is increased or reduced by adjusting the allowance 
account. If a future write-off is later recovered, the recovery is credited to the consolidated income statement in the respective impairment line with  
a negative sign as a reversal of impairment.
The present value of the estimated future cash flows is discounted at the financial asset’s original effective interest rate. If a loan has a variable 
interest rate, the discount rate for measuring any impairment loss is the current effective interest rate. The calculation of the present value of the 
estimated future cash flows of a collateralised financial asset reflects the cash flows that may result from foreclosure less costs for obtaining and 
selling the collateral, whether or not foreclosure is probable.
For the purpose of a collective evaluation of impairment, financial assets are grouped on the basis of the Group’s internal credit grading system that 
considers credit risk characteristics such as asset type, industry, geographical location, collateral type, past-due status and other relevant factors.
Future cash flows on a group of financial assets that are collectively evaluated for impairment are estimated on the basis of historical loss experience 
for assets with credit risk characteristics similar to those in the group. Historical loss experience is adjusted on the basis of current observable data 
to reflect the effects of current conditions that did not affect the years on which the historical loss experience is based and to remove the effects of 
conditions in the historical period that do not exist currently. Estimates of changes in future cash flows reflect, and are consistent with, changes in 
related observable data from year to year (such as changes in unemployment rates, property prices, commodity prices, payment status, or other 
factors that are indicative of incurred losses in the group or their magnitude). The methodology and assumptions used for estimating future cash 
flows are reviewed regularly to reduce any differences between loss estimates and actual loss experience.
WRITE-OFF OF LOANS TO CUSTOMERS
All retail loans, except mortgages, are written off when overdue by more than 150 days. Retail mortgage loans are written off when overdue by more 
than 365 days. Write off of corporate loans overdue by more than 150 days is subject to management discretion and is evaluated on a case by case 
basis, taking into account the current and expected positions of the loan/borrower.
AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE FINANCIAL ASSETS
For available-for-sale financial investments, the Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is objective evidence that an investment or a 
group of investments is impaired.
In the case of equity investments classified as available-for-sale, objective evidence would include a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of 
the investment below its cost. Where there is evidence of impairment, the cumulative loss – measured as the difference between the acquisition cost 
and the current fair value, less any impairment loss on that investment previously recognised in the consolidated income statement – is reclassified 
from other comprehensive income to the consolidated income statement. Impairment losses on equity investments are not reversed through the 
consolidated income statement; increases in their fair value after impairment are recognised in other comprehensive income.
In the case of debt instruments classified as available-for-sale, impairment is assessed based on the same criteria as financial assets carried at 
amortised cost. However, the amount recorded for impairment is the cumulative loss measured as the difference between the amortised cost and 
the current fair value, less any impairment loss on that investment previously recognised in the consolidated income statement. Future interest 
income is based on the reduced carrying amount and is accrued using the rate of interest used to discount the future cash flows for the purpose  
of measuring the impairment loss. The interest income is recorded in the consolidated income statement. If, in a subsequent year, the fair value  
of a debt instrument increases and the increase can be objectively related to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised in the 
consolidated income statement, the impairment loss is reversed through the consolidated income statement. 148 Annual Report 2017 BGEO Group PLC
3. SUMMARY OF SELECTED SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
RENEGOTIATED LOANS
A renegotiated loan is a loan for which the terms have been modified or for which additional collateral has been requested that was not 
contemplated in the original contract in response to a customer’s financial difficulties.
The contractual terms of a loan may be modified for a number of reasons including changing market conditions, customer retention and other 
factors not related to the current or potential credit deterioration of a customer. When the contractual payment terms of a loan are modified because 
we have significant concerns about the borrower’s ability to meet contractual payments when due, these loans are classified as ‘renegotiated loans’. 
Indicators of financial difficulties include defaults on covenants, significant arrears for 30 days or more in a three-month period, or concerns raised by 
the Credit Risk Department. Typical key features of terms and conditions granted through renegotiation to avoid default include special interest rates, 
postponement of interest or amortisation payments, modification of the schedule of repayments or amendment of loan maturity. Once the terms 
have been renegotiated, any impairment is measured using the original EIR as calculated before the modification of terms.
For the purposes of measuring credit losses within the collective loan loss assessment, these loans are not segregated from other loans which have 
not been renegotiated. Management regularly reviews all loans to ensure that all criteria according to the loan agreement continue to be met and that 
future payments are likely to occur. Loans subject to individual impairment assessment, whose terms have been renegotiated, are subject to ongoing 
review to determine whether they remain impaired.
Once a loan in the retail book is identified as renegotiated, it remains within this category until maturity or de-recognition from the balance sheet 
unless the customer is able to cure the break by making six regular payments on time. Corporate loans retain renegotiated loan designation until 
maturity or de-recognition unless borrowers’ experience significant credit improvement during the remaining life of the loan. Any new loans that arise 
following derecognition events will continue to be disclosed as renegotiated loans and are assessed for impairment as above.
DERECOGNITION OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES
FINANCIAL ASSETS
A financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets) is derecognised where:
• the rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired; or
• the Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset, or retained the right to receive cash flows from the asset, but has 
assumed an obligation to pay them in full without material delay to a third party under a ‘pass-through’ arrangement; and
• the Group either (a) has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or (b) has neither transferred nor retained substantially  
all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset.
Where the Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from an asset and has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and 
rewards of the asset nor transferred control of the asset, the asset is recognised to the extent of the Group’s continuing involvement in the asset. 
Continuing involvement that takes the form of a guarantee over the transferred asset is measured at the lower of the original carrying amount of the 
asset and the maximum amount of consideration that the Group could be required to repay.
Where continuing involvement takes the form of a written and/or purchased option (including a cash-settled option or similar provision) on the 
transferred asset, the extent of the Group’s continuing involvement is the amount of the transferred asset that the Group may repurchase, except 
that in the case of a written put option (including a cash-settled option or similar provision) on an asset measured at fair value, the extent of the 
Group’s continuing involvement is limited to the lower of the fair value of the transferred asset and the option exercise price.
FINANCIAL LIABILITIES
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires.
Where an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability  
are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability, 
and the difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognised in the consolidated income statement.
FINANCIAL GUARANTEES
In the ordinary course of business, the Group gives financial guarantees, consisting of letters of credit, guarantees and acceptances. Financial 
guarantees are initially recognised in the consolidated financial statements at fair value, in other liabilities, being the premium received. Subsequent to 
initial recognition, the Group’s liability under each guarantee is measured at the higher of the amortised premium and the best estimate of expenditure 
required to settle any financial obligation arising as a result of the guarantee.
Any increase in the liability relating to financial guarantees is taken to the consolidated income statement. The premium received is recognised  
in the consolidated income statement on a straight-line basis over the life of the guarantee.
INVENTORIES
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of 
business, less estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale.
The cost of inventory includes expenditure incurred in acquiring inventory and bringing it to its existing location and condition including borrowing 
costs. The cost of inventory is determined on a weighted average basis for beverages and in healthcare, and on a first-in-first-out basis (“FIFO”) in 
the pharma segment. The cost of inventory in the real estate segment is determined with reference to the specific costs incurred on the property 
sold and allocated non-specific costs based on the relative size of the property sold.

NON-CURRENT ASSETS HELD FOR SALE AND DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
The Group classifies non-current assets and disposal groups as held for sale if their carrying amounts will be recovered principally through a sale 
transaction rather than through continuing use. Non-current assets and disposal groups classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of their 
carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. Costs to sell are the incremental costs directly attributable to the disposal of an asset (disposal 
group), excluding finance costs and income tax expense.
The criteria for held for sale classification is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and the asset or disposal group is available for 
immediate sale in its present condition. Actions required to complete the sale should indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the sale  
will be made or that the decision to sell will be withdrawn. Management must be committed to the plan to sell the asset and the sale expected to  
be completed within one year from the date of the classification.
Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets are not depreciated or amortised once classified as held for sale.
Assets and liabilities classified as held for sale are presented separately from other assets and liabilities in the statement of financial position.
A disposal group qualifies as discontinued operation if it is a component of an entity that either has been disposed of, or is classified as held for 
sale, and:
• represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations;
• is part of a single coordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations; or
• is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale.
Discontinued operations are excluded from the results of continuing operations and are presented as a single amount as profit or loss after tax from 
discontinued operations in the statement of profit or loss. Net cash flows attributable to the operating, investing and financing activities of discontinued 
operations are presented separately in the statement of cash flows.
TAXATION
The current income tax expense is calculated in accordance with the regulations in force in the respective territories in which BGEO and its 
subsidiaries operate.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated in respect of temporary differences using the liability method. Deferred income taxes are provided for 
all temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying values for financial reporting purposes, except where 
the deferred income tax arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, 
at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss.
A deferred tax asset is recorded only to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary 
differences can be utilised. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset  
is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.
Deferred tax liabilities are provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, except where the timing 
of the reversal of the temporary difference can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Georgia and Belarus also have various operating taxes that are assessed on the Group’s activities. These taxes are included as a component of 
other operating expenses.
INVESTMENT PROPERTIES
Investment property is land or building or a part of a building held to earn rental income or for capital appreciation and which is not used by the 
Group or held for sale in the ordinary course of business. Property that is being constructed or developed or redeveloped for future use as an 
investment property is also classified as an investment property.
Investment property is initially recognised at cost, including transaction costs, and subsequently remeasured at fair value reflecting market conditions 
at the end of the reporting period. Fair value of the Group’s investment property is determined on the basis of various sources including reports of 
independent appraisers, who hold a recognised and relevant professional qualifications and who have recent experience in valuation of property  
of similar location and category.
Investment property that is being redeveloped for continuing use as investment property or for which the market has become less active continues to 
be measured at fair value. Earned rental income is recorded in the income statement within net other banking income for Banking Business companies 
and within real estate revenue for Investment Business companies. Gains and losses resulting from changes in the fair value of investment property  
are recorded in the income statement within net other banking income for Banking Business companies and within real estate revenue or gross  
other investment profit for Investment Business companies, depending on whether the gains derive from active property development or passive 
appreciation respectively.
Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with it will flow to the Group and the  
cost can be measured reliably. All other repairs and maintenance costs are expensed when incurred. If an investment property becomes owner-
occupied, it is reclassified to property and equipment, and its carrying amount at the date of reclassification becomes its deemed cost to be 
subsequently depreciated. 150 Annual Report 2017 BGEO Group PLC
3. SUMMARY OF SELECTED SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
Property and equipment, except for infrastructure assets, is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment in value. 
Such cost includes the cost of replacing part of the equipment when that cost is incurred if the recognition criteria are met. Infrastructure assets are 
measured at fair value less depreciation and impairment charged subsequent to the date of the revaluation.
Infrastructure assets comprise a network of systems consisting of raw water aqueducts, mains and sewers, impounding and pumped raw water 
storage reservoirs and sludge pipelines. Investment expenditure on infrastructure assets relating to increase in capacity or enhancements of the 
network and asset replacements to maintain the operating capability of the network is treated as an addition and initially recorded at cost, whilst 
repair and maintenance expenditure which does not enhance the asset base is charged as an operating cost.
The carrying values of property and equipment are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying 
value may not be recoverable.
Following initial recognition at cost, infrastructure assets are carried at a revalued amount, which is the fair value at the date of the revaluation less 
any subsequent accumulated depreciation and subsequent accumulated impairment losses. Valuations are performed once every three years, 
unless there is a sign of material change in fair values on the market.
Accumulated depreciation as at the revaluation date is eliminated against the gross carrying amount of the asset and the net amount is restated to the 
revalued amount of the asset. Any revaluation surplus is credited to the revaluation reserve for property and equipment included in other comprehensive 
income, except to the extent that it reverses a revaluation decrease of the same asset previously recognised in the consolidated income statement, in 
which case the increase is recognised in the consolidated income statement. A revaluation deficit is recognised in the consolidated income statement, 
except that a deficit directly offsetting a previous surplus on the same asset is directly offset against the surplus in the revaluation reserve for property 
and equipment.
An annual transfer from the revaluation reserve for property and equipment to retained earnings is made for the difference between depreciation 
based on the revalued carrying amount of the assets and depreciation based on the assets’ original cost. Additionally, accumulated depreciation  
as at the revaluation date is eliminated against the gross carrying amount of the asset and the net amount is restated to the revalued amount of  
the asset. Upon disposal, any revaluation reserve relating to the particular asset being sold is transferred to retained earnings.
Depreciation of an asset commences from the date the asset is ready and available for use. Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over 
the following estimated useful lives:
Years
Office buildings and service centres Up to 100
Infrastructure assets 10-40
Factory and equipment 7-30
Furniture and fixtures 10
Computers and equipment 5-10
Motor vehicles 5
The asset’s residual values, useful lives and methods are reviewed, and adjusted as appropriate, at each financial year-end.
Assets under construction are stated at cost and are not depreciated until the time they are available for use and reclassified to respective group  
of property and equipment.
Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the life of the related leased asset or the expected lease term if lower.
Costs related to repairs and renewals are charged when incurred and included in other operating expenses, unless they qualify for capitalization.
GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT
Goodwill is reviewed for impairment, annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may 
be impaired.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each of the Group’s 
cash-generating units, or groups of cash-generating units, that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination, irrespective of whether 
other assets or liabilities of the Group are assigned to those units or groups of units. Each unit or group of units to which the goodwill is so allocated:
• represents the lowest level within the Group at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes; and
• is not larger than a segment as defined in IFRS 8 “Operating Segments”.
Impairment is determined by assessing the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit (group of cash-generating units), to which the goodwill 
relates. Where the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit (group of cash-generating units) is less than the carrying amount, an impairment 
loss is recognised. Impairment losses cannot be reversed in future periods.
INTANGIBLE ASSETS
The Group’s intangible assets include computer software and licenses.
Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost. The cost of intangible assets acquired in a business combination is 
fair value as at the date of acquisition. Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and any 
accumulated impairment losses. The economic lives of intangible assets are assessed to be finite and amortised over four to ten years and assessed 
for impairment whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired. Amortisation periods and methods for intangible assets are 
reviewed at least at each financial year-end.

INTANGIBLE ASSETS CONTINUED
Costs associated with maintaining computer software programmes are recorded as an expense as incurred. Software development costs (relating  
to the design and testing of new or substantially improved software) are recognised as intangible assets only when the Group can demonstrate the 
technical feasibility of completing the software so that it will be available for use or sale, its intention to complete the asset and its ability to use or sell 
the asset, how the asset will generate future economic benefits, the availability of resources to complete the asset and the ability to measure reliably 
the expenditure during the development. Other software development costs are recognised as an expense as incurred.
INSURANCE AND REINSURANCE RECEIVABLES
Insurance and reinsurance receivables are recognised based upon insurance policy terms and measured at cost. The carrying value of insurance 
and reinsurance receivables is reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable, 
with any impairment loss recorded in the consolidated statement of income.
Reinsurance receivables primarily include balances due from both insurance and reinsurance companies for ceded insurance liabilities. Premiums on 
reinsurance assumed are recognised as revenue in the same manner as they would be if the reinsurance were considered direct business, taking into 
account the product classification of the reinsured business. Amounts due to reinsurers are estimated in a manner consistent with the associated 
reinsured policies and in accordance with the reinsurance contract. Premiums ceded and claims reimbursed are presented on a gross basis.
An impairment review is performed on all reinsurance assets when an indication of impairment occurs. Reinsurance receivables are impaired only if 
there is objective evidence that the Group may not receive all amounts due to it under the terms of the contract and that this can be measured reliably.
INSURANCE LIABILITIES
GENERAL INSURANCE LIABILITIES
General insurance contract liabilities are based on the estimated ultimate cost of all claims incurred but not settled at the reporting date, whether 
reported or not, together with related claims handling costs and reduction for the expected value of salvage and other recoveries. Significant delays can 
be experienced in the notification and settlement of certain types of general insurance claims, particularly in respect of liability business, environmental 
and pollution exposures – therefore the ultimate cost of which cannot be known with certainty at the reporting date.
PROVISION FOR UNEARNED PREMIUMS
The proportion of written premiums, gross of commission payable to intermediaries, attributable to subsequent periods is deferred as unearned 
premium. The change in the provision for unearned premium is taken to the consolidated income statement in order that revenue is recognised  
over the period of risk or, for annuities, the amount of expected future benefit payments.
LIABILITY ADEQUACY TEST
At each reporting date, a liability adequacy test is performed, to ensure the adequacy of unearned premiums net of related deferred acquisition 
costs. In performing the test, current best estimates of future contractual cash flows, claims handling and policy administration expenses, as well  
as investment income from assets backing such liabilities, are used. Any inadequacy is immediately charged to the consolidated income statement 
by establishing an unexpired risk provision.
PROVISIONS
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, and it is probable that an outflow 
of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate of the amount of obligation can be made.
Provisions for the risk of incurring losses on off-balance sheet commitments are estimated regularly based on the past history of actual losses 
incurred on these commitments.
RETIREMENT AND OTHER EMPLOYEE BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS
The Group provides management and employees of the Group with private pension plans. These are defined contribution pension plans covering 
substantially all full-time employees of the Group. The Group collects contributions in the size of 2% of full-time employees’ salaries, of which 1% is 
deducted from the salaries and the other 1% is additionally paid by the Group. When an employee reaches pension age, aggregated contributions, 
plus any earnings earned on the employee’s behalf are paid to the employee according to the schedule agreed with the employee. Aggregated 
amounts are distributed during the period when the employee will receive accumulated contributions. Respective pension benefit obligations are 
recorded within other liabilities, Note 16. Respective pension costs are recognised in consolidated income statement as salaries and other 
employee benefits.
SHARE-BASED PAYMENT TRANSACTIONS
Employees (including senior executives) of the Group receive share-based remuneration, whereby they render services and receive equity 
instruments of the Group (‘equity-settled transactions’) as consideration for the services provided.
EQUITY-SETTLED TRANSACTIONS
The cost of equity settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the date on which they are granted.
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised together with the corresponding increase in equity, over the period in which the performance 
and/or service conditions are fulfilled, ending on the date when the relevant employee is fully entitled to the award (‘the vesting date’). The cumulative 
expense recognised for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date until the vesting date reflects the extent to which the vesting period has 
expired and the Group’s best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest. The consolidated income statement charge or 
credit for the period represents the movement in cumulative expense recognised as at the beginning and end of that period. 152 Annual Report 2017 BGEO Group PLC
3. SUMMARY OF SELECTED SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
SHARE-BASED PAYMENT TRANSACTIONS CONTINUED
No expense is recognised for the awards that do not ultimately vest except for the awards where vesting is conditional upon market conditions  
(a condition linked to the price of BGEO’s shares) which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether the market condition is satisfied, provided  
that all other performance conditions are satisfied.
Where the terms of an equity-settled award are modified, the minimum expense is recognised as if the terms had not been modified. An additional 
expense is recognised for any modification which increases the total fair value of the share-based payment arrangement, or is otherwise beneficial  
to the employee as measured at the date of the modification.
Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it has vested on the date of cancellation, and any expense not yet recognised for  
the award is recognised immediately. However, if a new award is substituted for the cancelled award, and designated as the replacement award  
on the date that it is granted, the cancelled and the new awards are treated as if they were a modification of the original award, as described in the 
previous paragraph.
SHARE CAPITAL
SHARE CAPITAL
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. External costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares, other than on a business combination,  
are shown as a deduction from the proceeds in equity. Any excess of the fair value of consideration received over the par value of shares issued  
is recognised as additional paid-in capital.
TREASURY SHARES
Where BGEO or its subsidiaries purchase BGEO’s shares, the consideration paid, including any attributable transaction costs, net of income taxes,  
is deducted from total equity as treasury shares until they are cancelled or reissued. Where such shares are subsequently sold or reissued, any 
consideration received is included in equity. Treasury shares are stated at par value, with adjustment of premiums against additional paid-in capital.
DIVIDENDS
Dividends are recognised as a liability and deducted from equity at the reporting date only if they are declared before or on the reporting date. 
Dividends are disclosed when they are proposed before the reporting date or proposed or declared after the reporting date but before the 
consolidated financial statements are authorised for issue. All expenses associated with dividend distribution are added to the dividend amount  
and recorded directly through equity.
CONTINGENCIES
Contingent liabilities are not recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position but are disclosed unless the possibility of any outflow  
in settlement is remote. A contingent asset is not recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position but disclosed when an inflow of 
economic benefits is probable.
INCOME AND EXPENSE RECOGNITION
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be reliably measured. 
The following specific recognition criteria must also be met before revenue and expense are recognised:
INTEREST AND SIMILAR INCOME AND EXPENSE
For all financial instruments measured at amortised cost and interest bearing securities classified as trading or available-for-sale, interest income or 
expense is recorded at the effective interest rate, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through the 
expected life of the financial instrument or a shorter period, where appropriate, to the net carrying amount of the financial asset or financial liability. 
The calculation takes into account all contractual terms of the financial instrument (for example, prepayment options) and includes any fees or 
incremental costs that are directly attributable to the instrument and that are an integral part of the effective interest rate, but not future credit losses. 
The carrying amount of the financial asset or financial liability is adjusted if the Group revises its estimates of payments or receipts. The adjusted 
carrying amount is calculated based on the original effective interest rate and the change in carrying amount is recorded as interest income or 
expense.
Once the recorded value of a financial asset or a group of similar financial assets has been reduced due to an impairment loss, interest income 
continues to be recognised using the original effective interest rate applied to the new carrying amount.
FEE AND COMMISSION INCOME
The Group earns fee and commission income from a diverse range of services it provides to its customers. Fee and commission income is 
recognised when the Group satisfies a performance obligation. Fee income can be divided into the following categories:
FEE INCOME EARNED FROM SERVICES THAT ARE PROVIDED OVER A CERTAIN PERIOD OF TIME
Fees earned for the provision of services over a period of time are accrued over that period. These fees include commission incomes and asset 
management, custody, package services on bundled products and other management and advisory fees. Loan commitment fees for loans that  
are likely to be drawn down and other credit related fees are deferred (together with any incremental costs) and recognised as an adjustment to  
the effective interest rate on the loan.
CUSTOMER LOYALTY PROGRAMME
Customer loyalty programme points accumulated in the business are treated as deferred revenue and recognised in revenues gradually as they  
are earned. The Group recognises gross revenue earned from customer loyalty programme when the performance obligation is satisfied, i.e. when 
the customer redeems the points or the points expire, where the Group acts as a principal. Conversely, the Group measures its revenue as the net 
amount retained on its account representing the difference between the consideration allocated to the award credits and the amount payable to the 
third party for supplying the awards as soon as the award credits are granted, where the Group acts as an agent. At each reporting date the Group 
estimates a portion of accumulated points that is expected to be utilised by customers based on statistical data. These points are treated as liability 
in the statement of financial position and are only recognised in revenue when points are earned or expired.

INCOME AND EXPENSE RECOGNITION CONTINUED
FEE INCOME FROM PROVIDING TRANSACTION SERVICES
Fees arising from negotiating or participating in the negotiation of a transaction for a third party – such as the arrangement of the acquisition of 
shares or other securities or the purchase or sale of businesses – are recognised upon satisfaction of performance obligation on completion of the 
underlying transaction. Fees or components of fees that are linked to a certain performance are recognised after fulfilling the corresponding criteria.
DIVIDEND INCOME
Dividend revenue is recognised when the Group’s right to receive the payment is established.
INSURANCE PREMIUM INCOME
For the property & casualty and health insurance business, premiums written are recognised at policy inception and earned on a pro rata basis over 
the term of the related policy coverage. Estimates of premiums written as at the reporting date but not yet received are assessed based on estimates 
from underwriting or past experience and are included in premiums earned.
INSURANCE CLAIMS
General insurance claims incurred include all claim losses occurring during the year, whether reported or not, including the related handling costs 
and reduction for the value of salvage and other recoveries and any adjustments to claims outstanding from previous years.
HEALTHCARE REVENUE (DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS)
The Group recognises healthcare revenue when the Group satisfies a performance obligation at an amount that reflects the consideration to  
which the Group expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring the goods and services to a customer. Healthcare revenue is recognised net of 
corrections and rebates that occasionally arise as a result of reconciliation of detailed bills with counterparties (mostly with the state), to recognise 
revenue to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognised will not occur when the 
uncertainty associated with the corrections and rebates is subsequently resolved. Healthcare revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration 
received or receivable for providing inpatient and outpatient services and includes the following components:
• Healthcare revenue from insurance companies – The Group recognises revenue from the individuals who are insured by various insurance 
companies based on the completion of the actual medical service and agreed-upon terms between the counterparties.
• Healthcare revenue from state – The Group recognises the revenue from the individuals who are insured under the state programmes based  
on the completion of the actual medical service and the agreed-upon terms between the counterparties.
• Healthcare revenue from out-of-pocket and other – The Group recognises the revenue from non-insured individuals based on the completion of 
the actual medical service and approved prices by the Group. Sales are usually in cash or by credit card. Other revenue from medical services 
includes revenue from municipalities and other hospitals, with which the Group has contractual relationships. Sales of services are recognised  
in the accounting period in which the services are rendered calculated according to contractual tariffs.
Revenue from pharma comprises the fair value of the consideration received or receivable both from wholesale and retail sales and drug exchange 
transactions. The pharma business sometimes receives drugs in exchange for sale of drugs from other wholesalers. The consideration received is 
assessed with reference to its actual wholesale price which is deemed fair value of consideration received.
UTILITY AND ENERGY REVENUE
The Group recognises revenue from utility when the Group satisfies a performance obligation at an amount that reflects the consideration to which 
the Group expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring the goods and services to a customer. The following specific recognition criteria must 
be met before revenue is recognised:
• Revenue from water supply – includes amounts billed to customers based on the metered or estimated usage of water by legal entities and by 
application of the relevant tariff for services set per unit of water supplied. Meters are read on a cyclical basis and the Group recognises revenue 
for unbilled amounts based on estimated usage from the last billing through to the end of the financial year.
• Revenue from water supply to population – includes amounts billed on a monthly basis to residential customers (with meter) based on the 
metered usage of water and by application of the relevant tariff for services set per unit of water supplied or based on the number of individuals 
person registered by respective city municipality per each residential address (without meter) by application of the relevant tariff set per capita per 
month for the general population.
• Revenue from connection and water meter installation – includes non-refundable amounts billed upfront for connecting customers to the water 
system and providing them with access to the water supply. Revenue from connection and water meter installation is recognised over the time  
in line with the satisfaction of performance obligation over the life of water meters.
Revenue from electric power sales is recognised on the basis of metered electric power transferred.
GROSS REAL ESTATE PROFIT
Gross real estate profit comprises revenue from sale of developed real estate property and revaluation gains on such developed properties.
Revenue from sale of developed real estate property is recognised over the time based on the progress towards complete satisfaction of a performance 
obligation using input method (proportion of costs incurred up to date to total expected project cost). Percentage of completion calculated based  
on total costs of the building is applied to apartment selling price to recognise revenue from apartment sales. Payment arrangements of the sale of 
developed real estate property usually include advance payment of part of the transaction price and progress payments by the customer during the 
construction, such payments are recognised as deferred income. Significant financing component is usually immaterial.
GROSS OTHER INVESTMENT PROFIT
Gross other investment profit comprises revenue from sale of other finished goods and revaluation of other investment properties that were not 
developed by the Group. 154 Annual Report 2017 BGEO Group PLC
3. SUMMARY OF SELECTED SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
INCOME AND EXPENSE RECOGNITION CONTINUED
Revenue from the sale of other finished goods is recognised the Group satisfies the performance obligation, i.e. when the control of the goods has 
passed to the buyer, usually on delivery of the goods. For finished goods sold on a consignment basis, revenue is recognised when the goods are 
transferred to the end-customer or on expiration of a specified period. Revenue recognised in connection with the sale of finished goods reflects an 
adjustment for the consideration payable to the customer (cash amounts that the Group pays, or expects to pay, to a customer).
EBITDA
The Group separately presents EBITDA on the face of income statement for the Investment Business. EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, 
taxes, depreciation and amortisation, as well as cost of credit risk and net non-recurring items for the Investment Business.
NON-RECURRING ITEMS
The Group separately classifies and discloses those income and expenses that are non-recurring by nature. The Group defines non-recurring income 
or expense as an income or expense triggered by or originated from an economic, business or financial event that is not inherent to the regular and 
ordinary business course of the Group and is caused by uncertain or unpredictable external factors that cannot be reasonably expected to occur in 
the future and, thus, they should not be taken into account when making projections of future results.
FUNCTIONAL, REPORTING CURRENCIES AND FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION
The consolidated financial statements are presented in Georgian Lari, which is the Group’s presentation currency. BGEO’s and the Bank’s functional 
currency is Georgian Lari. Each entity in the Group determines its own functional currency and items included in the financial statements of each 
entity are measured using that functional currency. Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded in the functional currency, converted  
at the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated into 
functional currency at the functional currency rate of exchange ruling at the reporting date. Gains and losses resulting from the translation of foreign 
currency transactions are recognised in the consolidated income statement as gains less losses from foreign currencies – translation differences. 
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates as at the dates of the 
initial transactions. Non-monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair 
value was determined. When a gain or loss on a non-monetary item is recognised in other comprehensive income, any exchange component of that 
gain or loss is recognised in other comprehensive income. Conversely, when a gain or loss on a non-monetary item is recognised in profit or loss, 
any exchange component of that gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss.
Differences between the contractual exchange rate of a certain transaction and the NBG exchange rate on the date of the transaction are included  
in gains less losses from foreign currencies (dealing). The official NBG exchange rates at 31 December 2017, 31 December 2016 and 31 December 
2015 were:
GEL to GBP GEL to USD GEL to EUR Lari to BYN
31 December 2017 3.5005 2.5922 3.1044 1.3083
31 December 2016 3.2579 2.6468 2.7940 1.3532
31 December 2015 3.5492 2.3949 2.6169 1.2904
As at the reporting date, the assets and liabilities of the entities whose functional currency is different from the presentation currency of the Group are 
translated into Georgian Lari at the rate of exchange ruling at the reporting date and, their income statements are translated at the weighted average 
exchange rates for the year. The exchange differences arising on the translation are taken to other comprehensive income. On disposal of a subsidiary 
or an associate whose functional currency is different from the presentation currency of the Group, the deferred cumulative amount recognised in 
other comprehensive income relating to that particular entity is recognised in the consolidated income statement.
Any goodwill arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation and any fair value adjustments to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities arising 
on the acquisition are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign operations and translated at the rate at the reporting date.
ADOPTION OF NEW OR REVISED STANDARDS AND INTERPRETATIONS AND VOLUNTARY CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The nature and the effect of these changes are disclosed below.
IFRS 15 REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS
In May 2014, the IASB issued IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers, effective for the periods beginning on 1 January 2018 with early 
adoption permitted. IFRS 15 defines principles for recognising revenue and is applicable to all contracts with customers. However, interest and fee 
income integral to financial instruments and leases continue to fall outside the scope of IFRS 15 and are regulated by the other applicable standards. 
Under IFRS 15, revenue is recognised at an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring 
goods or services to a customer. The standard also specifies a comprehensive set of disclosure requirements regarding the nature, extent and timing as 
well as any uncertainty of revenue and corresponding cash flows with customers. IFRS 15 can be adopted using either a full retrospective or a modified 
retrospective approach.
The Group early adopted the new revenue recognition standard effective from 1 January 2017 using the modified retrospective approach. The 
impact of early adoption was GEL 29,050 decrease to retained earnings, with a corresponding increase of other liabilities, inventories, income tax 
liabilities and accounts receivables and other loans.

The Group’s revenue streams affected by transition to IFRS 15 included fee and commission income from credit card transaction, fee and commission 
income under certain transactions involving loyalty programme, real estate revenue and connection fees from utility services. For these revenue 
streams, part of the revenue was deferred under IFRS 15 requirements until satisfaction of the respective performance obligations, which are expected 
over the anticipated term of credit cards issued, settlement or expiration of bonus points under loyalty programme, residential construction completion

Accruals and deferred income 89,052 85,568
Accounts receivable and other loans* (i) 116,669 103,326

(i) Accounts receivable have increased as the Group’s beverage business launched its first mainstream beer production in June 2017 and accelerated its expansion into  
all of its three main segments.
Accounts receivable are recognised when the right to consideration becomes unconditional. Deferred revenue is recognised as revenue as we 
perform under the contract.
The Group does not adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of a significant financing component if the Group expects, at 
contract inception, that the period between when the Group transfers a promised good or service to a customer and when the customer pays  
for that good or service will be one year or less.
The Group recognised GEL 56,804 revenue in the current reporting period that relates to carried-forward contract liabilities and is included in the 
deferred income.
Disaggregation of revenue is presented in the following Notes: net fee and commission income (Note 23), Gross real estate profit (Note 25), Gross 
utility profit (Note 26) and Gross other investment profit (Note 27).

The Group applies the practical expedient in paragraph 121 of IFRS 15 and does not disclose information about remaining performance obligations 
that have original expected durations of one year or less.
AMENDMENTS TO IAS 7 STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS: DISCLOSURE INITIATIVE
The amendments require entities to provide disclosure of changes in their liabilities arising from financing activities, including both changes arising 
from cash flows and non-cash changes (such as foreign exchange gains or losses). The Group has provided the information for the current period  
in Note 18.
AMENDMENTS TO IAS 12 INCOME TAXES: RECOGNITION OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS FOR UNREALISED LOSSES
The amendments clarify that an entity needs to consider whether tax law restricts the sources of taxable profits against which it may make deductions 
on the reversal of deductible temporary difference related to unrealised losses. Furthermore, the amendments provide guidance on how an entity should 
determine future taxable profits and explain the circumstances in which taxable profit may include the recovery of some assets for more than their 
carrying amount. The Group evaluated the impact and concluded that the amendment has no effect on the Group’s financial position and performance.
AMENDMENTS TO IFRS 12 DISCLOSURE OF INTERESTS IN OTHER ENTITIES: CLARIFICATION OF THE SCOPE OF DISCLOSURE 
REQUIREMENTS
The amendments clarify that certain disclosure requirements in IFRS 12 apply to an entity’s interest in a subsidiary, a joint venture or an associate  
(or a portion of its interest in a joint venture or an associate) that is classified as held for sale or included in a disposal group. These amendments did 
not affect Group’s consolidated financial statements.
IAS 16 PROPERTY , PLANT AND EQUIPMENT
In 2017, the Group changed its accounting policy with respect to office buildings and service centres. The Group now applies the cost model,  
where assets are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment. Prior to this change in policy, the Group applied 
the revaluation model, where office buildings and service centres were carried at the fair value at the date of the revaluation less any subsequent 
accumulated depreciation and subsequent accumulated impairment losses. The Group believes that cost model provides more reliable and more 
meaningful presentation for investors because (1) it enhances comparability for the investors as the application of the cost model is a market practice 
across the banking industry and (2) it more closely aligns the accounting with the business model around these asset categories.
The cost model has been applied by restating each of the affected consolidated financial statement line items for the prior periods, as follows:

The change in accounting policy of office buildings and service centres did not have a material impact on the Group’s consolidated income 
statement for the years ended 31 December 2016 and 2015.
CHANGE IN SEGMENT REPORTING
At 31 December 2017 and in light of the proposed demerger (refer to Note 1 for detail), the Group changed the composition and presentation of  
its reportable segments. In line with IFRS 8 requirements, the change was applied retrospectively for comparable periods. The change primarily 
related to the presentation of JSC Insurance Company Aldagi, the Group’s property and casualty insurance business, which was reclassified from 
the banking business to the investment business segment. The Group believes that the revised composition and presentation of its reportable 
segments provides more relevant information to the financial statement users as it better aligns financial reporting with management’s views of 
operations within the Group and decision-making about resource allocations.
RECLASSIFICATIONS
As at 31 December 2017 the Group changed the composition of its reportable segments and corresponding reclassifications have also been made 
to the consolidated income statement without any impact on total balances on the consolidated statement of financial position.
The following reclassifications were made to year ended 31 December 2016 and 31 December 2015 consolidated income statement to conform to 
the year ended 31 December 2017 presentation requirements. Management believes that current period presentation provides a better view of the 
consolidated income statement of the Group:

3. SUMMARY OF SELECTED SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
STANDARDS ISSUED BUT NOT YET EFFECTIVE
Up to the date of approval of the consolidated financial statements, certain new standards, interpretations and amendments to existing standards 
have been published that are not yet effective for the current reporting period and which the Group has not early adopted. Such standards that are 
expected to have an impact on the Group, or the impacts of which are currently being assessed, are as follows:
IFRS 9 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
INTRODUCTION
In July 2014, the IASB issued the final version of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments that replaces IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and 
Measurement and all previous versions of IFRS 9 for annual periods on or after 1 January 2018, with early application permitted. In 2016, the Group 
set up a multidisciplinary implementation team with members from Risk, Finance and Operations teams and hired an external consultant to initiate 
the implementation of IFRS 9. The project was sponsored by the Chief Risk and Chief Financial Officers who provided regular updates to the Group’s 
Management Board. Implementation consisted of six key phases: the initial assessment and analysis, design, build, testing, parallel running and  
go live. Currently the Group has completed the IFRS 9 implementation programme including building of the new expected credit loss model and 
approving the IFRS 9 accounting policy across the Group.
The Group will adopt the new standard from the effective date by recognising the estimated impact from adoption in opening retained earnings  
on 1 January 2018 and as allowed by IFRS 9 will not restate comparative information. Based on the data as at 31 December 2017, the Group 
estimates that the adoption of IFRS 9 will result in a pre-tax decrease in shareholders’ equity as at 1 January 2018 of approximately GEL 45,144. 
IFRS 9 is not expected to have an impact on regulatory capital and capital adequacy ratios (regulatory capital requirements in Georgia are set by  
the National Bank of Georgia and are applied to the Bank on a standalone basis).
(A) CLASSIFICATION AND MEASUREMENT
From a classification and measurement perspective, the new standard will require all financial assets, except equity instruments and derivatives, to be 
assessed based on a combination of the entity’s business model for managing the assets and the instruments’ contractual cash flow characteristics.  
The IAS 39 measurement categories will be replaced by: Fair value through profit or loss (FVPL), fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) 
with recycling to profit or loss upon disposal for debt instruments, fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) without recycling to profit or 
loss for equity instruments and amortised cost. IFRS 9 will allow entities to continue to irrevocably designate instruments that qualify for amortised cost or 
fair value through OCI instruments as FVPL, if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces a measurement or recognition inconsistency. Equity instruments 
that are not held for trading may be irrevocably designated as FVOCI, with no subsequent reclassification of gains or losses to the income statement.
The accounting treatment for financial liabilities will largely be the same as the requirements of IAS 39, except for the treatment of gains or losses arising 
from an entity’s credit risk relating to liabilities designated at FVPL. Such movements will be presented in OCI with no subsequent reclassification to the 
income statement unless an accounting mismatch in profit or loss would arise.
The Group expects to continue measuring at fair value all financial assets currently held at fair value. Investments in debt securities and equity shares 
currently held as available-for-sale with gains and losses recorded in other comprehensive income will continue to be measured at fair value through 
other comprehensive income. The vast majority of loans are expected to satisfy the SPPI criterion and will continue to be measured at amortised cost.
(B) IMPAIRMENT OF FINANCIAL ASSETS
IFRS 9 requires the Group to record an allowance for expected credit losses (ECL) on all of its debt financial assets at amortised cost or FVOCI,  
as well as loan commitments and financial guarantees. The allowance is based on the ECL associated with the probability of default in the next 12 
months unless there has been a significant increase in credit risk since origination, in which case the allowance is based on the ECL over the life of 
the asset. If the financial asset meets the definition of purchased or originated credit impaired, the allowance is based on the change in the lifetime 
ECL. The Group has determined that the allowance for impairment will increase by GEL 31,197.
The Group will apply the simplified approach for trade and other receivables and record lifetime expected losses on all trade and other receivables. 
The Group has determined that, due to the unsecured nature of its trade and other receivables, the loss allowance will increase by GEL 13,627 of 
which GEL 6,962 relates to assets of disposal group held for sale.
In summary, the pre-tax impact of IFRS 9 adoption is expected to be as follows:
Pre-tax impact on equity (increase/(decrease)) as of 31 December 2017:

Cash and cash equivalents (B) (80)

3. SUMMARY OF SELECTED SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
STANDARDS ISSUED BUT NOT YET EFFECTIVE CONTINUED
IFRS 2 CLASSIFICATION AND MEASUREMENT OF SHARE-BASED PAYMENT TRANSACTIONS — AMENDMENTS TO IFRS 2
The IASB issued amendments to IFRS 2 Share-based Payments that address three main areas: the effects of vesting conditions on the 
measurement of a cash-settled share-based payment transaction; the classification of a share-based payment transaction with net settlement 
features for withholding tax obligations; and accounting where a modification to the terms and conditions of a share-based payment transaction 
changes its classification from cash-settled to equity-settled. On adoption, entities are required to apply the amendments without restating prior 
periods, but retrospective application is permitted if elected for all three amendments and other criteria are met. The amendments are effective  
for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018, with early application permitted. The Group is currently evaluating the impact.
IFRS 16 LEASES
IFRS 16 was issued in January 2016 and it replaces IAS 17 Leases, IFRIC 4 Determining whether an Arrangement contains a Lease, SIC-15 Operating 
Leases-Incentives and SIC-27 Evaluating the Substance of Transactions Involving the Legal Form of a Lease. IFRS 16 sets out the principles for the 
recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases and requires lessees to account for all leases under a single on-balance sheet model 
similar to the accounting for finance leases under IAS 17. The standard includes two recognition exemptions for lessees – leases of ’low-value’ assets 
and short-term leases (i.e., leases with a lease term of 12 months or less). At the commencement date of a lease, a lessee will recognise a liability to 
make lease payments (i.e., the lease liability) and an asset representing the right to use the underlying asset during the lease term (i.e. the right-of-use 
asset). Lessees will be required to separately recognise the interest expense on the lease liability and the depreciation expense on the right-of-use asset.
Lessees will also be required to re-measure the lease liability upon the occurrence of certain events (e.g. a change in the lease term, a change in 
future lease payments resulting from a change in an index or rate used to determine those payments). The lessee will generally recognise the amount 
of the re-measurement of the lease liability as an adjustment to the right-of-use asset.
Lessor accounting under IFRS 16 is substantially unchanged from today’s accounting under IAS 17. Lessors will continue to classify all leases using 
the same classification principle as in IAS 17 and distinguish between two types of leases: operating and finance leases.
IFRS 16 also requires lessees and lessors to make more extensive disclosures than under IAS 17.
IFRS 16 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019. Early application is permitted, but not before an entity applies IFRS 15. 
A lessee can choose to apply the standard using either a full retrospective or a modified retrospective approach. The standard’s transition provisions 
permit certain reliefs. In 2018, the Group will continue to assess the potential effect of IFRS 16 on its consolidated financial statements.
TRANSFERS OF INVESTMENT PROPERTY — AMENDMENTS TO IAS 40
The amendments clarify when an entity should transfer property, including property under construction or development into, or out of, investment 
property. The amendments state that a change in use occurs when the property meets, or ceases to meet, the definition of investment property and 
there is evidence of the change in use. A mere change in management’s intentions for the use of a property does not provide evidence of a change 
in use. Entities should apply the amendments prospectively to changes in use that occur on or after the beginning of the annual reporting period in 
which the entity first applies the amendments. An entity should reassess the classification of property held at that date and, if applicable, reclassify 
property to reflect the conditions that exist at that date. Retrospective application in accordance with IAS 8 is only permitted if it is possible without 
the use of hindsight. Amendment is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. The Group is currently assessing the impact.
IFRS 17 INSURANCE CONTRACTS
In May 2017, the IASB issued IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts, a new accounting standard for insurance contracts covering recognition and measurement, 
presentation and disclosure. Once effective, it will replace IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts that was issued in 2005. In contrast to the requirements in IFRS 
4, IFRS 17 provides a comprehensive model for insurance contracts covering all relevant accounting aspects. IFRS 17 is effective for reporting periods 
starting on or after 1 January 2021, with comparative figures required. Early application is permitted using either a full retrospective or a modified 
retrospective approach, provided the entity also applies IFRS 9 and IFRS 15 on or before the date it first applies IFRS 17. The Group is currently 
evaluating the impact.

3. SUMMARY OF SELECTED SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
ANNUAL IMPROVEMENTS 2014-2016 CYCLE
IAS 28 INVESTMENTS IN ASSOCIATES AND JOINT VENTURES – CLARIFICATION THAT MEASURING INVESTEES AT FAIR VALUE 
THROUGH PROFIT OR LOSS IS AN INVESTMENT-BY-INVESTMENT CHOICE
The amendments clarify that:
• An entity that is a venture capital organisation, or other qualifying entity, may elect, at initial recognition on an investment-by-investment basis,  
to measure its investments in associates and joint ventures at fair value through profit or loss.
• If an entity, that is not itself an investment entity, has an interest in an associate or joint venture that is an investment entity, the entity may,  
when applying the equity method, elect to retain the fair value measurement applied by that investment entity associate or joint venture to the 
investment entity associate’s or joint venture’s interests in subsidiaries. This election is made separately for each investment entity associate or 
joint venture, at the later of the date on which: (a) the investment entity associate or joint venture is initially recognised; (b) the associate or joint 
venture becomes an investment entity; and (c) the investment entity associate or joint venture first becomes a parent.
The amendments should be applied retrospectively and are effective from 1 January 2018. The Group does not expect a material effect from 
application of these amendments.
IFRIC INTERPRETATION 22 FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS AND ADVANCE CONSIDERATION
The Interpretation clarifies that, in determining the spot exchange rate to use on initial recognition of the related asset, expense or income (or part  
of it) on the derecognition of a non-monetary asset or non-monetary liability relating to advance consideration, the date of the transaction is the date 
on which an entity initially recognises the non-monetary asset or non-monetary liability arising from the advance consideration. The Interpretation is 
effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. Since the Group’s current practice is in line with the Interpretation, the Group does 
not expect any effect on its consolidated financial statements.
IFRIC INTERPRETATION 23 UNCERTAINTY OVER INCOME TAX TREATMENT
The Interpretation addresses the accounting for income taxes when tax treatments involve uncertainty that affects the application of IAS 12 and does 
not apply to taxes or levies outside the scope of IAS 12, nor does it specifically include requirements relating to interest and penalties associated with 
uncertain tax treatments.
An entity must determine whether to consider each uncertain tax treatment separately or together with one or more other uncertain tax treatments. 
The approach that better predicts the resolution of the uncertainty should be followed. The Interpretation also addresses the assumptions an entity 
makes about the examination of tax treatments by taxation authorities, as well as how it considers changes in facts and circumstances.
The interpretation is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019, but certain transition reliefs are available. The Group 
is currently assessing the impact.
4. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES
In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, the Board of Directors and management use their judgement and make estimates in 
determining the amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements. The most significant judgements and estimates are as follows:
FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
Where the fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded in the consolidated statement of financial position cannot be derived from 
active markets, they are determined using a variety of valuation techniques that include the use of mathematical models. The input to these models is 
taken from observable markets where possible, but where this is not feasible, a degree of judgement is required in establishing fair values (Note 32).
MEASUREMENT OF FAIR VALUE OF INVESTMENT PROPERTIES AND PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
The fair value of investment properties and infrastructure assets included in property and equipment is determined by independent professionally 
qualified appraisers. Fair value is determined using a combination of the internal capitalisation method (also known as discounted future cash flow 
method) and the sales comparison method.
The Group performs valuation of its investment properties and infrastructure assets included in property and equipment with a sufficient regularity  
to ensure that the carrying amount does not differ materially from that which would be determined using fair value at the end of the reporting period. 
Results of this valuation are presented in Notes 12 and 13, while valuation inputs and techniques are presented in Note 32. The Group’s properties 
are specialised in nature and spread across different parts of the country. While the secondary market in Georgia provides adequate market 
information for fair value measurements for small and medium-sized properties, valuation of large and unique properties involves application of 
various observable and unobservable inputs to determine adjustments to the available comparable sale prices. These estimates and assumptions 
are based on the best available information, however, actual results could be different. 162 Annual Report 2017 BGEO Group PLC
4. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES CONTINUED
ALLOWANCE FOR IMPAIRMENT OF LOANS AND FINANCE LEASE RECEIVABLES
The Group regularly reviews its loans and finance lease receivables to assess impairment. The Group uses its judgement to estimate the amount  
of any impairment loss in cases where a borrower is in financial difficulties and there are few available sources of historical data relating to similar 
borrowers. Similarly, the Group estimates changes in future cash flows based on the observable data indicating that there has been an adverse 
change in the payment status of borrowers in a group, or national or local economic conditions that correlate with defaults on assets in the group. 
Management uses estimates based on historical loss experience for assets with credit risk characteristics and objective evidence of impairment 
similar to those in the group of loans and finance lease receivables. The Group uses its judgement to adjust observable data for a group of loans  
and finance lease receivables to reflect current circumstances.
The Group considers the fair value of collateral when estimating the amount of impairment loss for collateralised loans and finance lease receivables. 
Management monitors market value of collateral on a regular basis. Management uses its expert judgement or independent opinion to adjust the fair 
value to reflect current conditions. The amount and type of collateral required depends on the assessment of credit risk of the counterparty.
Information about allowance for impairment of loans and finance lease receivables is presented in Note 11.
5. BUSINESS COMBINATIONS

JSC ABC PHARMACY
On 6 January 2017 JSC GEPHA (“GEPHA”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of GHG, classified as a disposal group held for sale, acquired 67% of LTD

1. The fair value of the receivables from sales of pharmaceuticals amounted to GEL 8,050. The gross amount of receivables is GEL 9,452. GEL 1,402 of the receivables has 
been impaired.
2. Consideration for the acquisition was GEL 73,819, of which, a) GEL 10,347 was fair value of 33% equity shares of JSC GPC transferred to former shareholders of ABC,  
b) GEL 32,501 was cash payment and c) GEL 30,971 holdback amount at fair value.
3. As part of the acquisition, the selling shareholders have a put option to sell their 33% share in the combined pharma business to GHG. The Group recognised a GEL 55 million 
liability to purchase the remaining 33% share and the non-controlling interest arising from the consolidated pharma business of GHG was fully de-recognised. The difference 
between the redemption liability and non-controlling interest was recognised in equity through other reserves. The redemption liability is carried at amortised cost and interest  
is unwound on each reporting date.
The net cash outflow on acquisition was as follows:
31 December 
2017
Cash paid (32,501)
Cash acquired with the subsidiary 4,184
NET CASH OUTFLOW (28,317)
The Group decided to increase its presence and investment in the pharmaceuticals segment through the acquisition of ABC. Management considers 
that the deal will have a positive impact on the value of the Group.
Since the acquisition, ABC has recorded GEL 139,812 and GEL 15,354 of revenue and profit, respectively. As the acquisition took place on 6 January 
2017, it would not have material effect on the Group’s profit if the combination had taken place at the beginning of the period. Since GHG is classified 
as a disposal group held for sale the acquisition did not have an impact on the Group’s revenues from continued operations.
The primary factor that contributed to the cost of the business combination that resulted in the recognition of goodwill on acquisition is the positive 
synergy that is expected to be brought into the Group’s operations.

6. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF DISPOSAL GROUP HELD FOR SALE
ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF DISPOSAL GROUP HELD FOR SALE AND DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
Given the expectation, in line with Georgia Capital’s strategy, that it is highly probable the Group will own less than a 50% stake in its healthcare 
business, consisting of a Georgia Healthcare Group (“GHG”), at the end 2018, the Group classified GHG as a “disposal group held for sale” and  
its results of operations are reported under “discontinued operations” line as a single amount in the consolidated income statement. The Group 
determined that GHG met the criteria to be classified as held for sale as at 31 December 2017 due to the following reasons:
• GHG was available for immediate sale and could be sold to the buyer in its current condition
• The actions to complete the sale were initiated and expected to be completed within one year from the date of initial classification
• Management was committed to the plan to sell
At 31 December 2017, GHG was classified as a disposal group held for sale and as a discontinued operation. 166 Annual Report 2017 BGEO Group PLC

Interest income accrued on loans, for which individual impairment allowances have been recognised at 31 December 2017 comprised  
GEL 20,510 (2016: GEL 31,433; 2015: GEL 22,234).
COLLATERAL AND OTHER CREDIT ENHANCEMENTS
The amount and type of collateral required depend on an assessment of the credit risk of the counterparty. Guidelines are implemented regarding 
the acceptability of types of collateral and valuation parameters.
The main types of collateral obtained are as follows:
• For commercial lending, charges over real estate properties, equipment and machinery, corporate shares, inventory, trade receivables and third 
party corporate guarantees.
• For retail lending, mortgages over residential properties, cars, gold and jewellery and third party corporate guarantees.
Management requests additional collateral in accordance with the underlying agreement and monitors the market value of collateral obtained during 
its review of the adequacy of the allowance for loan impairment.
It is the Group’s policy to dispose of repossessed properties in an orderly fashion or to hold them for capital appreciation or earning rentals, as 
appropriate in each case. The proceeds are used to reduce or repay the outstanding claim. In general, the Group does not occupy repossessed 
properties for business use.
Without taking into account the discounted value of collateral, the allowance for loan impairment would be GEL 253,818 higher as at 31 December 
2017 (2016: GEL 322,880 higher; 2015: GEL 176,759 higher).
CONCENTRATION OF LOANS TO CUSTOMERS
As at 31 December 2017, the concentration of loans granted by the Group to the ten largest third party borrowers comprised GEL 857,582 
accounting for 11% of the gross loan portfolio of the Group (2016: GEL 815,363 and 12% respectively; 2015: GEL 708,839 and 13% respectively). 
An allowance of GEL 43,478 (2016: GEL 20,123; 2015: GEL 2,484) was established against these loans.
As at 31 December 2017, the concentration of loans granted by the Group to the ten largest third party group of borrowers comprised  
GEL 1,072,450 accounting for 14% of the gross loan portfolio of the Group (2016: GEL 1,242,944 and 18% respectively; 2015: GEL 1,094,979  
and 20% respectively). An allowance of GEL 75,628 (2016: GEL 51,831; 2015: GEL 41,413) was established against these loans.

IMPAIRMENT TEST FOR GOODWILL
Goodwill acquired through business combinations with indefinite lives has been allocated to four individual cash-generating units, for impairment 
testing: Corporate banking, Retail banking, Property & Casualty Insurance and Teliani.
The carrying amount of goodwill allocated to each of the cash-generating units (“CGU”) is as follows:
2017 2016 2015
Retail banking 23,386 23,488 23,488
P&C Insurance 15,454 16,139 16,139
Corporate banking 9,965 9,965 9,965
Teliani 6,471 3,439 3,439
Pharmacy – 29,025 –
Healthcare – 21,468 16,491
Health Insurance – 3,462 3,462
TOTAL 55,276 106,986 72,984
KEY ASSUMPTIONS USED IN VALUE-IN-USE CALCULATIONS
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs have been determined based on a value-in-use calculation, using cash flow projections based on financial 
budgets approved by senior management covering a one to three-year period. Discount rates were not adjusted for either a constant or a declining 
growth rate beyond the three-year periods covered in financial budgets. For the purposes of the impairment test, a 3% permanent growth rate has 
been assumed when assessing the future operating cash flows of the CGU.
The following discount rates were used by the Group for Corporate banking and Retail banking:
Corporate banking Retail banking
2017 2016 2015 2017 2016 2015
Discount rate 4.5% 5.3% 5.8% 6.1% 6.9% 6.7%
The following rates were used by the Group for P&C Insurance and Teliani:
P&C Insurance Teliani
2017 2016 2015 2017 2016 2015
Discount rate 9.0% 14.5% 10.4% 12.8% 14.9% 9.4%
DISCOUNT RATES
Discount rates reflect management’s estimate of return required in each business. This is the benchmark used by management to assess operating 
performance and to evaluate future investment proposals. Discount rates are calculated by using pre-tax weighted average cost of capital (“WACC”).
For the Healthcare CGU, the following additional assumptions were made over the first three-year period of the business plan:
• Further synergies from healthcare businesses will increase cost efficiency and further improve operating leverage.
• Growth of other healthcare business lines through an increased market demand and economic growth.
For the Retail and Corporate banking CGUs the following additional assumptions were made:
• Stable, business as usual growth of loans and deposits.
• No material changes in cost/income structure or ratio.
• Stable, business as usual growth of trade finance and other documentary businesses.
• Further expansion of the Express banking businesses bringing more stable margins to Retail banking.
SENSITIVITY TO CHANGES IN ASSUMPTIONS
Management believes that reasonable possible changes to key assumptions used to determine the recoverable amount for each CGU will not result 
in an impairment of goodwill. The excess of value in use over carrying value is determined by reference to the net book value as at 31 December 
2017. Possible change was taken as +/-1% in discount rate and growth rate.

15. TAXATION
The corporate income tax credit (expense) comprises:
2017 2016 2015
Current income expense (42,396) (25,034) (38,959)
Deferred income tax credit (expense) 9,669 63,690 (9,449)
INCOME TAX (EXPENSE) CREDIT (32,727) 38,656 (48,408)
Income tax expense attributable to continuing operations (32,340) 17,500 (48,417)
Income tax expense attributable to a discontinued operation (Note 6) (387) 21,156 9
Deferred income tax credit (expense) in other comprehensive income (loss) (1,328) (2,274) 283
Deferred tax related to items charged or credited to other comprehensive income during the years ended 31 December 2017, 2016 and 2015 was 
as follows:
2017 2016 2015
Currency translation differences (576) (2,253) 283
Net losses on investment securities available-for-sale 27 (21) –
Revaluation of buildings (779) – –
INCOME TAX (EXPENSE) CREDIT IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (1,328) (2,274) 283
The income tax rate applicable to most of the Group’s income is the income tax rate applicable to subsidiaries’ income which ranges from 15%  
to 27% (2016: from 15% to 27%; 2015: from 15% to 25%).
In May 2016, the Parliament of Georgia approved a change in the current corporate taxation model, with changes applicable from 1 January 2017 
for all entities apart from certain financial institutions, including banks and insurance businesses (changes are applicable to financial institutions, 
including banks and insurance businesses from 1 January 2019). The changed model implies a zero corporate tax rate on retained earnings and  
a 15% corporate tax rate on distributed earnings, compared to the previous model of 15% tax rate charged to the company’s profit before tax, 
regardless of the retention or distribution status.
The effective income tax rate differs from the statutory income tax rates. As at 31 December 2017, 31 December 2016 and 31 December 2015  
a reconciliation of the income tax expense based on statutory rates with the actual expense is as follows:
2017 2016 2015
Profit before income tax expense from continuing operations 435,846 352,787 332,591
Net gain before income tax benefit from discontinued operations (Note 6) 60,330 37,133 26,762
PROFIT BEFORE INCOME TAX EXPENSE 496,176 389,920 359,353
Average tax rate 15% 15% 15%
THEORETICAL INCOME TAX EXPENSE AT AVERAGE TAX RATE (74,426) (58,488) (53,903)
Non-taxable income 38,223 19,711 3,744
Correction of prior year declarations 5,940 2,494 1,472
Non-deductible expenses (1,220) (1,645) (487)
Tax at the domestic rates applicable to profits in each country (1,244) (143) (262)
Effects from changes in tax legislation – 76,964 –
Other – (237) 1,028
INCOME TAX (EXPENSE) BENEFIT (32,727) 38,656 (48,408)
Applicable taxes in Georgia and Belarus include corporate income tax (profit tax), individuals’ withholding taxes, property tax and value added tax, 
among others. However, regulations are often unclear or non-existent and few precedents have been established. This creates tax risks in Georgia 
and Belarus, substantially more significant than typically found in countries with more developed tax systems. Management believes that the Group 
is in substantial compliance with the tax laws affecting its operations. However, the risk remains that relevant authorities could take differing positions 
with regard to interpretative issues.
As at 31 December 2017, 31 December 2016 and 31 December 2015 income tax assets and liabilities consist of the following:
2017 2016 2015

31. RISK MANAGEMENT
INTRODUCTION
Risk is inherent to the Group’s activities but it is managed through a process of ongoing identification, measurement and monitoring, subject to risk 
limits and other controls. This process of risk management is critical to the Group’s continuing profitability and each individual within the Group is 
accountable for the risk exposures relating to his or her responsibilities. The Group is exposed to credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk, the latter 
being subdivided into trading and non-trading risks. It is also subject to operational risks.
The independent risk control process does not include business risks such as changes in the environment, technology and industry. They are 
monitored through the Group’s strategic planning process.
RISK MANAGEMENT STRUCTURE
AUDIT COMMITTEE
The Audit Committee assists the Board in relation to the oversight of the Group’s financial and reporting processes. It monitors the integrity of the 
financial statements and is responsible for governance around both the internal audit function and external auditor, reporting back to the Board. It 
reviews the effectiveness of the policies, procedures and systems in place related to, among other operational risks, compliance, IT and IS (including 
cyber-security) and works closely with the Risk Committee in connection with assessing the effectiveness of the risk management and internal 
control framework.
RISK COMMITTEE
The Risk Committee assists the Board in relation to the oversight of risk. It reviews the Group’s risk appetite in line with strategy, identifies and monitors 
risk exposure and the risk management infrastructure, oversees the implementation of strategy to address risk, and in conjunction with the Audit 
Committee, assesses the strength and effectiveness of the risk management and internal control framework.
MANAGEMENT BOARD
The Management Board has overall responsibility for the Bank’s asset, liability and risk management activities, policies and procedures. In order to 
effectively implement the risk management system, the Management Board delegates individual risk management functions to each of the various 
decision-making and execution bodies within the Bank.
BANK ASSET AND LIABILITY MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE
The Bank’s Asset and Liability Management Committee (ALCO) is the core risk management body that establishes policies and guidelines with 
respect to capital adequacy, market risks and respective limits, funding liquidity risk and respective limits, interest rate and prepayment risks and 
respective limits, money market general terms and credit exposure limits, that designs and implements respective risk management and stress 
testing models in practice and that regularly monitors compliance with the preset risk limits.
INTERNAL AUDIT
The Internal Audit Department is responsible for the annual audit of the Group’s risk management, internal control and corporate governance 
processes, with the aim of reducing the levels of operational and other risks, auditing the Group’s internal control systems and detecting any 
infringements or errors on the part of the Group’s departments and divisions. It examines both the adequacy of and the Group’s compliance with 
those procedures. The Group’s Internal Audit Department discusses the results of all assessments with management, and reports its findings and 
recommendations to the Audit Committee.
RISK MEASUREMENT AND REPORTING SYSTEMS
The Group’s risks are measured using a method which reflects both the expected loss likely to arise in normal circumstances and unexpected 
losses, which are an estimate of the ultimate actual loss based on different forecasting models. The models make use of probabilities derived  
from historical experience, adjusted to reflect the economic environment. The Group runs three different basic scenarios, of which one is Base  
Case (forecast under normal business conditions) and the other two are Troubled and Distressed Scenarios, which are worse and the worst case 
scenarios, respectively, that would arise in the event that extreme events which are unlikely to occur do, in fact, occur.
Monitoring and controlling risks is primarily performed based on limits established by the Group. These limits reflect the business strategy and market 
environment of the Group as well as the level of risk that the Group is willing to accept, with additional emphasis on selected industries. In addition, the 
Group monitors and measures the overall risk bearing capacity in relation to the aggregate risk exposure across all risks types and activities.
Information compiled from all the businesses is examined and processed in order to analyse, control and identify risks early. This information is 
presented and explained to the Management Board, and the Head of each business division. The reports include aggregate credit exposures  
and their limits, exceptions to those limits, liquidity ratios and liquidity limits, market risk ratios and their limits, and changes to the risk profile.  
Senior management assesses the appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses on a monthly basis. The Management Board receives a 
comprehensive Credit Risk report and ALCO report once a month. These reports are designed to provide all the necessary information to assess 
and conclude on the risks of the Group.
For all levels throughout the Group, specifically tailored risk reports are prepared and distributed in order to ensure that all business divisions have 
access to extensive, relevant and up-to-date information.
A daily briefing is given to the Management Board and all other relevant employees of the Group on the utilisation of market limits, proprietary 
investments and liquidity, plus any other risk developments.
RISK MITIGATION
As part of its overall risk management, the Group uses derivatives and other instruments to manage exposures resulting from changes in interest 
rates, foreign currencies, equity risks, credit risks, and exposures arising from forecast transactions. While these are intended for hedging, they do 
not qualify for hedge accounting.
The Group actively uses collateral to reduce its credit risks (see overhead for more detail). 196 Annual Report 2017 BGEO Group PLC
31. RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED
INTRODUCTION CONTINUED
EXCESSIVE RISK CONCENTRATION
Concentrations arise when a number of counterparties are engaged in similar business activities, or activities in the same geographic region, or these 
counterparties represent related parties to each other, or have similar economic features that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations 
to be similarly affected by changes in economic, political or other conditions. Concentrations also involve combined, aggregate exposures of large 
and significant credits compared to the total outstanding balance of the respective financial instrument. Concentrations indicate the relative sensitivity 
of the Group’s performance to developments affecting a particular industry or geographical location.
In order to avoid excessive concentrations of risks, the Group’s policies and procedures include specific guidelines to focus on maintaining a 
diversified portfolio of both financial assets as well as financial liabilities. Identified concentrations of credit risks or liquidity/repayment risks are 
controlled and managed accordingly.
CREDIT RISK
Credit risk is the risk that the Group will incur a loss because its customers, clients or counterparties fail to discharge their contractual obligations. 
The Group manages and controls credit risk by setting limits on the amount of risk it is willing to accept for individual counterparties and for 
geographical, industry, product and currency concentrations, and by monitoring exposures in relation to such limits.
The Group has established a credit quality review process to provide early identification of possible changes in the creditworthiness of counterparties, 
including regular collateral revisions. Counterparty limits are established by the use of a credit risk classification system, which assigns each counterparty 
a risk rating. Risk ratings are subject to regular revision.
The credit quality review process allows the Group to assess the potential loss as a result of the risks to which it is exposed and take corrective action. 
The maximum credit exposure is limited to carrying value of respective instruments and notional amounts of guarantees and commitments provided.
DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
Credit risk arising from derivative financial instruments is, at any time, limited to those with positive fair values, as recorded in the statement of the 
financial position.
CREDIT-RELATED COMMITMENTS RISKS
The Group makes available to its customers guarantees which may require that the Group make payments on their behalf. Such payments are 
collected from customers based on the terms of the letter of credit. They expose the Group to similar risks to loans and these are mitigated  
by the same control processes and policies.
CREDIT QUALITY PER CLASS OF FINANCIAL ASSETS
The credit quality of financial assets is managed by the Group through internal credit ratings. The table below shows the credit quality by class  
of asset for loan-related lines in the statement of financial position, based on the Group’s credit rating system.

It is the Group’s policy to maintain accurate and consistent risk ratings across the credit portfolio. This facilitates focused management of the applicable 
risks and the comparison of credit exposures across all lines of business, geographic regions and products. The rating system is supported by a variety 
of financial analytics to provide the main inputs for the measurement of counterparty risk. All internal risk ratings are tailored to the various categories and 
are derived in accordance with the Group’s rating policy. Attributable risk ratings are assessed and updated regularly.
The credit risk assessment policy for non-past due and individually non-impaired financial assets has been determined by the Group as follows:

See Note 11 for more detailed information with respect to the allowance for impairment of loans to customers and finance lease receivables.
The Group specifically monitors performance of the loans with overdue payments in arrears for more than 90 days. The gross carrying value  
(i.e. carrying value before deducting any allowance for impairment) of such loans comprised GEL 278,284, GEL 293,054 and GEL 166,224  
as at 31 December 2017, 31 December 2016 and 31 December 2015, respectively.

IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT
The main considerations for the loan impairment assessment include whether any payments of principal or interest are overdue by any number  
of days or there are any known difficulties in the cash flows of counterparties, credit rating downgrades, or infringement of the original terms of the 
contract. The Group addresses impairment assessment in two areas: individually assessed allowances and collectively assessed allowances. Loans 
are considered to be individually impaired if they are past due by certain number of days as prescribed per the Group methodology, or history of the 
debt service is deteriorated by a certain percentage, as defined per the Group methodology, or any other defined event of a default is identified. 
Impairment for all such loans is assessed individually, rather than through a collective impairment assessment model of the Group.
INDIVIDUALLY ASSESSED ALLOWANCES
For loan loss allowance determination purposes the Group considers all individually significant loans and classifies them between being individually 
impaired and not impaired. The allowance for those individually significant loans that are determined to be individually impaired is determined through 
individual assessment of the associated credit risk. The allowances for non-significant loans that are determined to be individually impaired are also 
individually assessed. The allowance for losses for individually significant loans that are determined not to be individually impaired is assessed through 
the collective assessment approach described below. Items considered when determining allowance amounts include the sustainability of the 
counterparty’s business plan, its ability to improve performance once a financial difficulty has arisen, projected receipts and the expected dividend 
payout should bankruptcy ensue, the availability of other financial support and the realisable value of collateral, the timing of the expected cash flows 
and past history of the debt service of the borrower. Impairment losses are evaluated at each reporting date, unless unforeseen circumstances require 
more careful attention.
COLLECTIVELY ASSESSED ALLOWANCES
Allowances are assessed collectively for all loans (including but not limited to credit cards, residential mortgages, and unsecured consumer lending, 
commercial lending, etc.), both significant as well as non-significant, where there is not yet objective evidence of individual impairment. Allowances 
are evaluated on each reporting date with each portfolio receiving a separate review.
The collective assessment takes into account the impairment that is likely to be present in the portfolio even though there is not yet objective evidence 
of the impairment in an individual assessment. Impairment losses are estimated by taking into consideration the following information: historical losses 
on the portfolio, current economic conditions, the appropriate delay between the time a loss is likely to have been incurred and the time it will be 
identified as requiring an individually assessed impairment allowance, and expected receipts and recoveries once impaired. Local management is 
responsible for deciding the length of this period which can extend for as long as one year, depending on the product. The impairment allowance is 
then reviewed by credit management to ensure alignment with the Group’s overall policy.
Financial guarantees and letters of credit are assessed and provision is made in a similar manner to loans.

LIQUIDITY RISK AND FUNDING MANAGEMENT
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will be unable to meet its payment obligations when they fall due under normal and stress circumstances.  
To limit this risk, management has arranged diversified funding sources in addition to its core deposit base, manages assets with liquidity in mind, 
and monitors future cash flows and liquidity on a regular basis. This incorporates an assessment of expected cash flows and the availability of high 
grade collateral which could be used to secure additional funding if required.
The Group maintains a portfolio of highly marketable and diverse assets that can be easily liquidated in the event of an unforeseen interruption of 
cash flow. The Group also has committed lines of credit that it can access to meet liquidity needs. In addition, the Group maintains a cash deposit 
(obligatory reserve) with the NBG, the amount of which depends on the level of customer funds attracted.
The liquidity position is assessed and managed by the Group primarily on a standalone Bank basis, based on certain liquidity ratios established by 
the NBG. Minimum NBG requirement for liquidity ratio is 30%, calculated as average liquid assets during the month (as defined by the NBG) divided 
by liabilities for the same month (with certain exceptions established by the NBG). For the years ended 31 December 2017, 31 December 2016 and 
31 December 2015 these ratios were as follows:
2017 2016 2015
Average liquidity ratio 39.8% 43.6% 38.1%
Maximum liquidity ratio 47.0% 62.5% 48.0%
Minimum liquidity ratio 31.3% 34.1% 28.9% 200 Annual Report 2017 BGEO Group PLC
31. RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED
LIQUIDITY RISK AND FUNDING MANAGEMENT CONTINUED
The average liquidity ratio is calculated on a standalone basis for JSC Bank of Georgia as the annual average (arithmetic mean) of daily liquidity 
ratios, computed as the ratio of liquid assets to liabilities determined by the National Bank of Georgia as follows:
Liquid assets comprise cash, cash equivalents and other assets that are immediately convertible into cash. Those assets include investment 
securities issued by the Georgian Government plus Certificates of Deposit issued by NBG and do not include amounts due from credit institutions, 
other than inter-bank deposits, and/or debt securities of Governments and Central Banks of non-OECD countries, amounts in nostro accounts 
which are under lien, impaired inter-bank deposits and amounts on obligatory reserve with NBG that are pledged due to borrowings from NBG.
Liabilities comprise the total balance sheet liabilities, less amounts due to credit institutions that are to be exercised or settled later than six months 
from the reporting date, plus off-balance sheet commitments with residual maturity subsequent to the reporting date of less than six months. 
Off-balance sheet commitments include all commitments except financial guarantees and letters of credit that are fully collateralised by customer 
deposits placed in the Bank, and commitments due to dealing operations with foreign currencies. The maximum and minimum liquidity ratios are 
taken from historical data of the appropriate reporting years.
In addition, on 15 May 2017 NBG issued an Order on Liquidity Coverage Ratio for Commercial Banks, which became effective from 1 September 
2017. Pursuant to that order, banks are required to maintain a liquidity coverage ratio, which is defined as the ratio of high quality liquid assets to  
net cash outflow over the next 30 days. The order requires that, absent a stress-period, the value of the ratio be no lower than 100%. The liquidity 
coverage ratio as at 31 December 2017 was 112.4%. 
The Group also matches the maturity of financial assets and financial liabilities and imposes a maximum limit on negative gaps compared to the 
Bank’s standalone total regulatory capital calculated per NBG regulation. The ratios are assessed and monitored monthly and compared against  
set limits. In the case of deviations, amendment strategies/actions are discussed and approved by ALCO.
The table below summarises the maturity profile of the Group’s financial liabilities based on contractual undiscounted repayment obligations. 
Repayments which are subject to notice are treated as if notice were to be given immediately. However, the Group expects that many customers  
will not request repayment on the earliest date the Bank could be required to pay and the table does not reflect the expected cash flows indicated  
by the Bank’s deposit retention history.

LIQUIDITY RISK AND FUNDING MANAGEMENT CONTINUED
The maturity analysis does not reflect the historical stability of current accounts. Their liquidation has historically taken place over a longer period than 
indicated in the tables above. These balances are included in amounts due in less than three months in the tables above.
Included in client deposits and notes are term deposits of individuals. In accordance with the Georgian legislation, the Bank is obliged to repay such 
deposits upon demand of a depositor (Note 17).
MARKET RISK
Market risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of financial instruments will fluctuate due to changes in market variables such as interest 
rates, foreign exchanges, and equity prices. The Group classifies exposures to market risk into either trading or non-trading portfolios. Trading and 
non-trading positions are managed and monitored using sensitivity analysis.
INTEREST RATE RISK
Interest rate risk arises from the possibility that changes in interest rates will affect future cash flows or the fair values of financial instruments. The 
following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in interest rates, with all other variables held constant, on the Group’s 
consolidated income statement.
The sensitivity of the consolidated income statement is the effect of the assumed changes in interest rates on the net interest income for the  
year, based on the floating rate for non-trading financial assets and financial liabilities held at 31 December 2017. Changes in basis points are 
calculated as standard deviations of daily changes in floating rates over the last month multiplied by respective floating rates. During the years  
ended 31 December 2017, 2016 and 2015 sensitivity analysis did not reveal any significant potential effect on the Group’s equity.

CURRENCY RISK
Currency risk is the risk that the value of a financial instrument will fluctuate due to changes in foreign exchange rates. The Management Board has 
set limits on positions by currency based on the NBG regulations. Positions are monitored daily.
The tables below indicate the currencies to which the Group had significant exposure at 31 December 2017 on its monetary assets and liabilities. 
The analysis calculates the effect of a reasonably possible movement of the currency rate against the Georgian Lari, with all other variables held 
constant on the income statement (due to the fair value of currency sensitive non-trading monetary assets and liabilities). The reasonably possible 
movement of the currency rate against the Georgian Lari is calculated as a standard deviation of daily changes in exchange rates over the 12 
months. A negative amount in the table reflects a potential net reduction in income statement or equity, while a positive amount reflects a net 
potential increase. During the year ended 31 December 2017, year ended 31 December 2016 and year ended 31 December 2015, sensitivity 
analysis did not reveal any significant potential effect on the Group’s equity.

PREPAYMENT RISK
Prepayment risk is the risk that the Group will incur a financial loss because its customers and counterparties repay or request repayment earlier than 
expected, such as fixed rate mortgages when interest rates fall, or other credit facilities, for similar or whatever reasons.
The Group calculates the effect of early repayments by calculating the weighted average rates of early repayments across each loan product 
individually, applying these historical rates to the outstanding carrying amount of respective products as at the reporting date and multiplying by the 
weighted average effective annual interest rates for each product. The model does not make a distinction between different reasons for repayment 
(e.g. relocation, refinancing and renegotiation) and takes into account the effect of any prepayment penalties on the Group’s income.
The estimated effect of prepayment risk on net interest income of the Group for the years ended 31 December 2017, 31 December 2016 and 
31 December 2015 is as follows:
Effect on net 
interest income
2017 (46,527)
2016 (27,487)
2015 (19,341)
OPERATIONAL RISK
Operational risk is the risk of loss arising from systems failure, human error, fraud or external events. When controls fail to perform, operational risks 
can cause damage to reputation, have legal or regulatory implications, or lead to financial loss. The Group cannot expect to eliminate all operational 
risks, but through a control framework and by monitoring and responding to potential risks, the Group is able to manage the risks. Controls include 
effective segregation of duties, access, authorisation and reconciliation procedures, staff education and assessment processes, including the use of 
internal audit.
OPERATING ENVIRONMENT
Most of the Group’s business is concentrated in Georgia. As an emerging market, Georgia does not possess a well-developed business and 
regulatory infrastructure that would generally exist in a more mature market economy. Operations in Georgia may involve risks that are not typically 
associated with those in developed markets (including the risk that the Georgian Lari is not freely convertible outside the country, and undeveloped 
debt and equity markets). However, over the last few years the Georgian Government has made a number of developments that positively affect  
the overall investment climate of the country, specifically implementing the reforms necessary to create banking, judicial, taxation and regulatory 
systems. This includes the adoption of a new body of legislation (including new Tax Code and procedural laws). In the view of the Board, these  
steps contribute to mitigating the risks of doing business in Georgia.
The existing tendency aimed at the overall improvement of the business environment is expected to persist. The future stability of the Georgian economy 
is largely dependent upon these reforms and developments and the effectiveness of economic, financial and monetary measures undertaken by the 
Government. However, the Georgian economy is vulnerable to market downturns and economic slowdowns elsewhere in the world.
INSURANCE RISK
The risk under an insurance contract is the risk that an insured event will occur including the uncertainty of the amount and timing of any resulting 
claim. The principal risk the Group faces under such contracts is that actual claims and benefit payments exceed the carrying amount of insurance 
liabilities. This is influenced by the frequency of claims, severity of claims, actual benefits paid that are greater than originally estimated and subsequent 
development of long-term claims.
The variability of risks is improved by diversification of risk of loss to a large portfolio of insurance contracts as a more diversified portfolio is less likely 
to be affected across the board by change in any subset of the portfolio, as well as unexpected outcomes. The variability of risks is also improved by 
careful selection and implementation of underwriting strategy and guidelines as well as the use of reinsurance arrangements. The Group establishes 
underwriting guidelines and limits, which stipulate who may accept what risks and the applicable limits. These limits are continuously monitored.

The following is a description of the determination of fair value for financial instruments which are recorded at fair value using valuation techniques. 
These incorporate the Group’s estimate of assumptions that a market participant would make when valuing the instruments.
DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
Derivative financial instruments valued using a valuation technique with market observable inputs are mainly interest rate swaps, currency swaps, 
forward foreign exchange contracts and option contracts. The most frequently applied valuation techniques include forward pricing and swap 
models, using present value calculations, as well as standard option pricing models. The models incorporate various inputs including the credit 
quality of counterparties, foreign exchange spot and forward rates, interest rate curves and implied volatilities.
TRADING SECURITIES AND INVESTMENT SECURITIES
Trading securities and a certain part of investment securities are quoted equity and debt securities. Investment securities valued using a valuation 
technique or pricing models consist of unquoted equity and debt securities. These securities are valued using models which sometimes only 
incorporate data observable in the market and at other times use both observable and non-observable data. The non-observable inputs to the 
models include assumptions regarding the future financial performance of the investee, its risk profile, and economic assumptions regarding the 
industry and geographical jurisdiction in which the investee operates.

FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY CONTINUED
In order to determine reasonably possible alternative assumptions the Group adjusted key unobservable model inputs as follows:
For equities, the Group adjusted the price-over-book-value multiple by increasing and decreasing the ratio by 10%, which is considered by the 
Group to be within a range of reasonably possible alternatives based on the price-over-book-value multiples used across peers within the same 
geographic area of the same industry.

The following describes the methodologies and assumptions used to determine fair values for those financial instruments which are not already 
recorded at fair value in the consolidated financial statements.
ASSETS FOR WHICH FAIR VALUE APPROXIMATES CARRYING VALUE
For financial assets and financial liabilities that are liquid or have a short-term maturity (less than three months), it is assumed that the carrying 
amounts approximate to their fair value. This assumption is also applied to demand deposits, savings accounts without a specific maturity and 
variable rate financial instruments.
FIXED RATE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The fair value of fixed rate financial assets and liabilities carried at amortised cost are estimated by comparing market interest rates when they were 
first recognised with current market rates offered for similar financial instruments. The estimated fair value of fixed interest bearing deposits is based 
on discounted cash flows using prevailing money-market interest rates for debts with similar credit risk and maturity.
33. MATURITY ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES
The table below shows an analysis of financial assets and liabilities according to their contractual maturities, except for current accounts as 
described below. See Note 31 “Risk management” for the Group’s contractual undiscounted repayment obligations.

The Group’s capability to discharge its liabilities relies on its ability to realise equivalent assets within the same period of time. In the Georgian 
marketplace, where most of the Group’s business is concentrated, many short-term credits are granted with the expectation of renewing the loans 
at maturity. As such, the ultimate maturity of assets may be different from the analysis presented above. To reflect the historical stability of current 
accounts, the Group calculates the minimal daily balance of current accounts over the past two years and includes the amount in the up to 1 year 
category in the table above. The remaining current accounts are included in the On demand category.
The Group’s principal sources of liquidity are as follows:
• deposits;
• borrowings from international credit institutions;
• inter-bank deposit agreements;
• debt issues;
• proceeds from sale of securities;
• principal repayments on loans;
• interest income; and
• fees and commissions income.
As at 31 December 2017 client deposits and notes amounted to GEL 6,712,482 (2016: GEL 5,382,698; 2015: GEL 4,751,387) and represented 54% 
(2016: 51%; 2015: 59%) of the Group’s total liabilities. These funds continue to provide a majority of the Group’s funding and represent a diversified 
and stable source of funds. As at 31 December 2017 amounts owed to credit institutions amounted to GEL 3,155,839 (2016: GEL 3,470,091; 2015: 
GEL 1,789,062) and represented 25% (2016: 33%; 2015: 22%) of total liabilities. As at 31 December 2017 debt securities issued amounted to  
GEL 1,709,152 (2016: GEL 1,255,643; 2015: GEL 1,039,804) and represented 14% (2016: 12%; 2015: 13%) of total liabilities.
In the Board’s opinion, liquidity is sufficient to meet the Group’s present requirements.

35. CAPITAL ADEQUACY
The Group maintains an actively managed capital base to cover risks inherent in the business. The adequacy of the Group’s capital is monitored 
using, among other measures, the ratios established by the NBG in supervising the Bank.
Approved and published on 28 October 2013 by NBG, a new capital adequacy regulation became effective in 2014, based on Basel II/III 
requirements, adjusted for NBG’s discretionary items. Pillar 1 requirements became effective on 30 June 2014, with Pillar II (ICAAP) requirements 
becoming effective 30 June 2015. A transition period continued through to 31 December 2017, during which the Bank was required to comply with 
both the new, and the current, capital regulations of the NBG.
During the year ended 31 December 2017, the Bank and the Group complied in full with all its externally imposed capital requirements.
The primary objectives of the Group’s capital management are to ensure that the Bank complies with externally imposed capital requirements and 
that the Group maintains strong credit ratings and healthy capital ratios in order to support its business and to maximise value for shareholders.
The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it in the light of changes in economic conditions and the risk characteristics of its 
activities. In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividend payment to shareholders, return capital to 
shareholders or issue capital securities. No changes were made in the objectives, policies and processes from the previous years.
NBG CAPITAL ADEQUACY RATIO
The NBG requires banks to maintain a minimum capital adequacy ratio of 9.6% of risk-weighted assets, computed based on the Bank’s standalone 
special purpose financial statements prepared in accordance with NBG regulations and pronouncements. As at 31 December 2017, 31 December 
2016 and 31 December 2015, the Bank’s capital adequacy ratio on this basis was as follows:
2017 2016 2015
Core capital 787,225 676,692 728,139
Supplementary capital 787,225 669,940 649,607
Less – Deductions from capital (116,716) (79,059) (60,311)
TOTAL REGULATORY CAPITAL 1,457,734 1,267,573 1,317,435
RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS 11,004,699 9,360,857 7,811,398
TOTAL CAPITAL ADEQUACY RATIO 13.2% 13.5% 16.9%
Core capital comprises share capital, additional paid-in capital and retained earnings (without current period profits), less intangible assets and 
goodwill. Supplementary capital includes subordinated long-term debt, current period profits and general loss provisions. Deductions from the 
capital include investments in subsidiaries. Certain adjustments are made to IFRS-based results and reserves, as prescribed by the NBG.
NBG (BASEL II) CAPITAL ADEQUACY RATIO
Effective 30 June 2014, the NBG requires banks to maintain a minimum total capital adequacy ratio of 10.5% of risk-weighted assets, computed 
based on the bank’s standalone special purpose financial statements prepared in accordance with NBG regulations and pronouncements, based  
on Basel II requirements. As at 31 December 2017 the Bank’s capital adequacy ratio on this basis was as follows:
2017 2016 2015
Tier 1 capital 1,141,845 892,613 914,784
Tier 2 capital 501,689 519,726 479,176
TOTAL CAPITAL 1,643,534 1,412,339 1,393,960
RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS 11,115,315 9,790,282 8,363,369
TOTAL CAPITAL RATIO 14.8% 14.4% 16.7%
Tier 1 capital comprises share capital, additional paid-in capital and retained earnings, less investments in subsidiaries, intangible assets and goodwill. 
Tier 2 capital includes subordinated long-term debt and general loss provisions. Certain adjustments are made to IFRS-based results and reserves, as 
prescribed by the NBG.  212 Annual Report 2017 BGEO Group PLC
35. CAPITAL ADEQUACY CONTINUED
NBG (BASEL III) CAPITAL ADEQUACY RATIO
In December 2017, the NBG adopted amendments to the regulations relating to capital adequacy requirements, including amendments to the regulation 
on capital adequacy requirements for commercial banks, and introduced new requirements on the determination of the countercyclical buffer rate, on the 
identification of systematically important banks, on determining systemic buffer requirements and on additional capital buffer requirements for commercial 
banks within Pillar 2. The NBG requires banks to maintain a minimum total capital adequacy ratio of 12.4% of risk-weighted assets, computed based  
on the bank’s standalone special purpose financial statements prepared in accordance with NBG regulations and pronouncements, based on Basel III 
requirements. As at 31 December 2017 the Bank’s capital adequacy ratio on this basis was as follows:
2017
Tier 1 capital 1,141,845
Tier 2 capital 501,689
TOTAL CAPITAL 1,643,534
RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS 9,192,078
TOTAL CAPITAL RATIO 17.9%

DIVIDENDS
On 16 February 2018, the Directors of BGEO declared their intention 
to recommend an annual dividend for 2017 totalling c.GEL 120 million.  
If the expected demerger is successfully implemented as planned, it is 
intended that Bank of Georgia PLC (the then new parent company of the 
Banking Business), will instead, shortly after the demerger is completed, 
declare and pay a dividend in a similar or the same aggregate amount to 
shareholders then on the record. In the event that the demerger is for any 
reason not completed it is intended, subject to shareholder approval, that 
the Board would implement the payment of this dividend, which would 
represent a payment of GEL 3.1 per share, payable in British Pounds 
Sterling at the prevailing rate, a 19.2% increase over the 2016 dividend.
As a holding company whose principal assets are the shares of its 
subsidiaries, BGEO relies primarily on dividends and other statutorily and 
contractually permissible payments from its subsidiaries, principally the 
Bank, to generate reserves necessary to pay dividends to its shareholders.
