Presentation of financial information
The Group financial statements are prepared under 
IFRS where the Group’s interests in joint ventures and 
funds are shown as a single line item on the income 
statement and balance sheet and all subsidiaries  
are consolidated at 100%.
Management considers the business principally on  
a proportionally consolidated basis when setting  
the strategy, determining annual priorities, making 
investment and financing decisions and reviewing 
performance. This includes the Group’s share of  
joint ventures and funds on a line-by-line basis and 
excludes non-controlling interests in the Group’s 
subsidiaries. The financial key performance indicators 
are also presented on this basis. Refer to the Financial 
review for a discussion of the IFRS results.

 Hampton-Alexander Review, November 2016.
Not many people predicted the political 
outcomes seen over the last 12 months, not 
only in the UK, but around the world. It was 
certainly an eventful year.
But good businesses become stronger when 
they are put to the test and I am delighted to 
report that, despite uncertainty caused by the 
UK’s decision to leave the EU, we have not only 
demonstrated the resilience of our business 
but also shown how our strategic approach 
enables us to respond to such issues.
In the weeks following the EU referendum 
there was a peak of uncertainty around the  
full impacts that would be felt by businesses 
and the UK as a whole. For us in very broad 
terms, we considered the potential impact  
on consumer confidence affecting our retail 
business and what the result could do  
to business confidence, in particular the  
choice of global organisations to locate  
large parts of their businesses in London.
Our strategic approach is based on long  
term trends. We track consumer and occupier 
expectations and key themes impacting our 
business to ensure we address these in creating 
Places People Prefer. As the worlds of work and 
leisure become increasingly connected this  
has led to our assets becoming more mixed use,  
so that people can fulfil the needs of multiple 
demands on their time. Our London office 
campus approach and multi-let retail centre 
focus has proved to be a real differentiator  
in this respect, creating not only outstanding 
buildings but enabling us to make substantial 
improvements to the overall environments  
in which they sit.
Many of our investments over the year have 
been to structure our portfolio around these 
themes and of course work on the majority  
of them started before 23 June 2016. We had 
already positioned our business to respond.
So despite the uncertainty caused, British Land 
has performed well and I would like to thank 
everyone who works for and with us for their 
contribution during this unpredictable time. 
Underlying Profit for the year was £390 million 
up 7.4%. The valuation of our portfolio was 
marginally down 1.4% with EPRA NAV down 
just 0.4% at 915 pence per share with both 
occupier and investor demand remaining  
good over the year. Significantly, valuation 
performance in the second half was stronger 
than the first.
The Board has recommended a fourth quarter 
dividend of 7.3 pence per share making a total 
of 29.2 pence for the year. Together with the 
movement in net asset value, this brings total 
accounting return to 2.7%. We have proposed  
a first quarter dividend of 7.52 pence per share 
and 30.08 pence for the financial year ending  
31 March 2018 representing a further 3% 
increase, signalling our confidence in  
growing income over the medium term. 
Last year I commented that macro-economic and 
political risks had affected the FTSE 100. Shares  
in real estate have been significantly impacted by 
uncertainty. As a largely domestically focused 
business operating in sterling, UK REITs are more 
exposed to the implications of Brexit on the UK 
economy than the majority of the FTSE 100. 
Experience also shows that gaps between 
share price and reported values expand during 
times of uncertainty and there continues to  
be a wide range of views on the potential  
impact of the UK’s decision to leave Europe 
on our markets.
So while our business is in good shape we 
acknowledge that the environment is more 
uncertain. We have led our sector in a number  
of outstanding deals reflecting the quality  
of our portfolio. Just a couple of weeks after  
the EU referendum we exchanged on the sale  
of Debenhams’ flagship store on Oxford Street 
for £400 million, on terms agreed before the vote. 
And in March 2017, together with our JV partners

Oxford Properties, we exchanged contracts for 
the sale of The Leadenhall Building for a headline 
price of £1.15 billion, the most expensive building 
ever sold in the City of London. 
We’ve also had good letting activity over the year; 
solid evidence that our properties are delivering 
what our customers want. As a result our portfolio 
is virtually full at 98%. In a changing world, 
sustainable places are becoming increasingly 
sought after and continue to create value as they 
are both resilient and well positioned to respond  
to changing customer needs. We are proactively 
designing new buildings with a focus on health, 
wellbeing and productivity of the consumers  
and employees who will use those buildings.  
In addition, initiatives to deliver our Local Charter 
make positive local contributions and help our 
places become part of their local communities. 
As the Government’s Minimum Energy  
Efficiency Standards have the potential to affect 
property values, our award-winning efficiency 
programme has positioned our portfolio  
well and we have become a partner of RE100, 
committed to using 100% electricity from 
renewable sources. Our target for 3% of our  
UK supplier workforce to be apprentices by  
2020 also aligns with Government ambitions 
and our Supply Chain Charter supported  
our first Modern Slavery Act Disclosure.
We continue to be recognised for our leading 
stance on sustainability issues, following our 
2016 Queen’s Award for Enterprise: Sustainable 
Development. Our industry-leading energy and 
carbon reductions resulted in British Land being 
named European Sector Leader in the 2016 
Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmark for 
the third year running, and winning the CIBSE 
Test of Time Award 2017. We have cut energy 
intensity by 35% and carbon intensity by 44% 
across our portfolio since 2009, as we make 
strong progress towards our challenging 55% 
reduction target by 2020.

We have delivered good results despite 
challenges in our markets following the EU 
referendum. Our markets were stronger  
than many anticipated and our strategy, which 
positions us to benefit from long term trends,  
is delivering. Rising consumer expectations, 
the blurring of work and leisure time and the 
transforming impact of technology are the  
key themes shaping demand for our space. 
Nearly one year after the EU referendum, we  
see clear signs that the impact of these trends 
is accelerating, driving polarisation in our 
markets. Our leasing performance has been 
good, contributing to strong earnings growth; 
we have intensified our focus on where our 
placemaking expertise can enhance value, 
attracting a broader range of occupiers; and we 
have sold well, providing the capital to exploit 
opportunities we have within our portfolio. 
Our strategy is to differentiate our space  
by providing places which reflect people’s 
changing lifestyles. We use our placemaking 
expertise to create great environments both 
inside and outside our buildings – creating 
Places People Prefer. This underpins our  
focus on our multi-let retail properties and  
our London campuses which are increasingly 
mixed use.
Investment markets were weaker in the first 
half, reflecting uncertainty both before and 
after the EU referendum, but improved in  
the second half as the UK economy proved 
resilient. Overall, our EPRA net asset value was 
down just 0.4% to 915 pence per share. Retail and 
Offices valuations were down 1.8% and 0.7% 
respectively, with both sectors experiencing yield 
expansion in the first half but modest contraction 
in the second half. Our disposals provide clear 
evidence to support these valuations.
Our portfolio is virtually full with occupancy  
of 98%. Despite the low level of vacancy, we 
signed 1.7 million sq ft of lettings and renewals 
in the year, on average 8.0% ahead of ERV. In 
both the retail and office markets we are seeing 
an increasing focus on the best space in the 
best locations. 
In Offices, where the result of the EU 
referendum created greater uncertainty, we 
have seen occupiers continuing to commit, but 
often after longer and more thoughtful decision 
making processes. Our leasing performance 
was strong, with space let or terms renewed  
on 279,000 sq ft of space in the year, on average 
1.4% ahead of ERV. This included the remaining 
space at The Leadenhall Building and Marble 
Arch House. At 7 Clarges Street, the office 
space was over 80% let just four months after 
launch. In addition, we have 700,000 sq ft of 
space under offer or in advanced negotiations 
across our development pipeline. This includes 
102,000 sq ft at 4 Kingdom Street where almost 
80% of the office space was under offer within  
a week of completion in April 2017, on terms 
ahead of pre-referendum ERVs, and 1 Triton 
Square where we are under offer on 310,000  
sq ft representing all of the office space on  
the proposed redevelopment. 
Our focus on London remains. We expect London 
to continue as a leading global city reflecting its 
diverse pool of intellectual capital and reputation 
for innovation, as well as its culture, language 
and strong regulatory and legal framework.  
Our activity this year is testament to the quality  
of our space which reflects the needs of today’s 
occupiers. By providing space which reflects  
the evolving way people are working and  
blending their work and leisure time, we help  
our occupiers attract and retain key talent.  
Our newest spaces are more flexible, catering  
to the demands of big and small companies with  
the option of shorter lease term arrangements. 
This year, we will be launching a branded flexible 
workspace offer which enables us to capture 
incremental demand from the increasing 
number of small businesses taking space in 
London as well as meeting a growing need 
amongst our existing occupiers for flexible  
space for specific projects and teams. We have 
already agreed our first flexible workspace 
letting at 2 Finsbury Avenue, extending our 
relationship with an existing occupier at 
Paddington Central for their digital team. 
In Retail, demand remained firm in the year, 
despite wider uncertainty for consumers and 
retailers alike. We let more space on better 
terms to a wider range of occupiers than in the 
previous year. This amounted to 1.3 million sq ft 
of leasing, on average 10.8% ahead of ERV. 
Consumer spending was resilient in the months 
following the EU referendum, but weaker sales 
Chris Grigg
Chief Executive Officer
6 British Land  Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Strategic Report
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW data in recent months suggests that consumers 
are becoming more cautious with higher prices 
impacting disposable incomes. Retailers are also 
anticipating a more challenging environment, 
with import cost inflation, higher business rates 
in some areas and the National Living Wage 
putting pressure on margins. 
These dynamics have increased retailers’ focus 
on space which allows them to trade profitably 
across a range of channels. Our Regional and 
Local portfolio supports their strategy. Our 
Regional centres provide a broader offering, 
suited to larger, flagship stores and attracting 
visitors from a wide catchment for a longer 
dwell time. Our Local centres are convenient 
and accessible and so they work well for click 
and collect and more targeted shopping trips, 
as well as providing a range of amenities for 
local communities. Our placemaking activities 
and our community engagement encourage 
new and repeat visits to our sites and this has 
driven continued outperformance in both 
footfall (ahead of benchmark by 240 bps) and 
retailer in-store sales growth (220 bps ahead). 
We have made good progress on our 
development pipeline. As well as completions  
at 4 Kingdom Street and the offices element of 
Clarges, we committed to the redevelopment  
of 100 Liverpool Street at Broadgate and works 
commenced there in December. UBS have now 
vacated 800,000 sq ft of space across the campus 
on completion of their occupancy of 5 Broadgate. 
Located at the gateway to our Broadgate  
campus and adjacent to the new Liverpool Street 
Crossrail station, this development progresses 
our vision to create a world class, mixed use 
destination at Broadgate providing a range of 
space, including significant additional retail  
and restaurants. 
Gross investment activity since the start of  
the year totalled £2.0 billion and included the 
exchange of our 50% interest in The Leadenhall 
Building, which is due to complete later this 
month, reflecting our disciplined approach to 
capital allocation. This project has delivered 
annualised returns of 25% for us and our JV 
partner since our commitment in 2010 and 
demonstrates how our standalone office 
properties provide liquidity, allowing us to 
develop and trade opportunistically. On the 
retail side, we sold £881 million of single-let  
and non-core retail assets, including 
Debenhams, Oxford Street for £400 million  
and £226 million of superstores, reducing the 
weighting of superstores within our portfolio  
to 4%. Our £195 million of acquisitions were 
focused on adjacencies to existing holdings, 
notably the New George Street Estate in 
Plymouth (£64 million) which complements 
Drake Circus and 10-40 The Broadway  
(£49 million), adjacent to Ealing Broadway.
The net impact of our activity was a 7.4% 
increase in Underlying Profits to £390 million. 
Like-for-like income growth of 2.9%, together 
with lower finance costs reflected in a further 
reduction of our weighted average interest rate 
to 3.1%, has more than offset the impact of 
disposals. Diluted underlying EPS was up 
10.9% at 37.8 pence per share. The final 
dividend payment will be 7.3 pence per share, 
bringing the full year dividend to 29.2 pence per 
share, an increase of 3.0% and contributing to  
a total accounting return of 2.7%. The Board  
is proposing a quarterly dividend of 7.52 pence  
per share or 30.08 pence for the coming year,  
a further increase of 3.0%. The impact of recent 
sales and expiries on future profits, our target 
payout ratio, and the uncertain environment 
influenced the Board’s thinking, as well as the 
opportunities that we have within the portfolio 
to grow income over the medium term. 
The impact of our investment activity has been 
to reduce our proportionally consolidated LTV 
to 29.9% at March 2017 from 32.1% in March 
2016. This falls further to 26.9% pro forma  
for the sale of The Leadenhall Building. With 
our completed developments substantially  
let, and good progress on planning and pre-let 
discussions across the pipeline, we are  
well placed to exploit the optionality we have  
to create value and grow income. We have 
identified near term and medium term 
opportunities that enable us to apply our 
development and placemaking expertise  
in progressing the delivery of our strategy. 
Last week, we obtained approval from  
the London Borough of Camden on the 
redevelopment of 1 Triton Square at Regent’s 
Place, where we are under offer on all of the 
office space. We expect to commit to this, as  
well as refurbishments of 135 Bishopsgate and  
1 Finsbury Avenue at Broadgate in the coming 
months with an associated cost of c.£300 million.
Looking further ahead, our medium term pipeline 
covers a range of uses, including office-led 
development in London and retail and mixed use 
development across the country, notably Eden 
Walk in Kingston where we received planning 
permission for our 538,000 sq ft mixed use 
regeneration during the year. We will maintain  
an appropriate level of development risk; for  
our office-led developments commitment is  
likely to be influenced by the progress of pre-let 
discussions. We have a disciplined approach  
to capital allocation and retain flexibility to 
respond to the changing environment.
In addition, we are making progress at Canada 
Water where we are working closely with key 
stakeholders including the London Borough of 
Southwark. We held our fourth public consultation 
in May 2017 and are targeting submission of  
a planning application around the end of this 
financial year. We have held discussions with  
a wide range of potential occupiers and have  
been encouraged by the response. 
British Land received the Queen’s Award for 
Enterprise in 2016, the UK’s highest accolade 
for business success. One year on, we are 
continuing to deliver strong economic, social 
and environmental performance. Our industry-
leading energy and carbon reductions resulted 
in British Land being named European Sector 
Leader in the Global Real Estate Sustainability 
Benchmark for the third year running and in  
the CDP Climate A List, we rank in the top 9%  
of global companies tackling climate change. 
We have launched Bright Lights, our skills  
and employment programme helping a wide 
range of people into work within our industry. 
That includes within British Land. I was also 
particularly pleased to announce that we had 
updated our policy on Shared Parental Pay to 
provide equal enhanced benefits for all parents, 
one example of how we are promoting the 
development of a diverse and inclusive team.
Outlook 
Looking forward, the picture is a mixed one.  
The Brexit process has begun but uncertainty 
will continue for some considerable time. Though 
the UK economy has performed well since the 
vote, we can expect more inflation and increasing 
pressure on disposable incomes. This will impact 
consumer behaviour and retailer profitability. 
London occupiers, particularly financial 
institutions, are making contingency plans but 
there is a wide range of possible outcomes here. 
Our conversations with occupiers tell us that  
a large majority continue to value London and 
believe in its place as a global centre, as we do. 
Although we are seeing businesses taking 
longer to commit and being more thorough in 
assessing options, we see polarisation of both 
occupier and investor demand accelerating with 
an increasing focus on the best quality space. 
Our results show that our space continues to be 
attractive to occupiers and investors alike, with 
strong leasing across the portfolio, profitable 
disposals and material outperformance on  
our Retail operating metrics. This reflects the 
continuing execution of our strategy, providing 
space that responds to changing lifestyles  
and really fulfils customers’ needs. 
In this uncertain environment, we expect to 
benefit from the resilience of our business, the 
quality of our portfolio and the strength of our 
finances. We also look forward with cautious 
optimism as we believe that we can generate 
incremental returns by allocating capital to 
development opportunities we have created, 
whilst keeping risk at an appropriate level and 
flexibility to respond to changes in our markets.

7 British Land  Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Brexit is just one factor impacting our 
markets. Technology is at the heart  
of many far-reaching changes we are  
seeing. In London, Brexit is accelerating 
the trends we are already responding  
to: how people work and live, the growth  
in creative and tech industries, and  
the relative decline in demand from  
traditional banks. 
 
We continue to believe in London in the  
long term and are encouraged by the 
demand we are seeing from occupiers  
and investors for our buildings since  
the vote. However, we have planned  
for a period of uncertainty: we have 
moderated our speculative development 
risk and have continued to diversify our 
office occupier base. We have made good 
progress on leasing discussions and this 
puts us in a strong position to commit  
to new developments to generate 
incremental returns, while keeping  
risk at a sensible level.  
 
Sales over the last year, including  
The Leadenhall Building, have reduced  
our leverage further putting us in a  
strong position to take advantage of 
investment opportunities we have  
created within our portfolio.

  How is British Land  
responding to BREXIT?
  We run British Land to take advantage of 
long term trends but also to be resilient,  
so we are positioned to operate in a range 
of market conditions – property is a cyclical 
business. The quality of the assets we  
own and the strength of our finances  
serve us well as we face the potential 
challenges of Brexit.

Strategic Report
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW CONTINUED   What makes British Land different?
  We have a clear purpose at British Land to 
create Places People Prefer and this drives 
the business. We have a relentless focus  
on customers so we create the places  
they want; not just individual buildings but 
external environments too – it’s something 
I refer to as ‘inside and out’. And, we have 
the scale and capabilities to deliver on  
this long term approach. 
 
This means we invest heavily in data and 
insights to understand what customers 
really want, informing where we allocate our 
capital. This ensures our properties reflect 
the changing way people live their lives and 
provide what businesses need to thrive. 
 
By investing in well located schemes  
we can create great spaces alongside the 
broad range of amenities, experiences and 
services people want as their work and 
home lives becoming increasingly blurred. 
This is why our London campuses and 
multi-let retail centres are becoming  
more diverse and mixed use. 
 
Our operational scale, expertise and  
long term approach mean we have the 
capacity and skills to make the investments 
required and to deliver the benefits.  
It is the combination of all these things 
which makes us different. 
  You talk a lot about customer 
focus – why is this important to 
a property investment company?
  Successful businesses understand and 
deliver what their customers want. For  
us the interesting conversation has been 
defining who our customers are. It’s not 
just the businesses who lease space at  
our retail centres and offices but also  
the people who work in them, the people 
who choose to shop and spend time there 
and the local communities who live in  
and around them. Understanding these 
different stakeholders and the reasons why 
they prefer one location to another is what 
creating Places People Prefer is about. 
 
An outstanding place caters for all and 
often increases the connection between 
them. If your customers prefer your place 
then your business is well positioned for 
success. That’s why we focus on long term 
trends affecting how we work, shop and  
live and invest in our properties to ensure 
they remain relevant to our customers.  
 
This means people not only want to be in 
and around our properties but want to stay 
there longer too. Our new Leisure Quarter 
at Glasgow Fort comprises restaurants, 
green public spaces and children’s pocket 
parks in which to gather, socialise and  
play. More car parking was also added  
in response to shopper feedback. This,  
with other investments, is changing the 
demographic of people shopping at  
the centre and the retailers we attract.  
In turn, footfall has continued to increase 
and this is fuelling rental growth.  
 
We are changing our London campuses too. 
Broadgate, once home to predominantly 
large City financial institutions, is becoming 
a seven-day-a-week location. It is the 
largest pedestrianised commercial space  
in London and is responding to the changing 
needs of office occupiers, benefiting from 
its position in a dynamic part of London  
and the opening of Crossrail. The way we 
are configuring buildings and offering more 
flexible space on more flexible terms mean 
we are already appealing to a wider range  
of occupiers. By adding more restaurants, 
shops and events we are broadening the 
appeal well beyond the employees of the 
businesses based there. 
Understanding these 
different stakeholders  
and the reasons why  
they prefer one location  
to another is what  
creating Places People 
Prefer is about. ”

  For more information on Expert People see pages 24 and 25.
Inputs
Capital Efficiency
We finance our business with a combination of 
equity and debt. We manage the balance to adjust  
the scale and risk profile of the Company. 
Our scale brings operational efficiencies, influence 
and access to opportunities, as well as the capacity  
to invest in our portfolio. 
We have choices over how to allocate our capital. We can 
invest in the existing portfolio, develop new properties or 
purchase properties. We evaluate the prospective returns of 
each option to inform our allocation of capital. We also consider 
returning surplus capital to shareholders.
We can choose to sell properties to crystallise the value that we 
create. This provides capital for reinvestment into opportunities with 
greater prospective returns for shareholders. We monitor opportunities  
to dispose of assets which are not aligned with our strategic priorities  
or do not meet our return aspirations on an ongoing basis.
  For more information on Capital Efficiency see pages 22 and 23.
How we create value
We apply our placemaking 
expertise to create great places 
for modern lifestyles. These  
are Places People Prefer.
Customer Orientation

term trends impacting our 
markets, to ensure that  
the places we create and 
operate respond to people’s 
changing lifestyles.

11 British Land  Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Our business is positioned to 
benefit from long term trends
Key long term trends 
 The UK’s changing role in global markets
    London will remain a leading global city, but will face near term uncertainty as the terms on  
which the UK leaves the EU are negotiated. We may see increased pressure on employment  
in financial services and related sectors as businesses assess whether London and the UK  
remain the best location for them. The weaker currency translates to higher input costs for 
retailers, with consumers potentially facing lower disposable incomes as inflation increases.
 Population growth and urbanisation
    The UK population is expected to grow from 65 million in 2015 to over 74 million in 2040.  
Much of the increase is expected to be in its largest cities, particularly London, where  
there is an increasing emphasis on attractive mixed use environments.
Transformative impact of technology
    Technology is not only driving changes in how we work and shop, it is having a profound impact  
on the space we occupy. The ability to work remotely changes how we use office space, increasing 
the demand for flexible and co-working space. In response to online, retailers are developing 
sophisticated omni-channel strategies, and are using technology to respond to changing 
consumer behaviour. 
Evolving worker and consumer expectations
    The distinction between work and leisure time is increasingly blurred so people expect a  
range of amenities and services, and a choice of leisure and entertainment activities to form  
an integral part of the places where they work, shop and live. This is increasing demand for  
mixed use environments which are well integrated with local communities and provide a  
superior and differentiated offer.
Wellbeing and sustainability
    People’s wellbeing is strongly influenced by the places where they spend time. Increasingly, 
companies are focusing on providing workspaces which promote wellbeing and increase 
productivity. The quality of workspace has become a tool to attract and retain key talent and  
retailers are choosing to locate their stores in environments which encourage customer loyalty.  
There is also a growing expectation that buildings should reflect environmental concerns.

Strategic Report
MARKET TRENDS AND HOW WE ARE RESPONDING How we are responding
Investing in London
    The impact on London of the UK’s departure from the EU is unclear, but its capacity to evolve  
is well established. We believe that the ease of doing business, its intellectual capital, culture, 
diversity and reputation for innovation underpins London’s long term appeal as a global business 
and cultural centre. 58% of our portfolio is located here, and £4 billion of our assets are in  
close proximity to Crossrail stations, reflecting the importance of well-connected space to 
our customers. 
Getting closer to our customers
    Our strategy is focused on our occupiers and their customers and employees. We have invested  
in the skills and resources we need to better understand their preferences. In Retail, our data 
profiles the demographics of local catchments and our shoppers, as well as when and how  
people use our centres, highlighting the potential of each scheme. In Offices, we survey office 
workers and engage with key decision makers from a range of businesses, providing important 
insight into how to improve our work spaces.
Creating great environments
    Across our business, our strategy is to control the wider environment on both our multi-let  
retail centres and our London campuses, enabling us to deliver places which are attractive and 
authentic but also functional and efficient. Our environments are designed to reflect people’s 
changing lifestyles, where the distinction between work and leisure time is increasingly blurred. 
We target a mix of occupiers and services which reflect the local catchment and provide events 
which enliven our places and bring communities together.
Maintaining a flexible development pipeline
    Development has been an important driver of returns and we have assembled a pipeline  
of opportunities across a range of uses. In the more uncertain environment, our appetite for 
speculative development has moderated, but we are well placed to progress our plans when  
the time is right. The majority of the development opportunities in our portfolio enhance  
existing assets.
Promoting health and wellbeing
    We are focused on delivering environments which promote wellbeing and improve productivity. 
Social places, green spaces and initiatives which encourage active living, such as cycle racks  
and fitness centres are incorporated where possible and wellbeing activities form an important 
part of our events programme across both our Retail and Offices portfolios. At 100 Liverpool 
Street, we are targeting the WELL Building Standard which supports wellbeing innovations  
that help create healthier, more productive offices.
We focus on our customers and curate  
the environment inside and out using  
our scale and placemaking expertise. ”

15 British Land  Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Our research (shown in the chart below) shows 
that click and collect and store browsing boosts 
physical sales by 5%, rising to 9% for non-
grocery spend. Click and collect customers are 
incredibly valuable because they spend around 
50% more than the average shopper, including 
spend in addition to the items being collected.
Responding to 
changing lifestyles
We use our insight into customers’ needs and 
identify major long term trends to create 
environments which reflect changing lifestyles
Who are our customers?
Our customers are the end users of our 
properties as well as our occupiers. We engage 
with the people who visit our Retail centres and 
our Office properties, as well as the employees 
and residents who work and live, in and around 
them, to provide buildings and environments 
which meet their changing needs.
How we understand our customers
Our Insight team operates across the business, 
collecting and analysing data to develop our 
understanding of who our customers are, how 
they behave, what they experience and what 
their preferences are. This knowledge and the 
long term trends impacting our business (set  
out on page 12 to 13) inform our approach  
for each asset within our portfolio.
In Retail we use this information to understand 
the preferences of people visiting our centres 
and others within our catchments. This helps 
us to balance our space appropriately between 
retail, leisure and food & beverage and guides 
which brands we should be targeting. It provides 
valuable feedback on what people like about our 
services and environments and where we can 
improve, and helps us assess the impact of 
enhancements we undertake. We collect data 
on trading and occupancy cost ratios so we can 
identify occupiers who are under or over trading 
and locate them in the most appropriate space. 
For each centre, we are able to map the shopper 
missions the centre serves and understand  
the potential range of consumer journeys it can 
capture. This informs our vision of how to position 
the centre and what changes we should make 
to profitably grow footfall and consumer spend 
for our occupiers. 
The main structural shift impacting UK spending 
habits in recent years has been the increasing 
role of the internet. We create places that enable 
our occupiers to trade profitably across a range 
of channels. To help us better understand the 
role of physical space in each channel, we 
partnered with retail consultancy GlobalData  
to quantify the True Value of Stores.
As well as benefiting from this, retailers also 
save on delivery costs and create additional 
opportunities to engage consumers. The 
volume of click and collect transactions  
in the UK is forecast to double over the next  
five years. Our Local centres already capture 
46% more click and collect transactions  
than the national average evidencing how  
the combination of convenient locations,  
free car parking and quality environments 
appeal to the click and collect shopper.
In Offices our focus is on understanding 
perspectives on the workplace of today’s office 
workers. This year we launched the Office 
Agenda, a website where we engage with  
senior decision makers amongst current and 
prospective occupiers on issues which matter to 
them. Today’s occupiers see their workspace as 
a tool to attract and retain key talent so our first 
area of focus was on what made a great place to 
work, with particular emphasis on ‘millennials’ 
who will be the principal users of our space over  
the coming decades. Our survey of over 1,000 
office workers revealed that location and 
transport links were the most important 
factors, and in London, 93% of millennials said 
the ‘buzz’ of a location was also important. 
Around 90% of London millennials want food & 
beverage and retail options nearby, illustrating 
89%
of all UK retail sales touch a physical store
Understanding our 
Retail customers
 – We collect geographic and 
demographic data on local 
catchments, including online  
data from c.3 million individuals 
 – We collect operational data including 
footfall, dwell time and sales on the 
majority of our multi-let assets
 – We undertake 40,000 shopper  
surveys each year
 – We collect data from c.12 million visits  
to our Retail centre websites each year

OUR STRATEGY – CUSTOMER ORIENTATION
Customer Orientation     To read about how we create places  
which reflect customer preferences  
using our placemaking framework,  
go to pages 18 to 21.
How we engage with our occupiers 
We aim to develop collaborative long term 
relationships with our occupiers. We have a 
structured client relationship management 
programme and are happy to share our insights 
on consumer behaviours and today’s workforce 
with our customers. This is particularly 
beneficial in leasing discussions as we  
position our assets to appeal to a broader  
range of occupiers. 
In Retail we use our detailed understanding  
of local catchments, demographics, spending 
patterns and consumer preferences to effectively 
target new occupiers. Across our portfolio, we 
can identify areas where retailers are under-
represented, and where our catchments match 
the profile of their target shopper. Combined  
with persuasive footfall and sales data, and the 
modern, attractive environments at our centres, 
we are successfully attracting occupiers  
to geographies and retail formats in which  
they have not previously operated.
In Offices we have established a consistent 
approach to our relationships with all levels  
of occupier; from our day-to-day contacts 
through to key strategic decision makers. We 
share trends we have identified and research 
we have collected around how workers would  
like to and do use their office space. This helps 
our occupiers meet the changing needs of 
today’s workforce and improve their overall 
wellbeing. In turn, this approach helps us  
to refine our own proposition. 
One new area of focus for us is flexible 
workspace. Technology is driving change in 
people’s working patterns, creating demand  
for quality space which is flexible in terms of  
both the configuration of the physical space and 
the lease arrangements. Our campus-based 
office portfolio positions us well to address  
this growing need, whether in respect of small  
and expanding businesses or larger companies 
requiring added flexibility. We have established  
a small in-house team to deliver against these 
needs, so in June 2017 we will launch our first 
flexible workspace at Broadgate with plans  
to roll out this offer across our campuses. 
Broadgate Estates
We provide a consistent and high standard  
of customer service across our portfolio 
through our property management company 
Broadgate Estates, which is responsible for  
the day-to-day operation of our assets as well  
as those of third parties. In autumn 2016 we 
completed the transition of the management of 
our Retail assets to Broadgate Estates. Having 
a single organisation responsible for all assets 
enables us to rapidly capture and transfer best 
practice learnings across our portfolio. ‘World 
Host’ training and accreditation has been rolled 
out across our campuses and multi-let retail 
centres, improving the quality of customer 
service across the portfolio. Further initiatives 
to enhance the experience of customers at our 
places are planned.

Insight provided by our data attracted 
occupiers to new formats and locations.
Understanding our 
Office customers
 – We surveyed 1,000 office workers  
and decision makers on what makes  
a great place to work and a further  
1,000 on ‘smart’ office technology 
 – We surveyed 1,500 visitors and 250 
employees across our campuses on 
their experience
 – We measure footfall across our campuses
 – We run focus groups with existing and 
prospective occupiers about what they 
need from a campus
just how closely work and social lives now 
overlap. This insight supports our focus on 
campus environments with a mix of retail and 
leisure uses and influences the way we design 
and configure new buildings.
Surveys across our campuses were also 
supportive of our approach. Customer 
satisfaction levels were high scoring 4 out of 5, 
with architecture and landscaping, overall 
atmosphere and safety all scoring particularly 
well. The combined net promoter score for all of 
our campuses (a measure of willingness among 
office workers to recommend their place to work) 
was above the benchmark for London. We will 
monitor this on an ongoing basis to assess our 
performance in meeting customer needs.
Looking forward, technology is providing  
the capacity to make our buildings ‘smarter’, 
with systems that can adapt automatically, for 
example moderating lighting and temperature 
to individual needs. This was the second area  
of focus in the Office Agenda and our surveys 
showed that 87% of decision makers would 
require smart technology in their office next 
time they moved. This will be a focus for us  
in the coming years and we will be making  
100 Liverpool Street ‘smart from the start’. 
  The Office Agenda is available at  
http://officeagenda.britishland.com
Reflecting customer needs
At Glasgow Fort, we have responded to customer 
feedback by increasing car park capacity and the  
range of restaurants. In the year we completed the 
development of a 600 space multi-storey car park 
incorporating a further four restaurants with gardens 
featuring natural play elements for children. These 
enhancements contribute to an environment which 
has enabled us to attract operators including 
Superdry, Wahaca and Smiggle.

17 British Land  Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Creating great environments, 
inside and out
We design engaging, sustainable places  
which bring people together through  
the right mix of occupiers, services  
and activities. 
Our strategic focus
Together with the long term trends  
(see pages 12 and 13) we have identified,  
it is our understanding of our customers  
that guides our strategic focus on creating  
Places People Prefer.
In Retail our approach reflects our 
understanding of the consumer, so we  
provide places where people can shop,  
eat, and be entertained; places which  
are convenient and accessible, and which  
connect with local communities. We classify 
our multi-let retail centres as ‘Regional’  
which attract visitors from a wide catchment, 
and ‘Local’ which reflect the needs of  
local communities. Our research tells  
us that convenience is the most important 
consideration in any shopping trip, so we 
concentrate on assets which are well served  
by public infrastructure and where parking  
is widely available. Our strategy is to own  
and operate assets which are the preferred 
destination for the journeys they serve within 
their catchments. We are active in disposing  
of single-let retail assets which don’t  
provide opportunities for us to deploy  
our placemaking expertise.
In Offices our main focus is on office-led 
campuses which also include a mix of retail, 
leisure and residential to create attractive  
and engaging environments. They reflect  
the lifestyle of today’s workforce and appeal  
to a broad range of occupiers. Together our 
three London campuses, Broadgate, Regent’s 
Place and Paddington Central account for  
78% of our office portfolio (following the sale  
of The Leadenhall Building). We also own 
standalone assets and small clusters of  
assets in strong locations with well-managed 
environments. These provide liquidity in the 
Offices portfolio, allowing us to develop and 
trade more opportunistically.
The importance of London
We expect London to remain a leading  
global City. It plays host to an ecosystem  
of interrelated businesses and its unique 
attractions including the ease of doing 
business, its intellectual capital, culture, 
diversity and reputation for innovation  
underpin its long term appeal. We believe  
it will continue to benefit from population 
growth and urbanisation, driving long term 
demand for our places. In the months  
following the EU referendum several  
leading global businesses from a range  
of sectors, including technology and  
finance, reaffirmed their commitment to 
London with significant leases, providing  
a strong vote of confidence in the City.
Deploying our capital
Our focus on Right Places informs our 
investment decisions – what to acquire,  
what to develop, which capital projects to  
invest in and what to sell. All properties  
that we purchase must be aligned with our 
strategic focus and have the potential to  
meet the evolving needs of changing lifestyles.  
We are active in selling those properties  
within our portfolio which do not meet these 
criteria. Development and capital projects  
are the main ways that we can enhance  
our properties to better meet customers’ 
evolving demands and have been an

Creating Places People Prefer
Our understanding of our customers  
helps us assess the potential of our assets.  
For each asset, we create a business  
plan of how to achieve that potential.  
Our placemaking framework provides  
a consistent approach to enhancing  
our assets as We Connect, We Design,  
We Enhance and We Enliven. 
Connect is about providing places which  
are convenient and easily accessible, with  
car parking or public transport nearby; it is  
also about connecting with people through  
our branding and marketing and leveraging 
technology to engage with users of our  
places efficiently and with impact. Importantly, 
it is also about our connections within the 
community and occupiers. We work with 
community organisations, local people and 
employers to ensure our places meet their 
needs and foster a sense of community. 
18 British Land  Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Strategic Report
OUR STRATEGY – RIGHT PLACES
Right Places Our focus on design is about creating places 
which are both functional and attractive, and 
which complement the surrounding area.  
We consult extensively with local people before 
any development. At Canada Water for example 
we launched our fourth public consultation  
in May this year ahead of submitting planning. 
The next step in our framework is to enhance  
our places with the right mix of uses – retail, 
office, residential, places to eat, drink and be 
entertained and to target an occupier mix which 
is appropriate for the catchment. We use our 
data to guide everything from the occupiers we 
target to their optimal location at our schemes. 
It also informs where and how we invest in 
enhancements to secure the best return. 
Finally, our programme of events, the 
hospitality we show our customers and the 
distinctive features of our properties enliven 
our buildings and their environments, making 
them places people enjoy visiting, spending 
time and returning to. Our partnership with 
organisations such as the National Literacy 
Trust both strengthens our links with local 
communities and helps enliven our spaces.  
Our work with the New Diorama Theatre at 
Regent’s Place is a good example of how we  
are engaging with local communities at our 
campuses. We have made more than 40,000  
sq ft of rehearsal space available to them on  
a temporary basis, creating one of the largest 
performing arts spaces of its kind in London.
Right Places is about identifying the best locations  
and using our placemaking expertise to deliver  
Places People Prefer.”

Placemaking is how we create 
attractive and engaging real estate Over 10%
target retail, food & beverage allocation 
at Broadgate. Currently less than 4%
Upgrading the offer 
Since acquiring Ealing Broadway  
in 2013, we have re-let 30% of the 
centre to new occupiers. This includes 
brands attracted by the enhanced 
environment following our £15 million 
refurbishment such as Smiggle and 
Clas Ohlson. We have transformed the 
dining offer with new brands including 
Wagamama, Wasabi, Limeyard, Turtle 
Bay and Chicken Shop.
A broader range of uses
Our plans for the redevelopment of 
100 Liverpool Street at Broadgate 
will add 90,000 sq ft of retail space 
including a rooftop restaurant.  
This builds on the success of 
Broadgate Circle, which brought  
11 new brands to this part of the 
City, and is instrumental in creating  
a vibrant, mixed use destination  
at Broadgate. 
Leveraging technology to entertain 
We launched Freezy’s Christmas Adventure, 
an app-based children’s game, at 21 Regional 
and Local centres across our portfolio.  
The virtual present hunt ran over six  
weeks and was one of the UK’s largest ever 
augmented reality games in retail property. 
The app was downloaded almost 6,000 times 
generating over 16,500 competition entries.
Innovating to drive footfall
This year we expanded ‘Eats from the  
Street’, our pop-up dining concept which  
saw the British Land Routemaster bus visit  
10 of our Regional and Local retail centres 
serving the best in British street food.  
The concept was extended later in the year, 
with ‘Street Style’, a fashion and beauty  
event, which ran across seven retail centres. 
These initiatives widen our retail, dining and 
leisure offering, and create more dynamic 
shopping environments.
Bringing people together 
Seasonal events at Broadgate 
included ice skating at Christmas, 
which attracted 24,000 skaters and 
live screening of sporting events, 
over the summer, such as the 
Olympics and Wimbledon. Our 
regular events include Broadgate 
Live, our weekly music session  
and our artisan food markets  
which are held twice monthly.

21 British Land  Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Disciplined use of capital
We allocate capital, manage our finances  
and partner with like-minded organisations  
to deliver sustainable long term value. 
Capital allocation
We take a disciplined approach to allocating  
our capital. We forecast returns for each of  
our properties annually and we are active  
in selling assets with lower prospective 
returns, providing capital for reinvestment  
into opportunities with greater returns for 
shareholders. Assets with lower prospective 
returns are generally those where we do not 
have the opportunity to apply our placemaking 
expertise to create value. This includes single- 
let retail assets and those assets where the 
greatest opportunities for us to add value have 
already been realised, such as completed, 
well-let developments. These properties are 
often attractive to investors who wish to take  
a more passive approach to property ownership 
or who attribute greater value to stable income 
over a longer time horizon.
We have choices over how to invest our capital 
and assess the returns available both on 
opportunities within the portfolio and acquiring 
new properties. Often investments within the 
portfolio, or acquiring properties adjacent to 
our existing holdings, result in complementary 
benefits, enhancing returns. This is particularly 
the case on our campuses. Risk on investments 
within the portfolio is also moderated by  
our existing knowledge of properties and 
stakeholders such as occupiers and  
planning authorities.
Developments have delivered some of our 
strongest returns, but are inherently higher 
risk, particularly when pursued on a speculative 
basis. We manage our development exposure 
carefully, limiting it to 15% of the total portfolio 
by value with a maximum of 8% to be developed 
speculatively (i.e. without a pre-let or sale)  
at any time.
Our development exposure moves within this 
range depending on our appetite in the prevailing 
market conditions. Reflecting the uncertainty 
leading up to the EU referendum and since its 
result our speculative development exposure  
has moderated to just 4%. 
The scale and nature of our portfolio and  
our actions to create optionality in the last  
few years mean that we have a range of value 
enhancing development opportunities available 
to us. We believe that we will maximise returns  
over the medium term by retaining flexibility  
to pursue many of these opportunities when 
market demand justifies it. The benefits to 
shareholders of a more immediate capital 
return are an important consideration for  
the Board and this is assessed periodically 
alongside other uses of capital. 
  For more information on our development 
pipeline, see tables on pages 29 to 31.
Debt and leverage
We employ both debt and equity financing.  
We manage the mix between them to balance  
the benefits of leverage, including a greater 
income return, against the risks, including  
a magnification of the impact of property 
valuation movements. Loan to value (LTV)  
on a proportionally consolidated basis  
is our primary measure of leverage. We  
aim to manage our LTV through the property 
cycle such that our financial position would 
remain robust in the event of a significant  
fall in property values. This means we do  
not adjust our approach to leverage based  
on changes in property market yields. 
The scale of our business, the quality of our 
assets and the security of our rental stream 
enable us to access a broad range of debt 
finance on attractive terms. We raise debt  
from a variety of sources across a spread  
of maturities to ensure the Group and its  
joint ventures and funds are appropriately 
financed with actively managed refinancing 
risk. We also maintain significant undrawn  
revolving loan facilities to provide flexibility  
and support current and future requirements  
of the business.
  For more on our approach to financing, 
see pages 43 to 45 for our Financial 
policies and principles.
Over the last five years 
we have sold £4.8 billion  
of assets and reinvested  
£4.2 billion in acquisitions  
and developments 
better aligned with our 
strategic priorities. ”
Recycling capital
We sold Debenhams’ flagship Oxford Street store  
for £400 million in July 2016 on terms agreed ahead  
of the referendum. This disposal reflects the results  
of our capital allocation process and our strategic 
focus on multi-let assets where we can control  
the wider environment.
Superstore sales
We have continued to dispose of superstores 
with £226 million of sales since March 2016. 
Standalone superstores are now 4% of  
our portfolio, down from 13% in 2012.

OUR STRATEGY – CAPITAL EFFICIENCY
Capital 
Efficiency Strategic partnerships
We use strategic partnerships to achieve 
benefits of scale and spread risk. Around  
40% of our owned assets by value are in joint 
ventures and funds, including Broadgate  
and Meadowhall. Within these structures,  
we typically provide asset management, 
development, corporate and finance services,  
for which we earn fees, enhancing our overall 
returns and strengthening our relationships  
with partners, key customers and suppliers.
Energy efficient by design
We focus on achieving high sustainability 
standards on our developments, optimising 
energy efficiency and generating renewable 
energy on site, rather than buying offsets for 
carbon neutrality. Our approach delivers cost 
savings for occupiers, well managed buildings 
for the people who work, shop and live in  
them and better assets for investors. We have 
delivered energy savings for occupiers of  
£13 million over six years, at the same time  
as optimising lighting, temperatures and air 
quality for wellbeing and efficiency. We are  
also improving energy modelling and piloting 
Soft Landings to close the gap between  
efficient design and performance.
  For more information on  
carbon reduction, see page 38.
Crystallising value from development
Along with our partners Oxford Properties, we 
exchanged on the sale of The Leadenhall Building this 
year. This decision to sell reflected that the greatest 
value creation opportunities from development and 
leasing had been realised. The price, which was  
ahead of valuation, crystallised an annualised IRR  
of 25% since our commitment to develop in 2010  
and demonstrates investors’ continuing appetite  
for well let, well located buildings in London.

Reducing our footprint
We are fitting 24,000 sq ft of solar  
panels at Serpentine Green, Peterborough, 
following the success of a pilot at  
St Stephen’s, Hull. This installation  
is expected to generate a return on 
investment of 13% over 25 years and  
save 3,300 tonnes of carbon, as well as 
reducing reliance on the National Grid.

Investing in partnership
Together with GIC our joint venture 
partner, we are investing in Broadgate  
to create a vibrant, world class, mixed 
use destination. In 2015 we completed 
the redevelopment of Broadgate Circle 
and in 2016, UBS took occupation of  
5 Broadgate. We have now commenced

Making sense of BREEAM
Our analysis shows that the additional investment  
to achieve BREEAM Excellent sustainability ratings  
on our office schemes is less than 1% of design  
and construction costs. In our experience, buildings  
with strong sustainability ratings are easier to rent  
and achieve higher occupancy levels. We also believe  
that they perform better over time, providing high  
quality spaces that promote wellbeing and are  
futureproofed against climate change regulations.

23 British Land  Annual Report and Accounts 2017 The knowledge and skills 
to deliver
We employ Expert People and work  
with specialist partners to create insight,  
develop skills and build capacity. 
Our 650 employees are split between British 
Land and our property management business 
Broadgate Estates. The scale of our operations 
has enabled us to attract an expert team, with 
the range of capabilities required to own and 
operate real estate successfully, and respond 
to the changing needs of our markets. We  
have access to a broad network of contacts, 
spanning occupiers, planners, Government  
and local authorities, strategic partners  
and investors, so we see many of the most 
attractive investment opportunities as well as 
partnering and funding possibilities. We work 
closely with industry experts and specialists  
so we develop buildings which benefit from  
the latest technologies and provide spaces  
that promote wellbeing and productivity. 
Our people strategy focuses on creating  
a team who can deliver Places People Prefer. 
Nurturing talent and supporting development  
is an important part of the culture at British 
Land. We have a formal annual appraisal 
process for each member of our team and 
empower all employees to progress their 
careers with personal development plans.  
We operate a range of online resources to help 
employees develop their skills and work with 
Cambridge University to run a Leadership in 
Real Estate programme. Forty of our staff have 
benefited from this programme since it was 
launched in 2014. We are also rolling out 
training focused on pitching and negotiating 
skills, recognising the importance of these 
aspects of customer engagement as well  
as people management. This year we have 
embedded new capabilities, particularly in 
customer-focused research and marketing, 
where we are using data analytics to generate 
insights into customer behaviour and digital 
resources to keep them up to date with 
activities around the portfolio. We are investing  
in technology across the business, upgrading  
our core operational systems, and using 
artificial intelligence solutions to help ensure  
our network is better protected. We are mindful 
of cyber security and have enhanced our 
security position as well as rolling out cyber 
awareness training across both British Land and 
Broadgate Estates. As our business becomes 
increasingly mixed use, we are also improving 
the way we work across our teams leveraging 
skills from different parts of the business 
across the whole. Our Insight team now works 
across the portfolio and we are increasingly 
integrating operations across our core team  
at British Land and Broadgate Estates in 
functions such as technology, HR and finance.
We are focused on creating a culture which 
encourages diversity and inclusion, so the policy 
throughout British Land is to employ the best 
candidates available in every position regardless 
of sex, race, ethnic origin, nationality, colour,  
age, religion or philosophical belief, sexual 
orientation, marriage or civil partnership, 
pregnancy, maternity, gender reassignment  
or disability. We are a member of People  
in Property, a forum for Human Resources 
directors in real estate, and a signatory to  
their guidelines on diversity and inclusion in 
recruitment. We are also working towards the 
National Equality Standard, which sets out 
equality, diversity and inclusion criteria against 
which businesses are assessed annually. 
For the second year running, Chris Grigg  
was ranked in the top 20 Ally Executives by

we are pleased that BL Pride, our lesbian,  
gay, bisexual, transgender (LGBT) and allies 
network established in November 2015 
marched in the 2016 London Pride Parade  
in support of the Albert Kennedy Trust.

for women, as well as four ‘In Conversation’ 
events which are open to everyone. Parental 
leave coaching has been introduced and the 
mentoring scheme we piloted last year for 
women has now been rolled out across the 
company, offering guidance and support to both 
male and female employees. We currently have 
three female Directors on the Board, Lucinda 
Bell, Chief Financial Officer, and Lynn Gladden 
and Laura Wade-Gery, both Non-Executive 
Directors. As at 31 March 2017, 47% of 
employees across British Land and Broadgate 
Estates were female, including three out of 10  
of our Executive Committee. This placed us in  
the top 20 of FTSE 100 companies having at  
least 33% women’s representation across 
Executive Committee members and their direct 
reports as reported in the Hampton-Alexander 
Review in November 2016.
Promoting health and wellbeing across the 
business is an important part of our culture.  
This year we launched a Wellbeing Committee 
which will focus on mental health and personal 
wellbeing and we have updated our policy on 
Shared Parental Pay to provide equal enhanced 
benefits for all parents following the birth or 
adoption of a child. We also set out new flexible 
working guidelines and are leveraging 
technology to enhance both productivity  
and employee wellbeing. We encourage  
the recruitment of underrepresented ethnic 
minorities through our support for initiatives 
such as Pathways to Property, Budding  
Brunels and UrbanPlan UK. These schemes all 
encourage young people from a wide range of 
backgrounds to consider careers in real estate. 
Our volunteering programme offers our staff 
opportunities to connect with local communities 
and develop their skills, particularly through 
skills-based volunteering for example as charity 
trustees and school governors. 90% of British 
Land staff took part in volunteering activities  
and 16% undertook skills-based volunteering 
throughout the year. 
Both British Land and Broadgate Estates 
participate in the ‘Best Companies’ survey

OUR STRATEGY – EXPERT PEOPLE
Expert People satisfaction and valuable feedback on how we 
can focus our actions in this area to improve 
further. As part of our continuous programme  
of employee engagement, both British Land  
and Broadgate Estates host company meetings 
where directors update the team on business 
activities, financial results and strategy. 
Colleagues at all levels of the business are 
offered the opportunity to participate in our 
well-established all-employee share schemes, 
aligning their interests with those of shareholders. 
We have long recognised the importance of 
developing the skilled workforce of tomorrow  
for our business and markets. Through our 
Bright Lights skills programme, we partner  
with occupiers, suppliers and local authorities  
to support apprenticeships, training, work 
experience, internships and employment at  
our places. We support the Pathways to 
Property scheme, and are pleased to have 
recruited one of the graduates to join our own 
graduate scheme, starting in September 2017. 
Over 21,500 people benefited from our skills, 
employment and educational initiatives this 
year. Our Supply Chain Charter sets out 12 
principles we require our suppliers to work 
towards and we partner with occupiers and 
suppliers on fair working practices including 
the Living Wage Foundation. 
Our respect for human rights is embedded  
in how we do business. We are a signatory  
to the UN Global Compact which supports a 
core set of values, including human rights, and 
have made appropriate disclosures in respect 
of the Modern Slavery Act. We are also a 
member of APRES, an action programme on 
responsible and ethical sourcing across the 
construction industry.

Being an apprentice at 
Meadowhall and then 
progressing into a permanent 
role here, every day is 
different and I am always 
faced with something  
new, which I enjoy. ”
Chloe Simmonite, Customer Service 
Assistant at Meadowhall
Encouraging creativity 
We entered a new design partnership  
with the Royal College of Art, the world’s 
number one art and design university, 
challenging students to produce creative 
responses to development opportunities 
across our portfolio. This year, the first  
of a three year partnership, has seen 
students consider opportunities to innovate 
in the residential and office markets.
Developing future talent
Over 100 apprentices have worked 
on the construction of Clarges  
and 4 Kingdom Street through  
our Bright Lights skills and 
employment programme. 
Providing training, skills and employment 
Through our Bright Lights programme,  
we helped around 70 young people embark  
on careers in retail and hospitality this year. 
We delivered Bright Lights Starting Out in 
Retail and Hospitality in partnership with our 
retail and leisure occupiers and The Source  
Skills Academy, which we established  
with Sheffield City Council in 2003. 
75%
of Bright Lights retail and hospitality 
trainees progressed into employment
Supporting vulnerable young people 
We partner with the Albert Kennedy Trust,  
a charity which provides accommodation  
and support for vulnerable LGBT people.  
We sponsor a room in their safe house 
and this year seven British Land volunteers  
spent time at the safe house helping with 
decorating and gardening. 
Helping women succeed 
Our women’s network hosted conversation 
events with Nicola Shaw, CEO of High Speed I, 
Natasha Stromberg, Founder of Genderbuzz 
and architect Amanda Levete, who designed 
the Museum of Art, Architecture and 
Technology in Lisbon and the entrance,  
gallery and courtyard of the V&A.

Market and strategy 
It is nearly one year since the UK voted to leave 
the European Union. In that time, the economy 
has outperformed expectations, with GDP 
projections for 2017 revised upwards to an 
average of 2% and unemployment below 5%,  
its lowest in over 40 years. However, we have 
entered a prolonged period of uncertainty and 
businesses will face a number of headwinds. 
Mindful of this background, but facing a clear 
need to move forward, occupiers are continuing 
to make decisions, but plans are taking longer  
to come to fruition. 
This is reflected in our markets. IPD capital 
return fell 2.4% in the three months immediately 
following the referendum but since then, six 
months of positive capital returns totalling  
2.0% have partially reversed this position. 
On the investment side, overall volumes are 
down year on year. However, London offices 
saw a pick-up in activity towards the end of 
2016, and momentum was sustained into 2017, 
with a number of high profile transactions, 
concluded at tight yields, generally ahead of 
valuation. This included our exchange of The 
Leadenhall Building, which demonstrates the 
continuing appeal of high quality, well located 
properties in London. In retail, activity has  
been subdued with a lack of quality stock being 
brought to the market. This has resulted in 
limited transactional activity in multi-let retail, 
although long term, secure income assets 
remain attractive to a range of investors.
We expect Brexit-related headwinds to impact 
our occupational markets. In offices, it will be 
some years before we have clarity on the impact 
of proposed regulatory changes which may 
affect occupier demand, particularly in financial 
services. However, demand from more creative 
sectors, which has accounted for a growing 
share of activity in recent years, has held up 
well, and we are encouraged that a number of 
leading global companies have reaffirmed their 
commitment to London since the referendum. 
Vacancy rates have risen from low levels to 
marginally above long term averages in both the 
City and West End following recent development 
completions. We expect further supply to apply 
downward pressure on market rents, but  
our experience today is that the right space in 
strong locations continues to command rents 
around pre-referendum levels. Central London 
and import cost inflation. These factors will 
heighten their focus on the best space, where  
to date, demand has held up well. On the 
consumer side, confidence will be vulnerable  
to political and economic uncertainties and we 
have seen some evidence of softening retail 
spend in the first part of 2017 with inflation 
impacting disposable income. 
Our view is that Brexit will accelerate 
polarisation in our markets. In recent years  
we have positioned our business to benefit  
from the long term trends driving demand  
for space, by providing places which reflect 
people’s changing lifestyles. Our data-driven 
approach to understanding how people use our 
properties guides investment and placemaking 
activities across our portfolio, as well as our 
approach to targeting an increasingly broad 
range of occupiers. We provide places with  
a blend of uses and a mix of services in 
attractive environments, accommodating  
the preferences of our occupiers, their 
customers and employees. This is most 
effective where we control the wider 
surroundings, underpinning our focus  
on our multi-let retail properties and  
our London campuses.
Portfolio performance 
Our portfolio saw a valuation fall of 1.4% over 
the year. The decline of 2.8% in the first half 
was primarily due to outward yield shift of  
19 bps. This was partially offset by a valuation 
increase of 1.6% in the second half when yields 
moved inwards by 5 bps and we benefited  
from the impact of sales, particularly our  
50% interest in The Leadenhall Building which 
exchanged in the year. Valuations were also 
supported by continuing ERV growth. 
The value of our Retail portfolio was down 1.8% 
reflecting total outward yield shift of 14 bps, 
with 18 bps movement in the first half partially 
offset by 3 bps contraction in the second half. 
We saw variation within Retail, with the strongest 
ERV growth on our multi-let portfolio at 2.4%. 
This was 2.5% at our Local centres, marginally 
ahead of our Regional centres at 2.3%. We  
saw a valuation fall on superstores of 5.2%, 
reflecting a fall in ERVs of 4.0%, but a stronger 
performance across our other single-let assets 
with valuations up more than 5%. This reflected 
the sale of Debenhams, Oxford Street and  
lease extensions and rent increases agreed 
across our Homebase portfolio. 
Offices were down 0.7% with outward yield 
movement of 15 bps for the full year, as 21 bps 
expansion in the first half was partially offset  
by 6 bps contraction in the second half. We saw

the largest valuation falls on assets with near 
term expiries, particularly those properties 
vacated by UBS at Broadgate. Conversely,  
UBS’s new building 5 Broadgate gained in value 
benefiting from a long lease with RPI linked 
uplifts. The value of The Leadenhall Building 
also increased reflecting the sale price  
agreed 24% above valuation.
The value of Canada Water fell 10.8% reflecting 
the valuer’s reassessment of development  
risk and returns, particularly on residential,  
as well as planning and feasibility costs  
not recovered. This 46-acre regeneration 
opportunity is valued at £6 million per acre.  
The next major value creation step is expected  
to be on securing planning.
Our portfolio outperformed IPD at the sector 
level, with Retail and Offices 60 bps and 40  
bps ahead on a capital returns basis. Overall 
we underperformed the IPD universe which 
comprises 20% industrial assets which 
performed well this year, by 110 bps on a  
capital return basis and by 150 bps on a  
total return basis. 
Investment and development activity 
The gross value of our investment activity  
since 1 April 2016, as measured by our share  
of acquisitions, disposals, capital spend on 
developments and other capital projects was 
£2.0 billion. This includes £1.5 billion of sales on 
average 9% ahead of valuation, at an average 
yield of 4%. Net divestment was £1.1 billion. 
Offices sales included our 50% interest in  
The Leadenhall Building, which exchanged  
in March for a headline price of £1.15 billion 
(100%). The sale, to C C Land, is conditional 
upon C C Land shareholder approval. A Special 
General Meeting of the shareholders of C C 
Land has been convened on 18 May 2017  
to approve the transaction. We expect the 
transaction to complete shortly thereafter.  
This transaction is a good example of how  
our standalone office assets provide liquidity 
allowing us to develop and trade opportunistically. 
At our campuses we focus on delivering 
sustainable returns over the long term. 
In Retail, we made £881 million of disposals, 
3% ahead of valuation, comprising £709 million  
of single-let properties and £172 million of 
multi-let assets which were not aligned  
with our strategic goals. The largest sale was 
Debenhams, Oxford Street for a price of £400 
million. We sold £226 million (£410 million gross 
value) of superstores including £116 million as 
part of our Tesco JV swap transaction which 
exchanged and completed after the year end, 
resulting in the termination of the last of our 
five Tesco joint ventures. In aggregate, our 
Tesco joint ventures delivered an annualised 
return of over 10% since the first one was 
established in 1997. Over the last five years, we 
have now sold over £900 million of superstores, 
reducing their weighting in the Retail portfolio 
from 22% to 8% and in the overall portfolio 
from 13% to 4%. Multi-let retail now accounts 
for 78% of the Retail portfolio increasing from 
71% at the start of the year.
We have progressed sales at each of  
our residential schemes with £56 million 
exchanged over the year, on average 4.5% 
ahead of valuation with a further £27 million 
reserved at prices in line with March 2017 
valuations. Sales at Aldgate Place were 
exchanged at prices in line with valuation, 
leaving just one apartment to sell. At The  
Hempel Collection, sales accelerated following 
the launch in March 2017, and a reduction in 
prices by 10%. At Clarges, Mayfair we intend to 
market the remaining 11 apartments following 
completion in late 2017 but we agreed the sale 
of one of the larger apartments in the year ahead 
of valuation following a one-off approach. This 
activity reduces our residential properties to 
sell to £210 million of which £150 million is  
at Clarges. 
Our £195 million of acquisitions in the year were 
focused on adjacencies to existing holdings, 
notably our £64 million acquisition of the New 
George Street Estate in Plymouth which lies 
between Drake Circus and our proposed leisure 
scheme and our £49 million purchase of 10-40 
The Broadway, Ealing which is adjacent to our 
Ealing Broadway Local retail centre. In both 
cases these acquisitions complement and 
enhance our existing plans. 
Development spend totalled £183 million in the 
year. We completed almost 200,000 sq ft of office 
space at 4 Kingdom Street, Paddington Central 
and 7 Clarges Street and 187 apartments  
at Aldgate Place (Phase 1) and The Hempel 
Collection. Capital expenditure enhancing our 
assets was £109 million, including extensions 
and unit reconfigurations at our multi-let retail 
assets with directly associated income uplifts. 
We have invested £44 million improving our retail 
environments, notably at Meadowhall which 
accounted for £23 million, as part of our £60 
million (100%) refurbishment. This completes  
at the end of 2017, and is the most significant 
investment in the centre since it opened in 1990, 
ensuring that it continues to meet consumers’ 
evolving expectations. We are already seeing a 
good response from occupiers with 37 long term 
lettings and renewals signed here in the year.  
We have also invested £5 million enhancing the 
public realm at our London campuses, primarily 
Paddington Central, as part of a £12 million 
investment programme. 
Following development completions, our 
speculative development exposure has reduced 
to below 4%. This is well within our internal  
risk threshold for speculative development. 
This threshold was reduced to 8% of overall 
portfolio value from 10% in the year, reflecting  
a moderation of our appetite for speculative 
development risk given uncertainty in our 
markets. Our most significant commitment  
is 100 Liverpool Street at Broadgate; totalling 
520,000 sq ft, including 90,000 sq ft of retail.  
It is due to complete at the end of 2019, with 
costs to come of £152 million (British Land 
share). We also commenced a 66,000 sq ft 
leisure development at New Mersey, Speke 
which is largely pre-let and expect to complete 
the residential element of Clarges, Mayfair 
later this year. 
Construction cost forecasts continue to 
suggest a slowdown in the rate of growth over 
this year and next, despite increasing pressure 
on input costs. Our experience suggests that 
cost inflation is marginally lower than it has

29 British Land  Annual Report and Accounts 2017 been over the last two years. However, we 
continue to take a cautious view and maintain 
prudent allowances within project budgets  
to reflect specific sectors and locations. 90%  
of the costs on our committed development 
programme have been fixed.
Our divestments, totalling £1.5 billion this year, 
our planning activity and progress on leasing 
discussions improve our optionality and leave  
us well placed to make timely decisions on 
commitments in our development pipeline.  
Our completed developments are substantially 
let, with almost 80% of the office space at  
4 Kingdom Street under offer, and over 80% of 
the office space at 7 Clarges Street let. Leasing 
discussions on our committed pipeline are 
progressing and we are under offer on all of  
the office space at our proposed redevelopment 
of 1 Triton Square. This activity enables us  
to progress developments whilst keeping 
speculative commitments at an appropriate 
level. We secured planning consents totalling  
2.3 million sq ft in the year across the portfolio 
and submitted planning applications on a further 
1.3 million sq ft. This provides for a much wider 
range of opportunities in the near and medium 
term than we had at the start of the year. 
In our near term pipeline, we expect to commit 
to the refurbishments of 1 Finsbury Avenue 
(288,000 sq ft) and 135 Bishopsgate (325,000  
sq ft) at Broadgate, in the coming months 
following receipt of planning and agreement 
with our joint venture partner. Our plans at both 
include increasing retail and leisure space by 
88,000 sq ft including a cinema and roof terrace 
being added to 1 Finsbury Avenue. Royal Bank 
of Scotland will be surrendering their lease at 
135 Bishopsgate in June 2017 ahead of expiry in 
2019 and we will receive a payment of £34 million 
(100%) compensating for the remaining lease 
term and dilapidations; we are already seeing 
good interest on a significant portion of the space 
here. At 1 Triton Square we are currently under 
offer on all of the office space, and have received 
approval from the London Borough of Camden 
for our redevelopment. Subject to completion of 
the planning process and the pre-let, we expect 
to commit and to start on site in March next year. 
This will coincide with the expiry of short term 
leases agreed to maintain optionality for the 
redevelopment of this site while mitigating 
holding costs. On the retail side, we are refining 
our plans for a 104,000 sq ft leisure scheme at 
Drake Circus in Plymouth and we expect to start 
on site next year. In total, these commitments 
amount to £338 million of spend and would take 
our speculative development commitment to 6%. 
Looking further ahead, our medium term 
pipeline covers a range of uses, including 
office-led development in London, and retail and 
mixed use developments across the country and 
at Canada Water. The majority of these projects 
are income producing, (including 2&3 Finsbury 
Avenue and Eden Walk) or are held at low cost 
(Blossom Street and the proposed leisure 
scheme at Meadowhall) providing us with  
real optionality on the timing and nature of our 
commitment. The total potential cost associated 
with these opportunities is £1.4 billion plus 
Canada Water. We will maintain an appropriate 
level of development risk, and so on our 
office-led developments, commitment is likely  
to be influenced by the progress of pre-let 
discussions. We have a disciplined approach  
to capital allocation and retain the flexibility  
to respond to the changing environment. 
Opportunities at our campuses include the 
105,000 sq ft Gateway Building at Paddington 
Central, where we are in advanced negotiations 
with an operator for a boutique hotel on the site  
of the current management suite. We expect  
to proceed if these discussions are successful, 
subject to planning. We are also working to 
enhance the existing consent for a 240,000 sq ft 
office building at the site of 5 Kingdom Street.  
In the meantime, we have let space on a short 
term basis to Pergola Paddington Central,  
who are creating an 850-capacity pop up dining 
concept which benefits the broader campus.  
At Broadgate, we have secured planning for a 
563,000 sq ft redevelopment of 2&3 Finsbury 
Avenue; UBS have vacated 2 Finsbury Avenue 
and we have secured short term lettings on 90% 
of this space whilst their lease at 3 Finsbury 
Avenue remains in place (break in late 2018). 
Looking further forward, we expect to take 
vacant possession of 1-2 Broadgate in summer 
2019 and are working up our plans for a 375,000 
sq ft scheme which will include a substantial 
retail element. At Blossom Street, we have 
secured full consent on a 340,000 sq ft office-led 
mixed use development. 
Our retail opportunities include a 322,000  
sq ft leisure extension at Meadowhall. We have 
submitted our plans and expect a decision over 
the summer with a view to starting on site in 
2018. Our plans envisage a multi-level Leisure 
Hall with dining and entertainment options 
alongside high quality internal and external 
spaces for events and community use, 
including new restaurants, a new cinema,  
café court and gym. 
Eden Walk is a 538,000 sq ft mixed use, 
regeneration scheme in Kingston, which we 
own in joint venture with USS. In March 2017, we 
achieved consent for our development, which 
includes 40 new retail and restaurant units,  
380 new homes and 35,000 sq ft of high quality, 
modern and flexible office space. Our proposal 
will create an estimated 600 additional jobs for 
local people. We are progressing our plans to 
secure vacant possession of the site, and expect 
to commence development in 2019, but in the 
meantime the scheme is income producing  
with a yield of 3.4%. 
Canada Water is the most significant 
development opportunity in our medium term 
pipeline; the shopping centre and leisure scheme 
remain income producing with a yield of 2.8%. 
We are working closely with the London Borough 
of Southwark, the Greater London Authority, 
Transport for London and the local community 
on our masterplan for the 46 acre site, with plans 
for up to 5.5 million sq ft of space across a wide 
range of uses. This includes 2 million sq ft of 
workspace and 1 million sq ft of retail and leisure 
space alongside educational and cultural uses 
and up to 3,500 new homes. These will include  
a mix of affordable and market priced housing 
as well as a more targeted provision, including 
student accommodation. The revised masterplan 
integrates principles of sustainability and 
wellbeing which will create a new urban  
centre for London. Our active programme  
of engagement with the local community and 
other stakeholders includes our fourth public 
consultation which started earlier this month 
and we are targeting submission of a planning 
application around the end of the financial year. 
We will evaluate phasing of the project and 
potential funding structures as we move closer 
to securing planning. In the meantime, we have 
been engaging with a wide range of potential 
occupiers and are encouraged by the interest. In 
the short term, we have created an exciting new 
events space at the Printworks to raise the public 
profile of the area and to generate income, as 
well as testing the appetite for this kind of facility 
within our plans. The space has already played 
host to Secret Cinema and Mulberry in London 
fashion week, and now regularly hosts cultural 
events. In total, almost 100,000 people have 
attended events there.

31 British Land  Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Our Retail business has had a successful  
year, evidenced by our continued strong 
leasing, our operational metrics which are 
outperforming and our ERV growth which is 
ahead of the market, particularly where we 
have invested. This is our tenth consecutive 
year of outperformance on a total returns 
basis. This is testament to our strategy,  
which is to create outstanding places for 
modern consumer lifestyles. 
The growth of online has driven polarisation  
in retail, as occupiers are increasingly focused 
on the best, and the most appropriate space  
to profitably grow sales across all channels.  
We expect this trend to accelerate in the 
coming years, as retailers face a range of 
headwinds such as cost inflation and weaker 
consumer spending while the terms on  
which the UK leaves the EU are negotiated.  
For many of our occupiers, the best space  
means a number of flagship or “hub” stores 
supplemented by a network of more convenient 
outlets which ensure sufficient coverage and  
are an important part of online fulfilment 
networks, including click and collect. This 
mirrors our strategy in Retail which is to 
operate both Regional centres, attracting 
visitors from a wide catchment for planned 
trips, with a breadth and depth of retail and 
leisure, and Local centres which fit into the 
daily life of communities and are more 
convenient and accessible.

Our focus is on our occupiers and their 
customers and we use a range of sources to 
understand needs. We engage with consumers 
directly through shopper surveys and collect 
data on their online interactions, generating 
insights about how, when and where people  
like to shop. This guides everything from our 
investment in the portfolio to the occupiers  
we are targeting, enabling us to position our 
centres to be the best in their catchment, for 
the range of shopper missions they serve. A 
high level of customer services is a key element 
of our offering and we now manage our retail 
assets in-house through Broadgate Estates; 
this transition was completed in the year and 
we have been very pleased with how this has 
enabled us to deliver a consistent and a high 
standard of service across our retail portfolio.
This year, footfall and in-store sales (which 
exclude click and collect and the boost to online 
from physical stores), outperformed their 
benchmarks by 240 bps and 220 bps respectively, 
but both were flat overall. Differing dynamics 
were evident across our portfolio, with footfall 
at our Regional centres down 1.9% but sales up 
0.3% illustrating how people are visiting these 
larger centres less frequently, but spending 
more. At our Local centres, footfall was up 2.1% 
but in-store sales were down 0.7% reflecting 
greater click and collect usage at these sites 
which is not included within in-store sales. Our 
True Value of Stores research, conducted in the 
year with retail consultancy GlobalData illustrated 
the important role physical stores play in boosting 
sales across other channels, including click and 
collect. On average, click and collect usage is 46% 
greater at our Local centres than the national 
average and click and collect customers spend 
around 50% more than the average shopper. 
This outperformance illustrates that in a 
polarising market, our centres are attracting a 
disproportionate share of consumer demand. 
This year, despite a more uncertain trading 
environment, and with the portfolio virtually full 
at 98%, we let more space, on better terms, to  
a wider range of occupiers than in the previous 
year. Lettings and renewals totalling 1.3 million 
sq ft were signed in the year, on average 10.8% 
ahead of ERV. Our Regional centres accounted 
for approximately two-thirds of this activity but 
both Regional and Local centres achieved leasing 
terms which were strongly ahead of ERV. 
Our leasing covered a broad range of sectors, 
but we were particularly successful in fashion, 
homewares and food & beverage which 
accounted for 25%, 27% and 15% of leasing 
respectively. Reflecting our customers’ 
preferences, our plans are to increase the 
leisure and food & beverage allocation across 
our portfolio from the current position of 10% 
(up from 6% four years ago), and we made good 
progress on this in the year with 133,000 sq ft of 
lettings. We are particularly pleased that several 
of our occupiers have chosen our assets for their 
first out of town locations including Thaikhun, 
Wahaca, Smiggle, Superdry, Charles Clinkard 
and Pret-A-Manger. This success reflects an 
increasingly sophisticated pitching process 
which leverages our insights to help prospective 
occupiers understand our offer and positioning 
within our catchments. A number of operators, 
including Primark, JD Sports, Sports Direct and 
Schuh chose to locate more of their flagship 
stores with us in the year, by adding to their 
existing space at our Regional centres. At our 
Local centres, we saw new lettings to Wilko, 
River Island, Nando’s and more community 
focused occupiers such as Explore Learning 
and local gyms. We are also appealing to more 
premium brands, particularly where we have 
invested and Meadowhall is a good example of 
this. Neal’s Yard, Nespresso, Hawes & Curtis, 
Flannels and Ghost London all signed in the  
year as our £60 million (100%) refurbishment 
programme nears completion. 
This strong demand for our space is reflected in 
the re-letting of 90% of the 247,000 sq ft of space 
returned to us following BHS’ administration, 
with long term leases at levels significantly  
in excess of previous passing rent. 
Like-for-like rental growth (excluding 
surrender premiums) was 2.0%, driven by our 
strong leasing activity as well as rent reviews 
with over 120 reviews settled on average 3.4% 
ahead of passing rent and ahead of valuation 
assumptions. This year we renewed eight 
Homebase leases, totalling 283,000 sq ft 
extending the lease term to 15 years, increasing 
rents and providing a significant capital uplift  
for our single-let portfolio. 
ERV growth across our multi-let properties  
was 2.4% and this performance provides strong 
evidence that our strategy is working. Investment 
in our assets, guided by our insights has driven 
demand for our space, bringing our portfolio to 
near full occupancy, and generating the demand 
tension needed to drive rents. We are particularly 
pleased that ERV growth across assets benefiting 
from our investment was 3.2%, which was ahead 
of the portfolio average. At Colchester ERV 
growth was nearly 14% following completion of 
our £6 million investment to improve the public 
realm there, including a new playground, the 
addition of public art and reconfiguration of  
the car park. 
Over 5,000 children took part in the Young Readers 
Programme organised in partnership with the 
National Literacy Trust across 22 centres in our 
portfolio enlivening our spaces and strengthening 
links with local communities. This is the sixth year  
of our partnership.

Events such as the live screening of sports, theatre and film,

Development spend in the year was £20 million 
and included a new leisure quarter at Glasgow 
Fort, with four new restaurants and a multi-
storey car park adding 600 spaces and increasing 
car park capacity by over 30% to accommodate 
growing visitor numbers. This follows leisure  
and retail extensions in 2013 and 2015 which have 
underpinned improved operational performance 
at the centre. The centre is now ranked top in  
its category by CACI in Scotland. Our leisure 
extension at New Mersey, Speke, where 
construction commenced this year will add  
an 11-screen cinema, pre-let to Cineworld,  
and six restaurant units, significantly enhancing 
the leisure offering at this centre. Opening  
in summer 2018, we have already pre-let 
restaurants to Wagamama’s, Nando’s and TGI 
Friday. This year we achieved planning consents 
on 840,000 sq ft, covering a range of activity from 
large mixed use developments to small-scale 
improvements to existing properties, providing 
optionality for the future. 
This year, capital spend in the Retail portfolio 
totalled £91 million of which just over half were 
initiatives delivering an immediate increase in 
income. The remainder were initiatives to enhance 
environments with longer term benefits for  
our assets. The refurbishment programme at 
Meadowhall was the most significant of these, 
accounting for £23 million (British Land share). 
This is part of our £60 million (100%) upgrade 
completing in late 2017. At Teesside, we are on 
site with a £30 million refurbishment programme 
to coincide with the centre’s 25th anniversary. 
Our improvements focus on the public realm  
and customer service facilities and will deliver  
more flexible space for our occupiers. 
Our insight has also guided our placemaking 
activities across the portfolio. This year we 
staged a virtual Christmas present hunt at 21 
Local and Regional centres, the largest ever 
augmented reality game in UK retail property. 
Eats from the Street, showcasing the best in UK 
street food returned to ten of our centres and we 
launched Street Style a fashion and beauty event 
which ran across seven of our assets. Our Young 
Readers Programme, run in partnership with the 
National Literacy Trust and retail occupiers, is in 
its sixth year and we are pleased that over 5,000 
children took part this year. Our Bright Lights 
skills programme provided work placements 
with our retail and leisure occupiers for 70 local 
unemployed young people of which 75% moved 
into permanent jobs soon after. Initiatives such as 
these help enliven our places, attracting new and 
repeat visitors to our centres and foster stronger 
connections with local communities and our 
occupiers. The people who live in and around our 
assets are an important part of our catchment 
and their loyalty is increasingly relevant as 
customers have greater choices around how  
and where they shop.

has proved to be a magnet for these new  
and growing companies. This trend is  
driving a change in the type of space which  
is succeeding, with a growing emphasis on 
flexibility, co-working and wellbeing, as well  
as environments which are compatible with  
the way people’s work and leisure time overlap. 
Financial services accounted for under 20%  
of take up, less than half the figure in 2010.  
This trend may accelerate further with 
regulatory and policy changes following Brexit, 
but the feedback we have is that the preference  
of financial services companies is to retain the 
majority of their operations in London because 
overwhelmingly this is where their employees 
want to live and work.

Our strategy focuses on providing the right 
space, the right services, and the right 
environments to meet this broader spectrum  
of demand. We have engaged more actively  
with the users of our space, and this year, 
launched the ‘Office Agenda’ an online  
platform where we share key insights with 
workers and decision makers on topical issues 
including the role of real estate in attracting  
and retaining talent and ‘smart’ offices.  
Our surveys of nearly 4,000 office workers  
and decision makers provided valuable  
insight into what makes a great place to  
work, helping our occupiers refine their  
office strategy and enabling us to better  
reflect their needs. 
At the portfolio level, this includes broadening 
the range of uses on our campuses with a 
higher allocation to retail and leisure, as well  
as delivering more flexible office space with 
floorplates which are easily divisible, enabling 
us to target a wider range of occupiers. At the 
campus level, we are applying our placemaking 
framework by enhancing and enlivening our 
assets with a comprehensive programme of 
events including exhibitions, art installations, 
concerts, wellbeing activities, pop-up shops, 
bars, markets and restaurants, and live 
screening of sports, theatre and film. We also 
partner with our occupiers on community 
initiatives, such as the Regent’s Place 
Community Fund, where our partnership  
with occupiers has invested £30,000 this year  
to support local community projects, making a 
positive difference and strengthening our links 
with local communities. We survey occupiers 
across our campuses and our results show that 
satisfaction levels are high, and have improved 
over the last two years, particularly amongst 
key decision makers. 
The success of our approach is demonstrated 
by our leasing activity, which this year totalled 
279,000 sq ft, 1.4% ahead of ERV. 33,000 sq ft 
related to retail, leisure or community space. 
We have let a further 85,000 sq ft on a short 
term or meanwhile basis, adding uses which 
enliven our campuses and address lease 
expiries while preserving optionality for 
redevelopment. We were pleased that a  
number of our major occupiers re-committed  
to our campuses in the year, including 
Facebook who have agreed terms to further 
extend their occupation of 106,000 sq ft at 10 
Brock Street. At 20 Triton Street, Dimensional 
Fund Advisors have agreed to a re-gear, taking 
their term to 10 years (original expiry June 
2020), with an additional 12,000 sq ft and  
Credit Agricole have agreed to extend their 
140,000 sq ft lease at Broadwalk House from 
2019 to 2025. This activity, as well as the final 
lettings at Marble Arch House and The 
Leadenhall Building has increased like-for-like 
rent across the office portfolio by 4.5%.
We are also letting well across our recently 
completed and near term pipeline whilst 
successfully expanding our mix of uses. At  
4 Kingdom Street, Paddington Central, we  
were almost 80% under offer on the office 
space within a week of completion in April.  
In aggregate, these leases are on terms 3% 
ahead of pre-referendum net effective ERVs 
and over 25% ahead of our Investment 
Committee assumptions at commitment in 
2014. We have signed a two year lease with 
Pergola Paddington Central for an 850-capacity 
pop-up dining destination on the site of 5 
Kingdom Street. The venue will feature some  
of London’s most popular restaurants and 
bars, including Patty & Bun, DF / Mexico and 
Raw Press and the offering will change each 
season. At Broadgate, we are addressing 
vacancies at 2 Finsbury Avenue with 90,000  
sq ft of short term lettings, including to  
Theatre Delicatessen, a fintech company  
and an architecture practice.

We started on site at 100 Liverpool Street in  
the year. It sits at the gateway to our Broadgate 
campus, adjacent to Liverpool Street station 
where the first Crossrail services will 
commence next year. It covers 520,000 sq ft  
(an increase of 140,000 sq ft) and is designed  
to be divisible into units as small as 3,000 sq ft 
with shared facilities catering to demand from 
smaller businesses. 90,000 sq ft is allocated  
to retail and restaurants, and we are  
committed to both the WELL standard for 
wellbeing and the WiredScore Platinum rating 
for internet connectivity and infrastructure.  
This development is a good illustration of  
our strategy in Offices to deliver buildings 
which meet evolving customer needs and 
appeal to a broader range of occupiers.  
The redevelopment is expected to more  
than double rents at the building. 
The next phase of development will see the  
mix of uses continue to evolve. Our revised 
plans for a 288,000 sq ft refurbishment at  
1 Finsbury Avenue include a cinema, retail  
and restaurants at ground floor, and our 
proposals at 135 Bishopsgate allocate 43,000 
sq ft to retail. We have submitted plans for 
refurbishment of these buildings, and are in 
discussions with prospective occupiers on 
nearly half of the combined space. We expect  
to commit to both refurbishments in the  
coming months with an associated cost of  
£90 million. At Paddington Central, we are  
in advanced negotiations with an operator  
to pre-let a boutique hotel and all day dining 
concept on the site of the existing management 
suite (the Gateway Building). At Regent’s Place 
we are pleased that we are under offer on 
310,000 sq ft representing all of the office  
space at our proposed redevelopment of  
1 Triton Square, and received approval from  
the London Borough of Camden last week. 
This means that across our campuses,  
we are under offer or in advanced negotiations 
on over 700,000 sq ft of space with significant 
discussions ongoing across the London 
business with potential occupiers on a further 
850,000 sq ft of space, which could trigger 
further development commitments. 
As part of our campus offering we will  
shortly launch a branded flexible workspace 
offer which enables us to capture incremental 
demand from the increasing number of small 
businesses taking space in London as well  
as meeting a growing need amongst our 
existing occupiers for flexible space for specific 
projects and teams. Our first flexible deal is  
on 25,000 sq ft at 2 Finsbury Avenue, extending 
our relationship with an existing occupier  
at Paddington Central, who need additional 
space for their digital team. This initiative 
strengthens existing relationships and attracts 
new occupiers to our campus, potentially our 
core occupiers of the future. We have allocated 
further space across our campuses including 
at 4 Kingdom Street, and we have commenced 
fit-out across 80,000 sq ft.
Following the exchange of The Leadenhall 
Building, our standalone office portfolio 
accounts for 22% of Offices. At 7 Clarges 
Street, the 51,000 sq ft office element of our 
mixed use development in Mayfair, we were 
pleased that over 80% of the space was let  
or under offer just four months after its  
launch in September. We achieved an  
average rent of £113 psf, on terms in line  
with pre-referendum net effective ERVs, 
demonstrating the continuing demand for 
quality office space in London. At Yalding  
House (29,000 sq ft) we have let four of the  
six floors and are under offer on the final  
two. Like The Leadenhall Building, these  
are buildings where we can develop and  
trade opportunistically, to provide liquidity  
in our portfolio and enhance returns.
37 British Land  Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Carbon reporting
We actively manage greenhouse gas emissions 
across our business. Our energy efficiency 
programme has saved occupiers £13 million 
gross over six years and we’re committed to 
using 100% electricity from renewable sources.
    British Land was included in the CDP 
Climate A List of the top 9% of global 
companies tackling climate change. 
Our target to cut carbon intensity by 55%  
by 2020 versus 2009 (index scored) exceeds 
science-based targets, reflecting our support 
for the COP21 commitment to limit global 
warming to 2°C. 
We have reported on all emission sources 
required under the Companies Act 2006 
(Strategic Report and Directors’ Reports) 
Regulations 2013. These sources fall within our 
consolidated financial statement and relate to 
head office activities and controlled emissions 
from our managed portfolio. Scope 1 and 2 
emissions covers 97% of our multi-let managed 
portfolio by value. We have used purchased 
energy consumption data, the GHG Protocol 
Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard 
(revised edition) and emission factors from the 
UK Government’s GHG Conversion Factors for 
Company Reporting 2016.
Emission from combustion of fuels has 
increased by 1%, largely due to weather 
affecting gas use in Offices. Emissions from 
purchased electricity has decreased by 12%, 
largely due to changes in UK grid emission  
factors and changes in our portfolio.
For consistency with previous years, carbon  
data in this Report is calculated using  
the location based methodology. When the 
market based methodology is applied, our 
carbon emissions reduce by 28,000 tonnes, 
factoring in that most of the electricity we 
purchase comes from renewable sources 
(REGO backed).
As the graph opposite shows, Scope 3 emissions 
associated with our places are significantly 
larger than the Scope 1 and 2 emissions that  
we have more influence over. Scope 3 emissions 
come from activities that we don’t directly 
manage, such as visitors travelling by car  
to shopping destinations, occupiers’ energy  
use in the space they lease from us and the 
manufacture of construction materials for 
developments. By understanding and monitoring 
Scope 3, we identify and prepare for future risks 
from shifts in energy and carbon regulation  
and, at the same time, take steps to reduce  
our impact on climate change.

Opportunities and risks
We commissioned a review of climate related 
opportunities and risks in 2017. Our portfolio is 
well positioned through our futureproofing focus.
Opportunities include:
 – Anticipating occupier demand for climate 
resilient properties
 – Delivering energy and carbon cost savings 
(2017: £13m gross)
 – Generating on site energy (2017: 2,588MWh)
 – Outperforming Building Regulations  
(2012-2017: 21.2% better on average)
Risks include:
 – Rising energy costs
 – Energy and carbon taxation, such as  
the CRC Energy Efficiency Scheme
 – Climate legislation, such as Minimum 
Energy Efficiency Standards (2017: 4%  
of portfolio at risk
 – Flood risks, impacting on asset value  
and insurance costs (2017: 3% of  
portfolio high risk)
 – Cost increases linked with carbon-intensive 
construction materials

CLIMATE RELATED PERFORMANCE It’s been an active year with £2 billion  
of capital activity, increasing financial 
capacity and providing flexibility to invest 
in opportunities within the portfolio
Overview
We delivered a good set of results especially in the context of an 
uncertain environment, with Underlying Profit growth of 7.4% and 
underlying earnings per share (EPS) growth of 10.9%.
EPRA net asset value per share (NAV) decreased by 0.4% reflecting a 
portfolio valuation fall of 1.4% on a proportionally consolidated basis. It 
also includes the impact of no longer treating the 1.5% convertible bond 
as dilutive, as the share price was below the exchange price of 693 pence 
at the year end. Excluding this adjustment, NAV decreased by 1.7%.
We have been active, with £2.0 billion of gross capital activity (£1.1 billion 
of net capital activity). This comprises £1.5 billion of disposals of primarily 
single-let Retail assets and our 50% interest in The Leadenhall Building 
which completes after the year end. We have reinvested £0.3 billion in our 
developments and capital expenditure across the portfolio, and made 
£0.2 billion of acquisitions, primarily of assets adjacent to existing holdings. 
The net proceeds from this activity improve our financial resilience and 
provide capacity for reinvestment into our portfolio, particularly on the 
broad range of development opportunities within our existing pipeline. 
The proportionally consolidated loan to value ratio (LTV) has decreased 
to 29.9% from 32.1% at March 2016. Our actions have reduced the 
proportionally consolidated weighted average interest rate to 3.1%  
from 3.3% at March 2016. Adjusting for the receipt of proceeds from  
the sale of our 50% interest in The Leadenhall Building, LTV is 26.9%  
and the weighted average interest rate is 3.4%. 
Underlying Profit increased by 7.4% to £390 million; the impact of net 
sales has been more than offset by like-for-like rental growth, financing 
activity and a reduction in administrative expenses. The Group’s operating 
cost ratio has reduced by 100 bps to 15.6% (2015/16: 16.6%).
IFRS profit before tax for the year of £195 million is lower than the prior 
year profit of £1,331 million, primarily due to the negative property 
valuation movement in the year.
As previously announced in May 2016, we increased the dividend for  
the year ended 31 March 2017 by 3.0%. Looking forward to next year  
we intend to increase the dividend by a further 3.0% to 30.08 pence  
per share, with a quarterly dividend of 7.52 pence per share. 
Presentation of financial information
The Group financial statements are prepared under IFRS where  
the Group’s interests in joint ventures and funds are shown as a  
single line item on the income statement and balance sheet and  
all subsidiaries are consolidated at 100%.
Management considers the business principally on a proportionally 
consolidated basis when setting the strategy, determining annual 
priorities, making investment and financing decisions and reviewing 
performance. This includes the Group’s share of joint ventures and  
funds on a line-by-line basis and excludes non-controlling interests  
in the Group’s subsidiaries. The financial key performance indicators  
are also presented on this basis.

FINANCIAL REVIEW A summary income statement and summary balance sheet which 
reconcile the Group income statements to British Land’s interests  
on a proportionally consolidated basis are included in Table A within  
the supplementary disclosures.
Management monitors Underlying Profit as this more accurately  
reflects the Group’s financial performance and the underlying recurring 
performance of our core property rental activity, as opposed to IFRS 
metrics which include the non-cash valuation movement on the property 
portfolio. It is based on the Best Practices Recommendations of the 
European Public Real Estate Association (EPRA) which are widely  
used alternate metrics to their IFRS equivalents.
Management also monitors EPRA NAV as this provides a transparent 
and consistent basis to enable comparison between European property 
companies. Linked to this, the use of Total Accounting Return allows 
management to monitor return to shareholders based on movements  
in a consistently applied metric, being EPRA NAV, and dividends paid.
Loan to value (proportionally consolidated) is also monitored by 
management as a key measure of the level of debt employed by the 
Group to meet its strategic objectives, along with a measurement  
of risk. It also allows comparison to other property companies  
who similarly monitor and report this measure. 
Income statement
1. Underlying Profit
Underlying Profit is the measure that is used internally to assess  
income performance. No company adjustments have been made in the 
current or prior year and therefore this is the same as the pre-tax EPRA 
earnings measure which includes a number of adjustments to the IFRS 
reported profit before tax. This is presented below on a proportionally 
consolidated basis:

2017
The £10 million decrease in net rental income during the year was the 
result of like-for-like growth and leasing of developments partially 
offsetting the impact of capital activity and lease expiries.
Like-for-like rental income growth was 2.9% excluding the impact of 
surrender premia. Retail growth was 2.0% (1.6% including the impact  
of surrender premia). This was driven by strong leasing activity, asset 
management activities, such as splitting units, and additional turnover 
and car park income. 
Office and Residential like-for-like growth was 4.5%; just over half  
of this was due to the letting up of completed developments that are  
now in the like-for-like portfolio, predominantly The Leadenhall Building 
and Marble Arch House which are both now full. The remainder is 
attributable to strong rent review activity, particularly at Regent’s Place. 
Lease expiries relating to properties in our development pipeline 
reduced net rents by £8 million, including £3 million at 100 Liverpool 
Street where we are on site and £3 million at 1 Triton Square which  
is under offer for redevelopment on a pre-let basis; we have received 
approval for this development from the London Borough of Camden.  
The successful letting of our recently completed development 
programme provided £10 million of additional rent this year.  
This brings the net impact of developments on net rental income  
to £2 million.
Looking ahead to next year, we expect transactions completing  
post year end to reduce rent by £18 million and future lease expiries 
relating to properties in the development pipeline to reduce rent  
by £6 million. Rental income growth will be driven by the letting  
up of developments and like-for-like growth.

FINANCIAL REVIEW CONTINUED In proposing the dividend for the coming year, the Board took into account 
the current market environment, our target payout range and drivers of 
next year’s profits. It is the Board’s intention to increase the dividend by 
3.0% in 2017/18 to 30.08 pence per share, with a quarterly dividend of  
7.52 pence per share, reflecting confidence in our ability to grow income 
over the medium term.

The 0.4% decrease in EPRA NAV per share reflects a valuation decline  
of 1.4%. Values fell by 2.8% in the first six months, followed by an upward 
revaluation of 1.6% in the second half of the year. The movement in the 
year reflected outward yield movement of 15 bps, partially offset by  
ERV growth of 1.1%. Net sales exchanged of over £1.5 billion, including 
Debenhams, Oxford Street and The Leadenhall Building, provided a 
positive contribution to the portfolio capital return of 0.9%.
Financing costs were £29 million lower this year.
Debt related transactions over the last two years, including the £350 
million zero coupon convertible bond, reduced costs by £16 million this 
year. In the current year, we used sales proceeds to repay unsecured 
revolving credit facilities and we completed the early repayment of the 
£295 million TBL Properties Limited secured loan. We agreed one year 
extensions on a total of £1.4 billion of our unsecured facilities and agreed 
a new £100 million bilateral facility. Our liability management, which  
is NPV positive, reduced NAV by 4 pence per share.
Our approach to interest rate management remains an important factor 
in reducing interest costs. The decision to keep a portion of our debt at 
floating rates has seen us benefit from lower market rates which has 
resulted in a reduction in financing costs of £9 million. The proportion  
of our projected debt held at fixed rates is 60% on average over the  
next five years. At 31 March 2017, our debt pro forma for the sale of the 
Leadenhall Building was 78% fixed on a spot basis. 
1.3 Administration expenses
Administrative expenses decreased by £8 million this year as a result  
of managing down our cost base and lower variable pay. The Group’s 
operating cost ratio has reduced by 100 bps to 15.6% (2015/16: 16.6%).
1.4 Underlying EPS
Underlying EPS was 37.8 pence (2015/16: 34.1 pence) based on Underlying 
Profit after tax of £390 million (2015/16: £363 million). The increase in 
underlying EPS of 10.9% is more than the increase in Underlying Profit  
of 7.4% as the 1.5% convertible bond is no longer dilutive. As the share 
price was below the 693 pence exchange price at year end, no dilution 
adjustment was made (2015/16: £6 million interest added back and  
shares increased by 57.8 million), in line with EPRA guidance. 
2. IFRS profit before tax
The main difference between IFRS profit before tax and Underlying Profit 
is that it includes the valuation movement on investment and development 
properties and the fair value movements of financial instruments.  
In addition, the Group’s investments in joint ventures and funds are  
equity accounted in the IFRS income statement but are included on  
a proportionally consolidated basis within Underlying Profit. 
The IFRS profit before tax for the year was £195 million, compared  
to a profit before tax for the prior year of £1,331 million. This reflects  
the valuation movement on the Group’s properties which was  
£760 million less than the prior year and the valuation movement  
on the properties held in joint ventures and funds which was £338  
million less than the prior year, in both cases resulting from outward 
yield shift and a lower level of ERV growth in the current year.
IFRS basic EPS was 18.8 pence per share, compared to 131.2 pence  
per share in the prior year, driven principally by property valuation 
movements. The basic weighted average number of shares in issue 
during the year was 1,029 million (2015/16: 1,025 million).
3. Dividends
In line with the intention announced in May 2016, we increased the 
dividend by 3.0% for the year to March 2017 which gives a full year 
dividend of 29.20 pence per share. 
The fourth interim dividend payment for the quarter ended 31 March 2017 
will be 7.30 pence per share. Payment will be made on 4 August 2017  
to shareholders on the register at close of business on 30 June 2017.
The increase in Underlying EPS of 10.9% resulted in a reduction  
in the dividend pay-out ratio to 77% (2015/16: 83%).
41 British Land  Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Net divestment including transactions completing after the year end 
increased to £1.1 billion. This includes the expected completion of the 
sale of The Leadenhall Building sale for £575 million (British Land share) 
and the completion of the Tesco JV swap transaction resulting in a net 
divestment of £73 million of superstore assets.
We received a £10 million capital payment received in December 2016 
from UBS in relation to the development and occupation of 5 Broadgate, 
and subsequent exit of 100 Liverpool Street, including 8-10 Broadgate.

  Group data as presented in note 17 of the financial statements. The proportionally 
consolidated figures include the Group’s share of joint venture and funds’ net debt 
and exclude the mark-to-market on effective cash flow hedges and related debt 
adjustments and non-controlling interests. 
The balance sheet remains resilient. LTV and weighted average interest 
rate on drawn debt were reduced and interest cover improved. Our 
proportionally consolidated LTV was 29.9% at 31 March 2017, down 220 
bps from 32.1% at March 2016 mainly reflecting the impact of disposals. 
This reduces by a further 300 bps to 26.9% pro forma for the sale of The 
Leadenhall Building. Note 17 of the financial statements sets out the 
calculation of the Group and proportionally consolidated LTV.
The strength of the Group’s balance sheet is reflected in British Land’s 
senior unsecured credit rating which continues to be rated by Fitch at  
A- with the Outlook upgraded to ‘Positive’.
Our proportionally consolidated weighted average interest rate reduced 
to 3.1% at 31 March 2017 from 3.3% at 31 March 2016. This reflects  
a 60 bps reduction principally as a result of our financing activity  
and decisions, partially offset by a rise of 40 bps due to repayment  
of cheaper facilities with sales proceeds received. This increases  
to 3.4% pro forma for the sale of The Leadenhall Building.
Our weighted average debt maturity is eight years.
British Land has £1.8 billion of committed unsecured revolving banking 
facilities. Of these facilities, £1.7 billion have maturities of more than  
two years and £1.3 billion was undrawn at 31 March 2017. Based on our 
current commitments, these facilities and scheduled debt maturities,  
we have no requirement to refinance until early 2021 regardless of 
whether our convertible bonds are cash or equity settled.
Further information on our approach to financing is provided in the 
Financial policies and principles section on pages 43 to 45.
Lucinda Bell
Chief Financial Officer
Retail valuations were down 1.8% with outward yield movement of  
14 bps partially offset by ERV growth of 1.6%; the multi-let portfolio saw 
stronger ERV growth of 2.4%, driven by good leasing activity. Further 
information on Retail valuation performance can be found on page 32. 
Office and Residential valuations were down 0.5% with outward yield 
movement of 15 bps partially offset by ERV growth of 0.5%; We agreed 
the sale of The Leadenhall Building at a price 24% ahead of the 30 
September 2016 valuation and the valuers have recognised the majority  
of this increase in the 31 March 2017 valuation. Further information on 
Office & Residential valuation performance can be found on page 35.
The 4 pence impact of finance transaction costs primarily relates to early 
repayment of term debt and termination of associated interest rate swaps. 
There is a 12 pence benefit to EPRA NAV due to the reversal of the  
1.5% convertible bond dilution included in the 2015/16 results. As the 
share price was below the 693 pence exchange price at year end, no 
dilution adjustment was made (2015/16: £400 million debt deducted from 
net asset value and diluted number of shares increased by 57.8 million). 
Excluding this adjustment, NAV decreased by 1.7%.
5. IFRS net assets
IFRS net assets at 31 March 2017 were £9,476 million, a decrease of  
£143 million from 31 March 2016. This was primarily due to IFRS profit 
before tax of £195 million being less than the dividends paid in the year  
of £296 million.

  Adjusted net debt is a proportionally consolidated measure. It represents the 
Group net debt as disclosed in Note 17 and the Group’s share of joint venture  
and funds’ net debt excluding the mark-to-market on effective cash flow hedges 
and related debt adjustments and non-controlling interests. A reconciliation 
between the Group net debt and adjusted net debt is included in Table A within 
the supplementary disclosures.
Capital activity reduced debt by £0.5 billion in the year. Completed 
disposals during the year included the sale of Debenhams, Oxford Street 
for £400 million, a portfolio of non-core Retail assets for £191 million and 
eight superstores totalling £111 million (British Land share). Acquisitions 
completed in the year included the New George Street Estate in Plymouth 
for £64 million which will now be managed as an integrated part of  
Drake Circus. Other investments included development expenditure  
of £189 million and capital expenditure of £74 million related to asset 
management on the standing portfolio. 
Strategic Report
42 British Land  Annual Report and Accounts 2017
FINANCIAL REVIEW CONTINUED Leverage
We manage our use of debt and equity finance  
to balance the benefits of leverage against the 
risks, including a magnification of property 
valuation movements. A loan to value ratio 
(‘LTV’) measures our leverage, primarily on  
a proportionally consolidated basis including 
our share of joint ventures and funds and 
excluding non-controlling interests. At 31 
March 2017, our proportionally consolidated 
LTV of 29.9% was higher than the Group 
measure of 22.6%.
We aim to manage our LTV through the property 
cycle such that our financial position would 
remain robust in the event of a significant fall  
in property values. This means we do not adjust 
our approach to leverage based on changes  
in property market yields. Consequently our 
LTV may be higher in the low point in the  
cycle and will trend downwards as market 
yields tighten.
Debt finance
The scale of our business combined with the 
quality of our assets and rental income means 
that we are able to approach a diverse range of  
debt providers to arrange finance on attractive 
terms. Good access to the capital and debt 
markets is a competitive advantage, allowing  
us to take opportunities when they arise.
The Group’s approach to debt financing for 
British Land is to raise funds predominantly on 
an unsecured basis with our standard financial 
covenants (set out on page 45). This provides 
flexibility and low operational cost. Our joint 
ventures and funds are each financed in 
‘ring-fenced’ structures without recourse  
to British Land for repayment and are  
secured on the relevant assets.
Presented on the following page are the  
five guiding principles that govern the way  
we structure and manage debt.
Monitoring and controlling our debt
We monitor our debt requirement by focusing 
principally on current and projected borrowing 
levels, available facilities, debt maturity and 
interest rate exposure. We undertake sensitivity 
analysis to assess the impacts of proposed 
transactions, movements in interest rates  
and changes in property values on key balance 
sheet, liquidity and profitability ratios. We  
also consider the risks of a reduction in the 
availability of finance, including a temporary 
disruption of the debt markets.
Based on our current commitments and 
available facilities, the Group has no requirement 
to refinance until early 2021 (irrespective of 
whether the settlement of the 1.5% 2012 
convertible bond is with equity or debt). 
British Land’s committed bank facilities total 
£1.8 billion, of which £1.3 billion was undrawn 
at 31 March 2017.
  For more on managing our risks, including 
financial risks, see pages 46 to 53.
Managing interest rate exposure
We manage our interest rate profile 
independently from our debt, considering the 
sensitivity of underlying earnings to movements 
in market rates of interest over a five year 
period. The Board sets appropriate ranges  
of hedged debt over that period and the  
longer term.
Our debt finance is raised at both fixed and 
variable rates. Derivatives (primarily interest rate 
swaps and caps) are used to achieve the desired 
interest rate profile across proportionally 
consolidated net debt. Currently 60% on average 
of projected net debt is hedged over the next five 
years, with a decreasing profile over that period. 
The use of derivatives is managed by a Derivatives 
Committee, using delegated authority from the 
Board. The interest rate management of joint 
ventures and funds is considered separately  
by each entity’s Board, taking into account 
appropriate factors for its business.
Counterparties
We monitor the credit standing of our 
counterparties to minimise our risk exposure  
in placing cash deposits and arranging 
derivatives. Regular reviews are made of the 
external credit ratings of the counterparties.
Foreign currency
Our policy is to have no material unhedged  
net assets or liabilities denominated in  
foreign currencies. 
When attractive terms are available, the  
Group may choose to borrow in currencies 
other than Sterling, and will fully hedge the 
foreign currency exposure.
We focus on having an appropriate 
balance of debt and equity funding 
which enables us to deliver our 
property strategy
43 British Land  Annual Report and Accounts 2017
FINANCIAL POLICIES AND PRINCIPLES Our five guiding principles
Diversify 
our sources  
of finance
We monitor finance markets and seek to access different sources of finance when the relevant market conditions are favourable 
to meet the needs of our business and, where appropriate, those of our joint ventures and funds. The scale and quality of our 
business enables us to access a broad range of unsecured and secured, recourse and non-recourse debt. 
We develop and maintain long term relationships with banks and debt investors. We aim to avoid reliance on particular sources  
of funds and borrow from a large number of lenders from different sectors in the market across a range of geographical areas, 
with a total of 30 debt providers in bank facilities and private placements alone. We work to ensure that debt providers understand 
our business, adopting a transparent approach to provide sufficient disclosures to enable them to evaluate their exposure within 
the overall context of the Group. These factors increase our attractiveness to debt providers, and in the last five years we have 
arranged £4.6 billion (British Land share £3.9 billion) of new finance in unsecured and secured bank loan facilities, US Private 
Placements and convertible bonds. In addition we have existing long dated debentures and securitisation bonds. A European 
Medium Term Note programme has also been maintained to enable us to access Sterling/Euro unsecured bond markets  
when it is appropriate for our business.
£4.5bn
total drawn debt (proportionally consolidated)
Phase 
maturity  
of debt 
portfolio
The maturity profile of our debt is managed with a spread of repayment dates, reducing our refinancing risk in respect of timing 
and market conditions. We monitor the various debt markets so that we have the ability to act quickly to arrange new finance  
as opportunities arise which meet our business needs. As a result of our financing activity, we are comfortably ahead of our 
preferred refinancing date horizon of not less than two years.
The current range of debt maturities is within one to 19 years. In accordance with our usual practice, we expect to refinance 
facilities ahead of their maturities.
7.7 years
average debt maturity (proportionally consolidated)
Maintain 
liquidity
In addition to our drawn debt, we always aim to have a good level of undrawn, committed, unsecured revolving bank facilities. 
These facilities provide financial liquidity, reduce the need to hold resources in cash and deposits, and minimise costs arising 
from the difference between borrowing and deposit rates, while reducing credit exposure.
We arrange these revolving credit facilities in excess of our committed and expected requirements to ensure we have adequate 
financing availability to support business requirements and new opportunities.
£1.3bn
undrawn revolving credit facilities
Maintain 
flexibility
Our facilities are structured to provide valuable flexibility for investment activity execution, whether sales, purchases, 
developments or asset management initiatives. Our revolving credit facilities provide full operational flexibility of drawing and 
repayment (and cancellation if we require) at short notice without additional cost. These are arranged with standard terms and 
financial covenants and generally have maturities of five years. Alongside this unsecured revolving debt our secured term debt in 
debentures has good asset security substitution rights, where we have the ability to move assets in and out of the security pool.

We use both debt and equity financing. We aim to manage LTV through the property cycle such that our financial position would

in property market yields. 
We manage our interest rate profile independently from our debt, setting appropriate ranges of hedged debt over a five year 
period and the longer term.

FINANCIAL POLICIES AND PRINCIPLES CONTINUED Group borrowings
Unsecured financing for the Group includes 
bilateral and syndicated revolving bank facilities 
(with initial terms usually of five years, often 
extendable); US Private Placements with 
maturities up to 2027; and the convertible  
bonds maturing in 2017 and 2020.
Secured debt for the Group (excluding debt 
in Hercules Unit Trust which is covered under 
‘Borrowings in our joint ventures and funds’) 
is provided by debentures with longer maturities 
up to 2035. 
Unsecured borrowings and covenants
The same financial covenants apply across  
each of the Group’s unsecured facilities. 
These covenants, which have been consistently 
agreed with all unsecured lenders since  
2003, are:
 – Net Borrowings not to exceed 175%  
of Adjusted Capital and Reserves
 – Net Unsecured Borrowings not to  
exceed 70% of Unencumbered Assets
No income or interest cover ratios apply  
to these facilities, and there are no other 
unsecured debt financial covenants in  
the Group.
The Unencumbered Assets of the Group, not 
subject to any security, stood at £6.6 billion  
as at 31 March 2017.
Although secured assets are excluded  
from Unencumbered Assets for the covenant 
calculations, unsecured lenders benefit from the 
surplus value of these assets above the related 
debt and the free cash flow from them. During 
the year ended 31 March 2017, these assets 
generated £49 million of surplus cash after 
payment of interest. In addition, while 
investments in joint ventures do not form part  
of Unencumbered Assets, our share of free 
cash flows generated by these ventures are 
regularly passed up to the Group.
Secured borrowings
Secured debt with recourse to British Land is 
provided by debentures at fixed interest rates 
with long maturities and limited amortisation. 
These are secured against a combined pool of 
assets with common covenants; the value of 
those assets is required to cover the amount  
of these debentures by a minimum of 1.5 times 
and net rental income must cover the interest 
at least once. We use our rights under the 
debentures to withdraw, substitute or add 
properties (or cash collateral) in the security 
pool, in order to manage these cover ratios 
effectively and deal with any asset sales.
Secured debt without recourse to British  
Land comprises a fixed rate debenture of £30 
million for BLD Property Holdings Ltd to 2020 
secured by a small portfolio of properties.
The £295 million secured bank loan for TBL 
Properties Limited (and its subsidiaries) was 
repaid early on 30 September 2016.
Borrowings in our joint ventures and funds
External debt for our joint ventures and  
funds has been arranged through long dated 
securitisations or secured bank debt, according 
to the requirements of the business of  
each venture.
Hercules Unit Trust and its joint ventures have 
term loan facilities maturing in 2019 and 2020

For British Land, effective risk management  
is a cornerstone of delivering our strategy  
and integral to the achievement of our objective 
of delivering sustainable long term value. We 
maintain a comprehensive risk management 
process which serves to identify, assess and 
respond to the principal risks facing our 
business, including those risks that could 
threaten the Group’s solvency and liquidity, as 
well as identifying emerging risks. Our approach 
is not intended to eliminate risk entirely, but 
instead to manage our risk exposures across 
the business, whilst at the same time making 
the most of our opportunities.
Our risk management framework
Our integrated approach combines a top  
down strategic view with a complementary 
bottom up operational process outlined in  
the diagram on page 47. 
The Board is responsible for the overall 
approach to risk management with a particular  
focus on determining the nature and extent  
of exposure to principal risks it is willing to  
take in achieving its strategic objectives.  
This is assessed in the context of the core 
strengths of our business (as summarised on 
the right) and the external environment in 
which we operate – this is our risk appetite. 
The Audit Committee takes responsibility for 
overseeing the effectiveness of risk management 
and internal control systems on behalf of the 
Board, and also advises the Board on the 
principal risks facing the Group including those 
that would threaten its solvency or liquidity.
The Executive Directors are responsible for 
delivering the Company’s strategy and managing 
risk. Our risk management framework 
categorises our risks into external, strategic  
and operational risks and the Risk Committee 
(comprising the Executive Directors and chaired 
by the Chief Financial Officer) is responsible for 
managing the principal risks in each category in 
order to achieve the Group’s performance goals.
Whilst responsibility for oversight of risk 
management rests with the Board, the effective 
day-to-day management of risk is embedded 
within our operational business units and  
forms an integral part of how we work. This 
bottom up approach ensures potential risks  
are identified at an early stage and escalated  
as appropriate with mitigations put in place  
to manage such risks. Each business unit 
maintains a comprehensive risk register which  
is reviewed quarterly by the Risk Committee, 
with significant and emerging risks escalated  
to the Audit Committee. 
  To read more about the Board and  
Audit Committee’s risk oversight,

Strategic Report
MANAGING RISK IN DELIVERING OUR STRATEGY Our risk appetite
The Group’s risk appetite is reviewed annually 
as part of the annual strategy review process 
and approved by the Board. This evaluation 
guides the actions we take in executing our 
strategy. We have identified a suite of Key Risk 
Indicators (KRIs) to monitor the Group’s risk 
profile (as summarised on the left), which  
are reviewed quarterly by the Risk Committee, 
to ensure that the activities of the business 
remain within our risk appetite and that our  
risk exposure is well matched to changes in  
our business and our markets. These include 
the most significant judgements affecting  
our risk exposure, including our asset  
selection and investment strategy; the level  
of occupational and development exposure  
and our financial leverage.
The Board has considered the Group’s risk 
appetite in light of the outcome of the UK’s 
referendum on continued membership of  
the EU. Our strategy, which is based on  
long term trends, endures; we had already 
positioned the business for a range of outcomes 
with modest development exposure, high 
occupancy and robust finances. However, we 
have a range of tactical levers to address the 
evolving political and economic uncertainties.
We have moderated our development activity, 
reflecting increased uncertainty. We reduced  
our internal risk metric for the maximum  
we will develop speculatively from 10% of  
the portfolio to 8%, although our current 
exposure is much lower at 4%.
Our financial position is strong; our 
proportionally consolidated LTV has reduced to 
29.9% reflecting asset sales and our financing 
has an average term of eight years on drawn 
debt with no requirement to refinance until 
early 2021. 
The Board considers that the Group’s  
risk appetite is appropriate to achieve 
our strategic objectives. Our business is  
both resilient and well placed to capture  
value in the long term.

47 British Land  Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Our changing risks and focus 
The Board has undertaken a robust assessment 
of the principal risks and uncertainties that the 
Group is exposed to in light of the long term 
trends we are facing (see pages 12 and 13) and 
in light of the EU referendum result. Several of 
our principal risks are elevated as a result of the 
increased political and economic uncertainty 
(as shown by the risk heat map above). 
Looking forward, risks that also could be 
impacted while the terms and timing of exit are 
negotiated, and potentially beyond are: investor 
and occupier demand, availability of finance, 
execution of investment strategy and income 
sustainability. We remain mindful of potential 
headwinds going forward and our risk appetite 
and tactical decisions will reflect the evolving 
environment to ensure the business remains 
both resilient and well positioned to capture 
upside in the future. 
Also, several of our principal risks have evolved 
in nature; the regulatory environment is now 
recognised within a broader ‘Political and 
Regulatory Outlook’ risk; and the ‘Development 
Strategy’ risk has been expanded to include 
development cost inflation.
Other areas of focus for the Risk 
Committee during the year included:
 – Culture
 – Cyber security
 – Asset level crisis plan 
 – Fraud and whistleblowing 
 – Effectiveness review of our risk process
During the year, we have undertaken an 
effectiveness review of our risk management 
process, as well as an internal audit. Our risk 
management process appropriately  
supports the effective management  
of risks, whilst maintaining a practical  
approach and meeting the requirements  
of the UK Corporate Governance Code. 
We have built on our existing process by 
embedding risk management discussions  
in the relevant business unit management 
committees and provided training for our  
risk specialists across the business. 
This year we hosted a major civil contingencies 
exercise simulating a large scale critical 
incident at one of our multi-let retail assets. 
This was undertaken with support from several 
police forces, fire and ambulance and other 
national agencies and enabled us to test our 
capabilities and preparedness in the event  
of a significant emergency.

Strategic Report
MANAGING RISK IN DELIVERING OUR STRATEGY CONTINUED Viability statement
Assessment of prospects
The Group’s annual corporate planning 
process includes the completion of a strategic 
review, reassessing the Group’s risk appetite 
and updating the Group’s forecasts. 
The Group’s strategy provides the focus for  
our annual priorities and is formally reviewed 
annually. This process is led by the Chief 
Executive through the Executive Committee and 
includes the active engagement of the Board. 
Part of the Board’s role is to consider whether 
the strategy takes appropriate account of the 
Group’s principal risks. The latest updates  
to the strategic plan and Group's risk appetite  
were approved by the Board in March 2017.
The strategy and risk appetite drive the 
Group’s forecasts. These cover a five year 
period and consist of a base case forecast 
which includes committed transactions only, 
and a forecast which also includes non-
committed transactions the Board expects  
the Group to make in line with the Group’s 
strategy. A five year forecast is considered to 
be the optimal balance between the Group’s 
long term business model to create Places 
People Prefer and the fact that property 
investment is a long term business (with 
weighted average lease lengths and debt 
maturities in excess of five years), offset by the 
progressively unreliable nature of forecasting 
in later years, particularly given the historically 
cyclical nature of the UK property industry. 
Assessment of viability
For the reasons outlined above, the period over 
which the Directors consider it feasible and 
appropriate to report on the Group’s viability  
is the five year period to 31 March 2022. 
The assumptions underpinning these forecast 
cash flows and covenant compliance forecasts 
were sensitised to explore the resilience  
of the Group to the potential impact of the  
Group’s significant risks, or a combination  
of those risks.
The principal risks table which follows on 
pages 50 to 53 summarises those matters 
that could prevent the Group from delivering 
on its strategy. A number of these principal 
risks, because of their nature or potential 
impact, could also threaten the Group’s 
ability to continue in business in its current 
form if they were to occur.
The Directors paid particular attention to the 
risk of a deterioration in economic outlook 
which could impact property fundamentals, 
including investor and occupier demand which 
would have a negative impact on valuations, 
and give rise to a reduction in the availability of 
finance. The remaining principal risks, whilst 
having an impact on the Group’s business 
model, are not considered by the Directors  
to have a reasonable likelihood of impacting 
the Group’s viability over the five year period  
to 31 March 2022.
The sensitivities performed were designed  
to be severe but plausible; and to take full 
account of the availability of mitigating actions 
that could be taken to avoid or reduce the 
impact or occurrence of the underlying risks 
relating to a single ‘downturn scenario’:
 – Downturn in economic outlook: Key 
assumptions including occupancy, void 
periods, rental growth and yields were 
sensitised in the ‘downturn scenario’ to  
reflect reasonably likely levels associated  
with an economic downturn, including:
 – a reduction in occupier demand, with  
a fall in occupancy rate of 5% and  
Offices and Retail ERV declines of  
25% and 5% respectively
 – a reduction in investment property 
demand to the level seen in the last 
severe downturn in 2008/2009, with 
outward yield shift to 8% net initial yield
 – Restricted availability of finance: based  
on the Group’s current commitments and 
available facilities there is no requirement 
to refinance until early 2021. In the normal 
course of business, financing is arranged in 
advance of expected requirements and the 
Directors have reasonable confidence that 
additional or replacement debt facilities will 
be put in place. In the ‘downturn scenario’, 
the following sensitivity of this assumption  
was conducted: 
 – a reduction in the availability of  
finance, for the final two years of the  
five year assessment in tandem with 
the Group’s refinancing date
The outcome of the ‘downturn scenario’  
was that the Group’s covenant headroom 
based on existing debt (i.e. the level by which 
investment property values would have to fall 
before a financial covenant breach occurs) 
decreases from the current 58% to, at its 
lowest level, 11%, indicating covenants on 
existing facilities would not be breached. 
In the ‘downturn scenario’, mitigating  
actions would be required to enable the Group  
to meet its future liabilities at the refinancing 
date, principally through asset sales, which 
would allow the Group to continue to meet  
its liabilities over the assessment period.
Viability statement
Having considered the forecast cash flows  
and covenant compliance and the impact of the 
sensitivities in combination in the ‘downturn 
scenario’, the Directors confirm that they have 
a reasonable expectation that the Group will  
be able to continue in operation and meet its 
liabilities as they fall due over the period  
to 31 March 2022.
Going concern
The Directors also considered it appropriate  
to prepare the financial statements on the 
going concern basis, as explained in the 
Governance review.
  To read more information on going 
concern, go to page 65.
The principal risks facing British Land are 
summarised on pages 50 to 53, including  
an assessment of the potential impact and 
likelihood and how the risks have changed  
in the year, together with how they relate  
to our strategic priorities.

impacts
How we monitor 
and manage the risk
Change in 
the year
Economic 
outlook
The UK economic climate  
and future movements in 
interest rates present risks  
and opportunities in property 
and financing markets and the 
businesses of our occupiers 
which can impact both the 
delivery of our strategy and  
our financial performance.
 – The Risk Committee reviews the economic 
environment in which we operate quarterly to 
assess whether any changes to the economic 
outlook justify a re-assessment of the risk  
appetite of the business
 – Key Indicators include forecast GDP growth, 
employment rates, business and consumer 
confidence, interest rates and inflation/deflation 
are considered, as well as central bank guidance 
and government policy updates
 – We stress test our business plan against  
a downturn in economic outlook to ensure  
our financial position is sufficiently flexible  
and resilient
 – Our resilient business model focuses on a high 
quality portfolio, with secure income streams 
and robust finances 
 The UK economy has remained robust and  
fared better than many expected following the EU 
referendum, with economic activity improving in  
the second half of 2016, albeit we have seen some 
evidence of softening retail spend in the first part  
of 2017. There is continuing uncertainty associated 
with the UK’s future exit from the EU and other 
geopolitical changes, with a wide spectrum of  
views about future economic performance. Equity  
and foreign exchange markets have been volatile.  
Interest rates have remained low; but UK inflation  
is increasing, partly driven by the devaluation  
of sterling. 
 
We remain mindful of potential headwinds and  
have the flexibility to scale our development activity 
and risk exposures up or down to respond to market 
conditions, to ensure the business remains both 
resilient and well positioned to capture upside in  
the future. 
Political and 
regulatory 
outlook
Significant political events and 
regulatory changes, including 
the decision to leave the EU, 
brings risks principally in  
two areas:
 – reluctance of investors  
and businesses to make 
investment and occupational 
decisions whilst the outcome  
remains uncertain and
 – on determination of the 
outcome, the impact on the 
case for investment in the 
UK, and on specific policies 
and regulation introduced, 
particularly those which 
directly impact real estate  
or our customers
 – Whilst we are not able to influence the outcome  
of significant political events, we do take the 
uncertainty related to such events and the range  
of possible outcomes into account when making 
strategic investment and financing decisions
 – Internally we review and monitor proposals and 
emerging policy and legislation to ensure that we 
take the necessary steps to ensure compliance. 
Additionally we engage public affairs consultants  
to ensure that we are properly briefed on the 
potential policy and regulatory implications  
of political events. Where appropriate, we  
act with other industry participants and  
representative bodies to contribute to the  
debate on regulatory changes
 There remains uncertainty about the nature of 
Britain’s exit from and future relations with the EU, 
alongside how this could impact the UK economy. 
Furthermore, the global geopolitical and trade 
environment remains uncertain. 
 
We are confident that the natural resilience of our 
business, with its long leases, high occupancy and 
robust financial position, together with the actions  
we have taken, leaves our business well positioned.
Commercial 
property 
investor 
demand
Reduction in investor demand 
for UK real estate may result  
in falls in asset valuations and 
could arise from variations in:
 – the health of the UK economy
 – the attractiveness of 
investment in the UK
 – availability of finance and
 – relative attractiveness  
of other asset classes
 – The Risk Committee reviews the property market 
quarterly to assess whether any changes to the 
market outlook present risks and opportunities 
which should be reflected in the execution of  
our strategy and our capital allocation plan. The 
Committee considers indicators such as margin 
between property yields and borrowing costs  
and property capital growth forecasts which are 
considered alongside the Committee members’ 
knowledge and experience of market activity  
and trends
 – We focus on prime assets and sectors which  
we believe will be less susceptible over the  
medium term to a reduction in occupier and  
investor demand
 – Strong relationships with agents and direct 
investors active in the market
 – We stress test our business plan for the  
effect of a change in property yields
 Investment volumes were lower in 2016, although  
there has been a pick-up in activity more recently, 
particularly in central London offices. UK property 
continues to appeal to certain investors underpinned  
by the relatively wide yield gap between property  
yields and long term interest rates, further  
supported by currency movements. 
 
The market for the most attractive assets remains 
liquid and in the central London office market there 
have been a number of high profile transactions 
including our sale of The Leadenhall Building. 
 
Prime yields have remained broadly stable,  
although market pricing is becoming increasingly 
polarised with some softening in demand for more 
secondary assets. We have continued to be active  
and successfully exchanged on the sale of £1.5 billion  
of assets, overall 9% ahead of valuation.

Change in 
the year
Occupier 
demand  
and tenant 
default
Underlying income, rental 
growth and capital performance 
could be adversely affected  
by weakening occupier  
demand and occupier failures 
resulting from variations in  
the health of the UK economy 
and corresponding weakening  
of consumer confidence, 
business activity and 
investment.
Changing consumer and 
business practices including  
the growth of internet retailing, 
flexible working practices, and 
demand for energy efficient 
buildings, new technologies, 
new legislation and alternative 
locations may result in earlier 
than anticipated obsolescence  
of our buildings if evolving 
occupier and regulatory 
requirements are not met.
 – The Risk Committee reviews indicators of  
occupier demand quarterly including consumer 
confidence surveys, and employment and ERV 
growth forecasts, alongside the Committee 
members’ knowledge and experience of occupier 
plans, trading performance and leasing activity  
in guiding execution of our strategy
 – We have a high quality, diversified occupier base  
and monitor concentration of exposure to individual 
occupiers or sectors. We perform rigorous occupier 
covenant checks ahead of approving deals and on  
an ongoing basis so that we can be proactive in 
managing exposure to weaker occupiers
 – Ongoing engagement with our occupiers. Through 
our Key Occupier Account programme we work 
together with our occupiers to find ways to best 
meet their evolving requirements
 – Our sustainability strategy links action on occupier 
health and wellbeing, energy efficiency, community 
and sustainable design to our business strategy.  
Our social and environmental targets help us 
comply with new legislation and respond to 
customer demands; for example, we expect all 
office developments to be BREEAM Excellent
 In retail, demand remained firm in the year, despite 
wider uncertainty from consumers and retailers alike. 
However, retailers are facing a more challenging 
environment with cost pressures from a number  
of sources including the National Living Wage, the 
recent business rates revaluation, import cost 
inflation due to the weakening pound and from the 
requirements of establishing omni-channel platforms. 
These pressures mean that retailers are increasingly 
focusing on the most profitable stores, where they can 
grow sales with lower occupancy costs. Our continued 
upgrading of environments at our retail properties  
and targeted engagement with occupiers, positions  
us well to benefit from increasing polarisation. 
 
While occupier demand in the London office market 
has been more cautious post-referendum, take-up 
has picked up with overall take-up over the year in line 
with the ten year average. London’s broad appeal 
means that demand has continued to originate from  
a range of industries including strong demand from 
the creative and technology sectors. We have seen 
vacancy rates rising in both the City and West End 
following recent development completions and expect 
this to apply downward pressure on market rents; 
however accelerating polarisation towards higher 
quality places will provide support for rents in the  
best locations. 
 
As well as policy and regulatory changes arising  
from the UK’s departure from the EU, such as 
migration controls and passporting, office occupiers 
also face challenges as they adapt to economic,  
social and technology changes. Our focus is on London 
campuses which provide attractive and engaging 
environments and are increasingly flexible to suit the 
changing requirements and scale of central London 
office occupiers. These position us well to benefit  
from any shift in demand.
Availability  
and cost  
of finance
Reduced availability of finance 
may adversely impact ability to 
refinance debt and/or drive up 
cost. These factors may also 
result in weaker investor 
demand for real estate. 
Regulation and capital costs  
of lenders may increase cost  
of finance.
 – Market borrowing rates and real estate credit 
availability are monitored by the Risk Committee 
quarterly and reviewed regularly in order to guide  
our financing actions in executing our strategy
 – We monitor our projected LTV and our debt 
requirements using several internally generated 
reports focused on borrowing levels, debt maturity, 
available facilities and interest rate exposure
 – We maintain good long term relationships with  
our key financing partners
 – The scale and quality of our business enables  
us to access a diverse range of sources of finance 
with a spread of repayment dates. We aim always  
to have a good level of undrawn, committed, 
unsecured revolving facilities to ensure we  
have adequate financing availability to support 
business requirements and opportunities
 – We work with industry bodies and other relevant 
organisations to participate in any debate  
on emerging finance regulations where our  
interests and those of our industry are affected
   There has been market volatility reacting  
to macro-economic and political uncertainties.  
However, there remains good availability of finance  
in debt and capital markets (secured and unsecured)  
to UK REITs and other good quality real estate  
investors. Development finance without pre-lets  
is more difficult to obtain. 
 
We have continued to achieve attractive financings and 
agreed one year extensions on a total of £1.4 billion of 
our unsecured facilities and agreed a new £100 million 
bilateral facility in the year. 
Catastrophic 
business  
event
An external event such as  
a civil emergency, including a 
large-scale terrorist attack, 
cyber crime, extreme weather 
occurrence, environmental 
disaster or power shortage 
could severely disrupt global 
markets (including property 
and finance) and cause 
significant damage and 
disruption to British Land’s 
portfolio and operations.
 – We maintain a comprehensive crisis response  
plan across all business units as well as a  
head office business continuity plan
 – The Risk Committee monitors the Home Office 
terrorism threat levels and we have access  
to security threat information services
 – Asset emergency procedures are regularly 
reviewed and scenario tested. Physical  
security measures are in place at properties  
and development sites
 – Our Sustainability Committee monitors 
environmental and climate change risks.  
Asset risk assessments are carried out to  
assess a range of risks including security,  
flood, environmental, health and safety
 – We have implemented corporate cyber security 
systems which are supplemented by incident 
management, disaster recovery and business 
continuity plans, all of which are regularly reviewed 
to be able to respond to changes in the threat 
landscape and organisational requirements
 – We also have appropriate insurance in place  
across the portfolio
 The Home Office threat level from international 
terrorism remains ‘Severe’. Our business continuity 
plans and asset emergency procedures have been 
reviewed and enhanced where appropriate.  
 
We are mindful of cyber security risks and have 
enhanced our security position as well as rolling  
out cyber awareness training across both British 
Land and Broadgate Estates. We continue to  
monitor the cyber threat landscape including  
the impact on our supply chain and any  
implications of new regulations.

In order to meet our strategic 
objectives we aim to invest  
in and exit from the right 
properties at the right time. 
Underperformance could  
result from changes in  
market sentiment as well as 
inappropriate determination 
and execution of our property 
investment strategy, including:
 – sector selection  
and weighting
 – timing of investment and 
divestment decisions
 – exposure to developments
 – asset, tenant, region 
concentration
 – co-investment arrangements
 – Our investment strategy is determined to be  
consistent with our target risk appetite and is based  
on the evaluation of the external environment
 – Progress against the strategy and continuing 
alignment with our risk appetite is discussed  
at each Risk Committee with reference to the 
property markets and the external economic 
environment
 – The Board carries out an annual strategic review  
of the overall corporate strategy including the 
Group’s current and prospective asset portfolio 
 – Individual investment decisions are subject to  
robust risk evaluation overseen by our Investment 
Committee including consideration of returns 
relative to risk adjusted hurdle rates
 – Review of prospective performance of individual 
assets and their business plans
 – We foster collaborative relationships with  
our co-investors and enter into ownership 
agreements which balance the interests  
of the parties
 Whilst the outlook in our markets will remain  
uncertain for some time, we have an enduring  
strategy which is based on long term trends and  
this positions our high quality portfolio to benefit  
from increasing polarisation and to attract a  
broader range of occupiers. In line with our  
strategic priorities, we have accelerated our  
focus on lifestyle oriented real estate; we have  
recycled capital to maximise returns and we  
are getting closer to our customers. 
 
During the year we have exchanged on £1.5 billion of  
asset disposals at 9% above valuation. We have been 
disciplined in our investment activity, with £195 million 
of acquisitions, primarily of properties which are 
complementary to existing assets and £292 million 
capital spend on developments and placemaking. 
Development 
strategy
Responsible 
executives: 
Chris Grigg, 
Charles 
Maudsley, 
Tim Roberts
Development provides an 
opportunity for outperformance 
but usually brings with it 
elevated risk.
This is reflected in our 
decision-making process 
around which schemes to 
develop, the timing of the 
development, as well as the 
execution of these projects.
Development strategy 
addresses several development 
risks that could adversely impact 
underlying income and capital 
performance including:
 – development letting exposure
 – construction timing  
and costs (including 
construction cost inflation)
 – major contractor failure
 – adverse planning judgements
 – We manage our levels of total and speculative 
development exposure as a proportion of the 
investment portfolio value within a target range  
taking into account associated risks and the  
impact on key financial metrics. This is monitored 
quarterly by the Risk Committee along with  
progress of developments against plan
 – Prior to committing to a development, the Group 
undertakes a detailed appraisal overseen by our 
Investment Committee including consideration  
of returns relative to risk adjusted hurdle rates
 – Pre-lets are used to reduce development letting  
risk where considered appropriate
 – Competitive tendering of construction contracts 
and, where appropriate, fixed price contracts 
entered into
 – Detailed selection and close monitoring of 
contractors including covenant reviews
 – Experienced development management team 
closely monitors design, construction and  
overall delivery process
 – Early engagement and strong relationships  
with planning authorities
 – We also actively engage with the communities  
in which we operate, as detailed in our Local 
Charter, to ensure that our development activities 
consider the interests of all stakeholders
 – We manage environmental and social risks across 
our development supply chain by engaging with  
our suppliers, including through our Supply Chain 
Charter, Sustainability Brief for Developments  
and Health and Safety Policy
 Development has been an important driver of returns 
and we have assembled a pipeline of development 
opportunities with the optionality to progress when  
the time is right. In a more uncertain environment, we 
have moderated our current speculative development 
exposure to only 4% of the portfolio. We are progressing 
planning and pre-let discussions across the pipeline 
and positioned ourselves to make timely decisions  
on our developments going forward.

People
Responsible 
executives: 
Chris Grigg
A number of critical business 
processes and decisions lie  
in the hands of a few people.
Failure to recruit, develop  
and retain staff and Directors 
with the right skills and 
experience may result in 
significant underperformance  
or impact the effectiveness  
of operations and decision-
making, in turn impacting 
business performance.
 – Our HR strategy is designed to minimise  
risk through:
 – informed and skilled recruitment processes
 – talent, performance management and 
succession planning for key roles
 – highly competitive compensation and benefits 
 – people development and training
 – The risk is measured through employee 
engagement surveys (including the ‘Best 
Companies' survey), employee turnover and 
retention metrics. We monitor this through the 
number of unplanned executive departures  
in addition to conducting exit interviews
 – We engage with our suppliers to make clear our 
requirements in managing key risks including  
health and safety, fraud and bribery and other  
social and environmental risks, as detailed in  
our Supply Chain Charter
 Expert People is one of the four core focus areas  
of our strategy. We empower our people to make  
the most of their potential. During the year, we  
have introduced a number of initiatives to improve 
organisational effectiveness across the business  
and to promote wellbeing and health, including 
offering enhanced Shared Parental Pay  
to employees. 
 
Also, we are focused on creating a culture which 
encourages diversity and inclusion and are working 
towards the National Equality Standard. 
 
 For more on our Expert People,  
see pages 24 and 25.
Capital 
structure 
– leverage
Responsible 
executives: 
Lucinda Bell
Our capital structure 
recognises the balance 
between performance,  
risk and flexibility.
 – Leverage magnifies  
capital returns, both  
positive and negative
 – An increase in leverage 
increases the risk of  
a breach of covenants  
on borrowing facilities  
and may increase  
finance costs
 – We manage our use of debt and equity finance to 
balance the benefits of leverage against the risks, 
including a magnification of the impact of property 
valuation movements
 – We aim to manage our LTV through the property 
cycle such that our financial position would remain 
robust in the event of a significant fall in property 
values. This means we do not adjust our approach  
to leverage based on changes in property  
market yields
 – We manage our investment activity, the size and 
timing of which can be uneven, as well as our 
development commitments to ensure that our  
LTV level remains appropriate
 – We leverage our equity and achieve benefits of  
scale while spreading risk through joint ventures 
and funds which are typically partly financed  
by debt without recourse to British Land
 Balance sheet metrics remain strong. Our LTV and 
weighted average interest rate on drawn debt have 
reduced and interest cover has improved. The impact 
of investment activity in the year was a net decrease  
in debt of £0.5 billion. The strength of the Group’s 
balance sheet is reflected in our senior unsecured 
credit rating which was reaffirmed by Fitch at  
A- and outlook was upgraded to ‘Positive’. 
 
 For more on our financial policies,  
see pages 43 to 45.
Finance  
strategy
Responsible 
executives: 
Lucinda Bell
Finance strategy  
addresses risks both to 
continuing solvency and  
profits generated.
Failure to manage refinancing 
requirements may result in a 
shortage of funds to sustain  
the operations of the business  
or repay facilities as they  
fall due.
 – We have five key principles guiding our financing  
which are employed together to manage the risks  
in this area: diversify our sources of finance, phase 
maturity of debt portfolio, maintain liquidity, 
maintain flexibility, and maintain strong balance  
sheet metrics
 – We monitor the period until refinancing is required, 
which is a key determinant of financing activity, and 
regularly evaluate the financial covenant headroom
 – We are committed to maintaining and enhancing 
relationships with our key financing partners
 – We are mindful of relevant emerging regulation 
which has the potential to impact the way that  
we finance the Group
 Given the quality of our business, we have continued 
to achieve attractive financings which improve 
earnings and liquidity. As well as being well priced, 
our financing is robust with an average term of eight 
years on drawn debt and no requirement for the 
Group to refinance until early 2021. Our committed 
bank facilities total £1.8 billion of which £1.3 billion  
was undrawn at 31 March 2017. 
 
 For more on our financial policies,  
see pages 43 to 45.
Income 
sustainability
Responsible 
executives: 
Lucinda Bell, 
Charles 
Maudsley, 
Tim Roberts
We are mindful of maintaining 
sustainable income streams 
which underpin a stable and 
growing dividend and provide 
the platform from which to 
grow the business.
We consider sustainability  
of our income streams in:
 – execution of investment 
strategy and capital 
recycling, notably timing  
of reinvestment of sale 
proceeds
 – nature and structure  
of leasing activity
 – nature and timing of  
asset management and 
development activity
 – We undertake comprehensive profit and cash  
flow forecasting incorporating scenario analysis  
to model the impact of proposed transactions
 – Pro-active asset management approach to  
maintain strong occupier line-up. We monitor  
our market letting exposure including vacancies, 
upcoming expiries and breaks and speculative 
development as well as our weighted average 
unexpired lease term
 – We have a high quality and diversified occupier  
base and monitor concentration of exposure  
to individual occupiers or sectors
 – We are proactive in addressing key lease breaks  
and expiries to minimise periods of vacancy
 – We actively engage with the communities  
in which we operate, as detailed in our Local 
Charter, to ensure we provide buildings that  
meet the needs of all relevant stakeholders
 Despite the uncertainty, the quality of our portfolio  
and environments has continued to attract strong 
occupier interest with good leasing performance.  
Our income streams are secure; underpinned  
by a high quality, diverse occupier base with 98% 
occupancy and an average lease length of 8.3 years.  
 
We actively manage the impact of our investment 
strategy and office lease expiries on our income 
profile. Looking forward, we’re conscious of potential 
headwinds for our occupiers, however we continue  
to expect our high quality portfolio to benefit from 
increasing polarisation.

  Laura Wade-Gery was unable to attend one Board meeting due to 
travel disruption.
British Land has a highly effective Board, as once again confirmed by this  
year’s Board evaluation. Lord Macpherson, formerly Permanent Secretary  
to HM Treasury, was appointed as a Non-Executive Director in December 2016  
and we have recently announced that Preben Prebensen, Chief Executive of  
Close Brothers Group plc, will join the Board on 1 September 2017. These 
appointments will further strengthen the diverse mix of skills and experience  
of our Directors.
Lord Turnbull and Simon Borrows will retire from the Board at the end of  
the 2017 AGM. Lord Turnbull has served as a Director for more than 11 years  
and Simon for two three year terms. I would like to thank them both for their 
valuable contribution as Board members. Lord Turnbull will also step down  
as Senior Independent Director and will be succeeded by William Jackson. 
All Directors, other than Lord Turnbull and Simon Borrows, will stand for  
election or re-election at the 2017 AGM. We recognise the value that Directors  
who serve for many years bring to the Board and are delighted that Aubrey 
Adams, who will have served as a Non-Executive Director for almost nine  
years by the time of our 2017 AGM, has agreed to serve for a further one  
year term as an independent Non-Executive Director. Aubrey’s considerable 
experience in the property sector is an important part of the mix of skills and 
knowledge on our Board. The process is under way to recruit an additional 
Director with property sector experience to further strengthen the Board. 
  Read our Board biographies on pages 56 to 59.
Corporate culture is increasingly an area of focus for investors, governance  
advisory bodies, our customers and other stakeholders. The Board is  
committed to influencing and shaping British Land’s culture and believes  
that setting the ‘tone from the top’ and strong governance underpin a healthy 
inclusive culture, which is a key part of delivering long term business success.  
The Board has supported the executive team in the significant amount of work  
that has been done this year in reinforcing the behaviours that are expected  
of British Land employees, increasing employee engagement and continuing  
to develop a more diverse and inclusive culture at British Land. 
  Read about our diversity and inclusion initiatives on pages 24 and 25.
The Board will continue to focus this year on monitoring British Land’s culture  
and promoting good governance that supports openness and accountability 
throughout the business, including open engagement with stakeholders.  
Further details on the impact on culture of strategic and financial decisions  
can be found on page 62.
We welcome feedback from shareholders. Your feedback helps us shape  
our governance structure and the way we do business, I look forward to  
hearing your views at, and in advance of, our 2017 AGM.
John Gildersleeve
Non-Executive Chairman
As reported in the Chief Executive’s review, we have delivered good results 
in an eventful year as we have continued with our strategy of differentiating 
our space by providing places which reflect people’s changing lifestyles. 
The design and delivery of our strategy continues to be supported by our 
robust governance structure which ensures effective decision-making 
based on the right information. The Board plays a valuable role in 
encouraging debate about our strategy and its implementation  
and overseeing the identification and management of key risks.

OUR GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE Our governance structure is an 
integral part of the way we design 
and deliver our strategy
Leadership
The Board’s core responsibilities include setting British Land’s  
strategic aims and leading the Company as it works to achieve these 
aims and attain long term success. The focus on strategy by the Board 
continues throughout the year with annual Strategy Days providing an 
opportunity to discuss, challenge and develop the Company’s strategy  
as explained in the box below. Progress in delivery of the agreed  
strategy is considered at Board meetings during the year. The strategy  
is kept under review in light of Company performance and changes  
to the external environment. 
Compliance with the Code
The Board has continued to apply good governance practices during  
the year and considers that the Company has fully complied with the 
UK Corporate Governance Code (the Code). This section of the Annual 
Report outlines how we have applied the Code’s principles and provisions 
throughout the year. We are reporting against the Code which applies to 
companies with reporting periods beginning on or after 1 October 2014.  
A copy of the Code is available at ww w.frc.org.uk
For ease of reference, this is how we demonstrate our compliance 
throughout the Governance and remuneration section of the 2017  
Annual Report:
 A. Leadership D. Remuneration
 B. Effectiveness  E. Relations with shareholders
 C. Accountability
The division of responsibilities between the Chairman (who is  
responsible for running the Board) and the Chief Executive (who  
is responsible for running the Company’s business) is set out  
in writing and approved by the Board (A.2.1) .
The Board delegates authority for ensuring that the business is  
run in accordance with the agreed strategy to the Chief Executive,  
with responsibility for specific areas of the business delegated to  
the other Executive Directors. The Executive Directors are involved  
in, or aware of, all major activities and are therefore extremely well 
placed to ensure that actions taken align with strategy. 
The major decisions reserved for Board approval and other decisions 
delegated to the Executive Directors are formally documented and 
reviewed regularly (A.1.1) . The Executive Directors make decisions  
within these predefined parameters although any activities outside  
the ordinary course of business may still be taken to the full Board  
for consideration and approval where this is considered appropriate,  
even if they fall within those parameters. 
The parameters and controls set by the Board within which the 
management undertake the day-to-day running of the business ensure 
that decisions are taken by people with the correct authority to make 
these decisions. Management Committees deal with their specific areas 
of responsibility before making decisions (where authority has been 
granted) or before recommending actions for Board-level approval. 
The Chairman meets with individual Directors outside formal Board 
meetings as part of each Director’s continuing contribution to the 
Company (A.4.2) . This process allows for open, two-way discussion 
about the effectiveness of the Board, its Committees and individual 
Directors. In this way, the Chairman remains mindful of the views of 
individual Directors and can act as necessary to deal with any issues 
relating to Board effectiveness before they become a risk to the Company. 
Culture and composition of the Board
The composition of the Board is fundamental to its success in  
providing strong and effective leadership; the breadth of knowledge, 
skills and experience of our Non-Executive Directors is detailed in  
their biographies on pages 56 to 59. The Nomination Committee  
is responsible for reviewing the composition of the Board and its 
Committees and assessing whether the balance of skills, experience, 
knowledge and independence is appropriate to enable them to operate 
effectively (B.2.2) . 
Following recommendations by the Nomination Committee, Lord 
Macpherson was appointed a Non-Executive Director in December 2016 
and we have recently announced that Preben Prebensen will join as a 
Non-Executive Director and member of the Remuneration Committee  
in September 2017. These appointments will further strengthen the  
mix of skills and experience on the Board. 
Strategy Days
The annual Strategy Days provide Non-Executive Directors in 
particular with a focused opportunity to consider, develop and 
challenge the Company’s strategy. As well as considering the 
Group as a whole, consideration is given to key parts of the  
Group’s current and prospective asset portfolio. 
In 2017, the annual Strategy Days were held at the beginning of 
March. The Executive Directors, senior executives and external 
guests delivered a number of presentations to attendees providing  
in-depth analysis on aspects of the business and the external 
environment. The days were carefully structured to achieve  
a balance between presentations, debate and discussion.
Areas focused on at the 2017 Strategy Days included: corporate 
strategy, Canada Water, Office strategy, Retail strategy, technology 
opportunities and challenges.
Governance
62 British Land  Annual Report and Accounts 2017
GOVERNANCE REVIEW William Jackson will succeed Lord Turnbull as the Senior Independent 
Director at the end of the 2017 AGM when Lord Turnbull retires as  
a Director and as Senior Independent Director. Simon Borrows will  
also step down as a Director at the end of the 2017 AGM. 
Lord Macpherson joined the Audit Committee and Tim Score joined 
the Nomination Committee on 1 April 2017. 
Our rigorous and transparent procedures for appointing new  
Directors are led by the Nomination Committee. Non-Executive 
Directors are appointed for specified terms and all continuing Directors 
offer themselves for election or re-election by shareholders at the  
AGM each year, if the Board, on the recommendation of the Nomination 
Committee, deems it appropriate that they do so (B.7.1) .
Aubrey Adams will have served as a Non-Executive Director for almost  
nine years by the time of our 2017 AGM. When a Non-Executive Director’s 
tenure goes beyond nine years, their independence is carefully reviewed 
and monitored. Following a particularly rigorous review of Aubrey’s 
contributions and independence by the Nomination Committee,  
the Board determined that he remains independent in character  
and judgement. 
The Board has approved the recommendation of the Nomination 
Committee that it is appropriate for Aubrey Adams to remain in office  
as an independent Non-Executive Director, and a member of the Audit 
Committee, for a further year, notwithstanding the length of his service. 
Aubrey’s considerable expertise in the property sector is an important 
part of the mix of skills and experience on our Board and we recognise 
the importance of continuity and the value that Directors who serve  
for many years bring to the Board. We are delighted he has agreed  
to stand for re-election. The recruitment process to recruit an  
additional director with property sector experience is ongoing.
The Board considers that Aubrey Adams, Simon Borrows, Lynn Gladden, 
William Jackson, Tim Score, Lord Turnbull, Laura Wade-Gery and Lord 
Macpherson are independent. In making this determination, the Board 
has reviewed the Nomination Committee’s assessment of whether each 
Director remains independent in character and judgement and whether 
there are relationships or circumstances which are likely to affect,  
or could appear to affect, that judgement (B.1.1) . 
The Board believes that the Non-Executive Directors are of the stature 
and have the experience required to perform their roles as independent 
Directors properly. Following this year’s Board evaluation, the Board 
believes each Non-Executive Director standing for re-election at the  
2017 AGM continues to fulfil effectively and remains committed to their 
role within British Land. The terms and conditions of appointment of 
Non-Executive Directors are available for inspection at the Company’s 
registered office and at the AGM (B.3.2) .
The Board culture is one of openness and constructive debate; the 
Directors voice their opinions in a relaxed and respectful environment, 
allowing coherent discussion. The Chairman is responsible for 
maintaining this culture. He does so by ensuring information of an 
appropriate quality is provided in a timely manner before Board meetings 
which leads to focused discussion in the boardroom. When running  
Board meetings the Chairman maintains a collaborative atmosphere  
and ensures that all Directors contribute to debates. The Chairman 
arranges informal meetings and events throughout the year to help  
build constructive relationships between the Board members.
We continue to have a strong mix of experienced individuals on the  
Board with the majority being independent Non-Executive Directors  
who are able to offer an external perspective on the business, and 
constructively challenge the Executive Directors, particularly when 
developing the Company’s strategy (B.1.2) . The Non-Executive 
Directors scrutinise the performance of management in meeting their 
agreed goals and objectives, and monitor the reporting of performance.
The high calibre of debate and the participation of all Directors,  
Executive and Non-Executive, allow the Board to utilise the experience 
and skills of the individual Directors to their maximum potential and 
make decisions that are in the best interest of the Company.
Culture
British Land recognises that:
 – the behaviours and attitudes exhibited in the way British Land 
conducts business and in its relations with stakeholders are a 
key indicator of, and have a material impact on, our culture and
 – alignment of our business decisions with our culture, values  
and strategy is key to demonstrating our commitment to 
developing a long term sustainable business
The Board takes account of these factors when considering 
strategic and financial decisions.
Effectiveness
Regular Board and Committee meetings are scheduled throughout 
the year and the Directors ensure that they allocate sufficient time to 
discharge their duties effectively. Occasionally, Board meetings may  
be held at short notice when Board-level decisions of a time-critical 
nature need to be made.
  For meeting attendance, see the table on page 60.
Non-Executive Directors’ letters of appointment set out the time 
commitments expected and each Director’s attendance record is 
considered when assessing whether they should stand for re-election  
by shareholders. The Nomination Committee considers that all the 
Directors continue to devote sufficient time to discharging their  
duties to the required high standard. 
British Land’s policy is to allow Executive Directors to take one non-
executive directorship at another FTSE company, subject to British  
Land Board approval. External appointments of the Directors are 
disclosed in their biographies and fees earned by Executive Directors  
are disclosed on page 86 of the Remuneration Report (D.1.2) .  
The Directors are required to notify the Company of any potential  
conflicts of interest that may affect them in their roles as Directors  
of British Land. All potential conflicts of interest are authorised by  
the Board at the earliest opportunity and the register of Directors 
interests is reviewed by the full Board at least annually. 
63 British Land  Annual Report and Accounts 2017 The Non-Executive Directors are kept well informed of the key 
developments in the business through regular reports including a 
Management Report delivered by the Chief Executive at each Board 
meeting, a Finance Report and regular updates on the activities of the 
Risk and Sustainability Committees. Throughout the year presentations 
and reports on specific aspects of the business and individual assets  
are also delivered, along with updates on the regulatory and external 
environment. Specific input from the Non-Executive Directors is also 
sought when significant investment decisions and strategic initiatives  
are reviewed and discussed.
Care is taken to ensure that information is circulated in good time  
before Board and Committee meetings whenever possible, and that 
reports are presented clearly and contain the appropriate level of detail 
to enable the Board to discharge its duties. It is the Company Secretary’s 
role to facilitate effective information flows between the Board and  
its Committees, and between senior management and Non-Executive 
Directors. As a result, the Non-Executive Directors are able effectively  
to monitor management of the business and the implementation of  
the strategic aims as well as being able to assess the performance 
of the Chairman and Executive Directors (B.5.1) .
The Company Secretary is responsible, through the Chairman,  
for advising the Board on all aspects of governance (B.5.2) .
Key areas considered by the Board 
during the year:
 – outcomes of the annual Strategy Days and progress  
towards agreed outcomes
 – consideration and approval of risk appetite
 – principal risks faced by the Company
 – Brexit and its affect on the Group
 – reports of the activities of the Audit (including risk), 
Remuneration and Nomination Committees
 – updates on the business, external environment and  
investor relations
 – updates on the portfolio, including possible developments, 
acquisitions and disposals
 – updates on financing and capital structure
 – results of the Board performance evaluation
 – election and re-election of Directors at the AGM and  
Committee membership
 – conflicts of interest
 – approval of year end and half year financial results,  
the Annual Report and the Notice of AGM 
 – approval of the dividend policy and declaration of quarterly 
interim dividends
 – culture
 – people including training and development and  
succession planning
 – health and safety
 – sustainability
 – cyber security and information technology
Board training and development
British Land provides all Non-Executive Directors with a tailored  
and thorough induction which includes briefings on Directors’ duties, 
Group strategy, one-to-one meetings with Executive Directors and  
other senior executives. They are also provided with the opportunity 
to visit key properties and developments (B.4.1) .
The Chairman reviews training and development needs with the 
Directors annually (B.4.2) . Board members are provided with 
opportunities to update and refresh their knowledge throughout  
the year, ensuring that they are able to fulfil their role as members  
of the Board and its Committees effectively. During the year ended  
31 March 2017, the Board considered papers and presentations on  
legal and regulatory developments, technology opportunities and 
challenges and sustainability-related developments as well as  
receiving regular briefings on the views of stakeholders, the  
external environment and regulatory matters.
Board evaluation
The effectiveness of the Board and its Committees is reviewed  
annually, with an independent, externally facilitated review being 
conducted at least once every three years. The next external  
review will be undertaken in 2018 (B.6.2) . 
In 2017, an internal evaluation of the Board and its Committees  
was conducted by the Company Secretary and General Counsel 
(B.6.1) . In addition to the formal evaluation, the Chairman met  
each Non-Executive Director individually during the year to discuss  
their contribution to the Board. The Senior Independent Director  
led the appraisal of the Chairman’s performance by the Non-
Executive Directors, with the views of the Executive Directors  
also being taken into consideration (B.6.3) .
The Chairman and Chief Executive presented their appraisals  
of the performance of the Chief Executive and other Executive 
Directors respectively. These appraisals were taken into account 
when considering the performance of the Board as a whole as  
well as in relation to annual and long term incentive awards. 
The evaluation of the Board and its Committees concluded that  
the Board and its Committees continued to operate effectively  
with a high standard of performance throughout the year. 
Accountability
The Board is responsible for preparing the Annual Report and confirms 
in the Directors’ responsibility statement set out on page 91 that they 
believe that this Annual Report, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and 
understandable, and provides the information necessary to assess 
British Land’s position, performance, business model and strategy 
(C.1.1) . The basis on which the Company creates and preserves  
value over the long term is described in the Strategic Report (C.1.2) .
The content of the Annual Report is prepared by the relevant responsible 
individuals across the business. Specific sections are reviewed by 
Department Heads and Executive Committee members as appropriate, 
ensuring that key stakeholders are involved throughout the process.  
The Executive Directors are closely involved in drafting and reviewing 
their sections of the Annual Report. A detailed and robust due diligence 
process is conducted to verify key statements made within the Annual 
Report prior to its thorough review by the Audit Committee and 
presentation to the Board for consideration and approval.
Governance
64 British Land  Annual Report and Accounts 2017
GOVERNANCE REVIEW CONTINUED The procedure undertaken to enable the Board to provide the fair, 
balanced and understandable confirmation to shareholders has been 
reviewed by the Audit Committee. Meetings to review and document the 
key considerations undertaken to ensure that information presented is 
fair, balanced and understandable are held between the Chief Financial 
Officer, Head of Investor Relations and the Group Financial Controller 
and other appropriate employees. A detailed report is then presented  
to the Audit Committee which includes a summary of the process 
undertaken to satisfy management that the confirmation to be  
given is appropriate and accurate.
Risk management and internal control
The Board determines the extent and nature of the risks it is prepared  
to take in order to achieve the Company’s strategic objectives. 
The Board has responsibility for the Company’s overall approach to  
risk management and internal control. The Board’s responsibilities 
include ensuring the design and implementation of appropriate  
risk management and internal control systems. Oversight of the 
effectiveness of these systems is delegated to the Audit Committee  
which undertakes regular reviews to ensure that the Group is  
identifying, considering and mitigating, as far as practicable,  
the most appropriate risks for the business (C.2.3) . 
As well as complying with the Code, the best practice recommendations 
in ‘Guidance for Risk Management, Internal Control and Related Financial 
and Business Reporting’ have been adopted and the Company’s internal 
control framework has been assessed against the internationally 
recognised COSO Internal Control Integrated Framework. The latter 
assessment showed that all key control elements are in place. 
British Land’s approach to risk, including the roles of the Board, the 
Audit Committee and the Executive Risk Committee in setting risk 
appetite and monitoring risk exposure, is detailed in the “Managing  
risk in delivering our strategy” section on pages 46 to 49 (C.2.1) .
Formal and transparent arrangements exist for considering how 
corporate reporting, risk management and internal control principles 
are applied and for maintaining an appropriate relationship with the 
Company’s auditor.
The Group’s internal control system is built on the following fundamental 
principles, and is subject to review by internal audit:
 – a defined schedule of matters reserved for approval by  
the Board
 – a detailed authorisation process: no material commitments  
are entered into without thorough review and approval by  
more than one authorised person
 – formal documentation of all significant transactions
 – a robust system of business and financial planning: including  
cash flows and profitability forecasting, with scenario analysis 
performed on major corporate, property and financing proposals
 – a robust process for property investment appraisals
 – monitoring of key outcomes, particularly expenditure  
and performance of significant investments, against budget  
and forecast
 – clearly defined policies and review of actual performance  
against policies
 – benchmarking of property performance against external  
sources such as Investment Property Databank
 – key controls testing
 – a comprehensive property and corporate insurance  
programme and a formal whistle-blowing policy 
The Audit Committee reviews the effectiveness of the Group’s  
system of internal control annually, including the systems of control  
for material joint ventures and funds. During the course of its review  
of the risk management and internal control systems during the  
year ended 31 March 2017, and to the date of this Report, the Audit 
Committee has not identified, nor been advised of, a failing or  
weakness which it has determined to be significant (C.2.3) .
A number of policies and procedures have been adopted by the Group  
to ensure that we not only meet our legal obligations, but also behave 
ethically, act with integrity and protect our assets from the unlawful 
activities of others. These include policies on anti-bribery and  
corruption and fraud awareness and know-your-client procedures.  
All employees are made aware of the Group’s policies and receive 
training appropriate to their roles and responsibilities.
Viability and going concern
  The viability statement is set out on page 49 (C.2.2) .
The Group has considerable undrawn debt facilities and cash deposits  
in excess of current drawn banking facilities. There is substantial 
headroom against the covenants for its unsecured banking facilities.  
It also benefits from a diverse and secure income stream from leases 
with long average lease terms.
Having assessed the principal risks and other matters discussed in 
connection with the viability statement, the Directors believe that the 
Group is well placed to manage its financing and other business risks 
satisfactorily, and have a reasonable expectation that the Company and 
the Group have adequate resources to continue in operation for at least 
12 months from the date of the Annual Report. They therefore consider  
it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in  
preparing the financial statements (C.1.3) .
Taxation
Our principles of good governance extend to our responsible approach  
to tax. It remains important to our stakeholders that this is aligned to the 
long term values and strategy of the Group. The Chief Financial Officer, 
with close involvement of the other Executive Directors and senior 
management, is responsible for developing the Group’s approach  
to tax. A tax update is presented to the Audit Committee annually.
Community investment 
British Land’s approach to community investment is set out in our  
Local Charter which details how we build trust by making positive 
contributions locally. Our Community Funding Guidelines set out  
how we allocate funding, with a particular focus on initiatives close  
to our assets that provide opportunities to local people through 
education, employment and training. Both documents can be  
found on our website at ww w.britishland.com/policies
Our financial donations to good causes during the year totalled 
£1,351,000 (2016: £1,371,000). Our Community Investment Committee 
approves all expenditure from our Community Investment Fund  
and reports to the Executive Committee on an annual basis.
In addition to funding projects approved by our Community Investment 
Committee, the Company also supports fundraising and payroll giving  
for causes that matter to staff. This support includes:
 – 50% uplift of staff payroll giving contributions (capped at £5,000  
per person and £50,000 per annum for the whole organisation) and
 – a staff matched funding pledge, matching money raised for charity  
by staff up to £750 per person per year
65 British Land  Annual Report and Accounts 2017 We also support fundraising by the on site teams managing  
our retail and office properties around the UK by:
 – matching up to £750 for two site fundraising initiatives  
per year, per location and
 – extending our staff matched funding pledge to on site employees  
of Broadgate Estates Limited, our wholly-owned subsidiary
British Land does not make donations to political organisations.
Remuneration
The Directors’ Remuneration Report is set out on pages 73 to 88.
The Remuneration Policy was approved by shareholders at the 2016  
AGM and is summarised on page 75. The full policy is available on  
our website: ww w.britishland.com/committees. We are not making  
any changes to the Remuneration Policy this year. 
Relations with shareholders
The Board remains committed to maintaining open channels of 
communication with shareholders. It is important that we clearly  
explain the Company’s strategy and objectives and that feedback is 
listened to and any issues and questions appropriately considered.
British Land has a dedicated Investor Relations team which  
reports to the Chief Financial Officer. Investors and analysts receive 
regular communications from the Company throughout the year, 
including Investor Relations events (see box to the right), one-to-one and  
group meetings with Executive Directors and property or asset tours,  
as well as regular contact with the Investor Relations team. During  
the year, the Chief Executive, Chief Financial Officer and our Investor 
Relations team met with representatives from over 205 institutions.  
We periodically commission an independent investor perception  
study which is presented to the Board.
The Chairman encourages all Directors to attend the AGM, providing 
retail shareholders in particular with an opportunity to hear from the 
Board and to question the Directors in person.
Significant emphasis is placed on the importance of feeding shareholder 
views, both positive and negative, back to the Board. The Chief Executive 
provides a written report to the Board at each scheduled meeting which 
includes direct market feedback on activity during the period. (E.1.1)  
(E.1.2) .
British Land aims to be informative and accessible to all shareholders. 
Announcements relating to the Group’s financial results and other key 
matters are provided in a timely manner to both retail and institutional 
shareholders. Our website also provides a number of case studies  
for stakeholders’ information covering topics from asset profiles  
to sustainability activities. Shareholders are also able to contact  
the Company directly via the contacts page on our website:  
ww w.britishland.com/contacts
We are pleased with the level of engagement with shareholders achieved 
during the year and the Board also recognises the important contribution 
of providers of capital other than shareholders, namely our lenders and 
bondholders. We maintain a regular and open dialogue with our debt 
providers to help us understand their investment appetite and criteria.
As ever, our Senior Independent Director remains available to address 
any concerns shareholders may wish to raise, other than via the usual 
channels of the Chairman, Chief Executive or other Executive Directors 
(A.4.1) .

Committee composition and governance
During the year, the Committee was wholly composed of independent 
Non-Executive Directors, being Aubrey Adams, Simon Borrows  
and myself as Committee Chairman. With effect from 1 April 2017  
Lord Macpherson joined the Committee.
British Land has announced that Simon Borrows will retire from  
the Board, and this Committee, at the conclusion of the 2017 AGM.  
I would like to thank Simon for his valuable contribution as a  
member of this Committee.
The Board remains satisfied that each of the Committee members  
is appropriately qualified and experienced to undertake their  
roles. For the purposes of the Code, I am deemed to meet the  
specific requirement of having significant, recent and relevant  
financial experience (C.3.1) .
By invitation, members of management attend Committee meetings. 
These include the Chief Financial Officer, Chief Executive Officer,  
Company Secretary and General Counsel, Group Financial Controller, 
Head of Investor Relations, Head of Financial Reporting and Head of 
Planning and Analysis as well as representatives of both external and 
internal auditors. The Committee met privately with both external  
and internal auditors three times during the year and is satisfied  
that neither is being unduly influenced by management.
As Committee Chairman, I additionally hold regular meetings  
with the Chief Financial Officer and other members of management.  
These meetings provide me with a better understanding of key issues  
and identify those matters which require meaningful discussion at 
Committee meetings. I also meet the external audit partner, internal 
audit partner and representatives from each of the valuers to discuss  
any matters or concerns they have.
During the year, the Committee received reports from management, 
external and internal auditors, external valuers and the Risk Committee. 
These reports have allowed the Committee to scrutinise and ask questions 
where further clarification or discussion was required. Further details 
on the work undertaken by the Committee are set out in the section on 
‘Key activities during the year’ on page 68.
Tim Score
Chairman of the Audit Committee
I am pleased to present the report of the Audit Committee for the  
year ended 31 March 2017.
This year, the key areas of focus for the Committee have been:
 – scrutinising the valuation of investment and development properties
 – monitoring the effectiveness of the new internal auditor and  
reviewing the internal audit plan
 – agreeing a best practice policy for the appointment of the  
Company’s external valuers 
 – reviewing the appropriateness of continuing to publish interim 
management statements and
 – monitoring the quality, consistency and integrity of the Company’s 
financial reporting, including assessing whether the Annual Report  
is fair, balanced and understandable
67 British Land  Annual Report and Accounts 2017
REPORT OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE Key activities during the year
The key activities undertaken by the Committee are set out below.
1. External audit
The Committee is responsible for overseeing the relationship with  
the external auditor and for considering their terms of engagement, 
remuneration, effectiveness, independence and continued objectivity. 
The Committee annually reviews the audit requirements of the Group, 
for the business and in the context of the external environment, placing 
great importance on ensuring a high quality, effective external audit 
process. In particular, during the year, the Committee reviewed  
and approved the annual audit plan and reviewed the findings of the  
external audit and management’s responsiveness to those findings. 
In accordance with best practice and its own terms of reference,  
the Committee undertakes an annual review of the performance  
of the external auditor. During this review, the Committee considered  
the external auditor’s technical competence, strategic knowledge, 
reporting, their independence, and compliance with relevant  
statutory, regulatory and ethical standards. (C.3.8) .
The Committee noted the results of the Financial Reporting Council’s 
Audit Quality Review (AQR) of PwC’s audit of the Company, along with 
their performance on other audits of listed companies.
The Committee reviewed PwC’s performance during the year ended  
31 March 2017 and was content with the quality of the audit work 
undertaken and the knowledge and competence of the audit team.  
The external auditor confirmed to the Committee that it maintains 
appropriate internal safeguards to ensure its independence and 
objectivity. The Committee considered and approved PwC’s  
assessment of its independence and has recommended to the  
Board that a resolution for the reappointment of PwC as external  
auditor be put to shareholders at the 2017 AGM (C.3.7) .
British Land undertook a tender of external audit services in 2014 
resulting in the appointment of PwC as external auditor. This is the  
third year that PwC have audited the Annual Report. The Committee will 
consider the need for a competitive tender for the role of external auditor 
every five years, with a competitive tender taking place at least every  
ten years. There are no contractual obligations which would restrict  
the selection of a different auditor. The Committee will also ensure  
that the rotation of audit partner is undertaken as required by  
legislation to the extent that this is not undertaken earlier by PwC.
Role and responsibilities
The principal responsibilities of the Committee are:
1  External audit – Oversight and remuneration of the external 
auditor, assessing effectiveness and making recommendations 
to the Board on the appointment of, and the policy for, non-audit 
services provided by the external auditor
2  Financial reporting – Monitoring the integrity of the Company’s 
financial statements and any formal announcements relating 
to financial performance, and considering significant financial 
reporting issues, judgements and estimates
3  Investment and development property valuations – 
Considering the valuation process and the effectiveness 
of the Company’s valuers
4  Risk management and internal controls – Reviewing the 
system of internal control and risk management
5  Internal audit – Monitoring and reviewing reports on the work 
performed by the internal auditor and reviewing effectiveness, 
audit plans and resourcing
Provision of non-audit services (C.3.8)  
The Committee has adopted a policy for the provision of non-audit 
services by the external auditor. The policy helps to safeguard the 
external auditor’s independence and objectivity and was reviewed  
and updated during the year. The policy allows the external auditor  
to provide the following non-audit services to British Land where  
they are considered to be the most appropriate provider:
 – Audit related services: including formal reporting relating to 
borrowings, shareholder and other circulars and work in respect  
of acquisitions and disposals. In some circumstances, the external 
auditor is required to carry out the work because of their office.  
In other circumstances, selection would depend on which firm  
was best suited to provide the services required 
 – Sustainability assurance: PwC currently provides an assurance 
opinion to the Company over selected sustainability data.  
This appointment is reviewed annually.
In addition, the protocols that apply to non-audit fees are:
 – Total non-audit fees are limited to 70% of the audit fees in any one year. 
Details of the audit and non-audit fees paid during the year are set out  
in Note 5 on page 109. The audit and non-audit fees for the three year 
average are calculated in line with the methodology set out in the  
2014 EU Regulations and include fees for joint ventures and funds 
 – Committee approval is required where there might be doubts  
as to whether the external auditor had a conflict of interest and
 – Pre-approval by the Audit Committee Chairman is required for  
each additional project or incremental fee over £25,000 (previously 
£100,000) and Committee approval required for any additional 
projects over £100,000 
During the year one engagement relating to Sustainability assurance 
required approval. This was approved by the Audit Committee Chairman 
on the basis that PwC were best placed to provide this service and  
that it created no conflict of interest with their role as external auditor. 
2. Financial reporting
At the request of the Board the Committee reviewed the content and tone 
of the preliminary results press release, Annual Report and half year 
results as well as the quarterly trading updates. 
The Committee received a broad outline of the Annual Report structure  
and content early in the process. Further drafts of the Annual Report 
were reviewed by the Committee prior to formal consideration by the 
Board, with sufficient time to allow feedback. The Committee considered 
the key messages included in the Annual Report, half year results and 
the trading updates issued during the year. As well as content and tone  
of results, the Committee paid particular attention to financial reporting 
matters it considers to be important by virtue of size, complexity, level of 
judgement required and potential impact on the financial statements and 
wider business model. Identification of the issues deemed to be significant 
took place following open and frank discussion between the Committee, 
Chief Financial Officer, PwC, internal audit and other relevant British 
Land employees.
Following the Committee’s review, and receipt of an external audit 
opinion from PwC, the Committee has satisfied itself that controls  
over the accuracy and consistency of the information presented in the 
Annual Report are robust. The Committee recommended to the Board 
that the Annual Report presented a fair, balanced and understandable 
overview of the business of the Group and that it provides stakeholders 
with the necessary information to assess the Group’s position, 
performance, business model and strategy (C.3.4) .
The Committee also considered the continuing use of interim management 
statements between the full and half year announcements. Having taken 
into account the views of investors, the Committee recommended to the 
Board that the Company should cease publishing interim management 
statements from 1 April 2017.

68 British Land  Annual Report and Accounts 2017
REPORT OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE CONTINUED The significant issues considered by the Committee during the year ended 31 March 2017 and the actions taken to address these issues, are set out in 
the table below (C.3.8) .
Significant issues in relation to  
financial statements considered  
by the Committee during the year
How these issues
were addressed
by the Committee
Viability 
statement
Whether the assessment 
undertaken by management 
regarding the Group’s long  
term viability appropriately 
reflects the prospects of  
the Group and covers an 
appropriate period of time.
The Committee considered whether the assessment performed by management adequately 
reflected the Group’s risk appetite and principal risks as disclosed on pages 50 to 53; whether 
the period covered by the statement was reasonable given the strategy of the Group and the 
environment in which it operates; and whether the assumptions and sensitivities identified 
and stress tested represented severe but plausible scenarios in the context of solvency  
or liquidity. 
Following this evaluation, along with consideration of the external auditor’s report, the 
Committee agreed with management’s assessment and recommended the viability statement 
for approval by the Board. The viability statement, together with further details on the 
assessment undertaken, is set out on page 49 of the Strategic Report. 
Going concern 
statement
The appropriateness  
of preparing the Group  
financial statements on 
a going concern basis.
The Committee reviewed management’s analysis supporting the going concern basis  
of preparation, including consideration of forecast cash flows, availability of committed  
debt facilities and expected covenant headroom. 
The Committee also received a report from the external auditor on the results of the testing 
undertaken on management’s analysis. As a result of the assessment undertaken, the 
Committee satisfied itself that the going concern basis of preparation remained appropriate.
The going concern statement is set out on page 65 of the Corporate Governance Report.
Valuation  
of property 
portfolio
The valuation of investment  
and development properties 
conducted by external valuers  
is inherently subjective as it  
is undertaken on the basis  
of assumptions made by  
the valuers which may not  
prove to be accurate.
The outcome of the valuation  
is significant to the Group in 
terms of investment decisions, 
results and remuneration.
The external valuers presented their reports to the Committee prior to the half year  
and full year results, providing an overview of the UK property market and summarising  
the performance of the Group’s assets. Significant judgements were also highlighted.
The Committee analysed the reports and reviewed the valuation outcomes, challenging 
assumptions where thought fit. In particular this year, the effect of the EU referendum  
on property valuations and market sentiment was examined in detail.
The Committee was satisfied with the valuation process and the effectiveness of the 
Company’s valuers. The Committee also approved the relevant valuation disclosures  
to be included in the Annual Report.
Accounting  
for significant 
transactions
The accounting treatment  
of significant property 
acquisitions, disposals and 
financing transactions, is a 
recurring risk for the Group  
with non-standard accounting 
entries required, and in  
some cases management 
judgement applied.
The Committee reviewed management papers on key judgements, including those  
for significant transactions, as well as the external auditor’s findings on these matters.
In particular, the Committee considered the accounting treatment of The Leadenhall  
Building transaction, the disposal of Debenhams, Oxford Street and the impact of share  
price movements on the accounting treatment of the 2012 convertible bond, including  
the change in dilutive impact on the Company’s key metrics. 
The external auditor confirmed that management’s judgements in relation to these 
transactions were appropriate. The Committee agreed with this conclusion.
REIT status Maintenance of the Group’s 
REIT status through compliance 
with certain conditions has  
a significant impact on the 
Group’s results.
The Committee reviewed the Company’s compliance with the REIT tests. Management 
presented details of the methodology and results of their process for REIT testing, 
highlighting any change in long term trends and the current level of headroom. 
The external auditor presented the conclusions of their review of the REIT tests performed  
by management and the Committee concluded that the Company’s REIT status had been 
maintained in the year.
Revenue 
recognition
For certain transactions, 
judgement is applied by 
management as to whether,  
and to what extent, they  
should be treated as revenue  
for the financial year.
The Committee and the external auditor considered the appropriateness of the accounting 
treatment applied by management in relation to revenue recognition. In particular the 
Committee considered the accounting of significant payments received in the year in  
relation to the development and occupation of 5 Broadgate and were satisfied with their 
treatment as capital items.
The Committee considered the scope of the accounting standard and agreed with the 
reasonableness of the judgement made.
69 British Land  Annual Report and Accounts 2017 3. Investment and development property valuations
The external valuation of British Land’s portfolio is a key determinant  
of the Group’s balance sheet, performance and senior management’s 
remuneration. In accordance with its terms of reference, the Committee 
adopts a rigorous approach to monitoring and reviewing the valuation 
process and the effectiveness of the Group’s valuers, Knight Frank, CBRE 
and Jones Lang LaSalle. The Committee reviews the effectiveness of the 
external valuers bi-annually; focusing on a quantitative analysis of capital 
values, yield benchmarking, availability of comparable market evidence 
and major outliers to subsector movements, with an annual qualitative 
review of the level of service received from each valuer. 
The valuers attended the Committee meetings which considered the  
half year and annual results, and presented their reports including 
providing confirmation of the valuation process, market conditions  
and significant judgements made. PwC reviewed the valuations and 
valuation process, having had full access to the valuers to determine  
that due process had been followed and appropriate information used.  
It reported its findings to the Committee. The valuation process was  
also subject to regular review by internal audit.
British Land has fixed fee arrangements in place with the valuers  
in relation to the valuation of wholly-owned assets, in line with the 
recommendations of the Carsberg Committee Report. Copies of the 
valuation certificates of Knight Frank, CBRE and JLL can be found  
on the corporate website at ww w.britishland.com/reports
The Company has adopted a best practice policy on the appointment  
of external valuers. The policy covers duration of appointments and  
the number of valuers engaged across the portfolio. Implementation  
of the policy will commence during the year ending 31 March 2018  
and further details will be given in the 2018 Annual Report. 
4. Risk management and internal controls
The Committee is responsible for overseeing the effectiveness of  
the Group’s risk management and internal control systems on behalf  
of the Board. This Committee has oversight of the activities of the Risk 
Committee, receiving minutes of all Risk Committee meetings and 
discussing any significant matters. Prior to the announcement of full  
year and half year results the Committee reviews the Group’s principal 
risks. This includes a commentary on how risk exposures have changed 
during the period and any emerging risks in the Company’s risk register. 
In particular, consideration has been given to the effect on the Company’s 
external economic and internal strategic aims following the EU 
referendum result, geopolitical unrest and capital growth forecasts.  
The Committee reviewed management’s response to these matters 
including impact on near term budgeting and future investment and 
development strategy. The Committee considered and recommended  
the Group’s risk appetite to the Board for approval, ensuring that it  
was set at an appropriate level to achieve strategic goals without taking 
undue risk. The Committee reviewed the status of key risk indicators 
throughout the year against the risk appetite set, with focus on those  
that were outside optimal ranges.
Half-yearly, the internal auditor reports to the Committee on the 
effectiveness of management’s internal controls, including a thematic 
analysis of control issues identified by management. Internal audit  
and the Risk Committee work closely together to ensure that identified 
risk areas are incorporated in the internal audit plan and similarly,  
the findings of internal audits are taken into account when identifying  
and evaluating risks within the business. For the year ended  
31 March 2017, the internal auditor confirmed that the system  
of risk management and internal controls had been effective. 
Further details of the Company’s internal control systems can  
be found on page 65 of the Corporate Governance Report.
5. Internal audit
As set out in the 2016 Annual Report, a formal tender of internal audit 
services was undertaken during the first quarter of 2016. A selection  
panel was established which I chaired, comprising the Chief Financial 
Officer, Company Secretary and General Counsel and senior members  
of the Finance team. The principal criteria considered by the panel 
included the skills and experience of the proposed teams, cultural fit  
with British Land, insight and external perspectives to add value and 
expected fee arrangements. Ernst & Young LLP (EY) were identified  
as the preferred candidate and appointed to the role following  
approval by the Board on the Committee’s recommendation. 
The Committee reviewed and approved the internal audit plan for the year, 
including a consideration of its alignment to the principal risks of the 
Group and its joint ventures. EY have attended all Committee meetings 
during the year to present their observations arising from the audits 
undertaken and the status of any resulting management actions.
Internal audits undertaken by EY and reviewed by the Committee in the  
year included: property development including procurement, third party 
contract management, property valuations and statistics, property 
management contract acquisitions, property disposals and the wider  
risk management process, treasury, payroll and human resources.  
The audits revealed no significant issues however a number of process  
and control improvements were suggested and implemented in the year  
by management. EY also provided assurance over the effectiveness of  
key financial controls in the year and a number of advisory reviews were 
conducted over business continuity and IT processes including the ongoing 
design and implementation of a new finance general ledger system. 
The performance of internal audit was monitored throughout the  
year through the review, challenge and discussion of EY’s findings.  
The Committee reviewed the internal audit charter which defines  
EY’s role and responsibilities. A formal review of the effectiveness  
of the internal auditor was undertaken and, as a result of this review,  
the Committee believed that EY discharged its duties effectively  
(C.3.6)  during the year ended 31 March 2017.
Other matters discussed and reviewed by the Committee
In addition to the key areas set out above, the Committee considered 
the following matters during the year ended 31 March 2017:
Reporting and 
external audit
 – Changes to accounting policies
 – Annual audit plan and external  
auditor’s remuneration
Risk and internal 
control

John Gildersleeve (Chairman) (A.1.2) 2/2
William Jackson 2/2
Lord Turnbull 2/2
John Gildersleeve
Chairman of the Nomination Committee
Welcome to the report of the Nomination Committee.
The Committee considers that the Board consists of individuals with  
the right balance of skills, experience and knowledge to provide strong 
and effective leadership of the Company. The majority of the Board  
are independent Non-Executive Directors, and the Board’s collective 
experience covers a range of relevant sectors, as illustrated on page 56. 
As well as a breadth of property and financial experience, many Board 
members have personal experience of working in the retail and 
corporate environments that are typical of many of our occupiers.
In December 2016 Lord Macpherson was appointed as a Non-Executive 
Director, In addition, on 1 September 2017 Preben Prebensen will join  
the Board and the Remuneration Committee. Details of our appointment 
process are given on page 72.
We recognise the importance of continuity and the value that Directors 
who serve for many years bring. Aubrey Adams will be approaching  
the end of his ninth year as a Non-Executive Director by the time of  
our 2017 AGM. 
Aubrey’s considerable expertise in the property sector is an important 
part of the mix of skills and experience on our Board. The Committee 
undertook a rigorous review of Aubrey’s contributions to the Board and 
the Audit Committee and his independence and determined that Aubrey 
remained independent in character and judgement. We are delighted  
to recommend that Aubrey be invited to serve as an independent 
Non-Executive Director for a further one year term. The process to 
recruit an additional Non-Executive Director with property sector 
experience is under way (B.2.3) . 
Committee composition and governance
Membership of the Committee remained unchanged during the year  
to 31 March 2017 and comprised William Jackson, Lord Turnbull  
and myself as Committee Chairman. With effect from 1 April 2017,  
Tim Score, Chairman of the Audit Committee joined the Committee. 
We announced in March that Lord Turnbull will retire from the Board, 
and its Committees, at the conclusion of the 2017 AGM. I would like  
to thank Lord Turnbull for the support and advice he has provided  
to the Nomination Committee during his tenure. His guidance and 
experience will be missed. 
The Committee met twice during the year. By invitation, Tim Score  
and Chris Grigg, Chief Executive, attended both meetings. 
The Committee leads the process 
for Board appointments
Role and responsibilities
The Committee’s role and responsibilities are set out in  
its terms of reference found on the Company’s website at  
ww w.britishland.com/committees (B.2.1) .
The Committee’s principal responsibilities are:
 – reviewing the structure, size and composition of the Board  
and its Committees and recommending changes to the Board
 – considering succession planning for Directors and other  
senior executives
 – reviewing the independence and time commitment 
requirements of Non-Executive Directors and 
 – making recommendations as to the Directors standing  
for election or re-election at the AGM
71 British Land  Annual Report and Accounts 2017
REPORT OF THE NOMINATION COMMITTEE Key activities during the year
During the year, the Committee has undertaken each of its principal 
responsibilities as set out on page 71.
Composition of the Board and Committees
The Committee reviewed the composition of the Board, and considered 
whether the range of skills, experience and knowledge that the Directors 
bring continue to provide strong and effective leadership of the Company, 
and their length of tenure.
The Zygos Partnership (Zygos), an external search agency, was engaged 
by the Committee to assist with the recruitment process in relation  
to Lord Macpherson and Preben Prebensen. Zygos’ role included  
the preparation of detailed role specifications, searching for and 
benchmarking suitable candidates, and producing detailed personal 
profiles for the Committee’s consideration. Other than the provision  
of recruitment consultancy services, Zygos does not have any  
connection with British Land (B.2.4) .
The Board’s collective experience covers a range of relevant sectors,  
as illustrated on pages 56 to 59. The Committee considered the skills, 
experience and knowledge of each candidate as well as their ability  
to provide the appropriate level of scrutiny and challenge expected  
of independent Non-Executive Directors.
Throughout the year, the membership of the Audit, Remuneration  
and Nomination Committees comprised independent Non-Executive 
Directors to the extent required by the Code (B.2.1) . William Jackson 
succeeded Lord Turnbull as Chairman of the Remuneration Committee 
following the 2016 AGM when Lord Turnbull retired from that role.  
Lord Turnbull remains a member of the Remuneration Committee  
until the conclusion of the 2017 AGM when he will stand down as  
a Director and Senior Independent Director. William Jackson will  
succeed Lord Turnbull as the Senior Independent Director at that time.
On 1 April 2017, Lord Macpherson was appointed to the Audit  
Committee and Tim Score joined the Nomination Committee. 
The Committee undertook a detailed review of the continued 
independence of each of the Non-Executive Directors, the time 
commitment required and whether it was in the best interests of  
the Company for each Director to be recommended for re-appointment. 
Detailed consideration was given to each Non-Executive Director’s 
contribution to the Board and its Committees, together with the overall 
balance of knowledge, skills, experience and diversity on the Board. 
In accordance with the Code, all continuing Directors will retire at the 
Annual General Meeting in 2017 and submit themselves for election,  
in the case of Lord Macpherson, or re-election by shareholders. 
Following their review, the Committee is of the opinion that each  
Director continues to demonstrate commitment to his or her role  
as a member of the Board and its Committees, discharges his or  
her duties effectively and that each makes a valuable contribution  
to the leadership of the Company for the benefit of all stakeholders. 
Succession 
The Committee regularly reviews the adequacy of succession 
arrangements for the Board, including the Chief Executive, and other 
members of senior management. The Chief Executive is responsible  
for developing succession plans for the remaining Executive Directors 
and senior management which are presented to and commented on  
by the Committee. The Chairman is responsible for developing the 
succession plan for the Chief Executive, which is considered at least 
annually by the Committee. 
Board diversity
British Land pays full regard to the benefits of diversity, including  
gender diversity, both when the Nomination Committee is searching  
for candidates for Board appointments and when the Company is 
searching for candidates for other appointments.
British Land currently has three female Board members; Lynn Gladden 
and Laura Wade-Gery, both Non-Executive Directors, and Lucinda Bell, 
Chief Financial Officer. This represents 23% female Board membership 
(2016: 25%). The percentage of female Board members is expected to 
return to 25% once the announced Board changes have taken place. 
Achieving a more diverse Board, including increasing in the percentage 
of female Board members, will be subject to the availability of suitable 
candidates; the Board must ensure that appointments are of the 
candidates best able to promote the success of the Company.  
Subject to this requirement, the Board remains committed to further 
strengthening diversity, including female representation, at Board  
and senior management level. 
Focus for the coming year
For the coming year, the Committee will continue to review and  
develop succession planning for Executive Directors and senior 
management and will oversee the triennial externally facilitated  
Board evaluation.

and strategy for members of the Executive Committee and  
other members of executive management whilst having  
regard to pay and employment conditions across the Group

William Jackson
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee
Dear Shareholder
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report for the year ended 31 March 2017.
This is my first report as Chairman of British Land’s Remuneration 
Committee, having succeeded Lord Turnbull at the 2016 AGM. I would 
like to thank Lord Turnbull for his stewardship over the last few years 
and am grateful that he has remained on the Committee until this  
year’s AGM and continued to offer his knowledge and experience  
of remuneration matters within British Land. We look forward to 
welcoming Preben Prebensen, who will join as a Non-Executive  
Director and a member of this Committee on 1 September 2017.
British Land operates to high standards of remuneration practice.  
We would like to thank shareholders for reflecting this with their support  
for the Remuneration Policy at the 2016 AGM. Over 97% supported  
the new Remuneration Policy and over 96% supported the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report. 
The performance measures that determine the levels of variable pay  
for Executive Directors are fully aligned with the Company’s business 
strategy. These measures are mainly relative and have the objective  
of incentivising the Directors to deliver higher returns than the market.  
This means that if in any year the Company delivers weaker performance 
on a relative basis, variable pay is lower, and if it delivers stronger 
performance, variable pay is higher.
Over the year under review, despite the Company delivering good 
financial results in an eventful year, our relative property sector 
performance has been slightly above or just below market level rather 
than delivering the clear outperformance we aspire to achieve. As a 
result, payouts from our annual incentive plans are lower than last year. 
We expect the LTIP maturing this year will lapse as will half of the MSP 
awards vesting in June 2017. The Committee believes that this outcome 
shows that the Company’s remuneration policies are working correctly  
in the interests of shareholders and other stakeholders.
We are not making any revisions to the approved Remuneration Policy 
this year. However, we are aware of the current debate on remuneration 
practice and regularly review and challenge target setting for Executive 
Directors. We ensure this complies with best practice but also that the 
targets set align management actions with our strategy and the long 
term interests of shareholders and other stakeholders. During the year 
we have continued to take into account the views of our shareholders, 
investor representative bodies and governance advisory organisations  
in the way the Remuneration Policy is applied. In particular we have 
responded to feedback about the importance of simplifying executive  
pay and remuneration reporting as well as ensuring that remuneration  
is aligned with our strategy.
Our Remuneration Policy  
aligns management incentives 
with our strategy
73 British Land  Annual Report and Accounts 2017
REMUNERATION REPORT : LETTER FROM THE CHAIRMAN OF THE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE When our Remuneration Policy was introduced in 2016 we moved to one 
single long term incentive arrangement and selected three performance 
measures which closely align with our strategy (see full details on page 
77). In 2017 we are continuing to simplify our remuneration structure  
by reducing the number of quantitative measures for the annual incentive 
arrangements, from five to two, and introducing weightings for the 
proportion of maximum annual incentive award opportunity represented  
by each measure. The three measures that will no longer apply are 
adequately covered by the remaining measures in the Annual Incentive 
Plan and LTIP. The remaining performance measures, set out in full  
on page 76, better align the annual incentive awards made to Executive 
Directors with British Land’s strategic focus on creating Places People 
Prefer and delivering sustainable long term value for all stakeholders.
In this Remuneration Report, we have also further enhanced our 
disclosure of how we assess Executive Directors’ performance for 
annual incentive purposes. 
Our continuing focus on better alignment of remuneration with  
strategy is reflected in our decision to use the Investment Property 
Databank (IPD) March Annual Universe benchmark when assessing 
performance against the Total Property Returns measure for annual 
incentive awards and LTIP awards for the year commencing 1 April  
2017. The March Annual Universe benchmark is more appropriate  
for this purpose as the companies from which asset related information 
is sourced are more representative of our peer group. In addition 
measuring our performance against this benchmark, which includes 
sales, acquisitions and developments and so takes account of active 
asset management, positively supports achievement of the Company’s 
strategy. We weight this benchmark to reflect the sectors in which  
our assets are classified.
Remuneration in respect of the year ended  
31 March 2017 
Remuneration within British Land continues to be closely tied to the 
financial performance of the Group and the extent to which both short 
and long term strategic objectives are met. 
The annual incentive plan payout is based on performance against 
unlevered capital return, total property return and profit growth, 
together with qualitative measures supporting Places People Prefer  
and individual objectives. However, the quantitative objectives of total 
accounting return vs property majors and ERV growth against IPD  
were both below median and as a result, do not contribute to the  
award. The result of our performance gives an award of around  
one-third of the maximum, equivalent to approximately 50% of basic 
salary. This is a significant reduction over earlier years and shows that 
our pay structure is truly variable and reflects performance achieved.
The LTIP awards granted in 2014 and vesting in June 2017 are based  
on relative performance for the three years ended 31 March 2017.  
These are expected to lapse in full. In addition, only half of the MSP 
award made in respect of 2014 is expected to vest. Once again these 
significant reductions in share-based variable pay show how the 
structure is aligned to performance outcomes over the longer term.
Remuneration in respect of the year commencing 
1 April 2017
Salary and fees
The Committee has discussed and reviewed the Company’s annual 
salary process for all employees. It has also reviewed the basic salaries 
of the Executive Directors and the Chairman’s annual fee and concluded 
that these should remain unchanged for the coming year.
Annual incentives
We have simplified the performance measures for the annual  
incentive awards and introduced strict weightings to each measure.  
For the coming year, 70% of any potential award will be dependent on 
successfully achieving financial targets with 20% based on achieving 
qualitative and 10% on individual targets. Our decision to reduce  
the number of quantitative measures will produce clearer targets. 
Further information is provided on page 76.
Long-term incentives
The first long-term incentive awards under the Remuneration Policy 
approved in 2016 will be granted during this coming year.
Diversity and inclusion
The Committee carefully monitors the Company’s strategic focus on 
diversity and inclusion and has undertaken preparatory analyses for  
the disclosure requirements of gender pay reporting. Full disclosures 
will be published on our website when complete. Diversity data is  
given in the Strategic Report on pages 24 and 25.
Remuneration consultants
In early 2017 a tender of remuneration advisory services was 
undertaken. A panel was established to oversee the tender on behalf  
of the Committee whose members included Chris Grigg, Lord Turnbull, 
and Ann Henshaw (HR Director). I chaired the panel. Several providers 
were invited to present to the panel and, after due process and 
deliberation, the Committee appointed Korn Ferry Hay Group Limited  
to be its remuneration adviser with effect from 21 March 2017. We  
would like to thank FIT Remuneration Consultants LLP, and Alan Judes 
in particular, for the advice, guidance and support provided over the 
years. We wish Alan a good retirement.
Recommendation 
British Land continues to strive to apply best practice in its remuneration 
policies and to listen carefully to shareholder feedback. We therefore 
hope that you all show your support for our approach to remuneration  
by voting for the Directors Remuneration Report at the 2017 AGM.

 Annual Incentive awards
The maximum bonus opportunity for Executive Directors remains at 150% of salary. The performance measures for the Annual Incentive awards 
have been selected to reflect a range of quantitative and qualitative goals that support the Company’s key strategic objectives. The performance 
measures and weightings for the year commencing 1 April 2017 will be as follows:
Measure
Proportion of annual 
incentive as a percentage 
of maximum opportunity
Quantitative measures 70%
Total property return relative to IPD (sector reweighted) 42%
Profit growth relative to budget 28%
Qualitative measures 20%
Right Places – Progress on key projects including developments 5%
Customer Orientation – Company reputation with all stakeholders 5%
Capital Efficiency – Execution of targeted acquisitions and disposals 
 – Progress on strengthening the dividend 5%
Expert People – Promoting an inclusive, performance driven culture 5%
Individual objectives Performance against individual success factors 10%
The Committee has set targets for the quantitative measures and will disclose these in the 2018 Remuneration Report as they are felt to be 
commercially sensitive. In assessing how the Executive Directors performed during the year commencing 1 April 2017, the Committee will take  
into account their performance against all of the measures and make an assessment in the round to ensure that performance warrants the  
level of award determined by the table above.
During the year, the Committee considered whether the current Investment Property Databank (IPD) benchmarks against which the performance 
of annual and long-term incentive awards is assessed were the most appropriate measures. Following discussion with the Committee’s adviser, 
management and our own deliberations, the Committee agreed that the sector weighted IPD March Annual Universe benchmark which includes 
sales, acquisitions and developments and so takes into account active asset management as well as being a more representative peer group,  
would be most suitable. 
As a result of this decision, from 1 April 2017, the disclosed performance against IPD metrics for the annual incentive plan will be based on IPD 
estimates. These estimates will be adjusted once the IPD March Annual Universe data becomes available. No annual incentive payments will  
be made, or LTIP awards granted, to Executive Directors until the IPD March Annual Universe data is available and the final out-turn known.  
The final awards under the annual incentive plan will be detailed in the next Remuneration Report.

76 British Land  Annual Report and Accounts 2017
REMUNERATION REPORT : ANNUAL REPORT ON REMUNERATION  Long-Term incentive awards
The first LTIP award under the new Remuneration Policy will be made to Executive Directors during the year commencing 1 April 2017. It is 
anticipated that the grant size of LTIP awards to be made in the year commencing 1 April 2017 will be 250% of salary for each Executive Director.  
This is below the maximum available under the policy of 300% of salary approved by shareholders last year.
The performance measures that apply to this, and any future, LTIP award will be as follows:
Measure Link to strategy Measured relative to Weighting
Total Property Return (TPR)
The change in capital value, 
less any capital expenditure 
incurred, plus net income. TPR 
is expressed as a percentage  
of capital employed over the  
LTIP performance period and 
is calculated by IPD.
The TPR measure is designed to 
link reward to strong performance 
at the gross property level.
TPR performance will be assessed against the 
performance of an IPD benchmark.
40%
Total Accounting Return (TAR)
The growth in British Land’s  
EPRA NAV per share plus 
dividends per share paid over  
the LTIP performance period.
The TAR measure is designed  
to link reward to performance  
at the net property level that  
takes account of gearing and our 
distributions to shareholders.
TAR will be measured relative to a comparator group 
consisting of the 17 largest FTSE property companies 
that use EPRA accounting (including British Land).
40%
Total Shareholder Return (TSR)
The growth in value of a British 
Land shareholding over the LTIP 
performance period, assuming 
dividends are reinvested to 
purchase additional shares.
The TSR measure is designed to 
directly correlate reward with the 
return delivered to shareholders.
50% of the TSR measure will be measured relative to 
the performance of the FTSE 100 and 50% of the TSR 
measure will be measured relative to the performance 
of a comparator group consisting of the 17 largest  
FTSE property companies that use EPRA accounting 
(including British Land).
20%
Performance against the LTIP measures will be assessed over a period of three years. 100% of the proportion of the award attached to each 
measure will vest if British Land’s performance is at least at the upper quartile level. If performance against a measure is equal to the median, 
20% of the proportion attached to that measure will vest and if performance is below median the proportion attached to that measure will lapse. 
There will be straight-line vesting between median and upper quartile performance for each measure.
Chairman’s and Non-Executive Directors’ fees
Fees paid to the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors are positioned around the median of our comparator group of companies (FTSE 100 
companies with broadly similar market capitalisations to British Land) with the aim of attracting individuals with the appropriate degree of expertise 
and experience. The fee structure set out below was adopted at the 2016 AGM and no changes are proposed for the year commencing 1 April 2017.
Chairman’s annual fee £369,340
Non-Executive Director’s annual fee £61,000
Senior Independent Director’s annual fee £10,000
Audit Committee or Remuneration Committee Chairman’s annual fee £20,000

the TAR element was expected to vest at 44%. The actual vesting percentages were confirmed in July 2016 as 69% for TPR and 43.7% for TAR. The 2016 comparative 
numbers set out in the above table reflect the actual vesting values of the awards, replacing the estimated vesting values disclosed in the 2016 Annual Report. The MSP 
awards granted to Executive Directors in June 2013 vested on 2 August 2016. These MSP awards were subject to the same performance conditions as the MSP awards 
granted in 2014 (see page 81). As disclosed in the 2016 Annual Report, the TSR element of the 2013 award did not vest while the GIG element was expected to vest at 
100%. The vesting percentage for the GIG element was confirmed by the Committee in July 2016. In the 2016 Annual Report the share price for the period 1 January  
to 31 March 2016 was used. This has now been replaced by the actual price on the date of vesting.

REMUNERATION REPORT : ANNUAL REPORT ON REMUNERATION CONTINUED  Long-term incentives (audited information)
The information in the long-term incentives column in the single total figure of remuneration table (see page 78) relates to vesting of awards granted 
under the following schemes, including, where applicable, dividend equivalent payments on those awards and interest accrued on those dividend 
equivalents. 
Long-term Incentive Plan (LTIP)
The awards granted to Executive Directors on 23 June 2014, and which will vest on 23 June 2017, were subject to two equally weighted performance 
conditions over the three year period to 31 March 2017. The first measured British Land’s TPR relative to the funds in the December IPD UK Annual 
Property Index (the Index), while the second measured TAR relative to a comparator group of British Land and 16 other property companies. 
The TPR element is expected to vest at 0% based on British Land’s adjusted TPR of 10.7% compared to the funds in the Index of 11.9%. The TAR 
element is expected to vest at 0%. The actual vesting rate of the TAR element can only be calculated once results have been published by all 
of the companies within the comparator group. The actual percentage vesting will be confirmed by the Committee in due course and included 
in the 2018 Remuneration Report.

Matching Share Plan (MSP)
The performance conditions for the MSP Matching awards granted on 30 June 2014 were (i) TSR relative to a comparator group of British Land and 16 
other property companies and (ii) British Land’s gross income growth (GIG) relative to the IPD Quarterly Universe (the Universe). These performance 
conditions are equally weighted. The MSP Matching awards will vest on 30 June 2017. 
Aon Hewitt has confirmed that the TSR element of the award will not vest as British Land’s TSR performance over the period was 1.5% compared to  
a median of 12.7% for the comparator group. The GIG part is expected to vest at 100% as British Land’s annualised GIG over the period is expected  
to exceed the growth of the Universe by more than the upper hurdle of 1.5%. As a result, 50% of the MSP Matching awards granted in June 2014 is 
expected to vest. As disclosed for the 2014 LTIP above, the actual percentage vesting will be confirmed by the Committee and included in the 2018 
Remuneration Report.

LTIP
The total value of each Executive Director’s LTIP award for the year ended 31 March 2017 was equivalent to 200% of basic salary at grant. At grant 
each Director can indicate a preference as to the proportion of the award that they wish to receive as either performance shares or market value 
options. The share price used to determine the face value of performance shares and the fair value of options, and thereby the number of 
performance shares or options awarded, is the average over the three dealing days immediately prior to the day of award. For the award granted  
on 22 June 2016, this share price was 730.5 pence. The performance conditions attached to these awards are identical to those for the awards 
granted in 2014 which vest in June 2017 and are set out on page 81.

Shareholding guidelines
The minimum shareholding guidelines require Executive Directors to hold ordinary shares with a value equal to a set percentage of salary. 
There is no set timescale for Executive Director to reach the prescribed target but they are expected to retain net shares received on the vesting of 
long term incentive awards until the target is achieved. Shares that count towards the holding guideline are unfettered and beneficially owned by the 
Executive Directors and their connected persons. Deferred annual incentive shares, MSP Bonus Shares, SIP matching, dividend and free shares  
and all unvested awards do not count towards the requirement.
The guideline shareholdings for the year commencing 1 April 2017 are shown below:

 See Directors’ shareholdings table above which include MSP Bonus Shares and all shares held in the SIP.
The shareholding guidelines for Executive Directors were last increased with effect from 1 April 2015 when the holding requirement for each Director 
was increased by 25% of basic salary. The Committee continues to review the guidelines and the Directors’ shareholdings.
Although there are no shareholding guidelines for Non-Executive Directors, they are each encouraged to hold shares in British Land. The Company 
facilitates this by offering Non-Executive Directors the ability to purchase shares quarterly using their post-tax fees. During the year ended 31 March 
2017, Lynn Gladden, William Jackson, Tim Score, Lord Turnbull and Laura Wade-Gery have each received shares in full or part satisfaction of their 
Non-Executive Directors’ fees.

85 British Land  Annual Report and Accounts 2017 The Company may terminate an Executive Director’s appointment with immediate effect without notice or payment in lieu of notice under certain 
circumstances, prescribed within each Director’s service contract. The appointment of the Chairman or any Non-Executive Director may be 
terminated immediately without notice if they are not reappointed by shareholders or if they are removed from the Board under the Company’s 
Articles of Association or if they resign and do not offer themselves for re-election. In addition, their appointments may be terminated by either  
the individual or the Company giving three months’ written notice of termination (or, for the Chairman, six months’ written notice of termination). 
Neither the Chairman nor the Non-Executive Directors are entitled to any compensation (other than accrued and unpaid fees and expenses for  
the period up to the termination) for loss of office for any reason.
Executive Directors’ external appointments
Executive Directors may take up one non-executive directorship at another FTSE company, subject to British Land Board approval. 
Chris Grigg was appointed a non-executive director of BAE Systems plc on 1 July 2013. During the year to 31 March 2017, Chris Grigg received a fee  
of £84,000 (including £9,000 of expenses) from BAE Systems plc, which he retained in full (2016: £86,495). Lucinda Bell was appointed a non-executive 
director of Rotork plc on 10 July 2014. During the year to 31 March 2017, Lucinda Bell received a fee of £47,910 from Rotork plc, which she retained in 
full (2016: £43,625) (D.1.2) .
Relative importance of spend on pay
The graph below shows the amount spent on remuneration of all employees (including Executive Directors) relative to the amount spent on 
distributions to shareholders for the years to 31 March 2017 and 31 March 2016. The remuneration of employees increased by 2.5% relative to the 
prior year, while distributions to shareholders increased by 3.1%. Distributions to shareholders include ordinary and, where offered, scrip dividends.

Total Shareholder Return and Chief Executive’s remuneration
The graph opposite shows British Land’s Total Shareholder Return for 
the eight years from 1 April 2009 to 31 March 2017 against that of the 
FTSE Real Estate Investment Trusts (REIT) Total Return Index for the 
same period. The graph shows how the total return on a £100 investment 
in the Company made on 1 April 2009, would have changed over the  
eight year period measured, compared with the total return on a £100 
investment in the FTSE REIT Total Return Index. The FTSE REIT Total 
Return Index has been selected as a suitable comparator because it  
is the index in which British Land’s shares are classified.
The base point, required by the regulations governing Remuneration 
Report disclosures, was close to the bottom of the property cycle at  
1 April 2009. Since British Land’s share price had not fallen as much  
as the average share price of the FTSE REITs Sector at that time a  
higher base point for subsequent growth was set.
The table below sets out the total remuneration of Chris Grigg,  
Chief Executive, over the same period as the Total Shareholder  
Return graph. The quantum of Annual Incentive awards granted  
each year and long term incentive vesting rates are given as a  
percentage of the maximum opportunity available.

Remuneration Committee membership
Membership of the Committee remained unchanged during the year and, as at 31 March 2017, the Committee was comprised wholly of independent 
Non-Executive Directors, namely Lynn Gladden, William Jackson, Laura Wade-Gery and Lord Turnbull. Attendance by each member at Committee 
meetings is set out on page 73.
During the year ended 31 March 2017, Committee meetings were attended by Chris Grigg (Chief Executive), Elaine Williams (Company Secretary 
and General Counsel), Ann Henshaw (HR Director) and Joff Sharpe (Head of Operations), other than for any item relating to their own remuneration.
The Committee Chairman holds regular meetings with the Chairman, Chief Executive and HR Director to discuss all aspects of remuneration  
within British Land. He also meets the Committee’s independent remuneration advisers prior to each substantive meeting to discuss matters  
of governance, remuneration policy and any concerns they may have.
How the Committee discharged its responsibilities during the year
In addition to the Committee’s key areas of responsibility, during the year ended 31 March 2017, the Committee also considered the  
following matters:
 – Reviewing and recommending to the Board the Remuneration Report to be presented for shareholder approval
 – Consultation with major investors and deliberation of outcomes in relation to amendments to the LTIP
 – Appraisal of the Chairman’s annual fee; remuneration of the Executive Directors including achievement of corporate  
and individual performance; and pay and annual incentive awards below Board-level
 – Analysis of competitors’ remuneration structure and outcomes
 – Setting performance measures for annual incentive awards
 – Granting discretionary share awards, considering the extent to which performance measures have been met and,  
where appropriate, approving the vesting of annual incentive and long-term incentive awards
 – Reviewing and updating the Committee terms of reference
 – Considering gender pay and future reporting requirements
 – Receiving updates and training on corporate governance and remuneration matters from the independent  
remuneration consultant
 – Reviewing and tendering the role of independent adviser to the Committee
87 British Land  Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Remuneration consultants (D.2.1) 
Alan Judes provided independent remuneration advice to the Committee prior to August 2016 when his firm, Strategic Remuneration, merged  
with FIT Remuneration Consultants LLP. Following the merger, the Committee received independent remuneration advice from FIT Remuneration 
Consultants LLP. The merged firm is a member of the Remuneration Consultants Group and adheres to that group’s Code of Conduct. Strategic 
Remuneration and FIT Remuneration Consultants LLP also provide advice to British Land on human resources and share plan matters. Strategic 
Remuneration was appointed as remuneration adviser by the Committee following a competitive tender process. The Committee assesses the advice 
given by its advisers to satisfy itself that it is objective and independent. The adviser has a private meeting with the Committee Chairman once a year 
in accordance with the Code of Conduct of the Remuneration Consultants Group. Fees, which are charged on a time basis, were £126,765 (excluding 
VAT) (2016: £48,400 excluding VAT).
With effect from 21 March 2017, Korn Ferry Hay Group Limited were appointed to provide independent remuneration advice to the Committee. 
Korn Ferry Hay Group Limited did not charge any fees for the period from their appointment to 31 March 2017.

Annual General Meeting (AGM)
The Annual General Meeting of The British Land Company PLC will be 
held at The Hyatt Regency London – The Churchill, 30 Portman Square, 
London W1H 7BH on 18 July 2017 at 11.00am. Further information is 
available in the Notice of AGM (E.2.4) . 
The AGM is the principal occasion when shareholders are able to  
ask questions of the Board and main Committee chairmen (E.2.3) .
Board of Directors
The names and biographical details of the current Directors and  
details of the Board Committees of which they are members, are  
set out on pages 56 to 59.
The Service Agreements of the Executive Directors and the Letters  
of Appointment of the Non-Executive Directors are summarised  
in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 85 and 86 and  
are available for inspection at the Company’s registered office. 
In accordance with best practice, all continuing Directors will  
retire at the AGM and will offer themselves for election or  
re-election, as required.
Directors’ interests in contracts and conflicts 
of interest
No contract existed during the year in relation to the Company’s  
business in which any Director was materially interested.
Directors have a statutory duty to avoid situations in which they  
have, or may have, interests that conflict with those of British Land 
unless that conflict is first authorised by the Board. The Company  
has adopted procedures for managing conflicts of interest and the 
Articles of Association also contain provisions which allow the  
Directors to authorise potential conflicts of interest.
Directors must notify the Chairman and the Company Secretary of  
all new outside interests and actual or perceived conflicts of interest  
as they arise. New interests or conflicts are considered by the full  
Board at the next meeting and the full register of interests is reviewed  
at least annually. Furthermore, the Board reviews the policy on 
Directors’ interests on an annual basis. Following the last review  
in November 2016, the Board concluded that the policy continued  
to operate effectively.
Directors’ liability insurance and indemnity
The Company has indemnified each Director against any liability  
incurred in relation to acts or omissions arising in the ordinary  
course of their duties. The indemnity arrangements are qualifying 
indemnity provisions under the Companies Act 2006.
The Company also has in place appropriate Directors’ and Officers’  
liability insurance cover in respect of potential legal action against  
its Directors (A.1.3) .
Share capital
The Company has one class of shares, being ordinary shares of  
25 pence each, all of which are fully paid. At 31 March 2017 there  
were 1,041,035,058 ordinary shares in issue. Further details relating  
to share capital, including movements during the year, are set out  
in note 20 to the financial statements.
At the AGM in 2016, the Directors were given the power by the 
shareholders to make market purchases of ordinary shares representing 
up to 10% of its issued capital at that time and to allot shares within 
certain limits. These authorities will expire at the AGM in July 2017  
and renewals of those authorities will be sought. 
The Company has not purchased any of its own shares under the authority 
given at the 2016 AGM. Therefore, during the whole of the year ended  
31 March 2017, the Company held 11,266,245 ordinary shares in treasury.
Waiver of dividends
Blest Limited is a shareholder who acts as trustee (Trustee) of the 
Company’s discretionary Employee Share Trust (EST). The EST holds 
and, from time to time, purchases British Land ordinary shares in the

DIRECTORS’ REPORT AND ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES CONTINUED The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report,  
the Directors’ Remuneration Report and the financial statements  
in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements  
for each financial year. Under that law the Directors have prepared the 
Group financial statements in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union, and  
the parent Company financial statements in accordance with United 
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom 
Accounting Standards and applicable law). 
Under Company law the Directors must not approve the financial 
statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair  
view of the state of affairs of the Group and the Company and of  
the profit or loss of the Group for that period. In preparing these  
financial statements, the Directors are required to:
 – select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently
 – make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable  
and prudent
 – state whether IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and  
applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject  
to any material departures disclosed and explained in the Group  
and parent Company financial statements respectively and
 – prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis  
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will  
continue in business
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records 
that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s transactions  
and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position 
of the Company and the Group and enable them to ensure that the 
financial statements and the Directors’ Remuneration Report comply 
with the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group financial 
statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. They are also responsible  
for safeguarding the assets of the Company and the Group and hence  
for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud  
and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of  
the Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing  
the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ 
from legislation in other jurisdictions. 
The Directors consider that the Annual Report and Accounts, taken  
as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the 
information necessary for shareholders to assess the Company’s 
position and performance, business model and strategy. 
Each of the Directors, whose names and functions are listed on  
pages 56 to 59, confirm that to the best of their knowledge:
 – the Group financial statements, which have been prepared in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU, give a true and  
fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit  
of the Group and
 – the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report include a fair  
review of the development and performance of the business  
and the position of the Group, together with a description of  
the principal risks and uncertainties that it faces
By order of the Board.

Our audit approach
Overview
Our 2017 audit was planned and executed having regard to the fact  
that the Group’s operations were largely unchanged in nature from the 
previous year. Additionally, there have been no significant changes to the 
valuation methodology and accounting standards relevant to the Group. 
In light of this, our approach to the audit in terms of scoping and areas  
of focus was largely unchanged.
A full scope audit was performed by the Group team for all subsidiaries 
of the Group, and the following joint ventures: Broadgate, Meadowhall 
and Leadenhall.
Materiality
 – Overall Group materiality: £135 million (FY16: £138 million) which 
represents 1% of total assets
 – Specific Group materiality, applied to Underlying Profit; £19.4 million  
(FY16: £18 million) which represents 5% of underlying pre-tax profit
Areas of focus
 – Valuation of investment and development properties
 – Revenue recognition
 – Accounting for transactions
 – Taxation
The scope of our audit and our areas of focus
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards  
on Auditing (UK and Ireland) (‘ISAs (UK & Ireland)’).
We designed our audit by determining materiality and assessing the 
risks of material misstatement in the financial statements. In particular, 
we looked at where the Directors made subjective judgements, for 
example in respect of significant accounting estimates that involved 
making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently 
uncertain. As in all of our audits we also addressed the risk of management 
override of internal controls, including evaluating whether there was 
evidence of bias by the Directors that represented a risk of material 
misstatement due to fraud. 
The risks of material misstatement that had the greatest effect on our 
audit, including the allocation of our resources and effort, are identified 
as ‘areas of focus’ in the table below. We have also set out how we 
tailored our audit to address these specific areas in order to provide an 
opinion on the financial statements as a whole, and any comments we 
make on the results of our procedures should be read in this context. 
This is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT TO THE MEMBERS 
OF THE BRITISH LAND COMPANY PLC Area of focus How our audit addressed the area of focus
Valuation of investment and development properties
Refer to pages 67 and 70 (Report of the Audit Committee), pages 105  
to 107 (Accounting policies) and pages 115 to 119 (Notes).
The Group's investment property portfolio is split between office and 
residential properties in central London, retail and leisure properties 
across the UK, and the assets at the Canada Water site in East London. 
The valuation in the Consolidated Balance Sheet is £9,073 million.
The valuation of the Group's investment property portfolio is inherently 
subjective due to, among other factors, the individual nature of each 
property, its location and the expected future rentals for that particular 
property. For developments, factors include projected costs to complete 
and timing of practical completion.
The valuations were carried out by third party valuers, CB Richard  
Ellis, Jones Lang LaSalle and Knight Frank (the ‘valuers’). The valuers  
were engaged by the Directors, and performed their work in accordance  
with the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors (‘RICS’) Valuation  
– Professional Standards. The valuers used by the Group have 
considerable experience of the markets in which the Group operates.
In determining a property’s valuation the valuers take into account 
property-specific information such as the current tenancy agreements 
and rental income. They apply assumptions for yields and estimated 
market rent, which are influenced by prevailing market yields and 
comparable market transactions, to arrive at the final valuation. For 
developments, the residual appraisal method is used, by estimating  
the fair value of the completed project using a capitalisation method  
less estimated costs to completion and a risk premium.
The significance of the estimates and judgements involved, coupled  
with the fact that only a small percentage difference in individual  
property valuations, when aggregated, could result in a material 
misstatement, warrants specific audit focus in this area.
There were also certain specific factors affecting the valuations  
in the year:
 – the nature of the Canada Water site, which the Group are  
currently master planning as a combined large scale, mixed  
use development site, resulted in our audit paying particular  
focus to the relevant valuations
 – properties under development, completed developments that  
are now valued as standing investment properties and standing 
investment properties that have been reclassified to development 
properties, continue to be an area of focus
We read the valuation reports for all the properties and confirmed that the 
valuation approach for each was in accordance with RICS standards and 
suitable for use in determining the carrying value for the purpose of the 
financial statements.
We assessed the valuers’ qualifications and expertise and read their  
terms of engagement with the Group to determine whether there were  
any matters that might have affected their objectivity or may have imposed 
scope limitations upon their work. We also considered fee arrangements 
between the valuers and the Group and other engagements which might 
exist between the Group and the valuers. We found no evidence to suggest 
that the objectivity of the valuers in their performance of the valuations  
was compromised.
We obtained details of every property held by the Group and set an 
expected range for yield and capital value movement, determined by 
reference to published benchmarks and using our experience and 
knowledge of the market. We compared the investment yields used by  
the valuers with the range of expected range of yields and the year on  
year capital movement to our expected range. We also considered the 
reasonableness of other assumptions that are not so readily comparable 
with published benchmarks, such as Estimated Rental Value. We attended 
meetings with management and the valuers, at which the valuations  
and the key assumptions therein were discussed. Our work covered  
the valuation of every property in the Group, but the discussions with 
management and the valuers focused on the largest properties in the 
portfolio, properties under development or where the valuation basis  
has changed in the year, the Canada Water site and those where the yields 
used and/or year on year capital value movement suggested a possible 
outlier versus externally published market data for the relevant sector.
Where assumptions were outside the expected range or otherwise  
appeared unusual, and/or valuations showed unexpected movements,  
we undertook further investigations and, when necessary, held  
further discussions with the valuers and obtained evidence to support 
explanations received. The valuation commentaries provided by the 
valuers and supporting evidence, enabled us to consider the property 
specific factors that may have had an impact on value, including recent  
comparable transactions where appropriate.
We saw evidence that alternative assumptions had been considered and 
evaluated by management and the valuers, before determining the final 
valuation. We concluded that the assumptions used in the valuations  
were supportable in light of available and comparable market evidence.
We performed testing on the standing data in the Group’s information 
systems concerning the valuation process. We carried out procedures,  
on a sample basis, to satisfy ourselves of the accuracy of the property 
information supplied to the valuers by management. For developments, 
we confirmed that the supporting information for construction contracts 
and budgets, which was supplied to the valuers, was also consistent  
with the Group’s records for example by inspecting original construction 
contracts. For developments, capitalised expenditure was tested on  
a sample basis to invoices, and budgeted costs to complete compared  
with supporting evidence (for example construction contracts). 
It was evident from our interaction with management and the valuers,  
and from our review of the valuation reports, that close attention had  
been paid to each property’s individual characteristics at a granular, 
tenant by tenant level, as well as considering the overall quality, 
geographic location and desirability of the asset as a whole.  
No issues were identified in our testing.
95 British Land  Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Area of focus How our audit addressed the area of focus
Revenue recognition
Refer to pages 67 to 70 (Report of the Audit Committee), pages 105  
to 107 (Accounting policies) and page 109 (Notes).
Revenue for the Group consists primarily of rental income. Rental  
income is based on tenancy agreements where there is a standard 
process in place for recording revenue, which is system generated.  
There are certain transactions within revenue that warrant additional 
audit focus because of an increased inherent risk of error due to  
their non-standard nature.
These include spreading of tenant incentives and guaranteed rent 
increases – these balances require adjustments made to rental  
income to ensure revenue is recorded on a straight line basis  
over the course of the lease.
We carried out tests of controls over the cash and accounts receivable 
processes and the related IT systems to obtain evidence that postings to 
these accounts were reliable. For rental income balances, we then used 
data-enabled audit techniques to identify all standard revenue journals 
posted using these systems and processes.
The remaining journals related to non-standard transactions. These 
included reclassifications within revenue, accrued income, and bad debt 
provisions. For each category of non-standard revenue summarised 
above, we have understood the nature and assessed the reasonableness 
of journals being generated, and performed substantive testing over  
a sample of these items. There have been no exceptions arising from 
our testing over non-standard revenue transactions.
For balances not included within rental income, such as service charge 
income, we performed substantive testing on a sample basis. No issues 
were identified in our testing.
Accounting for transactions 
Refer to pages 67 to 70 (Report of the Audit Committee), pages 105  
to 107 (Accounting policies) and pages 108 to 143 (Notes to the Accounts).
There have been a number of transactions during the year. These 
warranted additional audit focus due to the magnitude of transactions  
and the potential for complex contractual terms that introduce  
judgement into how they were accounted for. Key transactions  
subject to additional audit focus were:
 – acquisitions of investment properties for £88 million
 – disposals of investment properties for £670 million, including  
the disposal of Debenhams Oxford Street for £397 million
 – exchange of contracts for the Sale of Interest in the Leadenhall  
Holding Co (Jersey) Limited Joint Venture which has been  
accounted for as a joint venture held for sale valued at £540 million
 – advanced funds received on exchange of contracts for the sale  
of shares in the Leadenhall Joint venture recorded as a financial  
asset and corresponding financial liability for £144 million
 – amount of £10 million received from UBS in relation to the  
development and occupation of 5 Broadgate, and subsequent  
vacation of 100 Liverpool Street
For each transaction, we understood the nature of the transaction and 
assessed the proposed accounting treatment in relation to the Group's 
accounting policies and relevant IFRSs.
For all acquisitions and disposals, we obtained and reviewed the key 
supporting documentation such as Sales and Purchase Agreements  
and completion statements. Consideration received or paid was  
agreed to bank statements. No material issues were found as a  
result of these procedures.
For the Leadenhall transaction which has been accounted for as a joint 
venture held for sale, we assessed the accounting treatment in relation to 
IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations and 
IAS28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures. We have reviewed the 
sale and purchase agreement and agree that the exchange of contracts  
to sell the shares in the joint venture meet the criteria for recognition as 
held for sale under IFRS 5. We have audited the carrying value of the joint 
venture at March 2017, including the valuation of the underlying investment 
property. No material issues were found in relation to the carrying value.
We have confirmed receipt of the advanced funds received on exchange of 
contracts, and tied this to the balances listed within the sale and purchase 
agreement and to confirmations from the Group’s lawyers. The monies 
received are held in a client account held by the Group’s lawyers and 
receipt is conditional on the completion of the sale. We agree with the 
recognition as a financial asset and corresponding liability.
For the £10 million payment from UBS we have reviewed the original  
lease agreement and the amended lease agreement that details  
the payment. We have agreed receipt of the amount received to  
bank statements. We concur with the treatment adopted.
Taxation 
Refer to pages 67 to 70 (Report of the Audit Committee), pages  
105 to 107 (Accounting policies) and pages 111 and 126 (Notes).
The Group's status as a REIT underpins its business model and 
shareholder returns. For this reason, it warrants special audit focus.  
The obligations of the REIT regime include requirements to comply  
with balance of business, dividend and income cover tests. The  
Broadgate joint venture is also structured as a REIT and as such,  
REIT compliance is also of relevance for this joint venture in  
addition to the overall Group.
Tax provisions are in place to account for the risk of challenge  
of certain of the Group's tax provisions. Given the subjective  
nature of these provisions, additional audit focus was placed  
on tax provisions.
We re-performed the Group's and annual REIT compliance tests,  
as well as those tests for the Broadgate REIT. Based on our work 
performed, we agreed with management's assessment that all  
REIT compliance tests had been met to ensure that the Group  
and Broadgate maintain their REIT status.
We evaluated the tax provisions and potential exposures as at  
31 March 2017. We used our knowledge of tax circumstances  
and by reading relevant correspondence between the Group and  
Her Majesty’s Revenue & Customs and the Group’s external tax  
advisors are satisfied that the assumptions and judgements  
used by the Group are reasonable. 
Financial statements
96 British Land  Annual Report and Accounts 2017
INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT TO THE MEMBERS 
OF THE BRITISH LAND COMPANY PLC CONTINUED How we tailored the audit scope
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough 
work to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements as a whole, 
taking into account the geographic structure of the Group, the accounting 
processes and controls, and the industry in which the Group operates. 
The Group and Company financial statements are produced using a 
single consolidation system that has a direct interface with the general 
ledger. We performed our audit procedures over the general ledger 
system and tested the interface with the consolidation system.
A full scope audit was performed by the Group audit team for all 
subsidiaries of the Group, and the following joint ventures: Broadgate, 
Meadowhall and Leadenhall. This gives coverage over substantially  
all of the Group.
In establishing the overall approach to our audit, we assessed the risk  
of material misstatement, taking into account the nature, likelihood and 
potential magnitude of any misstatement. Following this assessment,  
we applied professional judgement to determine the extent of testing 
required over each balance in the financial statements.
Materiality
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality.  
We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality. These, together  
with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our 
audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures on the 
individual financial statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating 
the effect of misstatements, both individually and on the financial 
statements as a whole. 
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for  
the financial statements as a whole as follows:
Overall Group materiality £135 million (2016: £138 million).
How we determined it 1% of total assets.
Rationale for benchmark applied A key determinant of the Group's 
value is direct property investments. 
Due to this, the key area of focus  
in the audit is the valuation of 
investment properties. On this basis, 
we set an overall Group materiality 
level based on total assets.
In addition, we set a specific materiality level of £19.4 million (2016:  
£18 million) for items within underlying pre-tax profit. This equates to  
5% of profit before tax adjusted for capital and other items. In arriving  
at this judgement we had regard to the fact that the underlying pre-tax  
profit is a secondary financial indicator of the Group (Refer to Note 2  
of the financial statements page 108 where the term is defined in full). 
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them 
misstatements identified during our audit of underlying pre-tax items 
above £1 million (2016: £1 million) as well as misstatements below that 
amount that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.  
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them,  
any misstatements identified during our audit of capital and other  
items above £6.7 million (2016: £6.9 million) as well as misstatements 
below that amount that, in our view, warranted reporting for  
qualitative reasons.
Going concern 
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the Directors’ 
statement, set out on page 65, in relation to going concern. We have 
nothing to report having performed our review. 
Under ISAs (UK & Ireland) we are required to report to you if we  
have anything material to add or to draw attention to in relation to the 
Directors’ statement about whether they considered it appropriate to 
adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.  
We have nothing material to add or to draw attention to. 
As noted in the Directors’ statement, the directors have concluded  
that it is appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in preparing  
the financial statements. The going concern basis presumes that the 
Group and Company have adequate resources to remain in operation, 
and that the Directors intend them to do so, for at least one year from  
the date the financial statements were signed. As part of our audit  
we have concluded that the Directors’ use of the going concern basis  
is appropriate. However, because not all future events or conditions  
can be predicted, these statements are not a guarantee as to the  
Group’s and Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.

to the longer-term viability of the Group. Our review was substantially 
less in scope than an audit and only consisted of making inquiries  
and considering the Directors’ process supporting their statements; 
checking that the statements are in alignment with the relevant 
provisions of the Code; and considering whether the statements  
are consistent with the knowledge acquired by us in the course  
of performing our audit. We have nothing to report having  
performed our review.
Adequacy of accounting records and information and  
explanations received
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if,  
in our opinion:
 – we have not received all the information and explanations  
we require for our audit
 – adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Company,  
or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from 
branches not visited by us; or
 – the Company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement with  
the accounting records and returns
We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.

REPORT OF THE AUDITOR CONTINUED Directors’ remuneration
Directors’ Remuneration Report – Companies Act 2006 opinion
In our opinion, the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to  
be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006.
Other Companies Act 2006 reporting
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if,  
in our opinion, certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified 
by law are not made. We have no exceptions to report arising from  
this responsibility. 
Corporate governance statement
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the part of the 
Corporate Governance Statement relating to ten further provisions  
of the Code. We have nothing to report having performed our review. 
Responsibilities for the financial statements  
and the audit
Our responsibilities and those of the Directors
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement  
set out on page 91, the Directors are responsible for the preparation  
of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a  
true and fair view.
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial 
statements in accordance with applicable law and ISAs (UK & Ireland). 
Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices 
Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only  
for the Company’s members as a body in accordance with Chapter  
3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose.  
We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility  
for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report  
is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly  
agreed by our prior consent in writing.
What an audit of financial statements involves
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures 
in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that 
the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether 
caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: 
 – whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s  
and the Company’s circumstances and have been consistently  
applied and adequately disclosed
 – the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made  
by the Directors
 – the overall presentation of the financial statements 
We primarily focus our work in these areas by assessing the Directors’ 
judgements against available evidence, forming our own judgements, 
and evaluating the disclosures in the financial statements.
We test and examine information, using sampling and other auditing 
techniques, to the extent we consider necessary to provide a reasonable 
basis for us to draw conclusions. We obtain audit evidence through 
testing the effectiveness of controls, substantive procedures or a 
combination of both. 
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information  
in the Annual Report to identify material inconsistencies with the  
audited financial statements and to identify any information that is 
apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent  
with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing  
the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements  
or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.  
With respect to the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report, we  
consider whether those reports include the disclosures required  
by applicable legal requirements.

104 British Land  Annual Report and Accounts 2017
CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CHANGES IN EQUITY
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2017 Restatement
The IFRS diluted earnings per share for the year ended 31 March 2016 
has been restated to reflect the full dilutive impact of the 1.5% 2012 
convertible bond. This restatement reduces the diluted earnings  
per share measure from 124.1 pence to 119.7 pence shown on the 
Consolidated Income Statement and within the associated notes.  
This is the only financial measure within these financial statements 
impacted by this restatement.
Going concern
The financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis  
as explained in the corporate governance section on page 65.
Subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates (including funds)
The consolidated accounts include the accounts of the British Land 
Company PLC and all subsidiaries (entities controlled by British Land). 
Control is assumed where British Land is exposed, or has the rights,  
to variable returns from its involvement with investees and has the  
ability to affect those returns through its power over those investees.
The results of subsidiaries, joint ventures or associates acquired or 
disposed of during the year are included from the effective date of 
acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal. Accounting policies  
of subsidiaries, joint ventures or associates which differ from Group 
accounting policies are adjusted on consolidation. 
Business combinations are accounted for under the acquisition method. 
Any excess of the purchase price of business combinations over the fair 
value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired and 
resulting deferred tax thereon is recognised as goodwill. Any discount 
received is credited to the income statement in the period of acquisition.
All intra-Group transactions, balances, income and expenses are 
eliminated on consolidation. Joint ventures and associates, including 
funds, are accounted for under the equity method, whereby the 
consolidated balance sheet incorporates the Group’s share (investor’s 
share) of the net assets of its joint ventures and associates. The 
consolidated income statement incorporates the Group’s share  
of joint venture and associate profits after tax. Their profits include 
revaluation movements on investment properties. 
Distributions and other receivables from joints ventures and associates 
(including funds) are classed as cash flows from operating activities, 
except where they relate to a cash flow arising from a capital transaction, 
such as a property or investment disposal. In this case they are classed 
as cash flows from investing activities. 
Properties
Properties are externally valued on the basis of fair value at the balance 
sheet date. Investment and owner-occupied properties are recorded at 
valuation whereas trading properties are stated at the lower of cost and 
net realisable value.
Any surplus or deficit arising on revaluing investment properties is 
recognised in the capital and other column of the income statement.
Any surplus arising on revaluing owner-occupied properties above 
cost is recognised in other comprehensive income, and any deficit arising 
in revaluation below cost for owner-occupied and trading properties is 
recognised in the capital and other column of the income statement.
1 Basis of preparation, significant accounting 
policies and accounting judgements
The financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2017 have been 
prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of 
properties, investments held for trading and derivatives. The financial 
statements have also been prepared in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union 
and interpretations issued by the IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRS 
IC), and therefore comply with article 4 of the EU IAS regulation, and in 
accordance with the Companies Act 2006. In the current financial year 
the Group has adopted a number of minor amendments to standards 
effective in the year issued by the IASB and endorsed by the EU, none of 
which have had a material impact on the Group. The accounting policies 
used are otherwise consistent with those contained in the Group’s previous 
Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 March 2016. 
A number of new standards and amendments to standards and 
interpretations have been issued but are not yet effective for the current 
accounting period. None of these are expected to have a material impact 
on the consolidated financial statements of the Group. 
Certain standards which could be expected to have an impact on the 
consolidated financial statements are discussed in further detail below. 
 – IFRS 9 – Financial Instruments (effective year ending 31 March 2019). 
The new standard addresses the classification, measurement and 
recognition of financial assets and financial liabilities. It simplifies the 
existing categories of financial instruments, introduces an expected 
credit loss model and redefines the criteria required for hedge 
effectiveness. On adoption of the new standard, these changes are  
not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial 
statements of the Group. There will however be limited changes to 
presentation and disclosure.
 – IFRS 15 – Revenue from contracts with customers (effective year 
ending 31 March 2019). The new standard combines a number of 
previous standards, setting out a five step model for the recognition  
of revenue and establishing principles for reporting useful information 
to users of financial statements about the nature, amount, timing  
and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from an entity's 
contracts with customers. The new standard does not apply to gross 
rental income, but does apply to service charge income, management 
and performance fees and trading property disposals. The impact  
of the new standard on these items of revenue is not expected to  
have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements  
of the Group. 
 – IFRS 16 – Leases (effective year ending 31 March 2020). For lessees, it 
will result in almost all leases being recognised on the balance sheet, 
as the distinction between operating and finance leases will be 
removed. The accounting for lessors will however not significantly 
change. As a result on adoption of the new standard, these changes 
are not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated 
financial statements of the Group.
The Group conducted an impact assessment of the above new standards  
in the year, and concluded that whilst adoption of these new standards 
based on the Group’s current activities would lead to some limited changes 
to presentation and disclosure, they are not expected to have a material 
impact on the consolidated financial statements. 
105 British Land  Annual Report and Accounts 2017
NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS As defined by IAS 39, cash flow and fair value hedges are initially recognised 
at fair value at the date the derivative contracts are entered into, and 
subsequently remeasured at fair value. Changes in the fair value of 
derivatives that are designated and qualify as effective cash flow hedges are 
recognised directly through other comprehensive income as a movement in 
the hedging and translation reserve. Changes in the fair value of derivatives 
that are designated and qualify as effective fair value hedges are recorded 
in the capital and other column of the income statement, along with any 
changes in the fair value of the hedged item that is attributable to the 
hedged risk. Any ineffective portion of all derivatives is recognised in the 
capital and other column of the income statement. Changes in the fair  
value of derivatives that are not in a designated hedging relationship under 
IAS 39 are recorded directly in the capital and other column of the income 
statement. These derivatives are carried at fair value on the balance sheet.
Cash equivalents are limited to instruments with a maturity of less than 
three months.
Revenue
Revenue comprises rental income and surrender premia, service charge 
income, management and performance fees and proceeds from the sale 
of trading properties. 
Rental income, including fixed rental uplifts, from investment property 
leased out under an operating lease is recognised as revenue on a 
straight-line basis over the lease term. Lease incentives, such as rent-free 
periods and cash contributions to tenant fit-out, are recognised on the 
same straight-line basis being an integral part of the net consideration for 
the use of the investment property. Any rent adjustments based on open 
market estimated rental values are recognised, based on management 
estimates, from the rent review date in relation to unsettled rent reviews. 
Contingent rents, being those lease payments that are not fixed at the 
inception of the lease, including for example turnover rents, are 
recognised in the period in which they are earned.
Surrender premia for the early determination of a lease are recognised 
as revenue immediately upon receipt, net of dilapidations and non-
recoverable outgoings relating to the lease concerned. 
Service charge income is recognised as revenue in the period to which 
it relates.
Management and performance fees receivable are recognised as revenue 
in the period to which they relate. Performance fees are recognised at the 
end of the performance period when the fee amount can be estimated 
reliably and it is virtually certain that the fee will be received.
Proceeds from the sale of trading properties are recognised when the 
risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the purchaser. 
This generally occurs on completion. Proceeds from the sale of trading 
properties are recognised as revenue in the capital and other column of 
the income statement. All other revenue described above is recognised 
in the underlying column of the income statement. 
The cost of properties in the course of development includes attributable 
interest and other associated outgoings including attributable development 
personnel costs. Interest is calculated on the development expenditure 
by reference to specific borrowings, where relevant, and otherwise on 
the weighted average rate interest rate of British Land PLC borrowings. 
Interest is not capitalised where no development activity is taking  
place. A property ceases to be treated as a development property  
on practical completion.
Investment property disposals are recognised on completion. Profits  
and losses arising are recognised through the capital and other column 
of the income statement. The profit on disposal is determined as the 
difference between the net sales proceeds and the carrying amount of 
the asset at the commencement of the accounting period plus capital 
expenditure in the period.
Trading properties are initially recognised at cost less impairments,  
and trading property disposals are recognised in line with the revenue 
policies outlined below.
Where investment properties are appropriated to trading properties, 
they are transferred at market value. If properties held for trading are 
appropriated to investment properties, they are transferred at book 
value. In determining whether leases and related properties represent 
operating or finance leases, consideration is given to whether the  
tenant or landlord bears the risks and rewards of ownership.
Financial assets and liabilities
Trade debtors and creditors are initially recognised at fair value and 
subsequently measured at amortised cost and discounted as appropriate.
Other investments include loans and receivables held at amortised  
cost and investments held for trading classified as fair value through 
profit or loss. Amortised cost of loans and receivables is measured using 
the effective interest method, less any impairment. Interest is recognised 
by applying the effective interest rate. Investments held for trading are 
initially recorded at fair value and are subsequently externally valued on 
the same basis at the balance sheet date. Any surplus or deficit arising 
on revaluing investments held for trading is recognised in the capital  
and other column of the income statement.
Where an investment property is held under a head lease, the head  
lease is initially recognised as an asset, being the sum of the premium 
paid on acquisition plus the present value of minimum ground rent 
payments. The corresponding rent liability to the head leaseholder  
is included in the balance sheet as a finance lease obligation.
Debt instruments are stated at their net proceeds on issue. Finance 
charges including premia payable on settlement or redemption  
and direct issue costs are spread over the period to redemption,  
using the effective interest method. Exceptional finance charges  
incurred due to early redemption (including premiums) are  
recognised in the income statement when they occur. 
Convertible bonds are designated as fair value through profit or loss  
and so are initially recognised at fair value with all subsequent gains  
and losses, including the write-off of issue costs, recognised in the 
capital and other column of the income statement as a component of 
net financing costs. The interest charge in respect of the coupon rate  
on the bonds has been recognised within the underlying component  
of net financing costs on an accruals basis.

106 British Land  Annual Report and Accounts 2017 The key areas of accounting judgement are: 
REIT status: British Land is a Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) 
and does not pay tax on its property income or gains on property sales, 
provided that at least 90% of the Group’s property income is distributed 
as a dividend to shareholders, which becomes taxable in their hands. 
In addition, the Group has to meet certain conditions such as ensuring 
the property rental business represents more than 75% of total profits 
and assets. Any potential or proposed changes to the REIT legislation  
are monitored and discussed with HMRC. It is Management’s intention 
that the Group will continue as a REIT for the foreseeable future. 
Accounting for joint ventures and funds: In accordance with IFRS 10 
‘Consolidated financial statements’, IFRS 11 ‘ Joint arrangements’, and 
IFRS 12 ‘Disclosures of interests in other entities’ an assessment is 
required to determine the degree of control or influence the Group 
exercises and the form of any control to ensure that the financial 
statement treatment is appropriate.
Interest in the Group’s joint ventures is commonly driven by the terms 
of the partnership agreements which ensure that control is shared 
between the partners. These are accounted for under the equity method, 
whereby the consolidated balance sheet incorporates the Group’s share 
of the net assets of its joint ventures and associates. The consolidated 
income statement incorporates the Group’s share of joint venture and 
associate profits after tax.
Accounting for transactions: Property transactions are complex in 
nature and can be material to the financial statements. Assessment is 
required to determine the most appropriate accounting treatment of 
assets acquired and of potential contractual arrangements in the legal 
documents for both acquisitions and disposals. Management consider 
each transaction separately and, when considered appropriate, seek 
independent accounting advice.
Held for sale asset: On 1 March 2017 the Group exchanged conditional 
contracts on an agreement to sell its interest in Leadenhall Holding Co 
(Jersey) Limited, a joint venture with Oxford Properties. The net 
investment in the joint venture has been reclassified as a held for sale 
asset within current assets on the Group balance sheet, and the carrying 
amount is disclosed separately from the investment in joint ventures and 
funds within note 11 to the financial statements.
Prior to exchange, held for sale criteria were not deemed to be met since 
the transaction relates to an illiquid asset and is subject to significant 
uncertainty prior to agreement of terms. However, upon exchange the 
sale is deemed highly probable as detailed terms have been agreed upon 
by relevant parties. At this point management expect the carrying 
amount of the Group's investment in the venture to be recovered 
principally through a sale transaction rather than continuing operations. 
Taxation
Current tax is based on taxable profit for the year and is calculated  
using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the 
balance sheet date. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in 
the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense 
that are not taxable (or tax deductible).
Deferred tax is provided on items that may become taxable in the future, 
or which may be used to offset against taxable profits in the future, on  
the temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and 
liabilities for financial reporting purposes, and the amounts used for 
taxation purposes on an undiscounted basis. On business combinations, 
the deferred tax effect of fair value adjustments is incorporated in the 
consolidated balance sheet.
Employee costs
The fair value of equity-settled share-based payments to employees  
is determined at the date of grant and is expensed on a straight-line  
basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of shares  
or options that will eventually vest. In the case of options granted,  
fair value is measured by a Black-Scholes pricing model. 
Defined benefit pension scheme assets are measured using fair values. 
Pension scheme liabilities are measured using the projected unit credit 
method and discounted at the rate of return of a high quality corporate 
bond of equivalent term to the scheme liabilities. The net surplus (where 
recoverable by the Group) or deficit is recognised in full in the consolidated 
balance sheet. Any asset resulting from the calculation is limited to the 
present value of available refunds and reductions in future contributions 
to the plan. 
The current service cost and gains and losses on settlement and 
curtailments are charged to operating profit. Actuarial gains and losses 
are recognised in full in the period in which they occur and are presented 
in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. 
Contributions to the Group’s defined contribution schemes are expensed 
on the basis of the contracted annual contribution.
Accounting judgements and estimates
In applying the Group’s accounting policies, the Directors are required 
to make judgements and estimates that affect the financial statements. 
Significant areas of estimation are:
Valuation of properties and investments held for trading: The Group 
uses external professional valuers to determine the relevant amounts. 
The primary source of evidence for property valuations should be recent, 
comparable market transactions on an arms-length basis. However, 
the valuation of the Group’s property portfolio and investments held  
for trading are inherently subjective, as they are made on the basis of 
assumptions made by the valuers which may not prove to be accurate.
Other less significant areas of estimation include the valuation of fixed 
rate debt and interest rate derivatives, the determination of share-based 
payment expense, and the actuarial assumptions used in calculating the 
Group’s retirement benefit obligations.
107 British Land  Annual Report and Accounts 2017 2 Performance measures 
Earnings per share
The Group measures financial performance with reference to underlying earnings per share, the European Public Real Estate Association (EPRA) 
earnings per share and IFRS earnings per share. The relevant earnings and weighted average number of shares (including dilution adjustments)  
for each performance measure are shown below, and a reconciliation between these is shown within the supplementary disclosures (Table B).
EPRA earnings per share is calculated using EPRA earnings, which is the IFRS profit after taxation attributable to shareholders of the Company 
excluding investment and development property revaluations, gains/losses on investing and trading property disposals, changes in the fair value of 
financial instruments and associated close-out costs and their related taxation. In the current year, diluted EPRA earnings per share did not include 
the dilutive impact of the 2012 convertible bond, as the Group’s share price was below the exchange price of 693 pence. IFRS diluted earnings per 
share includes the dilutive impact as IAS 33 ignores this hurdle to conversion. In the prior year, both measures included the dilutive impact of the  
2012 convertible bond, as the Group’s share price was above the exchange price.
Underlying earnings per share is calculated using Underlying Profit adjusted for underlying taxation (see note 7). Underlying Profit is the pre-tax 
EPRA earnings measure, with additional Company adjustments. No Company adjustments were made in either the current or prior year.

Net asset value
The Group measures financial position with reference to EPRA net asset value (NAV) per share and EPRA triple net asset value (NNNAV) per share. 
The net asset value and number of shares for each performance measure is shown below. A reconciliation between IFRS net assets and EPRA  
net assets, and the relevant number of shares for each performance measure, is shown within the supplementary disclosures (Table B). EPRA net 
assets is a proportionally consolidated measure that is based on IFRS net assets excluding the mark-to-market on effective cash flow hedges and 
related debt adjustments, the mark-to-market on the convertible bonds as well as deferred taxation on property and derivative valuations. They 
include the valuation surplus on trading properties and are adjusted for the dilutive impact of share options. 
As at 31 March 2017, EPRA NAV and EPRA NNNAV did not include the dilutive impact of the 2012 convertible bond, as the Group's share price was 
below the exchange price of 693 pence. IFRS net assets includes the dilutive impact following the treatment of IFRS earnings per share. In the prior 
year period, both measures included the dilutive impact of the 2012 convertible bond, as the Group's share price was above the exchange price.

Total accounting return
The Group also measures financial performance with reference to total accounting return. This is calculated as the increase in EPRA net asset value 
per share and dividend paid in the year as a percentage of the EPRA net asset value per share at the start of the year.

9 Pensions
The British Land Group of Companies Pension Scheme (‘the scheme’) is the principal defined benefit pension scheme in the Group. The assets of  
the scheme are held in a trustee-administered fund and kept separate from those of the Company. It is not contracted out of SERPS (State Earnings-
Related Pension Scheme) and it is not planned to admit new employees to the scheme. The Group has three other small defined benefit pension 
schemes. There is also a Defined Contribution Pension Scheme. Contributions to this scheme are at a flat rate of 15% of salary for non-Directors 
and are paid by the Company. 
The total net pension cost charged for the year was £7m (2015/16: £7m), of which £4m (2015/16: £4m) relates to defined contribution plans  
and £3m (2015/16: £3m) relates to the current service cost of the defined benefit schemes.
A full actuarial valuation of the scheme was carried out at 31 March 2015 by consulting actuaries, AON Hewitt Associates Ltd. The employer’s 
contributions will be paid in the future at the rate recommended by the actuary of 72.9% per annum of basic salaries. The best estimate of employer 
contributions expected to be paid during the year to 31 March 2018 is £5m. The major assumptions used for the actuarial valuation were:

Price inflation 3.4 3.3 3.3 3.7 3.2
The mortality assumptions are based on standard mortality tables which allow for future mortality improvements. The assumptions are that a 
member currently aged 60 will live on average for a further 29.7 years if they are male and for a further 31.7 years if they are female. For a member 
who retires in 2037 at age 60, the assumptions are that they will live on average for a further 31.7 years after retirement if they are male and for a 
further 33.2 years after retirement if they are female.

Through its defined benefit plans, the Group is exposed to a number of risks, the most significant of which are detailed below:
Asset volatility
The liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with a reference to corporate bond yields; if assets underperform this yield, this will create 
a deficit. The scheme holds a significant portion of growth assets (equities and diversified growth funds) which, although expected to outperform 
corporate bonds in the long term, create volatility and risk in the short term. The allocation to growth assets is monitored to ensure it remains 
appropriate given the scheme’s long term objectives.
Changes in bond yields
A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase the value placed on the scheme’s liabilities for accounting purposes, although this will be partially 
offset by an increase in the value of the scheme’s bond holdings.
Inflation risk
The majority of the scheme’s benefit obligations are linked to inflation, and higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities (although, in most cases,  
caps on the level of inflationary increases are in place to protect against extreme inflation). The majority of the assets are either unaffected by or  
only loosely correlated with inflation, meaning that an increase in inflation will also increase the deficit.
Life expectancy
The majority of the scheme’s obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member, so increases in life expectancy will result in an increase 
in the liabilities.

Property valuation
The different valuation method levels are defined below:
Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2:  Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices)  
or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
Level 3: Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).
These levels are specified in accordance with IFRS 13 ‘Fair Value Measurement’. Property valuations are inherently subjective as they are made  
on the basis of assumptions made by the valuer which may not prove to be accurate. For these reasons, and consistent with EPRA’s guidance, we 
have classified the valuations of our property portfolio as Level 3 as defined by IFRS 13. The inputs to the valuations are defined as 'unobservable'  
by IFRS 13 and these are analysed in a table on the following page. There were no transfers between levels in the period. 
The Group’s total property portfolio was valued by external valuers on the basis of fair value, in accordance with the RICS Valuation – Professional 
Standards 2014, ninth edition, published by The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors. 
The information provided to the valuers, and the assumptions and valuations models used by the valuers are reviewed by the property portfolio  
team, the Head of Offices, the Head of Retail and the Chief Financial Officer. The valuers meet with the external auditors and also present directly  
to the Audit Committee at the interim and year end review of results. Further details of the Audit Committee’s responsibilities in relation to  
valuations can be found in the Report of the Audit Committee (on pages 67 to 70).
Investment properties, excluding properties held for development, are valued by adopting the ‘investment method’ of valuation. This approach 
involves applying capitalisation yields to current and future rental streams net of income voids arising from vacancies or rent-free periods and 
associated running costs. These capitalisation yields and future rental values are based on comparable property and leasing transactions in the 
market using the valuers’ professional judgement and market observation. Other factors taken into account in the valuations include the tenure 
of the property, tenancy details and ground and structural conditions.

In the case of ongoing developments, the approach applied is the ‘residual method’ of valuation, which is the investment method of valuation as 
described above, with a deduction for all costs necessary to complete the development, including a notional finance cost, together with a further 
allowance for remaining risk. Properties held for development are generally valued by adopting the higher of the residual method of valuation, 
allowing for all associated risks, or the investment method of valuation for the existing asset.

All other factors being equal:
 – a higher equivalent yield or discount rate would lead to a decrease in the valuation of an asset;
 – an increase in the current or estimated future rental stream would have the effect of increasing the capital value; and
 – an increase in the costs to complete would lead to a decrease in the valuation of an asset.
However, there are interrelationships between the unobservable inputs which are partially determined by market conditions, which would impact  
on these changes. There were no transfers between valuation levels in the period. 
Additional property disclosures – including covenant information
At 31 March 2017, the Group property portfolio valuation of £9,520m (2015/16: £10,111m) comprises freeholds of £5,576m (2015/16: £6,184m); virtual 
freeholds of £809m (2015/16: £906m); and long leaseholds of £3, 135m (2015/16 £3,021m). The historical cost of properties was £6,024m (2015/16: £6,544m).
The property valuation does not include any investment properties held under operating leases (2015/16: £nil).
Cumulative interest capitalised against investment, development and trading properties amounts to £95m (2015/16: £88m).
Properties valued at £1,882m (2015/16: £2,559m) were subject to a security interest and other properties of non-recourse companies amounted 
to £1,158m (2015/16: £1,244m), totalling £3,040m (2015/16: £3,803m).
Included within the property valuation is £62m (2015/16: £110m) in respect of accrued contracted rental uplift income. The balance arises through the 
IFRS treatment of leases containing such arrangements, which requires the recognition of rental income on a straight-line basis over the lease term, 
with the difference between this and the cash receipt changing the carrying value of the property against which revaluations are measured.

The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other debtors is approximate to their fair value. There is no concentration of credit  
risk with respect to trade debtors as the Group has a large number of customers who are paying their rent in advance.

The following corporation tax rates have been substantively enacted; 19% effective from 1 April 2017 reducing to 17% effective from 1 April 2020.  
The deferred tax assets and liabilities have been calculated at the tax rate effective in the period that the tax is expected to crystallise.
The Group has recognised a deferred tax asset calculated at 17% (2015/16: 18%) of £5m (2015/16: £6m) in respect of capital losses from previous 
years available for offset against future capital profit. Further unrecognised deferred tax assets in respect of capital losses of £129m (2015/16: £60m) 
exist at 31 March 2017.
The Group has recognised deferred tax assets on derivative revaluations to the extent that future matching taxable profits are expected to arise.
At 31 March 2017, the Group had an unrecognised deferred tax asset calculated at 17% (2015/16: 18%) of £50m (2015/16: £51m) in respect  
of UK revenue tax losses from previous years.
Under the REIT regime, development properties which are sold within three years of completion do not benefit from tax exemption. At 31 March 2017, 
the value of such properties is £176m (2015/16: £967m) and if these properties were to be sold and no tax exemption was available, the tax arising 
would be £13m (2015/16: £56m).

1.5% Convertible bond 2012 (maturity 2017)
On 10 September 2012, British Land (Jersey) Limited (the 2012 Issuer), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Group, issued £400 million 1.5% guaranteed 
convertible bonds due 2017 (the 2012 bonds) at par. The 2012 Issuer is fully guaranteed by the Company in respect of the 2012 bonds.
Subject to their terms, the 2012 bonds are convertible into preference shares of the 2012 Issuer which are automatically transferred to the Company in 
exchange for ordinary shares in the Company or, at the Company’s election, any combination of ordinary shares and cash. Bondholders may exercise 
their conversion right at any time up to (but excluding) the 20th dealing day before 10 September 2017 (the maturity date). 
The initial exchange price was 693.07 pence per ordinary share. The exchange price is adjusted based on certain events.
From 25 September 2015, the Company has the option to redeem the 2012 bonds at par if the Company’s share price has traded above 130% of 
the exchange price for a specified period, or at any time once 85% by nominal value of the 2012 bonds have been converted, redeemed, or purchased 
and cancelled. The 2012 bonds will be redeemed at par on 10 September 2017 (the maturity date) if they have not already been converted, redeemed 
or purchased and cancelled. No redemption of the bonds occurred in the year.
0% Convertible bond 2015 (maturity 2020)
On 9 June 2015, British Land (White) 2015 Limited (the 2015 Issuer), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Group, issued £350 million zero coupon 
guaranteed convertible bonds due 2020 (the 2015 bonds) at par. The 2015 Issuer is fully guaranteed by the Company in respect of the 2015 bonds.
Subject to their terms, the 2015 bonds are convertible into preference shares of the 2015 Issuer which are automatically transferred to the Company 
in exchange for ordinary shares in the Company or, at the Company’s election, any combination of ordinary shares and cash. From 20 July 2015 up  
to and including 29 June 2018, a bondholder may exercise its conversion right if the share price has traded at a level exceeding 130% of the exchange 
price for a specified period. Thereafter, and up to but excluding the 7th dealing day before 9 June 2020 (the maturity date), a bondholder may convert 
at any time.
The initial exchange price was 1103.32 pence per ordinary share. The exchange price is adjusted based on certain events (such as the Company 
paying dividends in any quarter above 3.418 pence per ordinary share). As at 31 March 2017 the exchange price was 1063.79 pence per ordinary share.
From 30 June 2018, the Company has the option to redeem the 2015 bonds at par if the Company’s share price has traded above 130% of the 
exchange price for a specified period, or at any time once 85% by nominal value of the 2015 bonds have been converted, redeemed, or purchased

The fair values of debentures, unsecured bonds and the convertible bonds have been established by obtaining quoted market prices from brokers. 
The bank debt and other floating rate debt has been valued assuming it could be renegotiated at contracted margins. The derivatives have been 
valued by calculating the present value of expected future cash flows, using appropriate market discount rates, by an independent treasury advisor.
Short term debtors and creditors and other investments have been excluded from the disclosures on the basis that the fair value is equivalent 
to the book value. The fair value hierarchy level (as defined in note 10) of debt held at amortised cost whose fair value is disclosed is level 2.

Capital risk management
The capital structure of the Group consists of net debt and equity attributable to the equity holders of The British Land Company PLC, comprising 
issued capital, reserves and retained earnings. Risks relating to capital structure are addressed within Managing risk in delivering Our strategy on 
pages 46 to 49. The Group’s objectives, policies and processes for managing debt are set out in the Financial policies and principles on pages 43 
to 45.
Interest rate risk management
The Group uses interest rate swaps to hedge exposure to the variability in cash flows on floating rate debt, such as revolving bank facilities  
and floating rate bonds caused by movements in market rates of interest.
At 31 March 2017, the fair value of these derivatives is a net liability of £143m. Interest rate swaps with a fair value of £143m have been designated 
as cash flow hedges under IAS 39.
The ineffectiveness recognised in the income statement on cash flow hedges in the year ended 31 March 2017 was £nil (2015/16: £nil).
The cash flows occur and are charged to profit and loss until the maturity of the hedged debt. The table below summarises variable rate debt  
hedged at 31 March 2017.

Fair value hedged debt
The Group uses interest rate swaps to hedge exposure on fixed rate financial liabilities caused by movements in market rates of interest.
At 31 March 2017, the fair value of these derivatives is a net asset of £216m. Interest rate swaps with a fair value of £215m have been designated  
as fair value hedges under IAS 39 (2015/16: asset of £164m).
The cross currency swaps of the 2018/2021/2023/2026 US Private Placements fully hedge the foreign exchange exposure at an average floating  
rate of 146 basis points above LIBOR. These have been designated as fair value hedges of the US Private Placements.

Fixed or capped rate 1,604 2,372
Variable rate (net of cash) 1,490 1,245

All the debt is effectively Sterling denominated except for £11m (2015/16: £10m) of Euro debt of which £11m is at a fixed rate (2015/16: £10m).
At 31 March 2017 the weighted average interest rate of the Sterling fixed rate debt is 3.3% (2015/16: 3.5%). The weighted average period for which the 
rate is fixed is 8.3 years (2015/16: 9.1 years). The floating rate debt is set for periods of the Company’s choosing at the relevant LIBOR (or similar) rate. 
The proportion of net debt at fixed or capped rates of interest was 78% at 31 March 2017 on a spot basis, pro forma for the Leadenhall transaction 
(see page 124). The proportion of net debt at fixed or capped rates of interest as an average over the next five year forecast period, on a proportionally 
consolidated basis, was 60% at 31 March 2017. Based on the Group’s interest rate profile, at the balance sheet date, a 576 bps increase in interest 
rates would decrease annual profits by £87m (2015/16: £72m decrease). Similarly, a 34 bps reduction would increase profits by £5m (2015/16: £7m 
increase). The change in interest rates used for this sensitivity analysis is based on the largest annual change in three month Sterling LIBOR over 
the last ten years. The impact assumes LIBOR does not fall below 0%.
133 British Land  Annual Report and Accounts 2017 17 Net debt continued
Interest rate profile – including effect of derivatives continued
Upward movements in medium and long term interest rates, associated with higher interest rate expectations, increase the value of the Group’s 
interest rate swaps that provide protection against such moves. The converse is true for downward movements in the yield curve. The majority of the 
Group’s interest rate swaps which provide such protection qualify as effective cash flow hedges under IAS 39 therefore movements in the fair value 
are recognised directly in equity rather than the income statement. A 204 bps shift represents the largest annual change in the seven year Sterling 
swap rate over the last ten years. At 31 March 2017 a 204 bps parallel upward shift in swap rates would increase the value of these interest rate 
swaps by £82m (2015/16: £151m). A 204 bps downward shift in swap rates would reduce the value of these interest rate swaps by £131m (2015/16: 
£197m). Because the interest rate swaps are matched by floating rate debt, the overall effect on Group cash flows of such movements is minimal.
The 1.5% 2012 Convertible Bond and 0% 2015 Convertible Bond are both designated as fair value through profit or loss. Principal components of the 
market value of both bonds include British Land’s share price and its volatility, and market interest rates. 
The fair value of the 1.5% 2012 Convertible Bond at 31 March 2017 was a £406m liability. At 31 March 2017 a 204 bps parallel upward shift in interest 
rates would reduce the fair value liability by £4m, and a 204 bps downward shift in interest rates would increase the fair value liability by £4m. 
The fair value of the 0% 2015 Convertible Bond at 31 March 2017 was a £331m liability. At 31 March 2017 a 204 bps parallel upward shift in interest 
rates would reduce the fair value liability by £21m, and a 204 bps downward shift in interest rates would increase the fair value liability by £22m.
Foreign currency risk management
The Group’s policy is to have no material unhedged net assets or liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. The currency risk on overseas 
investments is hedged via foreign currency denominated borrowings and derivatives. The Group has adopted net investment hedging in accordance 
with IAS 39 and therefore the portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective hedge is recognised directly  
in equity. The ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised immediately in the income statement.
The table below shows the carrying amounts of the Group’s foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities. Provided contingent tax on overseas 
investments is not expected to occur it will be ignored for hedging purposes, as is the requirement to fair value interest rate swaps. Based on the 
31 March 2017 position a 33% appreciation (largest annual change over the last ten years) in the Euro relative to Sterling would result in a £nil change 
(2015/16: £nil) in reported profits.

Credit risk management
The Group’s approach to credit risk management of counterparties is referred to in the Financial policies and principles on pages 43 to 45 and the 
risks addressed within Managing risk in delivering Our strategy on pages 46 to 49. The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the financial 
statements represents the Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk without taking account of the value of any collateral obtained.
Cash and short term deposits at 31 March 2017 amounted to £114m (2015/16: £114m). Deposits and interest rate deposits were placed with financial 
institutions with BBB+ or better credit ratings.
At 31 March 2017, the fair value of all interest rate derivative assets was £217m (2015/16: £167m).
At 31 March 2017, prior to taking into account any offset arrangements, the largest combined credit exposure to a single counterparty arising from 
money market deposits, liquid investments and derivatives was £120m (2015/16: £85m). This represents 0.9% (2015/16: 0.6%) of gross assets.
The deposit exposures are with UK banks and UK branches of international banks.
The Group’s exposure to credit risk in respect of its trade receivables is analysed in note 13. Provisions are made taking account historic credit losses 
and the creditworthiness of debtors.
Liquidity risk management
The Group’s approach to liquidity risk management is discussed in the Financial policies and principles on pages 43 to 45, and the risks addressed 
within Managing risk in delivering Our strategy on pages 46 to 49.
The following table presents a maturity profile of the contracted undiscounted cash flows of financial liabilities based on the earliest date on which 
the Group can be required to pay. The table includes both interest and principal flows. Where the interest payable is not fixed, the amount disclosed 
has been determined by reference to the projected interest rates implied by yield curves at the reporting date. For derivative financial instruments 
that settle on a net basis (e.g. interest rate swaps) the undiscounted net cash flows are shown and for derivatives that require gross settlement  
(e.g. cross currency swaps) the undiscounted gross cash flows are presented. Where payment obligations are in foreign currencies, the spot 
exchange rate ruling at the balance sheet date is used. Trade creditors and amounts owed to joint ventures, which are repayable within one year,  
have been excluded from the analysis.

Liquidity risk management continued
The Group expects to meet its financial liabilities through the various available liquidity sources, including a secure rental income profile, asset sales, 
undrawn committed borrowing facilities and, in the longer term, debt refinancings.
The Group leases out all its investment properties under operating leases with a weighted average lease length of eight years. This secure income 
profile is generated from upward only rent reviews, long leases and high occupancy rates. The future aggregate minimum rentals receivable under 
non-cancellable operating leases is also shown in the table below. Income from joint ventures and funds is not included below. Additional liquidity 
will arise from letting space in properties under construction as well as from distributions received from joint ventures and funds.

of £144m (2015/16: £195m).
Any short term liquidity gap between the net payments required and the rentals receivable can be met through other liquidity sources available  
to the Group. The Group currently holds cash and short term deposits of £114m of which £99m is not subject to a security interest (see footnote 5  
to net debt table on page 127). Further liquidity can be achieved through sales of property assets or investments and debt refinancings.
The Group’s property portfolio is valued externally at £9,520m and the share of joint ventures and funds’ property is valued at £4,801m.  
The undrawn committed borrowing facilities available to the Group are a further source of liquidity. The maturity profile of committed

The fourth quarter interim dividend of 7.30 pence per share, totalling £75m (2015/16: 7.09 pence per share, totalling £73m) was approved by the Board 
on 16 May 2017 and is payable on 4 August 2017 to shareholders on the register at the close of business on 30 June 2017.
The Board will announce the availability of the Scrip Dividend Alternative, if available, via the Regulatory News Service and on its website 
(ww w.britishland.com/dividends), no later than four business days before the ex-dividend date of 30 June 2017. The Board expects to announce 
the split between Property Income Distributions (PID) and non-PID income at that time. Any Scrip Dividend Alternative will not be enhanced. PID 
dividends are paid, as required by REIT legislation, after deduction of withholding tax at the basic rate (currently 20%), where appropriate. Certain 
classes of shareholders may be able to elect to receive dividends gross. Please refer to our website ww w.britishland.com/dividends for details.

21 Segment information
The Group allocates resources to investment and asset management according to the sectors it expects to perform over the medium term. Its three 
principal sectors are Offices, Retail and Canada Water. The Office sector includes residential, as this is often incorporated into Office schemes. The 
Offices sector also includes the British Land share of the Leadenhall joint venture (see note 11). The Retail sector includes leisure, as this is often 
incorporated into Retail schemes.
The relevant gross rental income, net rental income, operating result and property assets, being the measures of segment revenue, segment result  
and segment assets used by the management of the business, are set out below. Management reviews the performance of the business principally on  
a proportionally consolidated basis, which includes the Group’s share of joint ventures and funds on a line-by-line basis and excludes non-controlling 
interests in the Group’s subsidiaries. The chief operating decision maker for the purpose of segment information is the Executive Committee.
Gross rental income is derived from the rental of buildings and the sale of trading properties. Operating result is the net of net rental income,  
fee income and administrative expenses. No customer exceeded 10% of the Group’s revenues in either year.

COMPANY STATEMENT OF CHANGES IN EQUITY
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2017 (A) Accounting policies
The financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2017 have been 
prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of 
derivatives. These financial statements have also been prepared in 
accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure 
Framework (‘FRS 101’). The amendments to FRS 101 (2015/16 Cycle) 
issued in July 2016 and effective immediately have been applied.
In preparing these financial statements, the Company applies the 
recognition, measurement and disclosure requirements of International 
Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU (‘Adopted IFRSs’), 
but makes amendments where necessary in order to comply with the 
Companies Act 2006 and has set out below where advantage of the  
FRS 101 disclosure exemptions has been taken. 
The Company has taken advantage of the following disclosure 
exemptions under FRS 101:
(a) the requirements of IAS 1 to provide a Balance Sheet at the  
beginning of the period in the event of a prior period adjustment;
(b) the requirements of IAS 1 to provide a Statement of cash flows  
for the period; 
(c) the requirements of IAS 1 to provide a statement of compliance  
with IFRS;
(d) the requirements of IAS 1 to disclose information on the  
management of capital;
(e) the requirements of paragraphs 30 and 31 of IAS 8 Accounting  
Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors to disclose  
new IFRSs that have been issued but are not yet effective; 
(f) the requirements in IAS 24 Related Party Disclosures to  
disclose related party transactions entered into between two  
or more members of a group, provided that any subsidiary which  
is a party to the transaction is wholly-owned by such a member; 
(g) the requirements of paragraph 17 of IAS 24 Related Party  
Disclosures to disclose key management personnel compensation;
(h) the requirements of IFRS 7 to disclose financial instruments; and
(i) the requirements of paragraphs 91-99 of IFRS 13 Fair Value 
Measurement to disclose information of fair value valuation 
techniques and inputs.
Going concern
The financial statements are prepared on the going concern basis  
as explained in the corporate governance section on page 65. 
Investments and loans
Investments and loans in subsidiaires and joint ventures are stated 
at cost less provision for impairment. 
Significant judgements and sources of estimation uncertainty
The key source of estimation uncertainty relates to the Company’s 
investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures. In estimating the 
requirement for impairment of these investments, management  
make assumptions and judgements on the value of these investments 
using inherently subjective underlying asset valuations, supported

1.5% Convertible bond 2012 (maturity 2017)
On 10 September 2012, British Land (Jersey) Limited (the 2012 Issuer), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, issued £400 million 1.5% 
guaranteed convertible bonds due 2017 (the 2012 bonds) at par. The 2012 Issuer is fully guaranteed by the Company in respect of the 2012 bonds.
Subject to their terms, the 2012 bonds are convertible into preference shares of the 2012 Issuer which are automatically transferred to the Company 
in exchange for ordinary shares in the Company or, at the Company’s election, any combination of ordinary shares and cash. Bondholders may 
exercise their conversion right at any time up to (but excluding) the 20th dealing day before 10 September 2017 (the maturity date). 
The initial exchange price was 693.07 pence per ordinary share. The exchange price is adjusted based on certain events.
147 British Land  Annual Report and Accounts 2017 (E) Net debt continued
From 25 September 2015, the Company has the option to redeem the 2012 bonds at par if the Company’s share price has traded above 130% of 
the exchange price for a specified period, or at any time once 85% by nominal value of the 2012 bonds have been converted, redeemed, or purchased 
and cancelled. The 2012 bonds will be redeemed at par on 10 September 2017 (the maturity date) if they have not already been converted, redeemed 
or purchased and cancelled. No redemption of the bonds occurred in the year.
The intercompany loan between the Issuer and the Company arising from the transfer of the loan proceeds was initially recognised at fair value, 
net of capitalised issue costs, and is accounted for using the amortised cost method. In addition to the intercompany loan, the Company has entered 
into a derivative contract relating to its guarantee of the obligations of the Issuer in respect of the Bonds and the commitment to provide shares or 
a combination of shares and cash on conversion of the Bonds. This derivative contract is included within the balance sheet as a liability carried at 
fair value through profit and loss.
0% Convertible bond 2015 (maturity 2020)
On 9 June 2015, British Land (White) 2015 Limited (the 2015 Issuer), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, issued £350 million zero coupon 
guaranteed convertible bonds due 2020 (the 2015 bonds) at par. The 2015 Issuer is fully guaranteed by the Company in respect of the 2015 bonds.
Subject to their terms, the 2015 bonds are convertible into preference shares of the 2015 Issuer which are automatically transferred to the Company 
in exchange for ordinary shares in the Company or, at the Company’s election, any combination of ordinary shares and cash. From 20 July 2015 up  
to and including 29 June 2018, a bondholder may exercise its conversion right if the share price has traded at a level exceeding 130% of the exchange 
price for a specified period. Thereafter, and up to but excluding the 7th dealing day before 9 June 2020 (the maturity date), a bondholder may convert 
at any time.
The initial exchange price was 1103.32 pence per ordinary share. The exchange price is adjusted based on certain events (such as the Company 
paying dividends in any quarter above 3.418 pence per ordinary share). As at 31 March 2017 the exchange price was 1063.79 pence per ordinary share. 
From 30 June 2018, the Company has the option to redeem the 2015 bonds at par if the Company’s share price has traded above 130% of the  
exchange price for a specified period, or at any time once 85% by nominal value of the 2015 bonds have been converted, redeemed, or purchased  
and cancelled. The 2015 bonds will be redeemed at par on 9 June 2020 (the maturity date) if they have not already been converted, redeemed or 
purchased and cancelled.
The intercompany loan between the Issuer and the Company arising from the transfer of the loan proceeds was initially recognised at fair value, 
net of capitalised issue costs, and is accounted for using the amortised cost method. In addition to the intercompany loan, the Company has entered 
into a derivative contract relating to its guarantee of the obligations of the Issuer in respect of the bonds and the commitment to provide shares or a

 The weighted average period over which rent-free periods expire is 1 year (2015/16: 1 year).
The above is stated for the UK portfolio only.
EPRA Net Initial Yield (NIY) basis of calculation
EPRA NIY is calculated as the annualised net rent (on a cash flow basis), divided by the gross value of the completed property portfolio. The valuation 
of our completed property portfolio is determined by our external valuers as at 31 March 2017, plus an allowance for estimated purchaser’s costs. 
Estimated purchaser’s costs are determined by the relevant stamp duty liability, plus an estimate by our valuers of agent and legal fees on notional 
acquisition. The net rent deduction allowed for property outgoings is based on our valuers’ assumptions on future recurring non-recoverable  
revenue expenditure. 
In calculating the EPRA ‘topped-up’ NIY, the annualised net rent is increased by the total contracted rent from expiry of rent-free periods and future 
contracted rental uplifts where defined as not in lieu of growth. Overall ‘topped-up’ NIY is calculated by adding any other contracted future uplift to 
the ‘topped-up’ net annualised rent.
The net reversionary yield is calculated by dividing the total estimated rental value (ERV) for the completed property portfolio, as determined by  
our external valuers, by the gross completed property portfolio valuation.
The EPRA vacancy rate is calculated as the ERV of the unrented, lettable space as a proportion of the total rental value of the completed property portfolio.

Dividends 
As a REIT, British Land pays Property  
Income Distribution (PID) and non-Property 
Income Distribution (non-PID) dividends.  
More information on REITs and PIDs can  
be found in the Glossary on page 177 or  
in the Investors section of our website at  
ww w.britishland.com/dividends
British Land dividends can be paid directly  
into your bank or building society account 
instead of being despatched by cheque.  
More information about the benefits of having 
dividends paid directly into your bank or 
building society account, and the mandate  
form to set this up, can be found in the  
Investors section of our website at  
ww w.britishland.com/dividends
Scrip Dividend Scheme
British Land may offer shareholders the 
opportunity to participate in the Scrip Dividend 
Scheme by offering a Scrip Alternative to a 
particular dividend from time to time. The  
Scrip Dividend Scheme allows participating 
shareholders to receive additional shares 
instead of a cash dividend. More information  
is available on the Investors section of  
our website at ww w.britishland.com/ 
scrip-dividend-scheme
Website and shareholder communications 
The British Land corporate website contains a 
wealth of material for shareholders, including 
the current share price, press releases and 
information dividends. The website can be 
accessed at ww w.britishland.com
British Land encourages its shareholders  
to receive shareholder communications 
electronically. This enables shareholders to 
receive information quickly and securely as  
well as in a more environmentally friendly and 
cost-effective manner. If you would like further 
information, please visit ww w.shareview.co.uk 
or telephone the Shareholder Helpline.
Shareholder fraud warning
Shareholders are reminded to be very vigilant  
of share fraud. This might include unsolicited 
telephone calls or letters offering free 
investment advice or offers to buy and sell 
shares at discounted or inflated prices. 
The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has 
published lots of useful advice on how to  
protect yourself from investment scams. This 
information is available on the FCA website  
ww w.fca.org.uk/scams or by calling the 
Consumer Helpline on 0800 111 6768.
ShareGift
Shareholders with a small number of shares, 
the value of which makes it uneconomic to  
sell them, may wish to consider donating their 
shares to charity. ShareGift is a registered 
charity (No. 1052686) which collects and sells 
unwanted shares and uses the proceeds  
to support a wide range of UK charities.

Honorary President
In recognition of his work building British Land 
into the industry leading company it is today,  
Sir John Ritblat was appointed as Honorary 
President on his retirement from the Board  
in December 2006.
Tax
The Group elected for REIT status on 1 January 
2007, paying a £308m conversion charge to 
HMRC in the same year. As a consequence of 
the Group’s REIT status, tax is not levied within 
the corporate group on the qualifying property 
rental business but is instead deducted from 
distributions of such income as Property 
Income Distributions to shareholders. Any 
income which does not fall within the REIT 
regime is subject to tax within the Group in the 
usual way. This includes profits on property 
trading activity, property related fee income 
and interest income. We continue to comfortably 
pass all REIT tests ensuring that our REIT 
status is maintained.
We work proactively and openly to maintain  
a constructive relationship with HMRC. We 
discuss matters in real-time with HMRC and 
disclose all relevant facts and circumstances, 
particularly where there may be tax uncertainty 
or the law is unclear. HMRC assigns risk ratings 
to all large companies. We have a low appetite 
for tax risk and HMRC considers us to be ‘Low 
Risk’ (a status we have held since 2007 when 
the rating was first introduced by HMRC).

Other information
SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION CONTINUED Development uplift is the total increase  
in the value (after taking account of capex  
and capitalised interest) of properties held  
for development during the period. It also  
includes any developer’s profit recognised  
by valuers in the period. 
EPRA is the European Public Real  
Estate Association, the industry body  
for European REITs. 
EPRA cost ratio (including direct  
vacancy costs) is a proportionally consolidated 
measure of the ratio of net overheads and 
operating expenses against gross rental 
income (with both amounts excluding ground 
rents payable). Net overheads and operating 
expenses relate to all administrative and 
operating expenses, net of any service fees, 
recharges or other income specifically intended 
to cover overhead and property expenses. 
EPRA cost ratio (excluding direct  
vacancy costs) is the ratio calculated above,  
but with direct vacancy costs removed  
from the net overheads and operating  
expenses balance. 
EPRA earnings is the IFRS profit after  
taxation attributable to shareholders of  
the Company excluding investment and 
development property revaluations, gains/
losses on investing and trading property 
disposals, changes in the fair value of  
financial instruments and associated  
close-out costs and their related taxation. 
These items are presented in the capital  
and other column of the income statement.  
A reconciliation between profit attributable  
to shareholders of the Company and  
EPRA earnings is included in Table B  
within the supplementary disclosures. 
EPRA NAV per share is EPRA NAV divided  
by the diluted number of shares at the  
period end. 
EPRA net asset value (EPRA NAV) is a 
proportionally consolidated measure, 
representing the IFRS net assets excluding  
the mark-to-market on effective cash flow 
hedges and related debt adjustments, the 
mark-to-market on the convertible bonds  
as well as deferred taxation on property  
and derivative valuations. It includes the 
valuation surplus on trading properties  
and is adjusted for the dilutive impact  
of share options. A reconciliation between 
IFRS net assets and EPRA NAV is included  
in Table B within the Supplementary 
Disclosures. 
EPRA net initial yield is the annualised rents 
generated by the portfolio, after the deduction of 
an estimate of annual recurring irrecoverable 
property outgoings, expressed as a percentage 
of the portfolio valuation (adding notional 
purchaser’s costs), excluding development  
and residential properties. 
EPRA NNNAV is the EPRA NAV adjusted to 
reflect the fair value of debt and derivatives and 
to include deferred taxation on revaluations. 
EPRA occupancy rate is the ERV of occupied 
space divided by ERV of the whole portfolio, 
excluding developments and residential 
property. 
EPRA topped-up net initial yield is the  
current annualised rent, net of costs, topped-
up for contracted uplifts, where these are  
not in lieu of rental growth, expressed as  
a percentage of capital value (adding  
notional purchaser’s costs). 
EPRA vacancy rate is the ERV of vacant space 
divided by ERV of the whole portfolio, excluding 
developments and residential property. 
Estimated rental value (ERV) is the external 
valuers’ opinion of the open market rent which, 
on the date of valuation, could reasonably be 
expected to be obtained on a new letting or  
rent review of a property. 
ERV growth is the change in ERV over a  
period on the standing investment properties 
expressed as a percentage of the ERV at the 
start of the period. ERV growth is calculated 
monthly and compounded for the period subject 
to measurement, as calculated by IPD. 
Fair value movement is the accounting  
adjustment to change the book value of  
an asset or liability to its market value. 
Footfall is the estimated annualised number  
of visitors entering our assets. 
Footfall growth is the like-for-like movement  
in footfall against the same period in the prior 
year, on properties owned throughout both 
comparable periods, aggregated at British 
Land’s ownership share for each asset. 
Gross investment activity is our share of 
acquisitions, sales and capital expenditure  
on investments and development. 
Gross rental income is the gross accounting 
rent receivable (quoted either for the period  
or on an annualised basis) prepared under  
IFRS which requires that rental income from 
fixed / minimum guaranteed rent reviews and 
tenant incentives is spread on a straight-line 
basis over the lease period to earliest 
termination date. This can result in income 
being recognised ahead of cash flow. 
Adjusted net debt is the Group net debt and  
the Group’s share of joint venture and funds’  
net debt excluding the mark-to-market on 
effective cash flow hedges and related debt 
adjustments and non-controlling interests.  
A reconciliation between Group net debt and 
adjusted net debt is included in Table A within 
the supplementary disclosures. 
AGM is the Annual General Meeting of The 
British Land Company PLC. The 2017 AGM will 
be held on 18 July 2017 at The Hyatt Regency 
London – The Churchill, 30 Portman Square, 
London W1H 7BH commencing at 11.00am.
Annualised rent is the gross property rent 
receivable on a cash basis as at the reporting 
date. Additionally, it includes the external 
valuers’ estimate of additional rent in respect  
of unsettled rent reviews, turnover rent and 
sundry income such as that from car parks  
and commercialisation, less any ground  
rents payable under head leases. 
Assets under management is the full value  
of all assets owned and managed by British 
Land and includes 100% of the value of all 
assets owned by joint ventures and funds. 
BREEAM (Building Research Establishment 
Environmental Assessment Method) assesses 
the sustainability of buildings against a range  
of social and environmental criteria. 
Capital return is calculated as the change  
in capital value of the portfolio, less any  
capex incurred, expressed as a percentage  
of capital employed (start value plus capital 
expenditure) over the period, as calculated  
by IPD. Capital returns are calculated  
monthly and indexed to provide a return  
over the relevant period. 
Contracted rent is the annualised rent 
adjusting for the inclusion of rent subject 
to rent free periods. 
Customer satisfaction combines survey  
results on overall experience ratings from 
decision makers, property directors, store 
managers and visitors across our retail  
and office businesses.
Developer’s profit is the profit on cost 
estimated by the valuers that a developer 
would expect. The developer’s profit  
is typically calculated by the valuers to  
be a percentage of the estimated total 
development costs, including land and  
notional finance costs. 
Development cost is the total cost of 
construction of a project to completion, 
excluding site values and finance costs  
(finance costs are assumed by the valuers 
at a notional rate of 5% per annum).
177 British Land  Annual Report and Accounts 2017
GLOSSARY Net development value is the estimated end 
value of a development project as determined 
by the external valuers when the building is 
completed and fully let (taking into account 
tenant incentives and notional purchaser’s 
costs). It is based on the valuer’s view on ERVs, 
yields, letting voids and tenant incentives. 
Net effective rent is the contracted gross  
rent receivable taking into account any 
rent-free period or other tenant incentives.  
The incentives are treated as a cost-to-rent  
and spread over the lease period to the  
earliest termination date. 
Net equivalent yield (NEY) is the time weighted 
average return (after adding notional purchasers 
costs) that a property will produce. In accordance 
with usual practice, the equivalent yield (as 
determined by the external valuers) assume  
rent is received annually in arrears. 
Net initial yield (NIY) is the current annualised 
rent, net of costs, expressed as a percentage  
of capital value, after adding notional 
purchaser’s costs. 
Net rental income is the rental income 
receivable in the period after payment of direct 
property outgoings which typically comprise 
ground rents payable under head leases, void 
costs, net service charge expenses and other 
direct irrecoverable property expenses. Net 
rental income is quoted on an accounting basis. 
Net rental income will differ from annualised 
net cash rents and passing rent due to the 
effects of income from rent reviews, net 
property outgoings and accounting adjustments 
for fixed and minimum contracted rent reviews 
and lease incentives. 
Net reversionary yield (NRY) is the anticipated 
yield to which the initial yield will rise (or fall) 
once the rent reaches the estimated rental value. 
Occupancy rate is the estimated rental value of 
let units as a percentage of the total estimated 
rental value of the portfolio, excluding 
development and residential properties. It 
includes accommodation under offer, subject  
to asset management (where they have been 
taken back for refurbishment and are not 
available to let as at the measurement date)  
or occupied by the Group. 
Omni-channel retailing seeks to provide the 
customer with a seamless shopping experience 
across channels, including stores, online and 
mobile. This empowers customers to switch 
between channels during the shopper journey 
according to their preferences. For example, they 
can use mobile in-store to research or make a 
purchase, buy online and collect in-store, or they 
can buy in-store and initiate a return online. 
Over rented is the term used to describe  
when the contracted rent is above the estimated 
rental value. 
Overall topped-up net initial yield (TUNIY)  
is the EPRA topped-up net initial yield, adding  
all contracted uplifts to the annualised rents.
Passing rent is the gross rent, less any  
ground rent payable under head leases. 
Property income distributions (PIDs) are 
profits distributed to shareholders which are 
subject to tax in the hands of the shareholders 
as property income. PIDs are normally paid  
net of withholding tax, currently at 20%, which 
the REIT pays to the tax authorities on behalf of 
the shareholder. Certain types of shareholder 
(e.g. pension funds) are tax exempt and receive  
PIDs without withholding tax. REITs also  
pay out normal dividends, called non-PIDs,  
which are taxed in the same way as dividends 
received from non REIT companies; these  
are not subject to withholding tax and for  
UK individual shareholders qualify for the  
tax free dividend allowance. 
Portfolio valuation is reported by the Group’s 
external valuers. In accordance with usual 
practice, they report valuations net, after the 
deduction of notional purchaser’s costs, including 
stamp duty land tax, agent and legal fees. 
Proportionally consolidated measures include 
the Group’s share of joint ventures and funds 
and exclude non-controlling interests in the 
Group’s subsidiaries. 
Rack rented is the term used to describe when 
the contracted rent is in line with the estimated 
rental value, implying nil reversion. 
Rent-free period see Tenant (or lease) incentives.
REITs are property companies that allow  
people and organisations to invest in commercial 
property and receive benefits as if they directly 
owned the properties themselves. The rental 
income, after costs, is passed directly to 
shareholders in the form of dividends. In the  
UK REITs are required to distribute at least  
90% of their tax exempt property income to 
shareholders as dividends. As a result, over  
time, a significant proportion of the total return 
for shareholders is likely to come from dividends. 
The effect is that taxation is moved from the 
corporate level to the investor level as investors 
are liable for tax as if they owned the property 
directly. British Land became a REIT in  
January 2007.
Group is The British Land Company PLC  
and its subsidiaries and excludes its share  
of joint ventures and funds (where not treated 
as a subsidiary) on a line-by-line basis  
(i.e. not proportionally consolidated). 
Headline rent is the contracted gross rent 
receivable which becomes payable after all the 
tenant incentives in the letting have expired. 
IFRS are the International Financial Reporting 
Standards as adopted by the European Union. 
Income return is calculated as net income 
expressed as a percentage of capital employed 
over the period, as calculated by IPD. Income 
returns are calculated monthly and indexed  
to provide a return over the relevant period. 
Interest cover is the number of times net 
financing costs are covered by Underlying  
Profit before net financing costs and taxation. 
IPD is a brand of real estate indices, owned by 
MSCI, which produce independent benchmarks 
of property returns and British Land UK 
portfolio returns. 
Lettings and lease renewals are compared 
both to the previous passing rent as at  
the start of the financial year and the  
ERV immediately prior to letting. Letting 
performance against ERV compares of 
achieved letting terms on long term lettings 
and renewals against valuation assumptions  
on like-for-like space, calculated on a net 
effective basis, aggregated at British Land’s 
ownership share for each asset.
Leverage see loan to value (LTV). 
Like-for-like rental income growth  
is the growth in net rental income on properties 
owned throughout the current and previous 
periods under review. This growth rate includes 
revenue recognition and lease incentive 
adjustments but excludes properties held  
for development in either period and lease 
accounting adjustments related to fixed and 
minimum rent reviews. 
Loan to value (LTV) is the ratio of principal  
value of gross debt less cash, short term 
deposits and liquid investments to the 
aggregate value of properties and investments. 
Managed portfolio consists of multi-let 
properties where we have control of facilities 
and utilities management. 
Mark-to-market is the difference between  
the book value of an asset or liability and its 
market value. 
178 British Land  Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Other information
GLOSSARY CONTINUED Reversion is change in rent estimated by  
the external valuers, where the passing rent  
is different to the estimated rental value.  
The increase or decrease of rent arises on  
rent reviews and letting of vacant space or  
re-letting of expiries. 
Scrip dividend For certain periods, British  
Land offers its shareholders the opportunity to 
receive dividends in the form of shares instead 
of cash. This is known as a Scrip dividend. 
Standing investments are assets which are  
not in the course of, or held for, development. 
Tenant (or lease) incentives are incentives 
offered to occupiers to enter into a lease. 
Typically this will be an initial rent-free period, or 
a cash contribution to fit-out. Under accounting 
rules the value of lease incentives is amortised 
through the income statement on a straight-
line basis to the earliest lease termination date. 
The residual site value of a development is 
calculated as the estimated net development 
value, less development profit, all development 
construction costs, finance costs (assumed at  
a notional rate) of a project to completion and 
notional site acquisition costs. The residual is 
determined to be the current site value. 
Topping out is a traditional construction 
ceremony to mark the occasion when  
the structure of the building reaches  
the highest point. 
Total property return is calculated as  
the change in capital value, less any capex 
incurred, plus net income, expressed as  
a percentage of capital employed over the 
period, as calculated by IPD. Total property 
returns are calculated monthly and indexed  
to provide a return over the relevant period. 
Total accounting return is the growth in  
EPRA NAV per share plus dividends paid,  
and this can be expressed as a percentage  
of EPRA NAV per share at the beginning  
of the period.
Total shareholder return is the growth  
in value of a shareholding over a specified  
period, assuming dividends are reinvested  
to purchase additional units of stock. 
Total tax contribution is a more  
comprehensive view of tax contributions  
than the accountancy-defined tax figure  
quoted in most financial statements.  
It comprises taxes and levies paid directly,  
as well as taxes collected from others  
which we administered. 
Turnover rent is where all or a portion of  
the rent is linked to the sales or turnover  
of the occupier. 
Under rented is the term used to describe 
when the contracted rent is below the 
estimated rental value (ERV), implying  
a positive reversion. 
Underlying earnings per share (EPS)  
consists of Underlying Profit after tax divided  
by the diluted weighted average number of 
shares in issue during the period. 
Underlying Profit is the pre-tax EPRA earnings 
measure with additional Company adjustments. 
No Company adjustments were made in either 
the current or prior period. 
Valuation movement is the change in the 
portfolio valuation and sales receipts of 
properties sold during the period, net of  
capital expenditure, capitalised interest and 
development team costs, and transaction costs 
incurred, expressed as a percentage of the 
portfolio valuation at the start of the period plus 
net capex, capitalised interest and development 
team costs, and transaction costs. 
Virtual freehold represents a long leasehold 
tenure for a period of up to 999 years. A 
‘peppercorn’, or nominal, rent is paid annually. 
Weighted average debt maturity is calculated 
by multiplying each tranche of debt by the 
remaining period to its maturity, with the  
sum of the results being divided by total  
debt in issue at the period end. 
Weighted average interest rate is the loan 
interest and net derivative costs per annum  
at the period end, divided by total debt in  
issue at the period end. 
Weighted average unexpired lease term 
is the average lease term remaining to  
first break, or expiry, across the portfolio 
weighted by contracted rental income 
(including rent-frees). The calculation  
excludes residential leases and properties  
allocated as developments. 
Yield on cost is the estimated annual rent  
of a completed development divided by  
the total cost of development including  
site value and notional finance costs to  
the point of assumed rent commencement, 
expressed as a percentage return. 
Yield shift is a movement (usually expressed 
in bps) in the net equivalent yield of a property 
asset, or like-for-like portfolio, over a given 
period, weighted by net capital value.
Rent reviews take place at intervals agreed  
in the lease (typically every five years) and  
their purpose is usually to adjust the rent to  
the current market level at the review date. For 
upwards-only rent reviews, the rent will either 
remain at the same level or increase (if market 
rents have increased) at the review date. 
Rents with fixed and minimum uplifts are  
either where rents are subject to contracted 
uplifts at a level agreed at the time of letting; or 
where the rent is subject to an agreed minimum 
level of uplift at the specified rent review. 
Retailer sales growth is the like-for-like 
movement in retailer in-store sales against  
the same period in the prior year, on occupiers 
remaining in the same unit, providing sales 
data throughout both comparable periods, 
aggregated at British Land’s ownership  
share for each asset. 
Retail planning consents are separated between 
A1, A2 and A3 – as set out in The Town and 
Country Planning (Use Classes) Order. Within the 
A1 category, Open A1 permission allows for the 
majority of types of retail including fashion to be 
accommodated, while Restricted A1 permission 
places limits on the types of retail that can operate 
(for example, a restriction that only bulky goods 
operators are allowed to trade at that site).
