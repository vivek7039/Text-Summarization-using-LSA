2 Lombard Risk Management plc Annual report and accounts 2017 Chairman’s statement
SUMMARY
• The Group achieved revenue 
growth of 44.8%, giving a 
five-year compound annual 
growth rate of 21.9%.
• The Group raised £7.9m net 
during the year via a placing and 
open offer to support its strategy.
• The Group invested in its 
products and launched a 
new technology development 
centre in Birmingham.
• The Board remains confident 
in our plans and our ability to 
continue to execute them.
The Board is very pleased with the progress 
made in delivering the Group’s two-year plan.
Philip Crawford
Non-executive Chairman
I am pleased to report on a year 
of substantial growth and investment 
for Lombard Risk Management plc 
(“Lombard Risk”), underpinned by the 
injection of new equity through the 
placing and open offer that we closed 
in June and July of 2016 and which was 
well supported by our shareholders.
Results
The Group achieved revenue growth 
of 44.8%, giving a five-year compound 
annual growth rate of 21.9%. Recurring 
revenues grew by 21.0% to £12.4m 
(2016: £10.2m) and revenues from 
new licences and renewals of expiring 
term licences grew by 113.7% to £11.6m 
(2016: £5.4m). The Group raised £7.9m 
net during the year via a placing and open 
offer to support its plans for increased 
investment in its products and the launch 
of a new technology development centre 
in Birmingham, and as a result of this 
continued investment, the Group has 
recorded a loss before tax of £1.6m 
(2016: £2.2m). Net cash as at the year 
end stood at £7.0m (2016: £3.3m). 
Dividend
The Group suspended its progressive 
dividend policy in the year ended 
31 March 2016 and it remains the view 
of the Board that the Group’s resources 
are best directed towards the exploitation 
of the considerable opportunities that 
continue to present themselves in both 
the regulatory reporting and collateral 
management software markets. The Board 
does not therefore recommend the 
payment of a dividend. 
Strategy
The support of our shareholders in 
both the placing and open offer closed 
during the year has enabled the Group 
to accelerate its strategy on a number 
of fronts. First, we continue to invest in 
the evolution of AgileREPORTER
®
, which 
will provide clients with a global platform 
from which to service their regulatory 
reporting requirements across multiple 
jurisdictions. Second, the launch of our 
cloud-based collateral management 
product, AgileCOLLATERAL
®
, allows 
clients of all sizes to access the

regulatory complexity.”
Strategy continued
function-rich capabilities of COLLINE
®
 
on a module-by-module basis. Third, 
the opening of our new technology 
development centre in Birmingham, 
UK, will introduce new efficiencies to 
the development, testing and support 
of our software products. In addition, 
our alliance partnerships with a number 
of key partners provides us with both 
increased bandwidth and a breadth 
of support in our sales, implementation 
and support activities. 
Employees
The substantial growth experienced by 
the Group could not have been delivered 
without the dedication and diligence 
of the Lombard Risk team across all 
of our locations and I would like to 
take this opportunity to thank all of our 
employees on behalf of the Board for 
their continued support. 
Board of Directors
There have been no changes to the 
composition of the Board since the 
Annual General Meeting held in July 2016. 
I would like to extend my thanks to my 
fellow Directors for their contributions 
to the Group over the last year. 
Outlook
The Board is very pleased with the progress 
made in delivering the Group’s two-year 
plan that supported the injection of new 
equity last year. The investment in both our 
product suite and our delivery capability, 
coupled with the strength of our alliance 
partners and the recent investment in our 
regional sales leadership teams, puts the 
Group in an excellent position to continue 
to deliver this plan. As I stated in our trading 
statement of 19 April 2017, the year to 
31 March 2018 promises to be a pivotal 
year for Lombard Risk as we continue 
to liberate our clients from operational 
and regulatory complexity, and the Board 
remains confident in our plans and our 
ability to continue to execute them.
AGM
The Annual General Meeting will be held at 
the offices of Newgate Communications 
Limited at 9.30am on Wednesday 19 July 
2017. My fellow Directors and I look forward 
to meeting shareholders at that time.

4 Lombard Risk Management plc Annual report and accounts 2017 SUMMARY
• We are reporting record revenues 
of £34.3m supported by an increase 
of 21% in recurring revenue to 
£12.4m and 35% growth in order 
book to £10.1m.
• We opened our new technology 
development centre in Birmingham, 
close to our London headquarters.
• We have announced the launch 
of AgileCOLLATERAL
®
 our flexible 
cloud-based product harnessing 
the power of COLLINE
®
.
• We continue to develop 
AgileREPORTER
®
 and have 
deployed live instances both 
direct to clients and through our 
strategic partner Oracle.
• We announced our strategic 
partnership with Atos taking 
our cloud-based collateral 
management solution to the 
German market.
Delivering as planned
During the 2016 placing, completed in 
June, Lombard Risk presented a two-year 
plan, setting out some clear objectives in 
terms of delivery and financial performance. 
At the halfway point of that two-year plan, 
we are delighted to be sharing positive 
news and significant progress on all fronts.
Financial performance
In terms of financial performance, the 44.8% 
increase in top-line revenue to £34.3m 
validates the Board’s belief that a step 
change was possible. This dramatic increase 
over the 10.3% achieved last year not only 
eclipses the 15% compound annual revenue 
growth from the previous five years, but also 
maintains the momentum generated during 
the first half. It is an excellent performance, 
ahead of market expectations, and one 
of which we are understandably proud.
We anticipated making a loss in this 
year, a year of significant investment 
for the Group, although the loss before 
tax we are reporting is much less than 
anticipated at £1.6m, with an adjusted 
EBITDA significantly ahead of market 
expectations during the year at £2.6m. 
We do capitalise certain of our research 
and development costs, and stripping 
out this accounting treatment would 
show a cash loss before tax of £5.6m.
We start the new fiscal year with 
confidence, with our recurring revenues 
at £12.4m, up 21.0%, and an order book 
of £10.1m against £7.5m a year ago, an 
increase of 35.0%. This is the year that 
Lombard Risk is targeting a return to 
cash profitability, and the team is fully 
focussed on fulfilling this commitment.
Finally, it is also very pleasing to report 
that following rigorous working capital 
management the Company’s cash 
balance at the year end stood at £7.0m, 
again significantly stronger than the 
market anticipated.
Delivering the future
In addition to the expectations we set 
around our ability to improve the financial 
performance of Lombard Risk, we set out 
an important strategic agenda showing 
how we would use the proceeds from the 
placing. In addition to critical investments 
in our core platforms, these included the 
creation of a new development centre, 
closer to our London headquarters in 
Birmingham. The Company has grown a 
strong offshore capability in Shanghai over 
the last decade, which has made a crucial 
contribution to our product development. 
However, in recent years, rising costs and 
pressure for talent from both local software 
firms and giant international brands has
Alastair Brown

Chief Executive Officer’s statement
Significant progress on all fronts.
5 Annual report and accounts 2017 Lombard Risk Management plc
Strategic report Delivering the future continued
increased the pressure on our team, adding 
to the complexities of managing a remote 
centre. Supporting our clients and keeping 
pace with the rapid changes in our key 
markets demanded a new solution.
After an extensive analysis of the 
infrastructure and talent availability in 
cities across Europe and mainland UK, 
we were delighted to select Birmingham 
as the centre for future investment 
in our delivery capacity. With strong 
communications links to London and 
a deep talent pool, it is a natural choice 
for technology companies, as evidenced 
by the speed we could set it up, opening 
the doors on 23 November 2016. Our 
launch has been well received, we have 
forged strong links with the local business 
and education communities, and most 
importantly we have been securing 
excellent technology talent at the 
rate we had planned.
Cross-product 
collateral management
Existing and new clients have benefited 
from the continued expansion of our 
world-class collateral management system. 
The regulatory release of COLLINE
®
 in May 
supported clients who needed to comply 
with Dodd Frank and IOSCO guidelines 
for trading uncleared derivatives, and we 
were delighted by both the response and 
take-up across our existing customer base. 
Our clients continue to strengthen their 
operations in a period of intensive change, 
injecting control, reducing both costs 
and operational risk and complying with 
the rapidly evolving regulatory framework. 
As similar regulations are adopted in 
Asia, and the Dodd Frank and IOSCO 
framework extends to new waves of 
market participants, Lombard Risk is 
well placed to continue this success.
With another major release in January, the 
addition of exchange-traded derivatives to 
COLLINE
®
 once again underlines the value 
derived from creating a truly cross-product 
collateral solution, designed to work across 
asset classes from the ground up. Attracting 
new Futures Commission Merchant (“FCM”) 
clients in Europe and North America,
as well as presenting an important upgrade 
to existing customers, its immediate 
success validates our strategy to offer a 
comprehensive and up-to-date solution 
suitable for the biggest Tier 1 organisations.
However, our collateral expertise is 
equally relevant across the market, to 
participants of all sizes, and building on 
our success of hosting COLLINE
®
 in the 
cloud for some clients, we launched 
AgileCOLLATERAL
®
 in November. With a 
focus on control, combining simplicity 
of both on-boarding and day-to-day 
operations, AgileCOLLATERAL
®
 offers 
the power of COLLINE
®
, tailored to the 
operational model of clients of any size.
Keeping pace with the regulators
Work has continued to deliver our 
vision to establish AgileREPORTER
®
 as the 
leading regulatory reporting solution across 
North America, Europe and Asia. Deployed 
as either an integrated package with our 
strategic partner Oracle, or implemented 
directly on top of existing data sources 
by Lombard Risk, we have clients live 
on both versions of the platform.
Creating a single platform to meet 
the future challenges of regulatory 
reporting whilst maintaining the value 
of our clients’ previous investments is 
the primary goal of AgileREPORTER
®
. 
With critical new returns such as the 
European Central Bank (“ECB”) AnaCredit 
and the Federal Reserve 2052a supported 
by the new web-based front end, we 
have comprehensive migration paths 
for our extensive customer base.
The Basel Committee on Banking 
Supervision’s regulation number 239 
continues to dominate our and our 
clients’ thinking alike, with the emphasis 
on robust, timely, accurate and complete 
returns driving a step change in both data 
architecture and requirements for data 
lineage. AgileREPORTER
®
 is designed 
with all these characteristics in mind, 
and in addition seeks to offer clients cost 
savings by reusing core components, 
with advanced workflow tooling 
allowing for the optimisation of 
regulatory reporting resources.
A quality client base
Lombard Risk’s extensive client base has 
always been a huge asset to the Group, 
both from a commercial perspective 
and also in terms of the market insights 
that such a diverse global community 
brings. Our clients range from some of the 
largest Tier 1 banks, through our specialism 
in supporting foreign branches, to some 
of the smallest buy-side participants in 
the derivatives markets. This group offered 
over 200 opportunities for services and 
additional modules in addition to several 
long-term renewal extensions on both 
sides of the business during the year. 
In addition to our valued existing 
client base, we were pleased to add 
four major collateral customers, close 
two AgileREPORTER
®
 for Oracle Financial 
Services Analytical Applications (“OFSAA”) 
deals with our partner Oracle, and welcome 
several other reporting clients, including 
a major greenfield challenger bank, 
choosing AgileREPORTER
®
 to meet 
its reporting requirements.
Delivering to such an extensive client 
community requires a highly skilled 
professional services organisation, 
and we pride ourselves on the quality 
of our implementation support. With a 
high number of projects being managed 
to an externally imposed regulatory 
deadline, and multiple clients having 
to meet those deadlines simultaneously, 
we have become adept at leveraging 
our extensive use of client feedback 
to provide the highest levels of support.
Critical partnerships
We have continued to work closely with 
our strategic partner Oracle America Inc., 
adding the ECB and European Banking 
Authority (“EBA”) reporting schedules to 
those previously developed for the Federal 
Reserve. The magnitude of the client 
investment projects involving an end-to-end 
solution offered in partnership with Oracle 
has meant that deal progression has been 
slower than both parties would have liked, 
but with five clients signed and a strong 
pipeline in North America, Europe and 
Australia we are extremely optimistic 
about the opportunities being pursued 
for fiscal year 2018.
Chief Executive Officer’s statement continued
6 Lombard Risk Management plc Annual report and accounts 2017 In November, we announced an exciting 
new relationship with Atos, taking our 
cloud-based collateral management 
solution to the German market. This 
important milestone represents critical 
progress in allowing us to open key 
geographies with local expertise, and 
represents a key strategic step. After 
a year of internal, organic growth, 
we anticipate partner arrangements such 
as Atos and Oracle playing a major role 
in driving our future expansion.
The collateral management landscape 
continues to evolve at a frenetic pace. 
As a truly cross-asset-class collateral 
management system, the key strengths 
of COLLINE
®
 lie in a combination of that 
asset class breadth, industry standard 
connectivity, inventory management, 
and intelligent automation. We continue 
to work with other partners such as 
AcadiaSoft and Razor Risk to extend 
our reach whilst playing to our core 
competencies. As the market evolves, we 
continue to look ahead and co-operate 
with our industry-leading partners for 
the benefit of all our mutual clients.
Lombard Risk is an innovative software 
company with an outstanding services 
organisation supporting our clients. 
We continue to engage with consulting 
partners not only to extend our reach, 
but also to give clients implementation 
and integration options with some 
of the world’s leading firms including 
Accenture and PwC.
Leadership and talent
Lombard Risk has continued to invest in 
talent at all levels of the organisation to 
support our growth. After major changes 
to the executive leadership last year, 
the focus has been on sales leadership, 
sales executives, product expertise and 
technology talent, including of course 
the build-out of our new technology 
centre in Birmingham.
On a geographic basis, the focus 
has been on developing and upgrading 
talent in North America and Europe, 
with additional strategic hires in Asia. 
With strong partnerships in Australia 
and Japan, and well established offices 
in Hong Kong and Singapore, the Group 
is well positioned for significant advances 
in that region.
Investment in our people globally remains 
a key priority for the firm. Lombard Risk’s 
expertise, a direct consequence of 
maintaining its talent, remains a long-term 
differentiator that is extremely hard to 
replicate. With a focus on employee 
engagement, training, talent management 
and development, this is an advantage 
we intend to keep.

Conclusion
We said we would use the funds raised 
in June 2016 to develop a world-class 
development centre in Birmingham, 
make our category-leading collateral 
management system cloud-ready, 
and accelerate the delivery of our vision 
for the future of regulatory reporting. 
We justified this short-term investment 
expenditure with our belief that a step 
change in revenue growth was achievable 
and that the opportunity was immediate 
and had to be exploited immediately. We 
have delivered on all those commitments 
and face fiscal year 2018 with excitement 
and confidence.
Finally, after a turbulent fiscal year 
2016, I would like to thank the Board, 
the Executive Committee, the extended 
leadership group and the whole 
Lombard Risk team for their extraordinary 
efforts in 2017. It is those efforts, applied 
daily, which have delivered such a strong 
performance, and it is a privilege to 
lead such a focussed and committed 
group of people.

ORACLE PARTNERSHIP – NOW UNFOLDING IN EUROPE AND ASIA AS WELL AS THE US
Since spring 2016 our partnership with Oracle has 
seen AgileREPORTER
®
 deployed as an integrated solution 
with Oracle’s Financial Services Data Foundation (“FSDF”) 
at large US clients. With these installations of the Oracle 
Regulatory Reporting Solution (“ORRS”), our clients have 
a proven solution to pressing regulatory problems. ORRS is 
now enabled for the European market. This makes available 
a potent solution for clients that have previously struggled 
to find a true end-to-end integrated solution to data 
management, computation and reporting automation for 
European Banking Authority (“EBA”) reporting. Lombard Risk’s 
relationship with Oracle in Asian markets is now opening 
opportunities there too.
Case studies with existing AgileREPORTER
®
/Oracle clients 
reveal these benefits:
• Assured regulatory accuracy at lower cost, with some 
clients estimating over 50% savings on operational costs.
• Automated regulatory reporting can deliver direct 
improvements in regulator relationships.
• Significant operational risk management improvements 
arise from timely monitoring and corrective actions.
• Replacement of manual processes has reduced time 
producing reports thus freeing resource to review 
outputs, analyse the data and utilise it for informed 
business decisions.
• Real and significant cost savings from AgileREPORTER
®
 
realised: reallocation of resources to higher value areas 
and reduction in overtime at peak times.
The ORRS solution including AgileREPORTER
®
 is well 
placed as clients gear up now for new requirements under 
International Financial Reporting Standard 9, the Fundamental 
Review of the Trading Book (“FRTB”) and the Net Stable 
Funding Ratio (“NSFR”).
13 Annual report and accounts 2017 Lombard Risk Management plc
Strategic report Business review
Outlook
Lombard Risk’s software is designed 
to help financial institutions continuously 
meet the seemingly insatiable demands 
of the global regulators, and to do so 
efficiently. Global standards created 
by the Basel Committee on Banking 
Supervision (“BCBS”) in quality and quantity 
of capital and liquidity and leverage, and 
standards in governance, translate into 
specific country implementation under 
national regulatory rules. Our design 
philosophy mirrors this relationship, 
efficiently leveraging our enterprise-level 
architecture investment into local 
frameworks for delivery to the regulators. 
As Basel III evolution continues into Basel 
IV a stream of requirements such as the 
Fundamental Review of the Trading Book 
(“FRTB”) and the Net Stable Funding Ratio 
(“NSFR”) dominate the horizon. Nearer 
term, changes to expected credit loss 
accounting under IFRS 9, and ongoing 
European regulatory changes for COREP 
and for AnaCredit in the Eurozone present 
immediate opportunities. In the US, the 
regulatory framework is expected to 
drive change despite the possibility of a 
re-regulation if not deregulation agenda 
taking hold, while in Asia markets are 
modernising with revisions to statistical 
data requirements from Singapore to 
Australia. In addition to these impacts on 
regulatory reporting driving demand for 
AgileREPORTER
®
, the increasingly strict 
derivatives margining regime will continue 
to be extended across the industry, affecting 
smaller clients, adding new financial 
services segments and driving demand 
for COLLINE
®
 and AgileCOLLATERAL
®
. 
As well as the external creation of this 
regulatory-driven and date-sensitive 
appetite for proven solutions, Lombard 
Risk offers clients genuine opportunities 
to streamline their processes and reduce 
both operational risk and the cost of 
maintaining a licence to operate.
We enter the new financial year with 
our recurring revenues at another all-time 
high of around £12.4m (2016: £10.2m) 
and our highest ever level of order book 
at £10.1m (2016: £7.5m).
Principal activities
The Company is a holding company. 
The principal activities of the Group are 
the provision of trading, valuation and 
risk management systems and regulatory 
reporting systems to the financial markets, 
being banks, fund administrators, 
investment firms, asset managers, 
energy companies and other firms 
operating in financial markets and the 
wider financial industry.
Strategy
What we do, what we plan to do and why
Lombard Risk is a global technology firm 
in the Governance, Risk and Compliance 
(“GRC”) space, with a special focus on 
collateral management and regulatory 
reporting. We consider ourselves to be 
a market leader in our chosen niches. 
With ever-increasing demands from 
regulators, GRC is one of the fastest 
growing areas in the financial industry 
and we believe we remain well positioned 
to take advantage of this market “sweet 
spot”. The year-on-year revenue growth of 
44.8% and the compound revenue growth 
rate of 21.9% that we have achieved in the 
last five years is some validation of our 
strategy having worked in that period, 
and the Board continues to be of the 
view that significant shareholder value 
can be obtained from retaining focus 
on this area over the next few years. 
Through our new explicit focus on our 
core products and areas of expertise, 
allied with our investment in both our 
direct and indirect sales resources, we 
believe that the growth rate that we 
have achieved in the last five years can be 
maintained with the caveat that there will 
inevitably be swings in the growth rate 
owing to the cycle of regulatory change. 
Our primary strategy at present is to grow 
through investment in our products to 
drive organic growth. We have, however, 
in the past made successful acquisitions 
and we are not averse to doing so again in 
the future. Our appetite to make acquisitions 
will be a combination of the strategic 
product and client fit, the revenue and 
cost synergies, and, importantly, the 
achievable acquisition price in relation 
to our own share price. Notwithstanding 
movements in our share price in the last 
three months, the Board’s willingness to 
dilute our own shareholders by issuing 
shares at the market price in order to pay 
a full price to a seller is necessarily limited.
Key performance indicators
The Directors have monitored 
the performance of the Group with 
particular reference to the following 
key performance indicators:
• turnover by product line and 
geography compared to prior year;
• recurring revenue as a percentage 
of total turnover;
• contractual backlog 
and contract longevity;
• utilisation and profitability 
of professional services against 
budgets and market norms;
• cash management – actual compared 
to budget; and
• operating costs by function as an 
absolute measure and as a proportion 
of revenues compared to prior periods, 
forecasts and market norms.
Turnover for the Risk Management 
and Trading division was 83.1% higher 
than the prior year, while the Regulatory 
Reporting division was 10.6% higher. 
The increase in revenues was predominantly 
in the Americas (+75.4%) and Europe 
(+43.4%) whilst Asia Pacific revenues 
declined by 2.6%.
Operating costs have been monitored 
and have increased consistently across 
both operating divisions.
Clients and client geography
Many of the Group’s clients have 
operations across multiple countries. 
We do business with over 300 clients 
and with 30 of the top 50 banks in the 
world. In the UK we have over 170 clients 
and, altogether, we have clients in 
23 countries. In centres such as London 
and New York we have clients with 
parent companies or head offices 
in many more countries.
Lombard Risk offers clients genuine opportunities to 
streamline their processes and reduce both operational 
risk and the cost of maintaining a licence to operate.
14 Lombard Risk Management plc Annual report and accounts 2017 Our client base and the associated 
relationships remain very important 
assets of the Group. We have had very 
few client losses over the past few years 
and when this does occur it is often due 
to a bank closing a UK or US branch and 
therefore ceasing to need our services 
in that branch.
In FY 2017, 33.8% of our revenues were 
from the UK (2016: 42.9%) and a further 
18.1% from EMEA outside of the UK 
(2016: 9.5%). This continues to represent 
an increasingly important contribution 
from the Group’s overseas operations. 
Revenues from the Americas represented 
36.1% of Group revenue (2016: 29.8%) 
as a result of strong Risk Management 
revenue. Revenues from Asia Pacific 
represented 12.0% of Group revenue 
(2016: 17.8%). 
Intellectual property
The intellectual property of the 
Group remains a key asset, enabling 
Lombard Risk to be a market leader 
in its chosen markets.
To maintain a market-leading position, 
the Group continues to invest in its 
intellectual property. The cost of 
developing innovative, function-rich, 
new technology is material to the 
Group’s finances. The Group capitalises 
these development costs, in line with 
and subject to the conditions of IAS 38. 
In FY 2017 the Group capitalised £7.5m 
(2016: £5.9m).
Personnel
We are headquartered in London, England, 
but 62.3% of our 385 employees work 
outside the UK. We have development 
and testing centres in Shanghai, China and 
Birmingham, UK. We have offices in the 
US (New York), Hong Kong, Singapore and 
T okyo, with representatives in other centres. 
Inevitably, people are our greatest asset 
and also by far our greatest expense, with 
personnel costs being 83.0% of our cash 
cost base. Retaining key staff is always 
very important to us. 
We have an extremely diverse employee 
base with 26 different nationalities 
employed and 128 female staff members 
and 257 male staff members, being 33.2% 
and 66.8% of the staff respectively. 
It is an important principle for us to 
encourage talent and to recruit on merit 
without consideration of gender, race, 
age or sexual preference. For this reason 
we do not set targets for percentages 
of recruitment as we want to recruit the 
best candidate who applies for the job. 
Three of our seventeen-person extended 
leadership team are female, although we 
do not have any female representation 
on the Board.
We are not currently obliged to comply 
with the Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay 
Gap Information) Regulations 2017; 
however, we are fully supportive of and 
committed to the principles embodied 
therein and our Company policies are 
constructed to reflect this.
Environmental issues
UK company law now requires that 
the boards of fully listed companies 
comment on environmental issues. 
Whilst the Group is not fully listed, we 
comment on this matter as we believe 
it is best practice to do so. As a financial 
technology business producing software 
for the financial industry, the environmental 
impact of the Company is small. We do 
not pollute the environment and, arguably, 
our products save appreciable paper 
as we help our clients produce reports 
electronically rather than printing them 
out. Naturally, with offices and clients in 
multiple countries, our staff do undertake 
air travel and this has an environmental 
impact. We do seek to optimise the use 
of video conferencing as an alternative to 
travel and have recently made a significant 
investment in our network and video 
conferencing infrastructure. As a result 
of this we do expect to see a modest 
reduction in our travel requirements 
on occasion.
Social community and human 
rights issues
UK company law now requires that 
the boards of fully listed companies 
comment on social community and 
human rights issues. Whilst the Group 
is not fully listed, we comment on this 
matter as we believe it is best practice 
to do so. The Group has its offices in 
generally high quality buildings in 
the main centres in which it operates, 
with relatively pleasant working conditions 
for employees, including dedicated 
computer equipment and air conditioning. 
While the Group encourages a strong work 
ethic, typical working hours are in line 
with the norm for the country concerned. 
Extracurricular activities are proactively 
encouraged in all the Group comprising 
both charitable and social events. HR 
departments ensure an appropriate level 
of care for the welfare of employees as 
well as the implementation of HR policies. 
The Company complies with the laws 
to which it is subject in not trading in 
countries where this is prohibited by 
sanctions, and takes account of Foreign 
Office warnings on travel to dangerous 
areas. There will inevitably be cases where 
the Board or individual employees may 
disagree with, for example, aspects of 
the human rights record of the country 
concerned or the ethical standards or 
environmental, pollution or health effects 
of parts of corporations we deal with. 
The Board feels that such issues are more 
appropriately dealt with at governmental 
level or through regulators or the courts 
and would not normally restrict dealings by 
the Group with such entities or countries 
unless it became concerned about the 
reputational risk of not doing so.
The Company is not currently obliged to 
make a statement in line with the Modern 
Slavery Act 2015. However, not only do we 
fully agree with the principles set out in 
that act, but as a supplier to major financial 
institutions, who do have to report, we 
need to be confident at all times that our 
own supply chains are free from slavery 
and human trafficking.
Risks
The Group’s main risks are incorporated 
in the risk analysis included with this 
Strategic report. In addition, the Group’s 
multinational operations expose it to 
financial risks that include market risk, 
credit risk, operational risk and liquidity 
risk. The Directors review and agree 
policies for managing each of these risks. 
These policies have remained unchanged 
from previous years and are detailed in 
note 14 to the accounts.

Group results
Group revenue increased by 44.8% to 
a record £34.3m compared with £23.7m 
in the prior year, with strong growth 
recorded in the Risk Management and 
Trading division, which saw revenues 
increase by 83.1%. Regulatory Reporting 
revenues grew by 10.6% primarily due 
to growth in recurring revenues and 
professional services. licence revenues 
for new and renewed term licences 
increased by 113.7% to £11.6m (2016: 
£5.4m), representing 33.7% of revenues 
(2016: 22.8%). Recurring revenues grew 
21.0% to £12.4m (2016: £10.2m) and 
represented approximately 36.0% 
of revenue (2016: 43.1%). Recurring 
revenues now have a current annualised 
run rate in excess of £12.9m.
Operating profit before share-based 
payment charges, depreciation and 
amortisation (adjusted EBITDA) was 
£2.6m (2016: £2.1m). The Group 
recorded a loss before tax of £1.6m 
(2016: £2.2m), resulting in a basic 
loss per share of 0.18p (2016: 0.98p).
The effective rate of tax for the year 
was negative 56.7% (2016: positive 33.0%).
This was driven by both an increase in the 
deferred tax asset to £0.5m (2016: £0.3m) 
and a cash tax reclaim relating to research 
and development tax credits of £0.7m 
(2016: £nil). The unrecognised deferred 
tax asset was £3.0m (2016: £3.2m).
Cash flow
Net cash inflow from operating activities 
was £4.1m (2016: £3.7m). Balancing working 
capital requirements with investing in 
longer-term growth remains an integral 
part of the Group’s financial responsibilities, 
as is the case for many growth technology 
companies. The Group produces weekly 
cash forecasts which are monitored closely. 
The Group has put in place post year end a 
£4.0m revolving loan facility agreement with 
Barclays Bank Plc at a margin of LIBOR plus 
3.5%. In addition, the Group has an overdraft 
facility of £0.5m, also with Barclays Bank Plc. 
There were no amounts owing under either 
the agreement or the overdraft at the 
end of the financial year.
Investment in development expenditure that 
was capitalised was £7.5m (2016: £5.9m).
The Group raised £7.9m (net) from the 
issue of new shares via a placing and 
open offer with £0.001m (2016: £0.2m) 
resulting from the exercise of employee 
stock options.
16 Lombard Risk Management plc Annual report and accounts 2017 Net Group cash, being cash and cash 
equivalents less borrowings, of £7.0m is up 
on the prior year (2016: £3.3m) following 
the placing and open offer for shares to 
raise £7.9m (net) of new equity in June and 
July 2016. The improvement was due to 
the strong focus on debt collection and 
enhanced working capital management.
Balance sheet
Non-current assets at 31 March 2017 
increased to £29.7m (2016: £23.8m), driven 
by the continued investment in capitalised 
development costs of £7.5m for the year. 
This investment was applied across the 
Group’s suite of products and included 
£4.1m of investment in COLLINE
®
, £1.9m in 
global regulatory reporting and £1.5m in the 
software platform to support its regulatory 
reporting products. The Directors continue 
to remain confident that this investment 
will bring future benefits to the business 
by enabling clients to both continue to 
meet their regulatory reporting obligations 
and more effectively manage risk in an 
increasingly regulated environment and 
by broadening the reach of the Group’s 
products through both direct and indirect 
sales channels. The carrying value of 
non-current assets includes £6.0m in 
respect of goodwill arising on previous 
acquisitions, £8.6m in respect of the 
written-down value of the Group’s 
investment in its risk management and 
trading products, £7.3m in respect of the 
Group’s regulatory reporting products 
and £4.1m relating to the development of 
the software platform that supports these 
products. During the year the Group’s 
technical team incurred costs of £7.0m that 
did not meet the criteria for capitalisation 
and were therefore recorded as an expense 
in the statement of comprehensive income.
Net Group cash at 31 March 2017 was 
£7.0m (2016: £3.3m). The Group had 
no borrowings at the balance sheet 
date (2016: £nil). 
Trade receivables were 12.1% of revenues 
as at 31 March 2017, compared to 15.6% 
and 17.3% for 2016 and 2015 respectively.
Year-on-year trends
The capitalisation of development 
costs for the last five years has an impact 
on the interpretation of the financial 
performance of the Group. Internally 
the Group’s operating budget and 
monthly management accounts measure 
financial performance assuming no such 
capitalisation. The table below allows 
readers to make a more informed 
assessment of the financial performance 
of the Group.

Strategic report Principal risks and uncertainties
Effectively managing risks.
Effectively managing risks is an integral part of Lombard Risk’s continuing success. The Group has identified 
its main risks and is taking appropriate action to manage and mitigate these risks. The Group’s multinational 
operations expose it to financial risks that include market risk, credit risk, operational risk and liquidity risk. 
The Directors review and agree policies for managing each of these risks. These policies have remained 
unchanged from previous years and are detailed in note 14 to the accounts.
The key factors affecting the Group’s performance are expected to include the following:
DESCRIPTION OF RISK POTENTIAL IMPACT MITIGATION
CHANGE IN 
LEVEL OF RISK
People
The Group’s products and 
services are built on the innovation 
and dedication of its employees. 
Continuing to attract, develop 
and retain highly skilled employees 
in a competitive market is key 
to its ongoing success.
Failure to attract and 
retain the right calibre of 
staff will impact on the 
Group’s ability to deliver 
world-class products 
and services.
The Group has invested in 
its human resources team to 
improve the structure around 
performance reviews, pay reviews, 
incentive schemes and career 
planning. A dedicated in-house 
recruitment function has been 
created to source and recruit 
skilled employees and offer 
exciting and challenging career 
opportunities. We have new 
evidence of this risk being low 
as we attract top talent to our 
new development facility 
in Birmingham.
The UK exit from the EU 
disrupts business
Macroeconomic downturn 
results from uncertainty surrounding 
the terms, timing and smooth 
execution of the UK’s exit from 
the EU. Reduced access to 
skilled labour.
Systems decisions that 
could be deferred (for 
example non-regulatory 
components of 
COLLINE
®
) may be 
delayed as banks’ 
revenues decline. 
Increased cost of hiring 
and retaining skilled 
labour due to 
competitive pressures in 
the employment market.
Focus sales activities on 
date-driven imperatives such as 
AgileREPORTER
®
 and regulatory 
components of COLLINE
®
; 
qualify client opportunities in 
collateral space to ensure major 
cost savings are evident; and 
continue to support clients 
writing cost-saving business 
cases. With offices in North 
America, Asia and the UK, the 
Group is well placed to tap into 
a variety of labour markets.
 
Banking sector and financial 
industry regulation
There continues to appear to the 
Group to be a multiple-year surge 
in regulation, and more firms are 
now in scope for regulation than 
before. Increased regulation, whilst 
representing a significant opportunity 
for the Group, brings the risk of 
becoming so onerous that regulators 
and / or politicians recognise the 
impact of regulation on the financial 
services industry and either delay or 
reduce demands, as demonstrated 
in elements of the campaign rhetoric 
in the 2016 US Presidential election.
The withdrawal 
of clients from the 
regulated space and 
a return to light-touch 
regulation would 
introduce the risk of 
sales of AgileREPORTER
®
 
being deferred or 
eliminated, which could 
have a material impact 
on Group revenues.
Refocus efforts on COLLINE
®
 
opportunities; in regulatory 
reporting business focus on 
rationalising clients’ expedient 
legacy decisions to reduce 
cost. Overall risk assessed as 
very low given forward sight to 
2020 of regulators’ requirements 
and further evidenced by the 
perception of a diminishing 
appetite in the US to dramatically 
reduce financial services 
regulation, due to the systemic risks 
such a move would precipitate.

Strategic report Dear Shareholder,
The Board is committed to high standards of integrity and corporate governance 
and consistently seeks to apply the principles set out in the UK Corporate Governance 
Code (the “Code”) as judged appropriate by the Board for an AIM-listed company.
We do not comply with the Code. However, we have reported on our corporate 
governance arrangements by drawing upon best practice available, including those 
components of the Code we consider to be relevant to the Company and best practice.
We recognise the importance of diversity on the Board and are satisfied that the 
independent Non-executive Directors have business backgrounds that supplement 
the remaining members of the Board.
The Company seeks to ensure it has an appropriate balance of Executive  
and Non-executive elements on its Board.

The role of the Board
The Board is responsible for the overall management 
of the Group, its strategy and long-term objectives, having 
regard to the interests of shareholders and the protection and 
enhancement of shareholder value. The Board ensures that the 
necessary financial and other resources are made available to 
enable those objectives to be met, and that objectives are only 
set that are consistent with the anticipated financial and other 
resources. It has a schedule of matters reserved for its approval 
including, but not limited to, decisions on strategy and risk 
management, approval of budgets, acquisitions and disposals, 
major capital expenditure, legal and insurance issues, Board 
structure and the appointment of advisers. In some areas 
responsibility is delegated to committees of the Board or 
to the Executive within clearly defined terms of reference.
Once the strategic and financial objectives of the Group 
have been agreed and set by the Board, it is the role of the 
Chief Executive Officer and the Executive team to ensure that 
these are achieved through the day-to-day management of the 
Group’s business.
All Directors are subject to election by the shareholders at the 
next general meeting following their appointment to the Board 
and are required to retire by rotation at the Annual General Meeting 
which falls nearest to the third anniversary of the Annual General 
Meeting at which they were appointed or last re-appointed. 
The Executive Directors have service contracts which are 
terminable upon between three and six months’ notice.
The names of the current Directors, together with their 
biographical details, are set out on pages 24 to 25 of this 
annual report. 
The Directors are given access to independent professional 
advice at the Group’s expense when the Directors deem it is 
necessary in order for them to carry out their responsibilities.
The Board meets at least six times a year and the Audit Committee, 
Nominations Committee and Remuneration Committee normally 
meet on a formal basis twice a year.

Governance Corporate governance report continued
For the year ended 31 March 2017
The role of the Board continued
The Board receives appropriate and timely information prior to 
each meeting, with a formal agenda and Board and committee 
papers being distributed before meetings take place. Any Director 
may challenge Group proposals and decisions are taken 
democratically after discussion. Any Director who feels that any 
concern remains unresolved after discussion may ask for that 
concern to be noted in the minutes of the meeting. Any specific 
actions arising from such meetings are agreed by the Board 
and then followed up by management.
The Group maintains, for its Directors and officers, liability 
insurance for any claims against them in that capacity.
The Group has effective procedures in place to deal with 
conflicts of interest. The Board is aware of other commitments 
of its Directors and changes to these commitments are 
reported to the Board.
A summary of the Board’s main work in the year ended 
31 March 2017 includes:
• strategy and delivery, including a fundraising to support 
the Group’s product enhancement strategy;
• evaluation of external growth opportunities;
• financial overview; and
• corporate governance and compliance, including selection 
of additional Board members.
While the Board seeks to operate collaboratively between 
Executive and Non-executive Directors in order to ensure 
the effective operation of the Board, there is a clear division 
between the formal responsibilities of the Directors as set 
out below.
Directors’ roles
The Chairman’s main role is to:
• ensure good corporate governance;
• lead the Board, ensuring the effectiveness of the Board in all 
aspects of its role;
• ensure effective communication with shareholders; and
• set the agenda for Board meetings in conjunction with the 
Chief Executive Officer and the Company Secretary, and 
ensure that all Directors are encouraged to participate fully 
in the activities and decision-making process of the Board.
The Chief Executive Officer’s main role is to:
• lead the Group and provide the key recommendations 
to the Board on corporate strategy;
• run the Group on a day-to-day basis;
• provide strategic direction to the Group’s management team;
• set objectives for and review the performance of the 
Group’s management team;
• play a key role in external client, partner 
and shareholder relationships;
• be responsible, along with the executive team, 
for implementing the decisions of the Board 
and its committees; and
• be the Group spokesperson, communicating with external 
audiences, such as investors, analysts and the media.
The Non-executive Directors’ main role is to:
• challenge the opinions of the Executive Directors, provide 
fresh insight in terms of strategic direction and bring their 
diverse experience and expertise to the benefit of the 
leadership of the Group;
• play a full part in ensuring good corporate governance;
• assess the performance of the Chairman;
• provide a sounding board for the Chairman and serve as 
an intermediary for the other Directors as necessary;
• scrutinise the performance of the Executive Directors 
in terms of meeting agreed goals and objectives;
• be available to shareholders if they have concerns 
which contact through the normal channels of Chairman, 
Chief Executive Officer or other Executive Directors has 
failed to resolve or for which such contact is inappropriate;
• monitor the reporting of performance;
• assist the Executive Directors with high level external 
contacts where this is possible; and
• ensure that the financial information, controls and systems of 
risk management within the Group are robust and defensible.

Philip Crawford 7 years
John McCormick 3.5 years
Steve Rogers 3.5 years
Sandy Broderick 1.5 years
Alastair Brown 1.3 years
Nigel Gurney 2.5 years
Internal controls
The Directors are responsible for the systems of internal 
control. Although no system of internal control can provide 
absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss, the 
Group’s systems are designed to provide the Directors with 
reasonable assurance that problems are identified on a timely 
basis and dealt with appropriately. The Board considers that 
there have been no substantial weaknesses in internal financial 
controls resulting in any material losses, contingencies or 
uncertainties and thus subject to disclosure in the accounts. 
The Board has considered the need for an internal audit 
function and has concluded that there is no current need 
for such a function within the Company.
Accounting policies
The Board considers the appropriateness of its accounting 
policies on an annual basis. The Board believes that its 
accounting policies and estimation techniques are appropriate, 
in particular in relation to income recognition, goodwill, 
research and development and deferred expenses.
Information
Board reports and papers are circulated to the Directors 
in advance of the relevant Board or committee meeting. 
These papers are supplemented by information specifically 
requested by the Directors from time to time. Minutes of Board 
and committee meetings are circulated to all Board members.
The Non-executive Directors receive monthly management 
accounts and regular management reports and information 
which enables them to scrutinise the Group’s and management’s 
performance against agreed objectives.
Shareholder relations and Annual General 
Meeting (“AGM”)
The Company recognises the importance of dialogue with all 
of its shareholders. The AGM is an opportunity to communicate 
with institutional and other shareholders. The outcome of the 
voting on AGM resolutions is disclosed by means of an 
announcement on the London Stock Exchange.
Additional information is supplied through the circulation 
of the interim report and the annual report and accounts. 
Lombard Risk Management plc maintains up-to-date information 
on the investor section of its website, www.lombardrisk.com.
Every shareholder receives or has online access to a full annual 
report after each year end and has access to an interim report 
online after each half year end. Care is taken to ensure that any 
price-sensitive information is released to all its shareholders, 
institutional and private, at the same time in accordance with 
London Stock Exchange requirements.

Governance Report of the Remuneration Committee
For the year ended 31 March 2017
Companies quoted on AIM are not required to provide a 
formal remuneration report. Therefore this report is provided 
for information purposes to give greater transparency to the 
way Directors and key management are remunerated.
Composition and role of the 
Remuneration Committee
The Board has established a Remuneration Committee which 
currently consists of Steve Rogers (Non-executive Director), 
who chairs the committee, John McCormick (Non-executive 
Director), Sandy Broderick (Non-executive Director) and 
Philip Crawford (Non-executive Chairman). The committee 
determines the specific remuneration packages for each of 
the Executive Directors and key management. No Director 
is involved in any decisions as to his own remuneration. 
Framework and policy on Executive 
Directors’ remuneration
The Group’s remuneration policy is designed to provide 
competitive rewards for its Executive Directors and key 
management, taking into account the performance of the 
Group and individual Executives, together with comparisons 
of pay conditions throughout the markets in which the Group 
operates. It is the aim of the committee to attract, retain 
and motivate high calibre individuals with a competitive 
remuneration package. It is common practice in the industry 
for total remuneration to be influenced by bonuses and 
long-term incentives.
The remuneration packages are constructed to provide 
a balance between fixed and variable rewards. Therefore 
remuneration packages for Executive Directors normally include 
basic salary, discretionary bonuses, long-term incentive awards 
and benefits in kind. In agreeing the level of basic salaries and 
annual bonuses, the committee takes into consideration the 
total remuneration that Executive Directors could receive.
Basic salary
Basic salaries are reviewed on an annual basis. The committee 
seeks to establish a basic salary for each position, determined 
by individual responsibilities and performance taking into account 
comparable salaries for similar positions in companies of a 
similar size in the same market.
Incentive arrangements
Annual discretionary bonuses
These are designed to reflect the Group’s performance taking 
into account the performance of its peers, the markets in which 
the Group operates and the Executive Directors’ contribution to 
that performance.
Long-term incentive awards
The Group operates an option scheme for qualifying staff, 
including Executive Directors. Options are granted over the 
Company’s shares that are capable of vesting no earlier than 
the second anniversary of issue. The vesting period runs for two 
to ten years from the date the options first vest. There are no 
other performance conditions other than the vesting period. 
During the year ended 31 March 2017, options over 5,000,000 
shares (2016: 6,900,000) were awarded to participating 
staff, of which none (2016: 3,000,000) were awarded to 
Executive Directors.
Other benefits
Depending on the terms of their contracts, Executive Directors 
are entitled to contributions to pension plans, private medical 
insurance, permanent health insurance and life assurance.
Service contracts and notice periods
All Executive Directors have employment contracts which are 
subject to between three and six months’ notice from either the 
Executive or the Group, given at any time. 
Non-executive Directors
All Non-executive Directors have a remuneration agreement 
for an initial period of twelve months and thereafter on a 
rolling basis subject to three months’ notice by either the 
Non-executive Director or the Group, given at any time.
In the event of termination of their appointment they are not 
entitled to any compensation. 
Non-executive Directors’ fees are determined by the Executive 
Directors having regard to the need to attract high calibre 
individuals with the right experience, the time and responsibilities 
entailed and comparative fees paid in the market in which the 
Group operates. They are not eligible for pensions. They may 
be invited to participate in the Group’s share option scheme.

Governance Report of the Audit Committee
For the year ended 31 March 2017
Membership and meetings of the 
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee is a committee of the Board and is 
composed entirely of Non-executive Directors, whom the 
Board considers to be independent. The Audit Committee 
invites the Executive Directors and other senior managers 
to attend its meetings as appropriate.
During the year the Audit Committee was chaired by 
John McCormick. The Audit Committee is considered to have 
sufficient, recent and relevant financial experience to discharge 
its functions. The Audit Committee invites others, including the 
external auditor, to attend its meetings as appropriate.
Role, responsibilities and terms of reference
The Audit Committee’s role is to assist the Board in the effective 
discharge of its responsibilities for financial reporting and 
internal control.
The Audit Committee’s responsibilities include:
• reviewing the integrity of the annual and interim financial 
statements of the Group, ensuring they comply with legal 
requirements, accounting standards, the AIM Rules and 
any other formal announcements relating to the Group’s 
financial performance;
• reviewing the Group’s internal financial control and risk 
management systems;
• monitoring and reviewing the requirement for an internal 
audit function; and
• overseeing the relationship with the external auditor, 
including approval of its remuneration, reviewing the scope 
of the audit engagement, assessing its independence, 
monitoring the provision of non-audit services and considering 
its reports on the Group’s financial statements.
Independence of external auditor
The Audit Committee keeps under review the relationship with 
the external auditor including:
• the independence and objectivity of the external auditor, taking 
into account the relevant UK professional and regulatory 
requirements and the relationship with the auditor as a 
whole, including the provision of non-audit services;
• recommending to the Board and shareholders the 
re-appointment or otherwise of the external auditor 
for the following financial period; and
• the consideration of audit fees and any fees for 
non-audit services.
The Audit Committee develops and recommends to the Board 
the Company’s policy in relation to the provision of non-audit 
services by the auditor and ensures that the provision of such 
services does not impair the external auditor’s independence.

The Directors are responsible for preparing the annual report 
and the financial statements in accordance with applicable 
law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial 
statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors 
have elected to prepare consolidated financial statements in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(“IFRS”) as adopted by the European Union and Parent Company 
financial statements in accordance with UK Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice (“UK GAAP”), including FRS 101 “The 
Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic 
of Ireland”. Under company law, the Directors must not approve 
the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a 
true and fair view of the state of affairs and profit or loss of the 
Company and Group for that period. In preparing these financial 
statements, the Directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply 
them consistently;
• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent;
• state whether applicable IFRS and UK GAAP have been 
followed, subject to any material departures disclosed 
and explained in the financial statements; and
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will 
continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate 
accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain 
the Company’s transactions and that disclose with reasonable 
accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company 
and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply 
with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for 
safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for taking 
reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud 
and other irregularities.
Insofar as each of the Directors is aware:
• there is no relevant audit information of which the 
Company’s auditor is unaware; and
• the Directors have taken all steps that they ought to have 
taken to make themselves aware of any relevant audit 
information and to establish that the auditor is aware 
of that information.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity 
of the corporate and financial information included on the 
Company’s website. Legislation in the UK governing the 
preparation and dissemination of financial statements may 
differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Capital management
The Group generally seeks to finance all operational financing 
requirements through cash flows generated from operating 
activities, although this may be supplemented through capital 
injections if mutually beneficial to the Group, current shareholders 
and prospective investors. The Company’s equity structure is set 
out in note 16 to the financial statements.
Management’s objectives with respect to managing capital 
include maintaining sufficient capital to enable the Group 
to implement its strategy going forward with an optimal level 
of external debt. Part of this strategy is to generate a positive 
return to investors, both through dividend income and 
capital growth.
Results and dividends
The audited financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2017 
are set out on pages 32 to 55. The Group’s loss for the year 
after taxation amounted to £0.7m (2016: £2.9m). It is the view 
of the Board that the Group is at a stage in its development 
where its resources can be best utilised within the business to 
accelerate the substantial opportunities that the Group is in a 
position to exploit in the coming months and years. The Board 
does not, therefore, propose to pay a dividend (2016: 0.035p 
per Ordinary Share of 0.5p).
Directors and their interests
The Directors who served during the year and up to the date 
of this report and their beneficial interests in the Company’s 
Ordinary Share capital were as follows:

Substantial shareholdings
As at 25 April 2017 the Company has been notified of the 
following interests in 3% or more of its issued share capital:
Number of shares % holding
John Wisbey 70,687,264 17.6

Fidelity International Limited 30,508,189 7.6
Herald Investment Management Limited 24,271,113 6.1
Richard Sneller 12,500,000 3.1
Research and development
Research and development expenditure incurred on the 
Group’s suite of products has been capitalised in line with 
the Group’s accounting policy in the relevant period. Research 
and comprises analysis, design, programming and testing of 
software solutions in both the Regulatory Compliance and Risk 
Management and Trading segments of the business. The Group 
will continue to invest in solutions to address new regulatory 
requirements as they arise and to take advantage 
of technological advances in the underlying software platforms. 
Amounts not capitalised have been expensed to the consolidated 
statement of comprehensive income, along with the amortisation 
of amounts that have been capitalised.
Going concern
The financial statements have, as in previous years, been 
prepared on a going concern basis. 
The Directors are required by the Companies Act 2006 to 
prepare annual accounts that give a true and fair view and, as 
part of this, to decide if it is appropriate to prepare them on a 
going concern basis. In forming an opinion that the Company 
and the Group is a going concern, the Directors have taken 
particular note of the trading performance in the year ended 
31 March 2017. This shows an increase in the Group’s cash 
balance following the issue of new shares in the year.
The Directors have prepared cash flow forecasts for the period 
ending 30 June 2018 which show that the Company and 
Group have sufficient facilities for ongoing operations. Whilst 
there will always remain some inherent uncertainty within the 
aforementioned forecasts, the Directors believe the Company 
and Group have sufficient resources to continue in operational 
existence for at least twelve months from the date of approval 
of these financial statements.
Accordingly, the Directors continue to adopt the going concern 
basis in preparing the financial statements for the year ended 
31 March 2017.
Financial risk management
The Group’s multinational operations expose it to financial risks 
that include market risk, credit risk, operational risk and liquidity 
risk. The Directors review and agree policies for managing each 
of these risks and details of these risks and policies are set out 
in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements.
Auditor
A resolution to re-appoint Grant Thornton UK LLP as auditor 
and to authorise the Directors to agree its remuneration will 
be placed before the forthcoming AGM of the Company.

Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements
For the year ended 31 March 2017
1. Accounting policies
(A) Basis of preparation
These consolidated financial statements are for the year ended 31 March 2017. They have been prepared in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) and IFRS Interpretation Committee (“IFRIC”) interpretations as at 31 March 2017, 
as adopted by the European Union and also in accordance with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 relevant to companies 
which prepare financial statements in accordance with IFRS. They have been prepared under the historical cost convention.
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires the Board to make judgements, estimates and assumptions 
that affect the application of accounting policies, the reported amounts of balance sheet items at the period end and the reported 
amount of revenue and expense during the reporting period. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical 
experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the 
basis of making judgements that are not readily apparent from other sources. However, the actual results may differ from these 
estimates. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
The Parent Company financial statements on pages 57 to 63 present information about the Company as a separate entity rather 
than about the Group, and have been prepared under Financial Reporting Standard 101 “Reduced Disclosure Framework” (FRS 101) 
as permitted by the Companies Act 2006.
New standards, amendments and interpretations
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, certain new standards, amendments and interpretations to existing 
standards have been published but are not yet effective and have not been adopted early by the Group.
Management anticipates that all of the pronouncements will be adopted by the Group’s accounting policies for the first period 
beginning after the effective date of the pronouncement. Information on new standards, amendments and interpretations that 
are expected to be relevant to the Group’s financial statements is provided below. Certain other new standards and interpretations 
have been issued but are not expected to have a material impact on the Group’s financial statements, with the exception of IFRS 15 
and IFRS 16, where the Group is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of these standards in future periods.
IFRS 9 “Financial Instruments” (effective date: 1 January 2018)

(1) Not adopted by the EU (as at 31 March 2017).
(B) Basis of consolidation
The Group accounts consolidate the financial statements of the Parent Company (Lombard Risk Management plc) and its 
subsidiary undertakings over which it has control (see note 6 to the Parent Company balance sheet). In accordance with IFRS 10, 
the Group considers it has control over its subsidiary undertakings on the grounds that it has: existing rights over them that give 
it the ability to direct their activities; rights to variable returns from its involvement with them; and the ability to use its power over 
them to affect the amount of the Group’s returns. A description of the principal activities and operations of the Group can be 
found in the Directors’ report.
The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings made up to 
31 March 2017. The acquisition method of accounting has been adopted. Under this method, the results of subsidiary undertakings 
acquired or disposed of in the year are included in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income from the date of acquisition 
or up to the date of disposal. All of the Group’s assets and liabilities existing at the date of acquisition are recorded at their fair values 
reflecting their condition at that date. Profits or losses on intra-group transactions are eliminated in full. Goodwill is capitalised and 
under IFRS 3 goodwill is not amortised but an impairment test is performed as appropriate, at least annually. The value of goodwill 
is to be written down according to the outcome of the impairment test.
Non-controlling interests, presented as part of equity, represent the portion of a subsidiary’s profit or loss and net assets that is not 
held by the Group. The Group attributes total comprehensive income or loss of subsidiaries between the owners of the Parent and 
the non-controlling interest based on their respective ownership interest.
36 Lombard Risk Management plc Annual report and accounts 2017 1. Accounting policies continued
(C) Segment reporting 
In identifying its operating segments, management generally follows the Group’s product lines. The Group operates two main 
operating segments: Regulatory Reporting software and Risk Management and Trading software. Regulatory Reporting software 
provides regulatory, anti-money laundering and compliance systems to financial markets. Risk Management and Trading software 
provides trading, valuation and risk management systems to the financial markets. Each of these product lines is managed separately 
as they each require different technology and other resources as well as marketing approaches. Corporate overheads, assets 
and liabilities which are not directly attributable to either product line are not allocated to segments.
(D) Going concern
The financial statements have, as in previous years, been prepared on a going concern basis. 
In forming an opinion that the Company and the Group is a going concern, the Directors have taken particular note of the trading 
performance in the year ended 31 March 2017. This shows an increase in the Group’s cash balance following the issue of new 
shares in the year.
The Directors have prepared a cash flow forecast for the period to 30 June 2018, which shows that the Company and Group have 
sufficient facilities for ongoing operations. Whilst there will always remain some inherent uncertainty within the aforementioned 
forecasts, the Directors believe the Company and Group have sufficient resources to continue in operational existence for at least 
twelve months from the date of approval of these financial statements.
Accordingly, the Directors continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements for the year ended 
31 March 2017.
(E) Revenue
Revenue represents the fair value of goods sold and services provided during the year, stated net of value added tax. Revenue and 
profit before tax are wholly attributable to the principal activities of the Group.
The recognition of revenue depends on the type of income:
Licence income   For long-term projects which do not include the upfront delivery of immediately usable software, 
revenue is recognised on both the consultancy and initial licence elements in line with the estimated 
percentage of completion of the project. This estimation is based upon the views of the consultants 
implementing the projects as to the proportion of the project completed and this is supported by 
data from a time recording system. Annual licence / usage fees and maintenance revenue invoiced 
simultaneously with the initial licence, but considered to relate to the period when the licence is 
deemed to be live, is deferred in its entirety until the live date, following which it is released to profit 
in equal daily instalments over the duration of the relevant licence or maintenance. For other projects 
which do include the upfront delivery of immediately usable software, revenue is recognised on a 
percentage of completion basis. For non-refundable licences, revenue is recognised in full on 
customer acceptance as there are no ongoing obligations in respect of such sales.
Customisation income Recognised once the customisation has taken place.
Maintenance income Recognised evenly over the term of the maintenance contract.
Rental income   Recognised evenly over the term of the rental contract.
Data subscription income  Recognised evenly over the term of the data contract.
Training income  Recognised when the relevant courses are run.
Multiple element transactions are allocated to relevant revenue categories based on typical revenue splits for transactions which 
are contracted separately and by using industry best practice.
(F) Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, net of depreciation and any provision for impairment. No depreciation is charged 
during the period of construction. Leasehold property is included in property, plant and equipment only where it is held under a 
finance lease.
The cost of computer hardware, fixtures, fittings and equipment is written down to the residual value and is depreciated in equal 
annual instalments over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The residual values of assets or groups of like assets and their 
useful lives are reviewed annually.
The estimated useful lives of the assets are as follows:
Computer hardware  two years
Fixtures, fittings and equipment four years
(G) Goodwill
Goodwill, representing the excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of the identifiable net assets 
acquired, is capitalised and reviewed annually for impairment. Goodwill is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. 
Negative goodwill is recognised immediately after acquisition in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.

(H) Intangible assets
Research and development
Expenditure on research is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.
Development costs incurred are capitalised when all of the following conditions are satisfied:
• completion of the intangible asset is technically feasible so that it will be available for use or sale;
• the Group intends to complete the intangible asset and use or sell it;
• the Group has the ability to use or sell the intangible asset;
• the intangible asset will generate probable future economic benefits. Among other things, this requires that there is a market 
for the output from the intangible asset or for the intangible asset itself, or, if it is to be used internally, the asset will be used 
in generating such benefits;
• there are adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the intangible asset; and
• the expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during its development can be measured reliably.
Development costs not meeting the criteria for capitalisation are expensed as incurred. Capitalised development costs are 
amortised in equal annual instalments over a period of five years from when the separately identifiable intangible asset is available 
for use in the manner intended by management. Enhancements to a separately identifiable intangible asset that is already available 
for use in the manner originally intended by management are expensed as incurred.
Computer software
The cost of computer software, net of estimated residual value and impairment, is depreciated in equal annual instalments over 
one to three years based on the estimated useful lives of the assets. The residual values of assets or groups of like assets are 
reviewed annually.
Customer relationships
The cost of customer relationships, net of estimated residual value and impairment, is amortised in equal annual instalments 
over nineteen years based on the estimated useful lives of the assets. The residual values of assets or groups of like assets are 
reviewed annually.
Trademarks
The cost of trademarks, net of estimated residual value and impairment, is amortised in equal annual instalments over seven years 
based on the estimated useful lives of the assets. The residual values of assets or groups of like assets are reviewed annually.
(I) Financial instruments
Financial assets and liabilities are recognised on the Group’s balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions of the instrument. The Group’s financial instruments comprise cash, trade receivables, derivative financial instruments 
(forward currency contracts) and trade and other payables. 
Derivative financial instruments
Derivative financial instruments held by the Group comprise forward foreign currency contracts and are recognised at fair value. 
The Group has not applied hedge accounting and the gain or loss on remeasurement to fair value is recognised immediately in 
profit or loss.
Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are initially stated at their fair value plus transaction costs, then subsequently at amortised cost using the 
effective interest method, if applicable, less impairment losses. Provisions against trade receivables are made when there is 
objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due to it in accordance with the original terms of those 
receivables. The amount of the write down is determined as the difference between the assets’ carrying amount and the present 
value of the estimated future cash flows.
Cash and cash equivalents
The Group manages short-term liquidity through the holding of cash and highly liquid interest-bearing deposits. Only deposits that 
are readily convertible into cash with maturities of three months or less from inception, with no penalty of lost interest, are shown 
as cash or cash equivalents.
Trade payables
Financial liabilities are obligations to pay cash or other financial assets and are recognised when the Group becomes a party to the 
contractual provisions of the instrument. All financial liabilities are recorded at amortised cost using the effective interest method, 
with interest related charges recognised as an expense in finance cost in the statement of comprehensive income.
A financial liability is derecognised only when the obligation is extinguished, that is, when the obligation is discharged, cancelled 
or expires.

(J) Foreign exchange
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency of the individual entity at the exchange rate ruling at 
the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated at the rates of exchange ruling at the 
balance sheet date. Non-monetary items that are measured at historical cost in a foreign currency are translated at the exchange 
rate at the date of the transaction. 
Any exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items or on translating monetary items at rates different from 
those at which they were initially recorded are recognised in the profit or loss in the period in which they arise. The assets and 
liabilities in the financial statements of foreign subsidiaries are translated into the Parent Company’s presentation currency at the 
rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. Income and expenses are translated at the actual rate at the date of transaction. 
The exchange differences arising from the retranslation of the opening net investment in subsidiaries are recognised in other 
comprehensive income and taken to the “Foreign exchange reserve” in equity. On disposal of a foreign operation the cumulative 
translation differences (including, if applicable, gains and losses on related hedges) are transferred to profit or loss as part of the 
gain or loss on disposal.
(K) Taxation
Current tax is the tax currently payable based on taxable profit for the year using rates and laws enacted / substantively enacted 
at the reporting date. Current tax credits arise from the UK legislation regarding the treatment of certain qualifying research and 
development costs, allowing for the surrender of tax losses attributable to such costs in return for a tax rebate.
Deferred taxes are calculated using the liability method on temporary differences using rates and laws enacted / substantively enacted 
at the reporting date. Deferred tax is generally provided on the difference between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities 
and their tax bases. However, deferred tax is not provided on the initial recognition of goodwill, nor on the initial recognition of an 
asset or liability unless the related transaction is a business combination or affects tax or accounting profit. Deferred tax on temporary 
differences associated with shares in subsidiaries and joint ventures is not provided if reversal of these temporary differences can 
be controlled by the Group and it is probable that reversal will not occur in the foreseeable future. In addition, tax losses available to 
be carried forward as well as other income tax credits to the Group are assessed for recognition as deferred tax assets.
Deferred tax liabilities are provided in full, with no discounting. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable 
that the underlying deductible temporary differences will be able to be offset against future taxable income. Current and deferred 
tax assets and liabilities are calculated at tax rates that are expected to apply to their respective period of realisation, provided they 
are enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Changes in deferred tax assets or liabilities are recognised as a component of tax expense in the statement of comprehensive 
income, except where they relate to items that are charged or credited directly to other comprehensive income or equity, in 
which case the related deferred tax is also charged or credited directly to other comprehensive income or equity.
(L) Leased assets
Leases of property, plant and equipment where the Group, as lessee, has substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified 
as finance leases. Assets held under finance leases are capitalised and the outstanding future lease obligations are shown in liabilities at 
the fair value of the lease, or if lower at the present value of the lease payments. The finance cost is charged to the profit or loss over the 
lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each period. The property, 
plant and equipment acquired under finance leases is depreciated over the asset’s useful life or over the shorter of the asset’s useful life 
and the lease term if there is no reasonable certainty that the Group will obtain ownership at the end of the lease term.
Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are not transferred to the Group as lessee are regarded 
as operating leases and the payments made under them are charged to the statement of comprehensive income on a straight line 
basis over the lease term. Lease incentives are spread over the term of the lease.
(M) Pension costs
The Group operates a number of defined contribution pension schemes. The assets of the schemes are held separately from 
those of the Group in independently administered funds. The amount charged to profit or loss represents the contributions 
payable to the schemes in respect of the accounting period.
(N) Share options issued to employees
All goods and services received in exchange for the grant of any share-based payment are measured at their fair values. Where employees 
are rewarded using share-based payments, the fair values of employees’ services are determined indirectly by reference to the fair 
value of the instrument granted to the employee. This fair value is appraised at the grant date using a binomial model, taking into 
account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted.
All equity-settled share-based payments are ultimately recognised as an expense in the statement of comprehensive income with 
a corresponding credit to “other reserves”.
If vesting periods or other non-market vesting conditions apply, the expense is allocated over the vesting period, based on the 
best available estimate of the number of share options expected to vest. Estimates are subsequently revised if there is any indication 
that the number of share options expected to vest differs from previous estimates. Any cumulative adjustment prior to vesting is 
recognised in the current period. No adjustment is made to any expense recognised in prior periods if share options ultimately 
exercised are different to that estimated on vesting.
Share options vest no earlier than the second anniversary of issue. The vesting period runs for two to ten years from the date the 
options first vest. There are no other performance conditions other than the vesting period.
Upon exercise of share options the proceeds received net of attributable transaction costs are credited to share capital and, where 
appropriate, share premium.

(O) Impairment testing of goodwill, other intangible assets and property, plant and equipment
For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows 
(cash-generating units). As a result, some assets are tested individually for impairment and some are tested at cash-generating-unit 
level. Goodwill is allocated to those cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from synergies of the related business 
combination and represent the lowest level within the Group at which management monitors the related cash flows.
Goodwill, other individual assets or cash-generating units that include goodwill, other intangible assets with an indefinite useful 
life and those intangible assets not yet available for use are tested for impairment at least annually. All other individual assets or 
cash-generating units are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount 
may not be recoverable.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s or cash-generating unit’s carrying amount exceeds its 
recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value, reflecting market conditions less costs to sell, and value 
in use based on an internal discounted cash flow evaluation. Impairment losses recognised for cash-generating units, to which 
goodwill has been allocated, are credited initially to the carrying amount of goodwill. Any remaining impairment loss is charged 
pro rata to the other assets in the cash-generating unit. With the exception of goodwill, all assets are subsequently reassessed for 
indications that an impairment loss previously recognised may no longer exist.
(P) Key judgements in applying the entity’s accounting policies and goodwill impairment
The Group’s management makes estimates and assumptions regarding the future. Estimates and judgements are continually 
evaluated based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable 
under the circumstances. In the future, actual experience may differ from these estimates and assumptions. The estimates and 
assumptions that have a reasonable risk of causing material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within 
the next financial year are discussed below.
Recognition of revenue
Revenue is recognised according to the accounting policies as stated and is dependent upon the type of income. Where contracts 
include different elements of revenue, those elements are recognised in line with those policies, with fair values attributed to each 
component part.
Judgement is used in the recognition of revenue from long-term projects. 
If work is contracted on a fixed-cost basis, revenue is recognised in line with an estimation of the percentage of completion of the 
project. This estimation is based upon the views of the consultants implementing the projects as to the proportion of the project 
completed and this is supported by data from a time recording system. There is, however, an element of judgement involved that 
can impact the recognition of revenue. This process and individual project recognition is reviewed regularly to ensure that, whilst 
still subjective, the reflection of revenue is the best approximation possible.
Where projects include the upfront delivery of immediately usable software, the element of non-refundable licence revenue is 
recognised on receipt of the software by the customer, with other revenue being recognised in line with the performance of the 
contracted services. The unbundling of this contract revenue requires management to exercise judgement as to the relative fair 
values of the component parts of the contract.
Goodwill impairment
An impairment loss is recognised if the amount by which the asset’s or cash-generating unit’s carrying amount exceeds its 
recoverable amount. To determine the recoverable amount, management estimates expected future cash flows from each 
cash-generating unit and determines a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value of those cash flows. In the 
process of measuring expected future cash flows, management makes assumptions about future operating results. These assumptions 
relate to future events and circumstances. The actual results may vary and may cause significant adjustments to the Group’s assets 
within the next financial year.
In most cases, determining the applicable discount rate involves estimating the appropriate adjustment to market risk and the 
appropriate adjustment to asset-specific risk factors.
Capitalisation of development costs
Development costs are capitalised when all of the criteria (see accounting policy note above) have been met. Employees’ time 
is recorded by product and activity and valued by reference to salaries and directly attributable overheads. Values by product are 
reviewed with reference to future profitability.
Some judgement is used to determine which activities constitute development that should be capitalised. Likewise, some judgement 
is required in assessing when a product has reached its intended use and hence when capitalisation of associated costs should cease. 
In addition, judgement is used to determine future profitability of the products and timing thereof.
Deferred tax assets
The assessment of the probability of future taxable income on which deferred tax assets can be utilised is based on the Group’s 
latest approved budget forecasts, which is adjusted for significant non-taxable income and expense. If a positive forecast of taxable 
income indicates the probable use of a deferred tax asset, especially when it can be utilised without a time limit, that deferred tax 
asset is usually recognised in respect of the period for which future profits can be confidently foreseen. The recognition of deferred 
tax assets that are subject to certain legal or economic limits or uncertainties is assessed individually by management based on the 
specific facts and circumstances.

The Directors have recognised a deferred tax asset in respect of carried forward trading tax losses as, based on current estimates, 
the Group is forecast to make sufficient trading tax profit in the future against which these losses can be offset. The recognised 
deferred tax asset is based on expected profits in the next financial year. The movement in the deferred tax asset in the year is 
recognised in full in the profit for the year; no amount is recognised directly in equity.
The deferred tax asset is expected to crystallise in full in the next financial year.
8. Loss per share
Basic loss per share has been calculated by dividing the loss after taxation by the weighted average number of Ordinary Shares 
in issue during each period.
Potential Ordinary Shares are treated as dilutive, when, and only when, their conversion to Ordinary Shares would decrease 
earnings per share or increase loss per share from continuing operations. As potential Ordinary Shares for 2017 would decrease 
the loss per share, they are therefore not included in diluted earnings per share.

The goodwill at 31 March 2017 and 31 March 2016 relates to the acquisition of STB Systems Limited, since renamed Lombard Risk 
Compliance Limited, which was acquired in 2005 and which constituted the Group’s regulatory compliance business, and to goodwill 
arising in 2011 relating to the acquisition of the regulatory reporting business of SOFGEN. Both these businesses now represent the 
Group’s regulatory compliance business. An impairment review has therefore been carried out on this cash-generating unit.
The cash-generating unit has been assessed by comparing its carrying value to its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the 
higher of fair value, reflecting market conditions less costs to sell, and value in use based on an internal discounted cash flow evaluation.
For the year ended 31 March 2017, the cash-generating unit recoverable amount was determined based on value-in-use calculations, 
which are based on detailed five-year discounted forecast cash flows (using a discount rate of 10%). Cash flows for the regulatory 
compliance business are based on management forecasts, which are approved by the Board and reflect management’s expectations 
of sales growth, operating costs and margin based on past experience as well as the current order book. Management has used a 
five-year period in the cash flow projections as the regulatory compliance business experiences a low level of customer turnover 
and the technology is based on regulations which, whilst subject to periodic amendment, are unlikely to be withdrawn.
Sensitivity to changes in key assumptions: impairment testing is dependent on management’s estimates and judgements, in particular 
in relation to the forecasting of future cash flows and the discount rate applied to the cash flows. Management has concluded that 
no reasonably possible change in the key assumptions would cause the carrying value of goodwill to exceed its recoverable amount.

Capitalised development costs reflect the expenditure attributable to the development of new technology that will provide 
economic benefit in future periods as set out in note 1(H). The Group’s development costs relate to the Group’s products, 
including COLLINE
®
, Oberon and AgileREPORTER
®
. The COLLINE
®
 suite of products is individually significant; the net book value 
at 31 March 2017 is £8,021,000 (2016: £5,107,000). Amortisation is over a five-year period from the time when each separately 
identifiable intangible asset within the suite of products reaches its intended use by management. The remaining amortisation 
period for the COLLINE
®
 suite of products varies accordingly and can be summarised as follows: four to five years – £3.1m; two 
to four years – £3.6m; and up to two years – £1.3m.
An impairment review was performed in relation to the year ended 31 March 2017 and no impairment was required. The assumptions 
used within the value-in-use calculations were based on internal forecasts and discount rates that were consistent with the approach 
adopted in prior years.
Prior year impairment
Four products were identified as impaired following a review of the carrying values of capitalised development costs during the 
year ended 31 March 2016. Two of the products form part of the Group’s Risk Management and Trading software operating segment 
and two form part of the Group’s Regulatory Reporting software operating segment. 
The impairment within the Group’s Risk Management and Trading software operating segment related to one product that has 
been brought to the end of its life and the other related to a module within a larger product that had no forecast revenue traction 
or pipeline. The net carrying value of the above were fully written down, resulting in an impairment charge of £469,000, which 
was included in the Administrative expenses line of the statement of comprehensive income.
The impairment within the Group’s Regulatory Reporting software operating segment related to one product where development work 
has been discontinued and the other related to a product that has been brought to the end of its useful economic life. Both products 
have been fully written down, resulting in a combined impairment charge of £777,000 which was included in the Administrative 
expenses line of the statement of comprehensive income. 
The review was carried out as part of the annual review of the carrying value of all intangible assets. This review involved a 
consideration of the recoverable amount of the asset, being the higher of fair value, reflecting market conditions less costs to sell, 
and value in use based on an internal discounted cash flow evaluation. Where the recoverable amount was considered to be lower 
than the net carrying value, an impairment charge has been applied. The result of the review identified that future cash flows anticipated 
from the aforementioned asset are lower than had previously been expected and hence the asset has been written down to its 
recoverable amount by reference to value-in-use calculations. These calculations were based on discounted cash flows using 
a discount rate of 10%.

The current amounts are short term and the Directors consider that the carrying amount of these trade and other receivables 
approximates to their fair value. The non-current amounts are due within two to five years and are stated at fair value, determined 
by discounting future receipts at the rate of interest that discounts the nominal amounts receivable to the current cash sales price of 
the goods sold. All of the Group’s trade and other receivables have been reviewed for indications of impairment. As at 31 March 2017, 
trade receivables of £4.2m (2016: £3.7m) were fully recoverable. An impairment provision of £0.5m (2016: £0.3m) has been made 
against the invoices of eleven clients (2016: nine clients). In addition, some of the unimpaired trade receivables are past due as of 
the reporting date. Trade receivables past due but not impaired are as follows:

48 Lombard Risk Management plc Annual report and accounts 2017 14. Financial risk management and financial instruments
The Group’s multinational operations expose it to financial risks that include market risk, credit risk, operational risk and liquidity 
risk. The Directors review and agree policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below. These policies have 
remained unchanged from the prior year.
Market risk
Market risk for the Group encompasses all those market risk factors that impact the value of the Group’s assets and liabilities and the 
expected value in base currency of the Group’s revenues and costs. The main risk factors are currency risk, inflation risk and interest 
rate risk. The Group’s policies for managing these are as follows:
I) Currency risk
The Group is exposed to translational and transactional foreign exchange risk as it operates in various currencies, including the 
US Dollar, the Euro, the Chinese Yuan, the Hong Kong Dollar and the Singapore Dollar, which affect the management and levels 
of working capital.
Mitigation: Although, through its own software, the Group has access to sophisticated models for the management of foreign 
exchange risk, there has historically been no use of foreign exchange derivatives to manage this position as part of standard operations 
on the basis that the overall effect on the Group’s income statement has not been large enough to warrant the management, costs 
and margin requirements of this activity. The Group does use natural hedges where the appropriate opportunity arises. In addition, 
the Group prepares working capital forecasts that incorporate sensitivity analysis on exchange rate fluctuations. The Group’s main 
ongoing transactional exposure is to be long of the Euro and the US Dollar through the Euro and the US Dollar income exceeding 
expenditure in those currencies and short of Chinese Yuan through expenditure exceeding income in that currency. In the current 
and prior year the Group has used forward currency contracts to manage cash flows associated with the Chinese Yuan. Forward 
exchange contracts are mainly entered into for significant foreign currency exposures that are not expected to be offset by other 
same-currency transactions.
Foreign currency sensitivity
Foreign currency denominated financial assets and liabilities which expose the Group to currency risk are disclosed below. 
The amounts shown are those reported to key management translated into Sterling at the closing rate:

The following tables illustrate the sensitivity of profit and equity in regards to the Group’s financial assets and financial liabilities 
and the USD / GBP exchange rate, HKD / GBP exchange rate, SGD / GBP exchange rate and CNY / GBP exchange rate “all other 
things being equal”. It assumes a + / - 10% change of each of the exchange rates for the year ended 31 March 2017 (2016: 5%). 
These percentages have been determined based on the average market volatility in exchange rates in the previous twelve months. 
The sensitivity analysis is based on the Group’s foreign currency financial instruments held at each reporting date and also takes 
into account forward exchange contracts that offset effects from changes in currency exchange rates. 
If the GBP had strengthened against the other currencies by 10% (2016: 5%) then this would have had the following impact:

Exposures to foreign exchange rates vary during the year depending on the volume of overseas transactions. Nonetheless, the analysis 
above is considered to be representative of the Group’s exposure to currency risk.

14. Financial risk management and financial instruments continued
Foreign currency sensitivity continued
II) Inflation risk
The Group has exposure to the inflationary effect in countries in which it operates, offset by its ability to raise prices in those 
countries in which it sells. This exposure could affect the Group’s cost base. The Group’s cost base is mainly exposed to the 
inflation rates and changes in payroll taxes in the UK, the US and China. 
Mitigation: The inflation rate for salaries in specialised parts of the financial sector in a financial centre such as London, New York 
or Shanghai is often different from the relevant country’s overall rate of wage inflation. Salary inflation in these markets and internally 
is monitored. No specific hedging of inflation risk has been carried out. 
III) Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk arises primarily on the investment of the Group’s cash balances or on its borrowings and the present value of the 
Group’s receivables. In particular, interest on the Group’s borrowings is affected by LIBOR. 
Mitigation: The Group finances its operations through retained cash reserves and overdraft facilities. The policy of the Group is to 
monitor exposure to interest rate risk and take into account potential movements in interest rates as well as liquidity considerations 
when selecting methods of financing.
Interest rate sensitivity
The Group has limited risk to interest rates (“LIBOR”) changes as borrowings were repaid by 31 March 2015, with the Group now 
having in place a revolving loan agreement as outlined below.
The following table illustrates the sensitivity of profit and equity to a reasonably possible change in interest rates (“LIBOR”) of +1% or 
-1%. These changes are considered to be reasonably possible based on observations of current market conditions. These calculations 
are based on a change in the average market interest rate for each period and the financial instruments held at each reporting date 
that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. All other variables are held constant.

LIBOR +1% -1% +1% -1%
31 March 2017 (722) (689) 29,192 29,225
Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk that a third party might fail to fulfil its performance obligations under the terms of a financial instrument. 
For cash and cash equivalents and trade and other receivables, credit risk represents the carrying amount on the balance sheet.
Mitigation: Most of the Group’s business is with banks, asset management firms and other high quality companies and the Group’s 
bad debt experience over fifteen years has been negligible. The Group consequently has not considered taking out credit insurance 
and is not likely to do so in the foreseeable future. Deposits are placed with high quality banks. The Group closely monitors its 
credit risk.
There has been no use of credit derivatives to mitigate counterparty risk and no such use is contemplated.
The Group’s exposure to credit risk is limited to the carrying amount of financial assets recognised at the balance sheet date, 
as summarised below:

Chinese Yuan forward currency contracts (held for trading) — 17
The Group uses forward foreign exchange contracts to mitigate exchange rate exposure arising from forecast costs in Chinese Yuan. 
The contracts are considered by management to be part of economic hedge arrangements but have not been formally designated 
as hedging instruments, so are treated as held for trading in accordance with IAS 39. The above contract as at 31 March 2016 was 
short term in nature and was settled within twelve months of the 2016 year end. 
50 Lombard Risk Management plc Annual report and accounts 2017 14. Financial risk management and financial instruments continued
Operational risk
The Group has numerous operational risks, ranging from control over bank accounts to its processes for delivering and supporting 
software to a required level of quality and on a timely basis and retention and recruitment of key personnel. A key risk, as for any 
group, is the reputational risk that might arise from poor execution, non-delivery or late delivery of a high profile project or a breach 
of client confidentiality for sensitive data. Further risks may arise where late delivery of software or untimely delivery of related 
services cause a client to miss regulatory deadlines. 
Mitigation: The Group’s Audit Committee regularly reviews controls over certain aspects of the operations of the Group. In addition, 
the Audit Committee maintains an operational risk register. Such a detailed operational risk review is outside the scope of this report 
but the Board attaches importance to maintaining appropriate internal controls to identify and limit these risks; this includes 
integrated project management across all functions of the business. 
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk of loss from not having access to sufficient funds to meet both expected and unexpected cash demands.
Mitigation: The Group seeks to manage financial risk by ensuring that sufficient liquidity is available to meet foreseeable needs 
and by investing cash assets safely as well as profitably. The Group’s working capital report, produced each month, shows forecast 
monthly movements in working capital and cash for the following year. When required the Group has a short-term overdraft facility 
which at the year end has not been used. At 31 March 2017 the Group’s financial liabilities were as follows:
2017

Total 5,107 122 3,103 —
The above contractual maturities reflect the payment obligations which may differ from the carrying value of the liabilities at the 
balance sheet date.
Capital management
The Group’s capital management objectives are to ensure the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern and ultimately to 
provide a return to shareholders. The Group monitors capital in proportion to risk and makes adjustments in light of changes in 
economic conditions and the risk characteristics of the underlying assets. In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure the 
Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt. The Group has 
pursued a progressive dividend policy for a number of years; however, it is the view of the Board that the Group is at a stage in 
its development where its resources can be best utilised within the business to accelerate the substantial opportunities that the 
Group is in a position to exploit in the coming months and years.
The Group had bank borrowings of £nil as at the year end. During the year ended 31 March 2015 the Group entered into a £2.5m revolving 
loan agreement with Barclays Bank Plc at a margin of 3.85%. This agreement was terminated by the Group during the year. The Group has 
put in place post year end a £4.0m revolving loan facility agreement with Barclays Bank Plc at a margin of LIBOR plus 3.5%.
15. Fair value measurement of financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value are required to be grouped into three Levels of a fair value hierarchy. 
The three Levels are defined based on the observability of significant inputs to the measurement, as follows:
–  Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets and liabilities;
–  Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly 
or indirectly; and
–  Level 3: unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.

Measurement of fair value of financial instruments
The Group’s finance team performs valuations of financial items for financial reporting purposes, with valuation techniques selected 
based on the characteristics of each instrument, with the overall objective of maximising the use of market-based information. 
The Group’s foreign currency forward contracts (Level 2) are not traded in active markets, so have been fair valued using observable 
forward exchange rates corresponding to the maturity of the contract. The effects of non-observable inputs are not significant for 
foreign currency forward contracts.

Employee share options charge
The fair value is based on a number of assumptions as stated below.
In accordance with the accounting policy stated under note 1(N), the expected volatility was determined by reference to historical 
data of the Company’s shares over a period of time since its flotation. For the year under review the volatility ranged between 32.5% 
to 43.8%, giving a charge to profit and loss for the year ended 31 March 2017 of £196,332 (2016: £182,745) offset by lapsed share 
option reversal of £15,589, with the same amount being credited to reserves. For details of the volatility used in each individual 
calculation see the table on pages 53 to 54.
52 Lombard Risk Management plc Annual report and accounts 2017 17. Share options continued
Equity-settled share-based payments
The Company has three share option schemes for all employees. Options are granted to employees based on the discretion of the 
Directors to reward performance. The options are settled in equity once exercised. If the options remain unexercised after the end 
of the exercise period, the options expire. Options are forfeited if the employee leaves the Company.
Under the approved and unapproved option schemes the Remuneration Committee can grant options for employees of the Group. 
Options are granted with a fixed exercise price which is typically issued at, or at a premium to, the market price. The contractual life is 
between five and ten years from the date of grant. Options become exercisable after two or three years. The vesting period runs for 
two to eight years from the date the options first vest. There are no other performance conditions other than the vesting period.
The fair values of the options were calculated using a numerical binomial model assuming the inputs shown below:

54 Lombard Risk Management plc Annual report and accounts 2017 19. Pensions
A Group company contributes to a defined contribution pension scheme on behalf of a limited number of employees of that subsidiary. 
The assets of the scheme are administered by trustees in a fund independent of the Company. Under the government’s pension 
auto enrolment legislation, employers must automatically enrol into a “qualifying pension scheme” all qualifying employees not 
already in a pension scheme as well as all new starters. The legislation also requires that those who have opted out must be reviewed 
and enrolled again every three years. Other defined contribution pension schemes to which the Group makes contributions on behalf 
of employees are of the stakeholder variety, again totally independent of the Company.
20. Related party transactions
Other than as stated below, there are no related party transactions in this reporting year or comparative period. 
Key management of the Group are the Directors of the Parent Company. The aggregate dividends paid to Directors in the year 
were £nil (2016: £52,000). Details of the Directors’ remuneration are set out in note 3 and in the Remuneration Committee report.
During the year the Group engaged Broderick Associates Ltd, a company controlled by Sandy Broderick, to provide additional 
consultancy services outside of his role as a Non-executive Director. The services were performed on an arm’s length basis and 
fees totalled £19,200 (2016: £nil). There were no balances owing or owed at the year end (2016: £nil).
21. Controlling personnel related parties
In the opinion of the Directors, there was no ultimate controlling party at 31 March 2017.
22. Dividends
During 2017, Lombard Risk Management plc paid a dividend of £nil (2016: £243,321) to its equity shareholders. This represents 
a payment of nil per share (2016: 0.08p). 
It is the view of the Board that the Group is at a stage in its development where its resources can be best utilised within the 
business to accelerate the substantial opportunities that the Group is in a position to exploit in the coming months and years. 
The Board does not, therefore, propose to pay a dividend.

Company statement of changes in equity
As at 31 March 2017
58 Lombard Risk Management plc Annual report and accounts 2017 1. Authorisation of financial statements and statement of compliance with FRS 101 
The financial statements of Lombard Risk Management plc (the “Company”) for the year ended 31 March 2017 were authorised 
for issue by the Board of Directors on 23 May 2017 and the balance sheet was signed on the Board’s behalf by Alastair Brown. 
Lombard Risk Management plc is incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales. 
These financial statements were prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 “Reduced Disclosure Framework” 
(“FRS 101”) and in accordance with applicable accounting standards. The principal accounting policies adopted by the Company 
are set out in note 2.
The Company’s financial statements are presented in Sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand pounds (£000) 
except when otherwise indicated. 
2. Accounting policies
(A) Basis of preparation
The accounting policies which follow set out those policies which apply in preparing the financial statements for the year ended 
31 March 2017.
The Company has taken advantage of the following disclosure exemptions under FRS 101: 
(a)  the requirements of paragraphs 45(b) and 46–52 of IFRS 2 “Share-based Payment”, because equivalent disclosures are included 
in the consolidated financial statements of the Group in which the entity is consolidated; 
(b)  the requirements of IFRS 7 “Financial Instruments: Disclosures”, because equivalent disclosures are included within the 
consolidated financial statements in which the entity is consolidated; 
(c)  the requirements of paragraphs 91–99 of IFRS 13 “Fair Value Measurement”, because equivalent disclosures are included within 
the consolidated financial statements in which the entity is consolidated;
(d) the requirement in paragraph 38 of IAS 1 “Presentation of Financial Statements” to present comparative information in respect of: 
 (i) paragraph 79(a)(iv) of IAS 1; 
 (ii) paragraph 73(e) of IAS 16 “Property, Plant and Equipment”; and 
 (iii) paragraph 118(e) of IAS 38 “Intangible Assets”;
(e) the requirements of paragraphs 10(d), 10(f), 39(c) and 134–136 of IAS 1 “Presentation of Financial Statements”; 
(f) the requirements of IAS 7 “Statement of Cash Flows”; 
(g) the requirements of paragraphs 30 and 31 of IAS 8 “Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors”; 
(h) the requirements of paragraph 17 of IAS 24 “Related Party Disclosures”; 
(i)  the requirements in IAS 24 “Related Party Disclosures” to disclose related party transactions entered into between two or more 
members of a group, provided that any subsidiary which is a party to the transaction is wholly owned by such a member; 
(j) the requirements of paragraphs 130(f)(ii), 130(f)(iii), 134(d)-134(f) and 135(c)-135(e) of IAS 36 “Impairment of Assets”; and
(k) the requirement to produce a balance sheet at the beginning of the earliest comparative period.
(B) Going concern
The financial statements have, as in previous years, been prepared on a going concern basis. 
In forming an opinion that the Company and the Group is a going concern, the Directors have taken particular note of the trading 
performance in the year ended 31 March 2017. This shows an increase in the Group’s cash balance following the issue of new 
shares in the year.
The Directors have prepared a cash flow forecast for the period to 30 June 2018, which shows that the Company and Group have 
sufficient facilities for ongoing operations. Whilst there will always remain some inherent uncertainty within the aforementioned 
forecasts, the Directors believe the Company and Group have sufficient resources to continue in operational existence for at least 
twelve months from the date of approval of these financial statements.
Accordingly, the Directors continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements for the year ended 
31 March 2017.
(C) Foreign exchange
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency of the individual entity at the exchange rate ruling at 
the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates of exchange 
ruling at the balance sheet date. Non-monetary items that are measured at historical cost in a foreign currency are translated at 
the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
Any exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items or on translating monetary items at rates different from 
those at which they were initially recorded are recognised in the profit or loss in the period in which they arise. 
(D) Taxation
Current tax is the tax currently payable based on taxable profit for the year using rates and laws enacted / substantively enacted 
at the reporting date. 
Deferred taxes are calculated using the liability method on temporary differences using rates and laws enacted / substantively 
enacted at the reporting date. Deferred tax is generally provided on the difference between the carrying amounts of assets and 
liabilities and their tax bases. In addition, tax losses available to be carried forward are assessed for recognition as deferred tax assets.
Notes to the Company financial statements

59 Annual report and accounts 2017 Lombard Risk Management plc
Financial statements Notes to the Company financial statements continued
For the year ended 31 March 2017
2. Accounting policies continued
(D) Taxation continued
Deferred tax liabilities are provided in full, with no discounting. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable 
that the underlying deductible temporary differences will be able to be offset against future taxable income. Current and deferred 
tax assets and liabilities are calculated at tax rates that are expected to apply to their respective period of realisation, provided they 
are enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Changes in deferred tax assets or liabilities are recognised as a component of tax expense in the statement of comprehensive 
income, except where they relate to items that are charged or credited directly to other comprehensive income or equity, in 
which case the related deferred tax is also charged or credited directly to other comprehensive income or equity.
(E) Leased assets
Leases of property, plant and equipment where the Company, as lessee, has substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are 
classified as finance leases. Assets held under finance leases are capitalised and the outstanding future lease obligations are shown in 
liabilities at the fair value of the lease, or if lower at the present value of the lease payments. The finance cost is charged to the profit 
or loss over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each 
period. The property, plant and equipment acquired under finance leases is depreciated over the asset’s useful life or over the shorter 
of the asset’s useful life and the lease term if there is no reasonable certainty that the Company will obtain ownership at the end of 
the lease term.
Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are not transferred to the Company as lessee are 
regarded as operating leases and the payments made under them are charged to the statement of comprehensive income 
on a straight line basis over the lease term. Lease incentives are spread over the term of the lease.
(F) Tangible and intangible fixed assets
Depreciation is provided using the following rates and bases so as to write off the cost or valuation of tangible and intangible fixed 
assets over their useful lives in the Company’s business:
Computer software  50% to 100% straight line
Computer hardware  50% straight line
Fixtures, fittings and equipment 25% straight line
(G) Investments in subsidiaries
Investments in subsidiaries are recorded at cost less any provision for permanent diminution in value.
(H) Share options issued to employees
All goods and services received in exchange for the grant of any share-based payment are measured at their fair values. 
Where employees are rewarded using share-based payments, the fair values of employees’ services are determined indirectly 
by reference to the fair value of the instrument granted to the employee. This fair value is appraised at the grant date using a 
binomial model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted.
All equity-settled share-based payments are ultimately recognised as an expense in the statement of comprehensive income with 
a corresponding credit to “other reserves”.
If vesting periods or other non-market vesting conditions apply, the expense is allocated over the vesting period, based on the 
best available estimate of the number of share options expected to vest. Estimates are subsequently revised if there is any indication 
that the number of share options expected to vest differs from previous estimates. Any cumulative adjustment prior to vesting is 
recognised in the current period. No adjustment is made to any expense recognised in prior periods if share options ultimately 
exercised are different to that estimated on vesting.
Share options vest no earlier than the second anniversary of issue. The vesting period runs for two to ten years from the date the 
options first vest. There are no other performance conditions other than the vesting period.
Upon exercise of share options the proceeds received net of attributable transaction costs are credited to share capital and, where 
appropriate, share premium.
(I) Financial instruments
Financial assets and liabilities are recognised on the Company’s balance sheet when the Company becomes a party to the 
contractual provisions of the instrument. The Company’s financial instruments comprise cash, amounts receivable from Group 
companies, derivative financial instruments (forward currency contracts) and trade and other payables. 
Derivative financial instruments
Derivative financial instruments held by the Company comprise forward foreign currency contracts and are recognised at fair 
value. The Company has not applied hedge accounting and the gain or loss on remeasurement to fair value is recognised 
immediately in profit or loss.
Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are initially stated at their fair value plus transaction costs, then subsequently at amortised cost using the 
effective interest method, if applicable, less impairment losses. Provisions against intra-group receivables are made when there 
is objective evidence that the Company will not be able to collect all amounts due to it in accordance with the original terms of 
those receivables. The amount of the write down is determined as the difference between the assets’ carrying amount and the 
present value of the estimated future cash flows.
60 Lombard Risk Management plc Annual report and accounts 2017 2. Accounting policies continued
(I) Financial instruments continued
Cash and cash equivalents
The Company manages short-term liquidity through the holding of cash and highly liquid interest-bearing deposits. Only deposits 
that are readily convertible into cash with maturities of three months or less from inception, with no penalty of lost interest, are 
shown as cash or cash equivalents.
Trade payables
Financial liabilities are obligations to pay cash or other financial assets and are recognised when the Company becomes a party 
to the contractual provisions of the instrument. All financial liabilities are recorded at amortised cost using the effective interest 
method, with interest related charges recognised as an expense in profit or loss.
A financial liability is derecognised only when the obligation is extinguished, that is, when the obligation is discharged, cancelled or expires.
(I) Judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty 
The Company’s management makes estimates and assumptions regarding the future. Estimates and judgements are continually 
evaluated based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable 
under the circumstances. In the future, actual experience may differ from these estimates and assumptions. The estimates and 
assumptions that have a reasonable risk of causing material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the 
next financial year are discussed below.
Amounts receivable from Group companies – initial recognition and impairment
The accounting for amounts receivable from Group companies under FRS 101 requires expected future cash flows to be 
discounted at a market rate of interest to determine the amount that should be included as a long-term investment rather than as 
a receivable. Determining the expected future cash flows is based on management’s best estimates of the performance of each 
entity and the selection of a suitable market rate of interest as the discount rate in order to calculate the present value of those 
cash flows. In the process of measuring expected future cash flows, management makes assumptions about future operating 
results. These assumptions relate to future events and circumstances. The actual results may vary and may cause significant 
adjustments to the Company’s assets within the next financial year.
When considering the expected future operating results management also considers whether any provisions for impairment are 
required against any of the amounts receivable from Group companies.

The transfer during the year from amounts due from Group companies represents the difference between the book value and

financial performance of the subsidiaries, that no impairment in value has taken place and therefore that no provision is currently 
required. At 31 March 2017 the undertakings in which the Company held more than 20% of the allotted share capital were as follows:
