Investment Case
Overview
Biffa offers an attractive 
investment proposition, 
supported by a sound track 
record of growing the 
underlying profitability 
of the business
1. Diversified and 
integrated operations 
on a national scale
The Group’s operations span a range  
of services, customers and locations 
across the UK, within each stage of the 
waste management value chain – from 
collection services to the treatment, 
processing and disposal of waste and 
recyclable materials, as well as the 
production of energy and sale of 
recovered commodities.
• Due to its diverse operations and operating 
scale, Biffa is not dependent on any single 
sector, service or facility. Its customer  
base extends over a wide spectrum of  
the UK economy, offering resilience and 
mitigating cyclicality. This diversity and 
scale give Biffa a competitive advantage 
when servicing the requirements of  
larger customers and those with more 
complex needs.
• Biffa’s scale enables it to respond to 
changing regulatory requirements and 
customer expectations as to how waste is 
collected, treated and disposed of. It also 
provides benefits in terms of procurement 
of supplies and third-party services.
• Biffa benefits from strategic integration 
across its business activities. The Group’s 
four operating divisions support each other 
by providing control over waste flows and 
security of disposal routes. 3

Overview
2. Operational and 
technical know-how
3. Service delivery, 
reputation and brand
4. Structural  
market growth
Biffa benefits from an experienced 
management team, with extensive 
industry knowledge and specialist skills 
developed over years of operating in an 
increasingly complex waste industry, as 
well as significant technical resources 
and expertise throughout its operations. 
• Biffa’s technical know-how supports  
the full range of its operations, from  
the deployment of the latest on-vehicle 
systems to ensure the most efficient 
collections, through our advanced waste 
sorting and treatment facilities to the 
leading capabilities in gas capture and 
energy generation.
• Operational know-how is at the heart  
of Biffa’s daily operations, ensuring our 
collection, processing and disposal 
operations operate to the highest 
standards of efficiency, safety and 
environmental compliance. 
• Biffa’s management team has developed 
considerable experience in all the stages  
of the Merger & Acquisition (M&A) process. 
Our focus when sourcing acquisition 
targets is to identify and deliver earnings 
accretive in-fill opportunities, leading to 
benefits across our operations, such as 
vehicle utilisation and improvements to 
route density, savings in shared and back 
office services, and other efficiencies.  
With leading market positions in many 
segments, Biffa is well placed to participate 
in sector consolidation and capture future 
synergies from both in-fill and potential 
bolt-on acquisitions. 
Biffa has built a strong reputation for 
service delivery, reflected both in  
key service operating measures and 
customer surveys. 
• A first-class reputation for service delivery 
and experience in expanding and 
developing its services to meet changing 
customer demands has helped Biffa both 
win and retain customers while improving 
operational efficiencies. Biffa has been  
at the centre of the transformation of the 
waste sector over the past two decades, 
successfully introducing new services on  
a national scale to enable its customers  
to increase recycling and energy recovery 
and maximise the diversion of waste 
materials from landfill. 
• The Group’s strong record of service 
delivery, together with its national  
presence and history, has led to the Biffa 
brand becoming one of the most highly 
recognisable in the UK waste industry and 
a key asset for the Group. Strong brand 
recognition plays a significant role in the 
Group’s success, both in helping to attract 
and retain both customers and employees. 
• Biffa’s people are one of its key assets, 
and the Group works to ensure it provides 
a safe and engaging working environment 
for its employees. Strong employee 
engagement and providing a safe work 
environment are important factors in  
both attracting and retaining staff, and  
are particularly significant given Biffa’s 
reliance on a large workforce for the 
delivery of its services.
Industry growth in recent years  
has been driven by population and 
household growth, and increased 
regulation, which has heightened the 
level of complexity in the waste industry. 
These trends are expected to continue 
in the future. Around half of the waste 
generated in the UK comes from 
industrial and commercial waste and 
households – key markets for Biffa.
• In simple terms, more people means  
more waste created. As well as population 
growth, growth in the number of separate 
households equates to more waste and a 
requirement for more collection services.
• Legislation from government agencies 
continues to influence the development  
of the waste industry. Regulation has and 
is expected to continue to drive the need  
for greater segregation of different waste, 
resulting in more complex collection and 
treatment services. This complexity lends 
itself increasingly to operators with scale 
and depth of expertise, as well as access 
to capital. It is our job to make the 
complicated simple for our customers.
• Whether they are businesses or 
households, customers are demanding 
greater quality, convenience, value for 
money and environmental sustainability. 
The industry is maturing into one that 
embraces technology and is more suited 
to well invested scale operators.
It’s our job to make the 
complicated simple for 
our customers” FY17 Net Revenue

Strategic Report
Chairman’s Letter
Dear Shareholder
It is a pleasure to introduce Biffa’s first annual 
report, following the Group’s return to the 
public markets in October 2016. This was 
achieved in uncertain IPO market conditions 
in the aftermath of the widely unexpected 
Brexit result. The confidence shown in Biffa 
by existing and new shareholders alike was 
therefore hugely gratifying.
The Group Executive Team, ably led by CEO 
Ian Wakelin, have transformed the Group’s 
prospects in recent years; a relentless focus 
on customer retention and acquisition, 
operational delivery and safety has resulted  
in consistent improvements in profitability. 
A detailed business plan is in place to 
continue to drive Biffa’s growth over the 
coming years, both organically and through  
a selective pipeline of synergistic acquisitions 
in markets that we thoroughly understand. 
Biffa has an experienced and highly 
respected management team, around 7500 
dedicated employees and now also the 
capital structure is in place to continue to 
evolve the business over the coming years.
Biffa is in a good financial
position, with a robust
balance sheet and 
good cash generation
Steve Marshall – Chairman
Performance
The Group has delivered good full year 
results, which were fully in line with the 
Board’s expectations at the time of the IPO. 
Revenues of £990.4m were 6.8% ahead  
of prior year and Net Revenues
1
 rose 8.3%  
to £898.8m, driven by growth in our I&C, 
Municipal and RR&T divisions. Underlying 
Operating Profit

 rose 18. 1% to £73.8m  
with the Underlying Operating Profit margin 
increasing to 7 .5% from 6.7%, reflecting  
our ongoing focus on the optimisation of 
operations as well as growth. Year end  
Reported Net Debt

 was £246. 1m, and 
therefore below 2.0x Underlying EBITDA

. 
Ian Wakelin’s Chief Executive's Statement  
on pages 10 to 1 1 of this report covers the 
business performance across the Group in 
some detail, and also our strategic priorities.  
The Group’s financial reporting for the  
past year is made more complex by the 
refinancing and exceptional costs associated 
with the IPO. These and certain other items 
resulted in the Group reporting a statutory 
loss after tax of £10.9m (prior year £5. 1m) 
as explained in Michael Topham’s Financial 
Review on pages 24 to 25. As a result of 
these other items, the commentary in the 
Operating Review on pages 20 to 23 has 
utilised underlying performance measures.

Strategic Report
The Board of Biffa considers that health, 
safety and wellbeing is the highest priority 
within the business and is committed to 
keeping our people, our customers and  
the public safe by promoting high standards 
on all our sites, premises, and in all our 
activities detailed in pages 34 and 35 of this 
report. In the year, key safety performance 
measures, including statutory RIDDOR and 
Lost Time Injury (LTI)
1
 continued a long-term 
trend of improvement, equating to a three-fold 
reduction in accident rates over the past  
five years. 
Board, Corporate Governance  
and Employees
Your Board believes that the effective 
stewardship of the Group is enhanced  
by the wealth of experience and range of 
expertise of its members. Together, we are 
committed to building a stronger Group for 
the future and delivering sustainable value  
to our shareholders and improving services  
for customers. 
Our Governance Report sets out and 
explains the processes we have put in place 
to deliver long-term success whilst also 
ensuring that the Group complies with all 
applicable laws and regulations, and meets 
the requirements of our shareholders and
their representative bodies.
Ahead of the IPO in October 2016, we were 
pleased to welcome two new Non-Executive 
Directors to the Board, both of whom bring  
a significant breadth and depth of expertise  
in leading successful and growing listed 
companies. David Martin, who serves as 
Senior Independent Director, was previously 
Chief Executive of Arriva. Ken Lever, who  
was appointed Audit Committee Chair, was 
previously Chief Executive of Xchanging plc 
and Group Finance Director at Tomkins plc. 
My thanks to Ken and David, to other Board 
colleagues and above all to the Group 
Executive Team for their very considerable 
commitment to Biffa over the last 12 months. 
Achieving a successful IPO whilst maintaining 
focus on driving the business forward, is a 
considerable undertaking.
I would also like to thank the Group’s  
loyal employees for their hard work and 
commitment this year. We were pleased  
that employees also directly participated  
in Biffa’s listing through the receipt of free 
shares under the share-award scheme.  
This summer Biffa will also be launching  
a new Sharesave plan, offering  
employees the opportunity to participate  
in Biffa’s success going forward.
Capital Allocation
The Board is committed to ensuring the 
efficient allocation of capital. The Group has  
a strong balance sheet and has strong and 
predictable free cash flow generation. With  
a clear strategy for sustainable profitable 
growth, reinforced by strict controls over 
capital expenditure and good working capital 
management, the Board will continually 
review organic growth opportunities, value 
enhancing acquisitions and shareholder 
returns to ensure it operates with an  
optimal capital structure.
Dividend
As previously stated, the Board has adopted 
a progressive dividend policy that will balance 
shareholder returns with our commitment to 
investing for long-term growth. The Board is 
recommending a maiden dividend of 2.40 
pence per share, to cover the approximately 
five-month period since listing in October 
2016 to the end of the financial year 2017 . 
This is expected to be paid following receipt 
of approval to pay a dividend at our  
Annual General Meeting, (AGM) to be  
held in July 2017 .
In future years, the Group intends to pay 
interim dividends in December in the relevant 
financial year and final dividends in July of the 
following financial year, with the amount being 
paid in an approximate one-third (interim) and 
two-thirds (final) split. The Group intends to 
pay annual dividends based on a targeted 
dividend pay-out ratio of approximately 35% 
of consolidated annual Underlying Profit  
After Tax.
2
Together we will 
create further value 
by delivering 
against the Group’s 
strategic priorities”
Looking Forward
The Board anticipates that the next 12 
months will bring more opportunity and see 
further progress for Biffa. We have a strong 
management team in place and I am 
confident that together we will create further 
value by continuing to deliver against the 
Group’s strategic priorities. I look forward  
to the next stage of our journey.

Chief Executive’s Statement
A Successful Year
The past 12 months has been an exciting 
time for our business, as we transitioned to a 
public company following our IPO in October 
2016. This was a significant milestone for 
Biffa, achieved despite uncertain capital 
markets, and has positioned the Group well 
for the future. It has also proved to be another 
successful year for the business and I am 
delighted to report a continued strong 
performance. The strength of our business 
model combined with the execution of our 
strategy has once again delivered growth. 
Performance Overview
Biffa traded strongly in the year, delivering 
robust Net Revenue growth of 8.3% to 
£898.8m and Underlying Operating Profit 
margin expansion from 6.7% to 7 .5%. The 
Group has delivered good organic growth, 
driven by new business and improved 
operational efficiencies, as well as an 
encouraging contribution from acquisitions. 
The business remains well positioned in all 
its key markets.
• In the I&C division, ongoing pricing discipline 
and a steady flow of customer wins 
delivered Organic Revenue Growth of 5.9%, 
while acquisitions added 3. 1 % to revenues 
for the year. Significant new corporate 
customer contracts included John Lewis 
Partnership, Coca Cola Enterprises and 
Engie, achieved as a result of our national 
presence and integrated service offering. 
The I&C division showed continued margin 
Ian Wakelin – Chief Executive 
progression with operating margins for  
the year increasing to 7 .4% from 5.7%, 
driven by operational efficiencies and 
acquisition synergies.
• The Municipal division has recorded a solid 
performance in a competitive market. We 
have delivered the underlying operating 
margin growth in our municipal contract 
portfolio by improving cost efficiency and 
successfully integrating the recent Cory 
Environmental Municipal Services (Cory) 
acquisition. Another strong customer 
relationship performance, with new 
business wins and 100% contract 
extensions, was also achieved.
• In the RR&T division, infrastructure and 
operational improvements in our recycling 
facilities have continued and together with 
improvements in underlying commodity 
prices supported the 1 14.8% increase in 
Underlying Operating Profit across the 
division. New projects in soil treatment and 
aggregates recycling, as well as upgrades to 
glass processing, have also improved 
operating efficiency and quality. Landfill 
volumes remained strong in the year.
• The Energy division delivered a solid 
operational performance with year-on- 
year revenue stable, despite the expected 
reduction in landfill gas volumes which 
were partially offset by the West Sussex 
MBT plant that completed its first full year 
of operations. Reduced operating costs 
also helped offset the natural decline in 
landfill gas output.

Strategic Report
Thirdly, in recent years, Biffa has focused  
on driving value from its existing operations 
by optimising its systems and processes to 
improve the customer experience and reduce 
operating costs. Examples of these efforts  
in the past year include a series of changes  
in I&C to protect margins from increased 
disposal costs alongside pricing discipline, 
and progress in the implementation of a 
groupwide IT modernisation programme  
with the goal of streamlining sales and 
operating processes and enhancing the 
customer experience. 
Acquisitions 
Acquisitions are an important component  
of our Group’s strategy. We continue to  
see opportunities to improve the utilisation  
of our existing asset base, and in this  
regard, will continue to target acquisition 
opportunities where we see clear value 
creation opportunities through asset 
combinations. I am pleased with the level  
of M&A activity this year and I am confident 
that the skills we have developed and 
resources we have mobilised strengthen  
our ability to successfully identify, acquire  
and importantly fully integrate businesses  
into our existing Group.
Our acquisitions are mentioned on page 25, 
but I want to make special mention of a 
couple. Last summer we were delighted to 
acquire the waste collection business of 
Cory, taking over the provision of commercial 
waste collection and recycling services  
to a customer base of about 6,300 I&C 
customers, as well as four major Local 
Authority contracts. In November, the 
acquisition of Blakeley’s Recycling (Blakeley’s) 
was completed, adding to our I&C business 
over 3,400 customers and a large, modern 
and well positioned facility in the North West 
of England. The acquisitions provide further 
demonstration that Biffa is a natural 
consolidator in the industry.
A Platform for Sustainable Growth
Biffa is distinguished from its peers owing  
to its control of waste. This control of large 
quantities of waste is a tangible asset to our 
business whether that be through securing 
commercially attractive outlets for that waste 
or using the control of waste to underpin the 
development of infrastructure.
We have continued to look at the opportunity 
open to us to invest in the continually growing 
Energy from Waste (EfW) market. There is a 
deficit of EfW infrastructure to deal with the 
residual waste arising in the UK. Biffa is very 
Strong cash management and capital

substantially increased on the prior year once 
significant one off items are excluded. Our 
Reported Net Debt on 24 March 2017 was 
246. 1m, representing a multiple of 1.8 times 
Underlying EBITDA, comfortably within our 
covenant level.
Our Strategy – Grow, Develop, Optimise
Our strategy continues to deliver results and 
therefore remains unchanged. The Group  
is focused on executing a very clear three- 
pronged strategy around growing market 
share, developing services and infrastructure 
and optimising systems and processes and  
has demonstrated success in all these  
areas over the past 12 months. 
Firstly, we have driven organic growth by 
leveraging our competitive advantages of 
scale, technical expertise and service 
excellence to increase the volume of waste 
collected to 3.8m tonnes. We completed  
5 attractive in-fill acquisitions in the 
fragmented UK waste market to deliver 
significant value as discussed in more detail 
below. The waste management industry 
continues to be one which evolves in a way 
that involves an ever increasingly complicated 
supply chain. This lends itself to larger players 
with the capital, knowledge and technical 
abilities to respond quickly to these changes 
and customer needs.
Secondly, the ongoing strategic development 
of Biffa’s processing infrastructure and 
services is strongly evidenced across the 
business. This includes a new RDF plant  
in Southampton, as well as advancements  
in glass processing, soil treatment and 
polymers in the RR&T division. Measured 
expansion of our capabilities enables us to 
capture more of the value inherent in each 
tonne of waste handled.
well positioned to facilitate the development 
of these required facilities through our control 
of large quantities of waste. We are delighted 
to have reached an agreement with the 
leading EFW developer and operator 
Covanta to jointly explore on an exclusive 
basis the development of two much needed 
facilities in the North West and East Midlands. 
We look forward to reporting again in due 
course on the nature and extent of our 
potential involvement in these two projects.
Our People and Community
The success of Biffa throughout the year  
is in large part due to the unstinting effort  
and commitment of our 7 ,500 employees.  
I would like to personally thank all the people  
of Biffa for their hard work and dedication, 
especially through a demanding listing 
process. We have worked hard on our 
employee engagement programmes over 
many years, and I was delighted to see  
our employee engagement score improve, 
once again. 
Biffa’s strategy is supported by sound 
business processes and a commitment to 
fulfilling our responsibilities to our employees 
and the wider community. We again made 
good progress with ensuring the health  
and safety of our employees and all other 
stakeholders. In particular, during the year  
we delivered a 14.3% reduction in reported 
accidents (based on RIDDOR data), and saw 
improvements year on year with all other key 
safety indicators. This performance is the 
direct result of prioritising safety management 
and our efforts will continue in this important 
aspect of our business. We have also 
improved our environmental performance, 
ensuring we continue to fulfil a vital role in 
society in as environmentally a sensitive 
manner as possible.
Prospects
Biffa is a successful business with significant 
potential. The prospects of the Group are 
positive thanks to a competitive market 
position, stable operating environment  
and our ability to grow the business both 
organically and through acquisition. 
We have entered the new financial year  
with continued optimism and at this early 
stage we are confident that the Group will 
deliver results for the year in line with the 
Board’s expectations.

Our Business Model
Our business 
model is integrated
and reflects the
waste supply chain 
Biffa is present across the entire waste 
management supply chain, from collection 
through to end products.
This integrated model gives us the 
opportunity to add value at various stages  
in the chain and to benefit from a range of 
synergies including the sharing of operational 
assets and know-how. For Biffa, the waste 
we collect from our customers becomes  
an essential feedstock for the processing, 
treatment and end products further down the 
waste supply chain. We can invest in these 
areas confident that our integrated model 
gives us control of the waste that is needed 
for the business to succeed.

Collection Processing and Treatment End Products
We organise our Collection offerings into two divisions: 
The I&C customer base includes both large national 
customers, with contracts typically lasting two to five 
years, and smaller local or regional customers typically  
on shorter rolling contracts. Customers are typically 
charged a price that includes the collection, treatment 
and disposal of their waste. 
 
Our Municipal division collects from households on  
behalf of local government under long-term contracts. 
Collection of household waste is the responsibility of local 
governments, many of whom choose to outsource the 
provision of the service to the private sector. Typically 
contracts are awarded for a minimum of seven years and 
payments are made to the contractor based on an 
agreed programme of services. Waste treatment and 
disposal is usually contracted separately from collection 
services by local governments.
The majority of waste streams undergo some form of processing or 
treatment to extract value and minimise the potential environmental 
harm of their disposal. Examples of processing methods include 
separation, reuse, recycling, recovery and biological treatment such 
as composting, anaerobic digestion or incineration. Biffa’s current 
activities include all of these methods with the exception of 
incineration, which is outsourced to a number of partners.
Operators apply the waste hierarchy when choosing treatment 
methods, meaning that where possible waste must first be  
reused, then recycled, or used for energy recovery, before opting  
for landfill disposal. 
Waste that cannot be practically or economically converted into  
end products is sent for landfill disposal.
The objective of processing and treatment activities is to produce 
end products and minimise landfill disposal. A range of end 
products are produced, including:
• Refuse Derived Fuel (RDF) is sent to Energy from Waste 
(EfW) facilities operated by third parties, which utilise it to 
produce heat and electricity
• The AD process breaks down organic waste material into a 
biogas used to generate electricity. It also produces digestate 
products used as agricultural fertiliser
• Biffa’s materials recycling facilities separate and 
decontaminate paper, cardboard, glass, wood, metals and 
plastics that are then sent for reuse as raw materials
• Processed compost materials and treated soil are sold or 
used for land restoration purposes
• Sand and aggregates are produced from refuse sources, 
including council street sweepings, sewage grit and dirty glass
• Biffa captures gas from waste as it decomposes in landfill and 
uses this to generate electricity.

demanded by customers as a result of 
increasing environmental regulation and 
awareness, as well as developing trends and 
customer preferences. Our strategy is split 
into three elements of strategic focus which 
are underpinned by ensuring a safe, efficient 
and engaging working environment for the 
people who ultimately deliver the strategic 
activities. We believe this strategy will deliver 
our targeted growth in shareholder returns.

Our market share
2. DEVELOP 
Services and infrastructure
Biffa has a strong position in many 
segments of the waste services market, 
and seeks to leverage this position to  
gain further market share as a result  
of growth initiatives through (i) further 
disciplined organic growth and  
(ii) additional in-fill acquisitions.
The Group is targeting organic growth 
through strong customer relationships and 
an integrated service offering and intends 
to continue to pursue in-fill acquisitions to 
further strengthen its offering and deliver 
operational efficiencies.
Why these KPIs are important
Being able to offer a range of waste 
collection, processing and disposal 
services enables Biffa to meet the 
increasingly complex waste management 
needs of its customers and regulators, 
giving it competitive advantage. 
Additionally, scale brings operational 
efficiency, ensuring we can provide 
competitively priced services whilst 
generating attractive returns. Importantly, 
as the waste industry continues to  
evolve, Biffa anticipates that its scale and 
integrated platform will enable it to remain  
a key player in industry consolidation in the 
near to medium term.
The UK waste management industry has 
experienced significant change in recent 
years, and Biffa plans to continue developing 
its service offerings and investing in its 
infrastructure and operating facilities.  
The significant volumes of waste that Biffa 
controls through its collection activities  
will support future expansion of waste 
processing and recycling capabilities.
Why these KPIs are important
The UK waste market is expected to continue 
its broader shift away from landfill disposal 
toward recycling and energy recovery. This 
remains an imperative for our customers and 
regulators alike and it represents a key area  
of opportunity for Biffa to deliver profitable 
growth. Biffa will continue to evaluate 
opportunities and is committed to further 
targeted investment in waste processing 
infrastructure and services.

disposing of residual waste, and in recent 
years we have developed a network of 
facilities to prepare waste into Refuse 
Derived Fuel (RDF), from where it is sent 
for incineration in both the UK and other 
European countries. During the year  
we further expanded this operation, and 
increased the amount of RDF sent to  
UK facilities, further growing our margins 
despite the additional costs arising from  
the rise in value of the Euro. 
Market Conditions
UK market waste volumes are relatively  
stable but there is an increasing degree of 
complexity as certain waste types, such as 
food and glass, are increasingly collected  
on a segregated basis. The European EfW 
demand for RDF has remained consistent 
with previous years but we have seen an 
increasing requirement from UK EfW sites  
for industrial and commercial RDF . The 
commercial collections marketplace in  
the UK remains fragmented with a sizeable 
number of smaller scale or regional 
businesses providing the I&C division  
with the opportunity to drive further value  
by building scale through acquisitions and 
delivering ongoing operating efficiencies 
through an increased density of collections.
Strategic objectives
The I&C division remains focused on driving 
organic revenue growth through targeted 
sales across all of our customer channels 
and by making further improvements in our  
levels of customer retention. The I&C network 
has an unparalleled national capability but with 
a regional focus which allows us to compete 
effectively at both national and local levels.
Highlights
• Strong revenue growth (9.0%): organic 
revenue growth (5.9%) and revenue from 
acquired business (3. 1%). 
• Underlying Operating Profit margin growth 
from 5.7% to 7 .4%: Prior year acquisitions 
fully integrated while other cost efficiencies 
and price discipline delivered into the  
base business.
• Current year acquisitions of the 
commercial elements of Cory, Blakeley’s 
and several smaller regional businesses 
are performing well and expected to 
deliver in-line with businesses case  
in the coming year.
• Continued focus on organic and 
acquisition growth, coupled with ongoing 
cost initiatives to drive margin growth in  
a stable market places us well for the  
year ahead.
Performance Summary
The I&C division has continued to see strong 
growth with revenue increasing by 9.0% to 
£522. 1m and Underlying Operating Profit 
increasing by 41.0% to £38.5m. Revenue has 
grown through increased collection volume 
from a number of major new business wins 
such as The John Lewis Partnership, Next 
and FM provider Engie supplemented by the 
full year impact of the acquisitions in 2016 
and the initial contribution from those in 2017 . 
The cost efficiencies arising from integrating 
the acquisitions of the commercial elements 
of Cory (c.£8m revenue annualised), Blakeley’s 
(c.£8m revenue annualised) and three smaller 
local businesses (c.£2m revenue annualised) 
have helped overall Underlying Operating 
Profit increase, but also driven the operating 
margin from 5.7% to 7 .4%. A significant cost 
of the I&C business relates to the cost of

In the year we delivered a number of new

develop these as part of our strategy to 
provide an increasingly broad service offering 
to our customers. We expect our RDF supply 
to mainland Europe to remain constant in the 
year ahead although we expect to increase 
our RDF production for a number of new UK 
EfW plants. To ensure a balanced approach, 
we continue to focus on driving operational

governments in the country for recycling  
and were pleased to see that in 2015/6, 4  
of the top ten performing authorities were 
Biffa customers. 
 
Market Conditions
The market remains competitive but has 
seen increasing stability as a result of local 
governments seeking ever more complex, 
broad ranging outsourced waste contracts. 
This has reduced the number of businesses 
with the credibility and experience required  
to offer the services. Local government 
customers have also recognised the need  
to see a balance of risk and reward with  
the outsource service providers – which  
has seen a move toward gain share 
arrangements in areas such as recycling 
performance and also for service 
improvement initiatives. 
Local government customers continue to face 
financial pressures and whilst collection costs 
rightly do not escape scrutiny, customers are 
often keen to explore opportunities to reduce 
their overall waste management costs by 
investing more in collection services to 
increase recycling levels (such as separate 
food waste collections), thereby reducing 
disposal costs, or by looking at introducing 
optional services – such as garden waste 
collections – that are paid for directly by 
householders. These market changes 
together with the demographic increase in 
household numbers and waste volumes is 
resulting in larger contracts better suited 
toward large scale bidders. 
Highlights
• Strong organic revenue growth and the 
incorporation of the Cory acquisition drove 
statutory revenue forward by 13. 1% year 
on year.
• Cost efficiencies across the contract 
portfolio helped to advance Operating 
Profit by 22.2% thereby increasing 
operating margin from 5.6% to 6.0%.
• The acquisition of the municipal contracts 
of Cory, incorporating the Cornwall, 
Lincoln, Rutland and Tunbridge Wells 
Local Authority collection contracts are 
performing well and expected to deliver 
in-line with our targets in the coming year.
• The recent win and mobilisation of the 
North Somerset contract, together with 
contract extensions and the addition of  
the Cory contracts, gives us good visibility 
of earnings into the future. 
Performance Summary
The Municipal division has continued to see 
strong growth with revenue increasing by
13. 1% to £182.2m and Underlying Operating 
Profit increasing by 22.2% to £1 1.0m. 
Revenue has grown both organically to 
replace expiring contracts and through the 
impact of the Cory acquisition. The cost 
efficiencies arising from integrating the 
acquisition and from some of our newer 
maturing contracts have helped overall 
Underlying Operating Profit increase, but also 
driven the operating margin forward by 0.4% 
to 6.0%. During the year we were delighted  
to secure the North Somerset contract, 
which is expected to add circa £7m to annual 
revenues. The contract was mobilised in 
March 2017 . We are very proud to partner

Strategic objectives
The Municipal division will continue to seek to 
grow revenue profitably through maximising 
customer retention through contract 
extensions and by capitalising on the trend 
toward larger scale contracts. There is scope 
to develop further service offerings direct to 
our residential customers to complement  
our municipal revenue stream. Optimising  
our collection service through deployment  
of technology and increasing segregated 
food collection will allow us to focus on 
reducing costs for our clients whilst 
supporting our margins.

recycled or treated for energy recovery, and 
for which landfill is the only viable means of 
safe disposal. In parallel we continued to 
focus on developing alternative treatments  
for certain materials, including composting, 
aggregates recycling and polymer 
reprocessing. Towards the end of the year  
we completed the £6m expansion of  
our HDPE processing facility, supplying 
recycled food-grade HDPE to the food  
and cosmetics industries.
Market Conditions
The recycling market continues to mature, 
with a greater focus on material quality and 
an acceptance by local government 
customers that they must share some of the 
unavoidable volatility in commodity values. 
Opportunities to invest in processing 
solutions for particular types of waste 
continue to be available for those operators 
who control the supply of waste and have  
the right locations and expertise.
The landfill market is increasingly focused on 
waste that cannot be recycled or treated for 
energy recovery. Landfill sites continue to close 
once they have been filled and are not being 
replaced – leaving the UK with fewer sites. 
Whilst overall tonnages will continue to reduce 
over time, those sites that remain open are 
likely to see increased tonnages and prices.
Strategic objectives
The RR&T division will continue to seek  
to grow revenue through expanding its 
processing infrastructure where the 
appropriate market conditions exist and 
where the risks are understood and can  
be managed.
We have seen a strong 
improvement in our 
MRF’s and the ongoing 
investment in 
infrastructure will 
enable us to further 
broaden our scope 
of services to 
our customers” 
Highlights
• Revenue relatively flat year on year but 
improvements in performance of our 
recycling facilities has driven Underlying 
Operating Profit forward by 1 14.8%.
• Landfill volumes stable in the year; prices 
improved.
• A number of new projects in soil treatment 
and aggregates recycling have begun to 
contribute to earnings.
• In our Materials Recycling Facilities (MRFs), 
the improvements in achieved commodity 
sales were complemented by a more 
balanced risk share with our customers 
and an improvement in facility up-time.
• The expansion of our Polymers business 
was completed towards the end of the 
year and will contribute to earnings in the 
coming year. 
Performance Summary
The RR&T division has seen revenue held 
fairly flat but significant improvement in the 
selling prices achieved in commodity sales 
has contributed to Underlying Operating 
Profit growth of 1 14.8% to £1 1.6m. We have 
continued to evolve the recycling business 
model to one of shared risk, meaning that  
in future earnings volatility in this part of our 
business will be reduced. As at the end of the 
year circa 50% of the commodity price risk 
was held by Biffa. In addition to benefitting 
from improved commodity prices, we 
delivered a number of key operational 
initiatives within our facilities, helping us to 
maximise material yields and throughputs 
whilst reducing processing costs.
Landfill volumes remained strong in the year 
and pricing improved. We continue to focus

The RR&T division focuses on the treatment, 
recycling and disposal of waste. It provides  
a number of treatment services for those 
materials that can be recovered, and landfill 
disposal for those that are not suitable for 
recycling or energy recovery.
There is scope to develop further service 
offerings from our existing landfill facilities, 
including seeking to increase the amount  
of waste that is transported by rail, in order  
to increase the mobility of inactive waste.  
By utilising these rail hubs we can enhance 
the contribution per tonne from the  
landfilled waste.

waste via anaerobic digestion.
certainty. We also benefit from renewables 
incentives, providing a more stable revenue 
stream. Landfill gas will continue to decline 
over time as landfill waste inputs reduce. 
Separate food waste collections have grown 
in recent years and this has supported the 
development of AD facilities. Currently there 
appears to be excess capacity and this has 
resulted in a downward pressure on gate 
fees. Conversely, we see a significant deficit 
in capacity for UK residual waste treatment 
infrastructure and expect this gap to remain, 
creating a potentially attractive investment 
opportunity for operators with the control  
of supply of waste.
Strategic objectives
The Energy Division will continue to seek  
to maximise earnings from its existing 
operations by optimising gas, electrical  
and material yields.
 
Our growing available grid headroom at many 
of our locations offers a potentially valuable 
asset and we will investigate opportunities  
to best utilise it over time.
 
In the AD market, whilst the sector remains 
challenged we remain optimistic of its future 
prospects and will continue to look into  
ways to increase our operating footprint in 
readiness for the stabilisation of the market.
 
We see many opportunities to leverage the 
Group’s control of waste, and specifically look 
forward to working with Covanta to explore 
the feasibility of developing two large scale 
Energy Recovery Facilities with them.
Highlights
• Strong operational performance with  
year on year revenue relatively flat despite 
an expected 7% decline in landfill  
gas production.
• Operating cost reductions minimised the 
profit impact of the natural decline of 
landfill gas output.
• Development of three new food transfer 
stations enabled bulking and transfer of 
food to the Poplars AD plant enhancing 
total contribution. 
• Partnership with Covanta to investigate  
the feasibility of developing large scale  
EfW plants in two UK locations.
Performance Summary
The Energy division has continued to see 
strong operational performance to hold 
revenue relatively flat despite the natural 
decline in gas yields year on year. During  
the year the Energy division satisfactorily 
completed the settlement of all outstanding 
construction items and contract variation 
issues with the MBT plant in West Sussex  
to put the ongoing operation on a sustainable 
footing. Further investment was made in the 
year in developing food transfer stations in  
three strategic locations around the country 
to enable the bulk transfer of food from the  
I&C business into the AD plant at Poplars 
internalising this feedstock and enhancing 
total margin of food processed.
Market Conditions
Energy prices remain uncertain and for that 
reason we forward sell our generation (from 
which we earned revenues of £18.5m in the 
year) for the coming year to provide earnings 
The first full year of 
full scale operation of
the MBT plant for West
Sussex has been a
major achievement 
and we can now focus 
on some exciting 
new initiatives in the

Financial Review
Underlying Group Performance
Revenues grew from £927 .5m to £990.4m 
(6.8%) and Net Revenues grew from 
£830.3m to £898.8m (8.3%).
Underlying EBITDA increased by 12.6% to 
£137 .7m and Underlying Operating Profit 
increased by 18. 1% to £73.8m. Underlying 
Profit Before Tax increased 1 13% to £45. 1m 
and Underlying Profit after tax increased 
251% to £35.8m.
Other Items
Statutory loss after tax for the year was 
£10.9m (prior year £5. 1m).
To enable a better understanding of business 
performance, certain items are excluded 
when calculating the Group’s Underlying 
measures of performance.
The items are more fully explained in Note 3 
to the consolidated financial statements and 
include exceptional items, amortisation of 
acquisition intangibles and material impacts 
from changes in real discount rates on  
landfill provisions and totalled £61.7m (at the 
operating profit level) in the year (prior year 
£18.3m). The principal reasons for the 
significant increase in the current year are  
the exceptional costs associated with Biffa’s 
IPO in October 2016 of £29.0m and the 
impact of the reduction in the real discount 
rate on landfill provisions, which resulted in a 
charge of £17 .9m in the year (prior year £nil). 
A reconciliation from Underlying Profit 
After Tax to statutory loss after tax is set  
out below.
FY 17
(£m)
FY 16

Amortisation of  
acquisition intangibles (14.6) (14.8)
Impact of changes  
in real discount rate  
on landfill provisions (17.9) –
Net interest (2.1) –
Tax 17.1 3.0
Statutory loss after tax (10.9) (5.1)
Finance Charges 
Finance charges (totalling £33.6m on an 
underlying basis) includes interest charges  
on the Group’s borrowings (£29.3m, 
including £7m on finance leases), bond 
premiums (£1.8m) and discount unwind 
on landfill provisions (£2.5m). 
Finance charges reduced by £10.3m in  
the year, £13.0m on an underlying basis.  
The decrease in underlying interest is due  
to a reduction in both the principal amount  
of the Group’s term debt and the post-IPO 
cost of funding.
Taxation
The effective tax rate on Underlying Profits 
was 21%. The effective tax is higher than the 
prevailing rate due to certain charges being 
disallowed for UK corporation tax. 
During the second half of the year, the  
Group successfully concluded negotiations  
with HMRC in respect of certain historic 
expenditures; as a result the Group has 
recognised the associated losses within its 
deferred tax asset as disclosed in note 21  
of the financial statements.
Payments in respect of Corporation Tax in  
the year were nil (prior year nil). The Group’s 
deferred tax balance of £28.5m (prior year 
£16.9m), will serve to reduce future cash tax 
payments in the years to come.
Earnings per Share
The reported earnings per share figures  
are impacted by the Group’s IPO during  
the year. 
Underlying Earnings Per Share decreased  
to 29.3 pence per share. Total loss per share 
reduced to 9.0 pence per share. 
Dividend
The Board has adopted a progressive 
dividend policy aiming to pay circa 35% of 
Underlying Profit After Tax being paid in an 
approximate one third (interim) and two thirds 
(final) split. The Directors recommend a final 
dividend in respect of the period from the IPO 
to 24 March 2017 of 2.40 pence per share. 
This is expected to total £6.0m and, if 
approved, be paid on the 28 July 2017 
to those shareholders on the register 
at 7 July 2017 .

Retirement Benefits
The Group operates a defined benefit 
pension scheme for certain employees  
which closed to future accrual for the majority 
of its members as at 1 November 2013.  
At 24 March 2017 , the net retirement benefit 
surplus was £15.4m compared to a surplus 
of £29.5m at 25 March 2016. Both the assets 
and liabilities of the scheme have increased 
significantly over the period due to the fall in 
gilt yields during the year. The scheme had 
an actuarial deficit of £66.7m as at the time  
of the last valuation in March 2015, and an 
inflation-linked annual payment of £3.85m 
from March 2017 has been agreed with the 
trustee of the scheme. 
Capital Allocation and Return on Capital
The Board is committed to ensuring the 
efficient allocation of capital, with a clear 
strategy for sustainable profitable growth, 
reinforced by strict controls over capital 
expenditure and good working capital 
management. The Board will continually 
review organic growth opportunities, value 
enhancing acquisitions and shareholder 
returns to ensure it operates with an  
optimal capital structure. 
Group Return on Operating Assets 
(measured as Underlying Operating Profit 
divided by average of opening and closing 
Tangible Fixed Assets plus net working 
capital) increased from 24. 1% to 27 .6%. 
Group Return on Capital Employed 
(measured as Statutory Operating profit 
excluding exceptionals and the real discount 
rate changes to landfill provisions divided by 
the average of opening and closing 
shareholder’s equity plus net debt (including 
finance leases), pensions and environmental 
provisions increased from 8.6% to 9.9%. 
Acquisitions
During the year the Group completed five 
acquisitions; the entire issued share capital  
of Cory (on 8 June 2016, for a consideration 
of £13.5m), the trade and assets of Blakeleys, 
a medium sized trade waste collection 
business in North West England (on  
1 November 2016, for a consideration  
of £2.6m) and three small trade waste  
collection businesses for an aggregate 
consideration of £0.7m.

Changes in borrowings and share 
capital on IPO 28.0 –
Movement in financial assets 6.9 (5.0)
Net cash flow (49.6) 16.5 
Prior year Underlying Free Cash Flow included 
receipts of £15m relating to plant acceptance 
(£12m in working capital and £3m in net 
interest paid) at West Sussex and £6.4m from 
the sale of a surplus freehold property, both of 
which were one-off in nature. Working capital 
movement in the year was adversely affected 
by £3.7m relating to the acquisition of Cory, 
which is expected to reverse over time. 
Net cashflow was materially affected by 
cashflows relating to the Group’s IPO, 
including exceptional costs (£31.4m), EVP 
prepayment (£63.6m, see below) and net 
proceeds from refinancing of £28.0m.
Net interest paid increased due to the 
non-recurrence of the aforementioned 
one-off £3m interest income in the prior  
year relating to the West Sussex contract. 
Finance lease principal payments increased 
due to phasing of the Group’s ongoing 
vehicle replacement programme.
Net Debt and Borrowings
Following Biffa’s Listing on the London  
Stock Exchange in October 2016, the 
Group’s Reported Net Debt and ongoing 
financing costs reduced. Reported Net  
Debt as at the year end was £246. 1m or  
1.8 times Underlying EBITDA.

Junior shareholder loan – (120.0)
Total (246.1) (505.9)
The above analysis excludes the liability in 
respect of the EVP Dispute (see below).
Following the refinancing of the Group’s 
debts at IPO (as explained below) the  
Group’s net finance charges were  
reduced to approximately £22m p.a. of  
which approximately £20m p.a. is cash.
Debt facilities and liquidity
As part of the IPO, the Group entered into 
new borrowing facilities with a syndicate of 
banks. These new facilities comprise a fully 
drawn £200m 5 year term loan and a £100m 
Revolving Credit Facility (RCF). At the year 
end, the RCF was undrawn and provides 
significant liquidity for the Group to pursue  
its strategic objectives.
EVP Dispute
The Group is engaged in a dispute with 
HMRC concerning historic landfill tax. 
Arrangements were put in place at the time  
of the Group’s IPO to ensure the tax at risk 
was prepaid to HMRC and that the Group 
was protected against any adverse outcome 
from the dispute. For further details see note

Risk Management
There are well established risk 
management processes with 
engagement from the Board and 
Group Executive Team
The Group operates in an 
industry which has specific 
areas of risk, such as health  
& safety and regulatory 
compliance, which require 
particular focus and the  
Board is aware of the potential 
impacts on the public, our 
employees, our customers 
and the environment which 
could arise from our 
operational activities. 
Risk Appetite
The Group’s tolerance for risk in the area  
of Health & Safety and also regulatory and 
environmental risks, pertinent to our industry 
is low and the Group dedicates significant 
resources and focus to understanding and 
ensuring these risks are monitored and 
managed on a daily basis. Other risks are 
considered and monitored on an ongoing 
basis with controls and mitigating actions 
designed as appropriate to reflect the risk 
appetite in each instance.
Risk Governance
The Board is responsible for the adequacy 
and effectiveness of the Group’s internal 
control system and risk management 
framework, which the Board has delegated 
to the Audit Committee in order to fulfil  
its responsibilities.
The Group Executive Team has been 
delegated ownership and responsibility from 
the Board for operating day-to-day risk 
management and controls. Management 
provides leadership and direction to 
employees to ensure the organisation’s 
overall risk-taking activity is managed in 
relation to the agreed level of risk appetite.
To manage the ongoing effectiveness of risk 
and control, the organisation operates the 
‘Three Lines of Defence’ model as a way  
of explaining the relationship between these 
functions and demonstrating how 
responsibilities are allocated. 27
www.biffa.co.uk Biffa plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Strategic Report
Risk Management Processes
Biffa has an established risk management 
process and risk registers are maintained  
for each operating division and corporate 
function. Whilst the policy and process are 
centrally coordinated and managed, there is 
an established network of ‘Risk Champions’ 
with representation in each division/function 
to lead the ongoing identification and 
updating of key risks. These Risk Champions 
are members of the local senior management 
team and take a lead role within each 
division/function to engage with local 
management and identify, agree and update 
risk information on a regular basis.
The Group Executive Team hold quarterly 
Risk Committee meetings to review the risk 
management process and a summary of 
work undertaken by Internal Audit, who  
have a risk based annual plan of assurance 
reviews. The key risks from each division/
function are reviewed with the detail for each 
risk including:
• Risk description;
• Current assessment based on likelihood 
and impact (assessed over a number of 
risk impacts including financial, regulatory, 
reputation and customer risk);
• Current ongoing controls or mitigation 
activity in place; and
• Planned future mitigation activity with 
owners/completion dates. 
The Audit Committee receives regular updates 
on both the risk management processes in 
place, and also undertakes regular reviews of 
the outputs and the key risks, as identified and 
assessed by management through the risk 
management process.
The risk management systems are intended 
to mitigate and reduce risk to the lowest 
extent possible but cannot eliminate all  
risks to the Group. The risk management 
processes can only provide reasonable and 
not absolute assurance against material 
misstatement or loss.
Viability Statement
In accordance with the revised 2014 UK 
Corporate Governance Code, the Board 
has assessed the viability of the Group 
over a longer period than twelve months 
and has adopted a period of three years for 
the assessment. The Board’s strategic 
planning horizon is five years, however the 
first three years of the plan were selected 
for the testing as most of the Group’s risks 
would have the greater adverse impact 
over this timespan.
 
The Group has a broad range of 
customers and suppliers and operates 
across the breadth of the UK waste 
management chain. It is supported by  
a well-funded balance sheet and has 
significant further committed and undrawn 
liquidity facilities. The Board assessed the 
principal risks to the business as set out  
on the subsequent pages and agreed  
that a number of severe but plausible risk 
scenarios should be explicitly modelled, 
both individually and in combination.  
The Group also identified a number of 
mitigating steps it would take to reduce the 
risk, including cost reduction programmes.
 
The Group’s profitability, liquidity and 
financial headroom have all been assessed 
and incorporated within the risk scenario 
modelling. Based on the consolidated 
financial impact of the sensitivity analysis 
and associated mitigating actions that are 
either in place or could be implemented,  
it has been demonstrated that the Group 
would maintain adequate headroom under 
all of the scenarios modelled.
 
Based on the results of this analysis,  
the Directors confirm that they have a 
reasonable expectation that the Group  
will be able to continue in operation and 
meet its liabilities as they fall due over the 
period of assessment. Strategic Report

Biffa faces risks arising from its 
acquisition strategy. There could  
be potential increased competition 
for acquisition targets or a lack  
of suitable targets. Additionally,

5. Business Continuity Planning,  
IT resilience and Cyber Security
A significant disruption to Biffa’s IT 
systems could potentially have an 
impact on the activity of the Group’s 
customers, such as increased billing 
times, interruptions to collection 
operations and processing logistics, 
and additional costs. Additionally, 
the theft, destruction, loss, 
misappropriation, or release  
of sensitive and/or confidential 
information could result in business 
disruption, negative publicity

6. Economic Environment
Economic conditions in the United 
Kingdom may have an adverse 
impact on Biffa’s operating 
performance, revenues and  
results of operations. The Group  
is exposed to a number of political, 
social and macroeconomic risks 
relating to the United Kingdom’s 
pending exit from the European 
Union (“EU”). Any economic 
weakness that leads to reduced 
volumes of waste and recyclate  
could adversely impact the 
Group’s business. Furthermore, a 
deterioration in macroeconomic 
conditions may also result in 
increased competitive pricing 
pressure and increased  
customer turnover.
Financial • A substantial proportion of our contractual relationships  
with customers give pricing flexibility.
• Biffa has both revenues and costs that are either directly  
or indirectly impacted by the value of Sterling relative to 
other key currencies such as the US dollar or the Euro. This 
provides some degree of offset and natural hedge.
• We enter into forward contracts for the sale of electricity  
and to mitigate short term currency exposures, improving 
earnings visibility in the short term.

in an event of default and the 
acceleration of the Group’s 
obligations to repay those 
borrowings, increased borrowing 
costs or cancellation of certain 
credit facilities.

The Way We Work
Values and Pillars
Each year we develop a Group Balanced 
Business Plan (BBP) which is aligned to our 
business strategy. Each division and function 
develops a BBP and derives individual 
objectives from these plans, giving everyone 
a clear line of sight as to how their targets 
align and contribute to the ‘big picture’.
Our values (Be safe, Be innovative,  
Be customer focused, Be a team player  
and Be accountable) help guide our people  
in their daily activities and support our suite  
of behavioural frameworks. These describe 
the behaviours we encourage all employees  
to adopt in best serving the interests of our 
customers, colleagues and business overall.
Each year we share our strategy and business 
plans with our employees through senior 
leader and manager conferences and 
employee roadshows delivered by our CEO.
Numbers Employed and  
Gender Diversity
Our four operating divisions and  
support functions directly employ  
around 7 ,500 people.
Biffa is committed to providing equal 
opportunities in employment and to avoiding 
unlawful discrimination against employees 
and customers. We value individuality
and are committed to creating a truly 
inclusive workplace. The table below  
shows employment by gender in each  
of the job classifications.
Male Female

Board 6 100% 0 0%
Senior Management 6 75% 2 25%
All employees 6602 88% 878 12%
Talent Management and Development
Biffa recognises the importance of 
developing people, and talent management 
is key to our growth strategy. We focus on 
‘Building pride in Biffa’ and creating a culture 
of accountability through skills training, and 
talent and career development.
During the year, we have reviewed the 
strength of our leadership capability and  
the initiatives we have in place to develop  
a robust pipeline of talent. We have 
implemented a talent management approach 
and introduced bespoke career development 
initiatives including executive and senior 
manager coaching, and targeted leadership 
development programmes. We also have 59 
apprentices in training and will look to double 
this number from April 2017 .
Our ‘B Developed’ core programmes were 
introduced in 2015 for our current and future 
team leaders, team managers and senior 
leaders. We understand the importance of 
nurturing and developing our internal talent, 
particularly in relation to succession planning 
for senior positions within Biffa. To reinforce  
the commitment to nurturing the talent  
of our people, Biffa has delivered over
6,200 training days to employees in 2016. 
More than 940 of these were focused on 
personal capability and management 
development training, which demonstrates 
our focus not just on role based skills but  
also career development and progression.
Reward
We offer a competitive reward package 
which encourages high individual and team 
performance and is instrumental to our ability 
to attract and retain key talent. Employee 
benefits feature salary sacrifice schemes 
(pensions, cycle2work and childcare), 
voluntary benefits (healthcare, high street 
discounts, and holiday, travel and leisure 
discounts) and were further enhanced last 
year when over 6,000 employees became 
shareholders in Biffa following its listing, 
through the issue of free shares. We intend to 
launch a Sharesave Plan in 2017 and give 
employees a further opportunity to participate 
in Biffa’s success going forward.
Health and Wellbeing
In October 2015 Biffa launched an employee 
Health & Wellbeing strategy intended to 
tackle the commonly occurring health issues 
associated with our business sector (e.g. 
musculo-skeletal disorders and mental 
wellbeing). The ‘&me’ programme was 
developed following analysis of our sickness 
absence and accident data before being 
deployed throughout Biffa from November  
of 2016. The &me programme includes an 
Employee Assistance Programme (EAP) 
which gives all employees free and 
confidential access to professional advice on 
a range of issues such as debt, relationship 
problems or other commonly occurring daily 
life stressors 24 hours a day.
Biffa’s Wellbeing Website was launched in 
January 2017 giving all employees free and 
unlimited access to online health information 
including videos, networking groups and  
four-week plans and receiving expert advice 
in tackling physical and mental health issues 
such as diet, exercise, sleep, hydration  
and stress. 
Ethics and Human Rights
Our employee handbook sets out how we 
endeavour to operate and our expectations 
of our people placing particular emphasis on 
honesty, integrity, fairness and respect. Our 
handbook and specific policies of including 
Whistleblowing, Anti-Fraud & Corruption, 
Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking, 
Diversity, Market Abuse Regulations, 
Disciplinary, Grievance, Safeguarding, 
Working Hours, and Harassment and 
Bullying, which aim to guide our people in
‘doing the right thing’ at all times. We consult 
with recognised trade unions over proposed 
changes, employee pay and working 
conditions for parts of our workforce which 
are trade unionised. Through the effective 
operation of the above policies and practices
we respect the human rights of our 
employees and fulfil our legal requirements.
A market leading independent service 
provider operates a confidential whistleblowing 
hotline on our behalf, and any report logged 
is thoroughly investigated and appropriate 
action taken where it is found to be necessary.
Our Anti-Fraud & Corruption policy includes 
guidance to employees on the giving, receiving 
and recording of business gifts and hospitality.
Trade Union Relationships 
Constructive working relationships with  
trade unions at national and local levels  
have enabled an avoidance of any recent 
significant industrial action.

Strategic Report
Having joined the 
business recently this 
was the first time I had 
attended an employee 
roadshow. Being given 
the opportunity to ask 
questions directly to the 
CEO was brilliant and 
the event gave me a 
better understanding 
of the business and 
our goals”
Employee Engagement 
Employee engagement is a key goal for Biffa, 
underpinned by our belief and internal and 
external evidence, that higher engagement  
is associated with better business results.  
We compare our employee engagement 
levels with other business metrics such as 
profitability, health & safety performance  
and customer service. Results of the analysis 
show that more highly engaged teams 
outperform less engaged teams by up  
to 50% in such performance measures. 
In the seven years we have been conducting 
an employee engagement survey, we have 
seen year-on-year increases. In 2016 not only 
did we score our highest ever engagement 
score (55%) but we also saw our largest 
year-on-year increase ever (+9% points).  
This year we improved our engagement 
score for the seventh successive year to 
56%. We have nearly doubled the proportion 
of engaged employees over the past seven 
years, making us Aon Hewitt’s largest 
improver in employee engagement scores  
in the UK over that period. In the last survey, 
75 teams had an engagement score of  
above 62% (placing them in the upper 
quartile range).
Our KPI is to be above the UK average with 
an aim to reach the upper quartile (high 
performance zone) as measured by Aon 
Hewitt’s index.
Currently at 56%, we are 3% points above 
the UK average and within 6% points of 
achieving the upper quartile threshold.
Each year we identify key areas to focus on  
to improve engagement levels going forward 
through a suite of Group and local level action 
plans developed by our network of employee 
engagement champions. Last year we 
focused on enhancements to our Learning 
and Development opportunities. This included 
personal development plans, career pathways 
for employees wanting to develop their career 
and introducing more e-learning modules. 
Other actions included improvements to  
our employee communication channels  
(Biffa News, OBi (our intranet) and employee 
roadshows), the further development of  
our employee benefits package through  
an annual cycle2work scheme, the launch  
of an EAP and the implementation of a  
Health & Wellbeing Strategy. 
The Diamond Awards are our formal annual 
national recognition ceremony where we 
celebrate individuals who have gone the  
extra mile in their contribution to Biffa. We  
are always overwhelmed by the quality of  
the nominations for each of the main award 
categories, which reflect the five pillars of  
our BBP .
Diversity
Biffa is committed to providing equal 
opportunities in employment and to avoiding 
unlawful discrimination in employment and 
against customers. 
Biffa will not discriminate directly or indirectly 
in our recruitment, employment and  
post-employment practices because of  
age, disability, sex, gender reassignment, 
pregnancy, maternity, race (which includes 
colour, nationality and ethnic or national 
origins), sexual orientation, religion or belief,  
or because someone is married or in a  
civil partnership. 
Our diversity policy covers specific 
arrangements for people with  
disabilities including:
• giving full and fair consideration to 
applications for employment by disabled 
persons, having regard to their particular 
aptitudes and abilities;
• continuing the employment of and 
arranging appropriate training for those 
who have become disabled when 
employed by Biffa; and
• otherwise for the training, career 
development and promotion of  
disabled employees
Future Priorities 
Emanating from our HR strategy, our future 
priorities are: 
• to drive productivity and performance 
through effective incentivisation and 
performance management over the short 
to longer term 
• for all of our teams to reach the upper 
quartile employee engagement score as 
measured by the Aon Hewitt index 
• to attract and retain key talent through 
effective talent management, succession 
planning and management development 
• to deliver organisational benefits from the 
use of systems and technology 
• to support business growth and 
development through effective acquisition 
and integration processes

Performance and Success
Each year, Biffa sets itself key safety 
objectives and targets. Typically, 
measurements are recorded to track  
incident frequency rates, incident and  
hazard reporting, lost time and incident 
investigation outcomes.
Over the past five years, Biffa has seen 
accident rates reduce threefold and we 
continue to see improvements year on  
year with all key indicators.
Our own internal communication and 
consultation programme with staff and 
external stakeholders is supported by a 
campaign that is based around the five key  
‘i for Safety’ behaviours that prevent accidents 
and support safer working. ‘i for Safety’ 
encourages personal responsibility and 
understanding of the importance of personal 
behaviour to improve safety. ‘i for Safety’ has 
contributed to the decrease in accident rates, 
the increase in hazard & near miss reporting, 
and increased safety engagement. Our 
annual employee engagement survey 
incorporates health & safety questions.

The Biffa Way
Biffa is committed to operating without 
causing harm or ill health to any employees, 
partners, and members of the public or the 
environment. This commitment extends to 
working with other parties and stakeholders 
for the overall protection of people and the 
environment and also towards achieving 
continuous improvement within Biffa and  
our industry.
The Safety, Health Environment and Quality 
(SHEQ) leadership team, in conjunction with 
the Group Executive Team, develop and 
manage strategies to ensure that all risks are 
identified and suitable controls implemented 
along with adequate supervision, information, 
training, monitoring and regular reviews.  
The SHEQ field teams are aligned to the 
business’s four operating divisions. It consists 
of a divisional SHEQ coach plus several 
regional SHEQ coaches.
All of the SHEQ team have a broad range of 
knowledge, skills, qualifications and experience 
which enable them to train, coach and advise 
the operational teams on how to successfully 
assess health & safety risks and apply suitable 
and sufficient control measures. A number  
of the team are graduates or chartered 
members of the Institution of Occupational 
Safety and Health (“IOSH”). 
There has been significant investment in 
training for the SHEQ Coaches throughout 
the year across a variety of technical 
disciplines that includes fire, machinery 
safety, auditing and noise.
Biffa also seeks external accreditation 
through audit and external benchmarking 
with peer waste management companies. 
The most recent industry benchmarking 
showed that Biffa is performing significantly 
better than the industry average. Biffa is a 
member of the British Safety Council and has 
for the fifth year running undertaken the Five 
Star audit process. This year Biffa achieved 
its highest ever ranking and score of over 
97%, securing the British Safety Council Five 
Star Award in a combined review of H&S  
and Environmental management systems.
Biffa has also maintained accreditation of key 
ISO standards including ISO 9001, ISO14001 
and BS OHSAS 18001 with our external 
accreditor NQA to ensure legal compliance 
and to steer strategies for continual 
improvement.
Health & Safety Risks
Biffa has carried out high level risk profiling 
across all four divisions and has a focused 
programme of risk improvement in each of 
the high risk areas. Biffa also recognises  
the benefits of promoting the use of human 
factor and behaviour improvement 
techniques to significantly reduce the risk. 
Campaigns are in place to address the  
key risks which include:

Strategic Report
Signage has been developed to warn of the 
dangers of sleeping in bins and we educate 
our customers to lock and use their bins in a 
way that prevents access. There is a robust 
partnership in place with StreetLink, a charity 
which supports homeless people. People in 
Bins has received significant media coverage 
both on the local and national television. 
Vehicle and Plant Movements
A key priority at all Biffa facilities is to ensure 
robust pedestrian segregation systems are  
in place. Biffa operates in accordance with  
a “5 metre” rule to ensure that vehicles and 
mobile plant operators stop work if pedestrians 
enter their safe working zone. Equipment 
specifications and operator awareness 
programmes are continually evolving and 
technical solutions are assessed by our internal 
best practice group of specialists to identify 
best techniques. Campaigns to ensure that 
traffic management plans are satisfactory at all 
locations are currently being prepared.
Fire Prevention
Fire is one of the most significant risks  
to our business. Biffa was the first waste 
management company to enter into a 
primary authority agreement with Hampshire 
Fire and Rescue Service. The agreement 
provides us with regular and consistent 
support which is at the forefront of design, 
technology and engineering in fire safety  
and prevention.
Key Campaigns
Biffa has developed a number of key 
campaigns and is beginning to see  
evidence of significant improvements 
nationwide across the waste industry.  
Driving Recklessly on  
Pavements (DRoPS)
Members of the public commonly drive 
recklessly on pavements, endangering our 
collection crews whilst at work. Cars mount 
pavements to overtake our vehicles whilst our 
staff are collecting waste. The impact of 
these interactions can be fatal. The 
development of strong partnerships with 
police services and local authorities is 
growing nationwide to tackle this. High profile 
media campaigns and welcome support 
from a number of leading road safety 
charities have recently led to a number of 
drivers being prosecuted, with our crews 
feeling safer and supported in their work. 
www.biffa.co.uk/news/drops-driving-
recklessly-pavements/
People in Bins
In recent years, social problems have seen  
a surge in the number of homeless people 
using waste containers as a safe place of 
refuge. A number of initiatives have been 
enlisted to help tackle this issue. Front End 
Loading (FEL) vehicles in the I&C Division 
have been fitted with CCTV cameras in both 
the cab and the hopper. Driver re-training has 
been rolled out to ensure bins are checked 
prior to emptying, supported by remote 
compliance monitoring.
Working with Stakeholders
Biffa is a member of the ESA and meets 
regularly with other waste companies to 
discuss similar risks and ongoing concerns 
enabling us to apply best practice.
Biffa has publicly supported the new Health  
& Safety Executive (HSE) strategy “Helping 
Great Britain Work Well” and has provided a 
commitment in support of this HSE strategy 
such as our Driving Recklessly on Pavements 
and People in Bins campaigns detailed 
above. Biffa has also been proactive during 
the consultation process seeking sector 
guidance in the waste and recycling industry. 
A number of our SHEQ coaches take an 
active role in developing industry guidance  
as part of ESA.
Future Strategy
Biffa is committed to aligning future 
improvement objectives with the HSE’s  
new Regulatory Plans 2017 and in  
particular the Waste Industry Sector Plan  
for Health and Safety, focussing on:
• Reducing the risk of people being struck 
by vehicles;
• Reducing the risk of people being injured 
by machinery;
• Improving the understanding of human 
factors in behavioural choices;
• Tackling the main causes of ill health;
• Improving compliance through audit 
programmes;
• Improving contractor control and  
CDM awareness; and
• Improving fire prevention standards  
and emergency planning.

The Way We Work continued
Sustainable Waste Management
Biffa the service provider: sustainable 
waste management services for all
The waste management sector is guided by 
a suite of EU and UK waste management 
and environmental policies and regulations. 
Fundamental to this is managing waste in 
accordance with the “Waste Hierarchy” 
enshrined in UK and EU law.
Greater uptake of resource use concepts 
such as the “Circular Economy” have begun 
to influence customer behaviour, moving 
away from old style linear economy thinking 
of take/make/use/dispose to resource use 
business systems. Biffa’s range of facilities 
and services help provide infrastructure and 
solutions for UK waste producers as well as 
helping those customers meet their own 
sustainable waste management objectives.
Biffa the Commentator: Influencing UK 
waste policy and thought leadership 
Through our environmental external affairs 
activities we keep abreast of the changing 
policy and legal landscape which we help to 
shape it through our engagement. We are an, 
active member of the ESA, as well as other 
trade bodies such as the Environmental 
Industries Commission and the Renewable 
Energy Association. During the last year we 
have been engaged in national debates  
such as Defra’s Waste Crime consultation, 
the EU Circular Economy Package, the 
Environment Agency’s new Fire Prevention 
Plan system and UK Waste Management 
Strategy formulation in relation to Brexit.  
Our acclaimed “Reality Gap” report in 2015, 
which discussed the UK’s shortfall in residual 
waste treatment capacity and the investment 
opportunity that it presents, is shortly to be 
updated and expanded to include analysis  
of the UK’s growing shortage of landfill 
disposal capacity for non-recyclable waste.
Biffa the Operator: Operational  
Environmental Compliance
Strong environmental compliance is essential 
for a waste management business like Biffa. 
2015 saw increased focus in this area to 
continue driving performance forward, 
including production of a new, target-driven, 
three-year environmental compliance and 
training strategy. The approach has received 
praise from the regulator in terms of both  
the methodology and the substantial 
performance improvements it delivered  
after year 1 and again after year 2.
Carbon Management
Biffa recognises that its business operations 
have an impact upon the global carbon 
footprint and we seek to minimise our net 
emissions (CO
2
e) by increasing the carbon 
benefits associated with our business activities 
and reducing the carbon burdens, as set out 
in our Environment & Carbon Management 
Policy. This approach involves focus on 
reducing our energy consumption, continually 
improving how we manage landfill methane 
and increasing the quantities of recyclate 
released to market. It also includes increasing 
the amount of renewable energy that we 
generate directly from biogas and other 
renewable fuels as well as indirectly, through 
our supply of refuse derived fuels to energy 
from waste facilities.
Carbon reporting
At the end of each financial year Biffa 
undertakes a detailed Environmental Data 
capture exercise in order to calculate annual 
sustainability data for greenhouse gas emissions 
reporting (scope 1 , 2 and 3 emissions).
Biffa’s electricity and gas consumption data 
is measured by 99% smart metering and 
input to our online Energy Management 
Platform, which is externally verified for 
reporting under the Carbon Reduction 
Commitment (CRC) each year.
Sustainability data is also captured for a 
number of voluntary accreditation and 
reporting schemes to which Biffa subscribes, 
helping to demonstrate its commitment and 
credentials. These include:
• Carbon Saver Gold accreditation: Biffa has 
maintained this certification over the last  
10 years, in addition to maintaining other 
accreditations including ISO 14001. The 
certification recognises the year-on-year 
reductions in our carbon emissions arising 
from energy use.
• Chartered Institute of Procurement and 
Supply (CIPS) sustainability rating: The 
CIPS Sustainability Index (CSI) is an online 
assessment of Biffa’s environmental, 
economic and social sustainability 
credentials. Biffa first obtained a rating in 
2015/16 and was 31 points ahead of any 
comparable competitor in our sector.
• Logistics Carbon Reduction Scheme 
(LCRS) in association with the Freight 
Transport Association: LCRS is an annual 
report providing vehicle and fuel data to 
demonstrate to the Government that the 
industry is contributing to climate change 
reduction targets without the need for 
regulation or additional taxation.
Carbon Reduction Achievements 
Biffa’s commitment to reducing its carbon 
footprint is also reflected in its transition  
to services which focus on recovering 
recyclables from waste streams and treating 
organic waste via anaerobic digestion (AD)  
to generate renewable energy, or by 
composting, with disposal to landfill being 
minimised to materials which still require  
that solution. 
Over recent years, our achievements include:
• Improvements to energy consumption 
through upgraded metering with  
automatic data supply to our energy 
management system;
• Installation of LED lighting, solar PV  
and intelligent heating systems across  
the business;
• Saving 1,500 tonnes CO
2
 per year  
by converting trucks on three Municipal 
contracts to bio-diesel; and 
• Capturing, on average, 80% of landfill gas 
to generate renewable energy for supply  
to National Grid and also direct to some 
neighbouring businesses. Overall we 
generate around 20 times more electricity 
than we consume.
Greenhouse Gas Emissions
The methodology and systems used to 
produce the greenhouse gas emissions data 
below was subjected to third party inspection 
and audit by RSK Consulting who noted  
that Biffa had an excellent GHG emissions 
reporting system resulting from the quality  
of its existing internal reporting arrangements 
and practice as well as compliance with 
external reporting requirements including  
the CRC Energy Efficiency Scheme and 
Energy Savings Opportunity Scheme.

Strategic Report
Landfill Tax Communities Funding
Biffa operates the Biffa Award scheme, which 
is managed by the Royal Society of Wildlife 
Trusts and is a multi-million pound fund 
providing grants to community and 
environmental projects across the UK. These 
funds are derived from landfill tax credits 
donated by Biffa. Further details of this 
scheme are available on the dedicated website, 
www.biffa-award.org.
Community Volunteering
Biffa’s people also get directly involved in 
helping the local communities we serve.  
In the RR&T division, employees take  
part in community volunteering exercises,  
with over 60 staff involved last year in 
volunteering initiatives around the UK. 
Fundraising
Linked to the Health & Safety initiative to 
tackle the issue of people sleeping in  
bins, 23 volunteers were involved in a “sleep 
out” event, which raised over £3,500 for 
Wycombe Homeless Connection in July 
2016. Our I&C division operates a charitable 
giving scheme through which depots accrue 
funds for every day with no LTI. At the end of 
the year the funds are donated to the charities 
of choice for the local depots, with the total 
amount raised last year being £69,290.
Scope 1 emissions have continued to 
decrease in part due to a reduction in 
methane emissions from our historic  
landfills. The amount of biodegradable  
waste entering landfills is reducing and is 
expected to continue to reduce as more 
biodegradable material is diverted to 
recycling and recovery operations.
 
Scope 2 emissions decreased due to a small 
reduction in electrical usage but also due to
a change in the emissions factor for the UK 
grid. As the UK has moved further from coal 
fired power generation to renewable energy, 
the carbon intensity of the electricity 
generated is reducing.
The number of employees has increased
at the same time as the total emissions has 
decreased, leading to a sharper drop in our 
emissions intensity ratio.

Social and Community Issues
At Biffa’s key operating facilities, we host 
public liaison groups to keep local community 
representatives informed and to help resolve 
any local issues. Similarly, where major new 
developments are planned, Biffa engages 
with the local community and regulators to 
discuss proposals.
Future Targets
As part of our detailed compliance strategy 
for our waste management sites, further 
improvements in compliance scores are 
targeted, along with additional training and 
best practice roll-out, adapted to provide 
bespoke solutions. This will build on the 
success of the previous two years, securing 
Biffa’s position as a well regarded, compliant 
operator, and maintaining good working 
relationships with our regulators.
Future Corporate Sustainability,  
actions include:
• Smart meter upgrades to the existing 
water meter portfolio to improve data 
capture on water usage; 
• Investigation of sub-metering for installed 
energy savings measures such as LED 
lighting banks, in order to help quantify 
CO
2
 and financial savings and to make  
the case for other projects;
• Development of improved carbon 
reporting tools for Biffa customers;
• Maintaining our key sustainability 
performance accreditations; and
• Internal campaigns to help deliver 
environmental improvements, such as 
“Walk to Work” week, “Deliver 1 Thing” 
environment initiative and more user-
friendly electricity and gas usage reports. www.biffa.co.uk

Corporate Governance
Biffa plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Chairman’s Introduction to Governance
Dear Shareholder,
In this, our first Annual Report as a listed public company, we set 
out our commitment to ensuring and maintaining high standards
of corporate governance to enhance performance for the protection 
of our shareholders’ interests. The Board recognises that good 
corporate governance is essential in building a successful business 
that is sustainable for the longer term. The Board is required to 
comply with the principles and provisions of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code (June 2016) (the Code).
As part of the IPO and in compliance with the Code, the Board 
established three formal Board Committees; the Audit, Remuneration 
and Nomination Committees and whose members are either entirely 
or largely comprised of Non-Executive Directors. In addition, the 
Company established and adopted the required governance policies 
such as Whistleblowing, Anti-Bribery & Corruption, Insider Information 
& Disclosure, and Share Dealing restrictions for Directors, senior 
executives and employees together with establishing the division
of responsibilities between Ian Wakelin as Chief Executive Officer 
and myself as Chairman. The Board also approved those matters 
reserved for the decision of the Board and reviewed in conjunction 
with our remuneration consultants, the remuneration packages of our 
Executive Directors to ensure they were in line with current practice 
for a listed company (further details are contained in the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report on pages 55 to 66).

Corporate Governance
Biffa plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
The Corporate Governance Report which follows will provide 
shareholders with an understanding of Biffa’s corporate governance 
arrangements and how they will operate to ensure that we comply 
with all applicable laws and regulations. The Corporate Governance 
Report includes reports from each of the Committee Chairs and 
provides details on key matters addressed by each Committee
since the IPO.
The Board considers that it and the Company have complied with  
the principles of the Code since the IPO, except as detailed in the 
table below. The Board considers that as the Company only listed  
on 20 October 2016, it is not practicable to expect full compliance 
with certain provisions of the Code for the year under review. It further 
recognises that the establishment of corporate governance policies 
and procedures is just the start of an ongoing process and proactive 
commitment to manage Biffa’s governance, diversity and 
effectiveness, so that it continues to reflect best practice 
and meets the changing requirements of the business.
We have made a good start and established sound governance 
procedures to create the internal culture across our four operating 
divisions to enable us to meet the expectations of our shareholders 
and wider stakeholders, and deliver long-term sustainable growth.
Finally, I would like to thank all Board members, past and present, for 
their valuable support and commitment during and since the IPO and 
I look forward to reporting to you next year on how our governance 
arrangements have continued to evolve.

Biffa plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Corporate Governance Report
Roles of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
The roles of Chairman and Chief Executive are separate, clearly 
defined and set out in writing in separate responsibility statements 
which have been approved by the Board.
The Chairman’s primary role is to lead the Board and ensure that 
it operates effectively. In particular, the Chairman sets the Board’s 
agenda and ensures that adequate time is available for discussion  
of all agenda items. Additionally the Board is keen to promote a 
culture of openness and debate facilitating effective contributions 
from the Non-Executive Directors and ensuring constructive 
relations between themselves and the Executive Directors.
The Company does not comply with provision A.3. 1 of the Code 
which requires that the Chairman should, on appointment, meet the 
independence criteria set out in provision B. 1. 1 of the Code. This is 
because, at Admission, the Chairman held shares in the Company 
and its subsidiary Wasteholdco 1 Limited, the latter being the holding 
company of the Group prior to the IPO. Nevertheless, the Board 
considers that notwithstanding the Chairman’s shareholdings, this 
does not influence his independence of character and judgement 
within the meaning of Code provision B. 1. 1, and it does not influence 
him or the Board in the proper discharge of their duties and the 
operation of the business of the Group.
The Chief Executive’s role is the day-to-day running of the Group’s 
businesses and includes the development and implementation of 
strategy, decisions made by the Board and operational management 
of the Group, supported by the Group Executive Team.
Senior Independent Director
David Martin, the Senior Independent Director is an Independent 
Non-Executive Director of the Board. In this role David provides 
advice and additional support and experience to the Chairman and 
performs an intermediary role to other Directors, where necessary. 
He will lead the annual appraisal and review of the Chairman’s
performance and make himself available to shareholders if they  
have any concerns that have not been resolved through the normal 
channels of communication with the Chairman and Chief Executive 
Officer or if it is inappropriate for them to do so.
Board Role & Governance Structure
Role of the Board
The Board is collectively responsible for the long-term success of the 
Group by providing effective leadership and direction to the business 
as a whole. The Board, with due regard to the views of shareholders 
and other stakeholders, sets strategic priorities and oversees their 
delivery in a way that enables sustainable long-term growth, while 
maintaining a balanced approach to risk within a framework of 
effective controls. It is also responsible for corporate governance
and the overall financial performance of the Group. All Directors are 
required to devote sufficient time and demonstrate commitment 
to their role.
In order to retain control of key decisions and ensure there is a clear 
division of responsibilities between the Board and the running of the 
Company business, the Board has a formal schedule of matters 
reserved for its decision. These reserved matters include Group 
strategy and structure, governance and regulatory compliance, 
financial reporting, major capital commitments, major contracts and 
agreements, internal controls, significant remuneration changes, 
stakeholder engagement, and material corporate transactions 
(including acquisitions and disposals). The formal schedule will be 
reviewed annually to ensure it remains fit for purpose and sets the 
parameters for management and expectation for internal controls.
Board Committees and their Role
As part of the IPO the Board established the three Board Committees 
as mentioned above and considered the composition of the Board 
and the Committees at that time. Each Committee has its own terms 
of reference approved by the Board which will be reviewed annually, 
and are available on the Investors section of the Company’s website 
www.biffa.co.uk. Membership of each Committee is determined by 
the Board on the recommendation of the Nomination Committee. 
The membership, roles and duties discharged in the year ended  
24 March 2017 for each Committee is detailed in their respective 
Committee reports at pages 48 to 56.
In addition to the oversight provided by the Board and its 
Committees, the Executive Directors are supported by several 
executive management committees that help them discharge  
their duties. These include reviews with the senior and divisional 
management teams covering areas such as financial management, 
risk management and regulatory compliance. The Board structure 
is set out below. Group Executive Team

Reviews all material RNS announcements

Biffa plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Non-Executive Directors
All the Non-Executive Directors, except Steve Marshall, were deemed 
independent on appointment and continue to be independent in 
accordance with the Code. 
Non-Executive Directors are responsible for bringing an external 
perspective, sound judgement, and objectivity to the Board’s 
deliberations and decision making and to support and constructively 
challenge the Executive Directors using their broad range of 
experience and expertise. They are also required to monitor the 
delivery of the agreed strategy within the risk management framework 
set by the Board and amongst other things review the relationship
with the Company’s External Auditors within the Audit Committee; 
and review the remuneration of, and succession planning for,  
the Board.
More detailed background information on each Non-Executive 
Director can be found in their biographies on pages 42 and 43.  
Each Non-Executive Director is appointed for an initial fixed term  
of three years, subject to annual re-election by shareholders.  
Their appointment term may be renewed by mutual agreement.
It is proposed that the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors  
will meet at least twice a year without the Executive Directors  
being present.
The Group Executive Team 
The Group Executive Team comprises the senior leadership  
team that reports directly to the Chief Executive Officer and has 
management responsibility for the business operations and support 
functions. The Group Executive Team is not a decision-making body, 
but an advisory forum supporting the Executive Directors. The Group 
Executive Team meets monthly and relevant matters are reported to 
Board meetings by the Chief Executive Officer and as appropriate  
the Chief Financial Officer. The Group Executive Team structure 
is set out below.
Election and Re-election of Directors
The Company’s Articles of Association provide that all Directors will 
stand for re-election at least every three years but in order to comply 
with the Code, all of the Directors submit themselves for election 
at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting (AGM).
Board Meetings
Since Admission, the Board has met seven times and consideration 
and decisions taken by the Board have included the following  
key matters:
• Approval of the 2017/18 Annual Budget
• Review of the Company’s Strategy
• Approval of the West Sussex EPC Litigation  
Settlement Agreement
• Approval of the Interim Results and Pre-closing  
Trading announcements.
The Board intends to meet formally at least nine times a year, with ad 
hoc meetings called as and when circumstances require it to meet at 
short notice. The Board has approved an annual calendar of agenda 
items to ensure that all matters are given due consideration and are 
reviewed at the appropriate point in the regulatory and financial cycle. 
It is acknowledged that there may be unforeseen circumstances 
which prevent a Director from attending a meeting. In such a case  
the Director would be expected to review the meeting papers and 
provide comments to the Chairman, Committee Chairman or 
Company Secretary to ensure they are raised at the meeting.
The Directors’ attendance records at those Board and Committee 
meetings held during the year since Admission are shown in  
the table on page 46. Non-Executive Directors are also encouraged  
to communicate directly with senior management between  
Board meetings. www.biffa.co.uk

  Records the Board Meetings and Committee meetings held since Admission.  
Four further Board and Two Remuneration Committee meetings were held as part  
of the IPO process prior to Admission.
No meetings of the Nomination Committee were held during the year under review.
Directors are provided with appropriate documentation approximately 
one week in advance of each Board or Committee meeting during
the year. For each scheduled Board meeting the papers include a 
trading update, financial performance, market update and papers 
where a decision or approval is required. Members of the Group 
Executive Team are invited to attend at least one Board meeting 
each year to present an update on the performance and forward 
focus of their area(s) of responsibility.
Should any Director judge it necessary to seek independent legal 
advice about the performance of their duties with the Company, they 
are entitled to do so at the Company’s expense. Directors also have 
access to the advice and services of the Company Secretary who 
is responsible for advising the Board on all governance matters 
and ensuring that Board procedures are complied with.
Directors’ indemnities and insurance
Directors are ultimately responsible for the operation, performance 
and decision-making of the Company. In doing so, they are exposed 
to potentially significant personal liability under criminal or civil law  
and the UK Listing, Prospectus, Disclosure and Transparency Rules, 
which include penalties including private or public censure, fines  
and/or imprisonment.
In line with normal market practice, the Company believes it is  
in the Company’s best interests to protect Directors from the 
consequences of innocent errors or omissions. It maintains, at the 
Company’s expense, a Directors’ and Officers’ Liability Insurance 
policy. The policy provides indemnity to Group employees that serve 
as directors or officers of any Group company, as recommended 
by the Code, which includes the Board of Directors. This insurance 
policy would not provide cover in the event a director or officer 
knowingly acting fraudulently or dishonestly.
Risk Management
The Board has overall responsibility for monitoring the Group’s 
system of internal control and risk management and for carrying out a 
review of its effectiveness. In discharging that responsibility, the Board 
confirms that it has established the procedures necessary to apply 
the provisions of the Code, including clear operating procedures, lines 
of responsibility and delegated authority. These procedures have
been reviewed by the Board both before and after Admission. 
Business performance is managed closely and the Board and the 
Group Executive Team have established processes, as part of the 
normal good management of the business, to monitor:
• Strategic plan achievement, through a regular review of progress 
towards strategic objectives;
• Monitoring and maintenance of insurance cover to insure all risk 
areas of the Group;
• Financial performance, within a comprehensive financial planning 
and accounting framework, including budgeting and forecasting, 
financial reporting, analysing variances against plan and taking 
appropriate management action;
• Capital investment and asset management performance, with 
detailed appraisal, authorisation and post-investment reviews; and
• The principal risks facing the Group are being identified, evaluated 
and appropriately managed.
The Board is supported by the Audit Committee in reviewing the 
effectiveness of the Group’s risk process and internal control
systems. The system of internal control is designed to manage, rather 
than eliminate, the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and 
it must be recognised that it can only provide reasonable and not 
absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss. A robust 
assessment of the principal risks faced by the Company has been 
undertaken by the Board. 
The Executive Directors, with the assistance of the finance function,  
is responsible for the appropriate maintenance of financial records 
and processes. This ensures that all financial information is relevant, 
reliable, in accordance with the applicable laws and regulations, and 
distributed both internally and externally in a timely manner. A review 
of the consolidation and financial statements is completed by the 
Executive Directors to ensure that the financial position and results  
of the Group are appropriately recorded, circulated to members of 
the Board and published where appropriate. All financial information 
published by the Group is subject to the approval of the Board, on  
the recommendation of the Audit Committee.
Effectiveness
Board Evaluation 
Given the short period between listing and the financial year end,  
and that two of the independent Non-Executive Directors only joined 
the Group shortly prior to the IPO, the Board did not consider it 
appropriate to carry out a performance evaluation process prior to 
publication of the Annual Report. The Company has not therefore 
complied with provisions B.6. 1 or B.6.3 of the Code in the period 
under review. The Board believes that a meaningful evaluation can 
only take place after it has been working together for a reasonable 
time, and therefore an agreed approach to evaluation will be 
developed and implemented before the end of financial year 2018 
and annually thereafter. This will include consideration as to whether it 
is appropriate to carry out an externally facilitated evaluation process. 47

Biffa plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Conflicts of Interest
Under the Company’s Articles of Association, the Board may 
authorise any actual or potential conflicts of interest that may arise 
and to impose limits or conditions as appropriate. Each Director 
provides the Company Secretary with information regarding any 
actual or potential interests that may conflict with those of the 
Company, such as other external directorships, and any other 
potential interests that each thinks may cause a conflict requiring prior 
Board authorisation on an annual basis. If the circumstances of any 
of these disclosed interests change, the relevant Director is required 
to advise the Company Secretary promptly.
Any decision of the Board to authorise a conflict of interest, whether 
matter-specific or situational, is only effective if it is agreed without  
the participation of the conflicted Director(s), and in making such a 
decision, as always, the Directors must act in a way they consider
in good faith will be most likely to promote the success of the 
Company. The Company has established a procedure whereby actual 
or potential conflicts of interest are registered, reviewed annually by the 
Board to ensure the authorisation granted to the Directors, and any 
conditions attached to them, are appropriate for the relevant matter to 
remain authorised and for the appropriate authorisation to be sought 
prior to the appointment of any new Director or if a new conflict arises.
The register setting out each Director’s current disclosures was 
created at the time of the IPO. Since that date the only registered 
potential conflict, namely Michael Averill’s non-executive directorship 
of the Van Gansewinkel Groep in the Netherlands, has been removed 
from the register following his resignation from that company on  
1 March 2017 .
Directors’ Induction, Training and Development
In preparation for listing, all Directors received an induction briefing 
from the Company’s legal adviser, Linklaters LLP , on their duties 
and responsibilities as Directors of a publicly quoted company. The 
induction process also comprised a programme which included 
meetings with all Directors, members of the Group Executive Team , 
the Company Secretary and heads of functions. Key site visits were 
also scheduled and undertaken to meet business management and 
develop greater commercial awareness of the Group. On acceptance 
of their appointment the Directors were provided with a comprehensive 
suite of Group materials, which comprised: Group strategic plan, 
financial information and trading updates, risk registers, governance 
and regulatory guidance and documents, Group policies, Group and 
business structure, statutory documents of the Company, and Board 
and Committee papers, minutes and other reference documents 
covering the prior 12-month period.
A full, formal and tailored induction programme will be developed for 
any new Directors joining the Board. 
As in the case of Board evaluation, given the short period between 
listing and the financial year end, the Chairman did not consider  
it appropriate to review and agree with each Director their training  
and development needs. The Company has not therefore complied 
with provisions B.4.2 of the Code in the period under review.  
The Chairman, with the support of the Company Secretary,  
will ensure that the development and ongoing training needs of 
individual Directors and the Board are reviewed and agreed at least 
annually. The Company Secretary will ensure that the Board is briefed 
on forthcoming legal and regulatory developments, as well as 
developments in corporate governance best practice.
Shareholder Engagement
Investor Relations
The Board is committed to maintaining good communications with 
shareholders. As part of its ongoing investor relations programme,  
the Company aims to maintain an active dialogue with its shareholders, 
including those institutional investors which monitor the Company’s 
governance policies and procedures and to discuss issues relating to 
the performance of the Group including strategy and new developments.
The Board places importance on communication with all 
shareholders and encourages them to arrange to speak to or meet 
the Chairman and Directors in the coming 12 months as appropriate. 
Arrangements can be made for major shareholders to meet with  
the Chairman, the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer 
and the Non-Executive Directors as required. The Company’s 
Investor Relations team has organised an ongoing programme of 
presentations, dialogue and meetings between the Chief Executive 
Officer and Chief Financial Officer and institutional investors, fund 
managers and analysts. Brokers’ reports and investors’ feedback  
are circulated regularly to the Board, who discuss these and any 
other key matters relating to investors. In each case the Board,  
in conjunction with advisers where appropriate, determines the 
strategy to address significant issues raised.
Annual General Meeting 
The Company’s first AGM will be held at 1 1am on Wednesday
19 July 2017 at the offices of Linklaters, 1 Silk Street, London
EC2Y 8HQ. Details of the business to be proposed at the meeting
are contained in the Notice of AGM which will be sent to shareholders 
at least 20 working days prior to the date of the meeting. To 
encourage shareholders to participate in the AGM process, the 
Company will offer electronic proxy voting through both our registrar’s 
website and, for CREST members, the CREST service. Voting at  
the AGM will be conducted by way of a poll and the results will be 
announced through the Regulatory News Service and made available 
on the Company’s website.
The Chairman, and the Chairs of the Audit and Remuneration 
Committees, will be present at the AGM which provides a valuable 
opportunity for shareholders to engage with the Board and receive  
an update on the performance and strategy of the Company and  
ask questions during the meeting. Shareholders will also have the 
opportunity to meet the Company Secretary, senior managers and 
the Auditors. www.biffa.co.uk

Audit Committee Report
Dear Shareholder,
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present the report of the  
Audit Committee for the period ended 24 March 2017 . It describes  
the Committee’s responsibilities and key activities since the IPO.
The Audit Committee was formally established by the
Board in advance of the IPO and I was appointed its Chairman  
when I became a Director of the Company on 28 September 2016. 
Michael Averill and David Martin joined me as the other members
of the Committee. The Board is satisfied that by virtue of my 
qualification as a Chartered Accountant, my executive background  
in finance roles, and my experience as an audit committee chair at 
Vertu Motors and Blue Prism, I have recent and relevant financial 
experience as recommended under provision C.3. 1 of the Code.
The Committee’s role is to assist the Board with the discharge of its 
responsibilities in relation to internal and external audits and financial 
controls, including reviewing the Group’s annual financial statements, 
considering the scope of the annual audit and the extent of the 
non-audit work undertaken by external auditors, advising on the
appointment of external auditors and reviewing the effectiveness  
of the systems and processes for the management of risk and the 
effective operation of the financial and internal control systems in 
place within the Group.
Ken Lever – Chairman of the Audit Committee
The Committee has a key role to 
ensure the integrity of the Company’s 
financial reporting, the management 
of risk and the effective operation of 
the financial and internal control process
The committee’s terms of reference can be found at 
www.biffa.co.uk/investor–centre/company–information/corporate–
governance/
Although the Committee did not meet formally before the IPO it has 
since met on three occasions, principally to discuss matters in relation 
to the audit, the External Auditor’s fees, the audit programme for 
2017-2018 and the Annual Report and financial statements. A 
summary of the matters that were discussed is set out below, 
the key highlights being:
 – Risk Management and Internal Control – the Group’s systems of 
risk management and internal control were reviewed extensively  
as part of the pre-IPO process, and it was concluded that the 
systems were satisfactory and work effectively. This review was 
updated prior to the financial year end. Going forward we will 
continue to work with the management to ensure that these 
systems are reviewed and developed as appropriate.
 – External Audit – the Committee has discussed and approved a 
policy for the provision of non-audit services by the auditor, and  
it will ensure that the policy, which is described in the following 
report, is implemented and operated effectively in accordance  
with the requirements of the new EU Statutory Audit regime.
 – Annual Report – the Committee has supported the Board to 
ensure that the Annual Report is fair, balanced and understandable 
and that the statements in respect of viability and going concern 
have been appropriately considered.
The Committee look forward to working with the management team 
and the Board in the forthcoming financial year to ensure that our 
governance and control processes operate effectively to support  
the delivery of the Group’s strategy.

Membership
The current members of the Audit Committee are the three 
independent Non-Executive Directors. The Committee members 
have been selected to provide the wide range of financial and 
commercial expertise necessary to fulfil the Committee’s duties  
and responsibilities, and the Board considers the Committee 
members’ financial experience to be recent and relevant for the 
purposes of the Code. Two of the three Committee members  
are qualified accountants.
The Chief Financial Officer, Head of Internal Audit and the External 
Audit Partner attend and report to each Audit Committee meeting. 
Responsibilities – to monitor and review:
How the Committee discharged its responsibilities  
since Admission
The integrity of the financial statements and related formal 
announcements, and the significant financial reporting issues  
and judgements which they contain.
• Reviewed the financial statements and announcements relating  
to the financial performance and governance of the Group at  
year end and half year end and the Pre-Close Trading Statement.
• Considered the material areas in which significant judgements were 
applied based on reports from both the Group’s management and 
the External Auditors. Further information is provided in the Financial 
Reporting at pages 91. 
The Company risk management systems and internal  
control processes.
• Reviewed the adequacy and effectiveness of the Group’s risk 
management systems and control processes,  
through an evaluation of:
• the risk and assurance plans;
• Internal Audit reports and risk assessments.
The effectiveness of the Company’s Internal Audit function  
and its activities.

Non-Audit Services section of this report.
The adequacy and security of the Group’s arrangements for its 
employees and contractors to raise concerns, in confidence, about 
possible wrongdoing in financial reporting or other matters.
To date the Committee has reviewed the arrangements in place to 
enable employees to raise concerns (Whistleblowing). The service is 
supported by an external specialist and an analysis of matters raised 
during the year was undertaken as part of the review of the 
Whistleblowing process. 
Other duties of the Audit Committee
Annually reviewing its terms of reference. As the terms of reference were adopted by the Board on the  
28 September 2016 it was considered premature to undertake  
a further review.
Assessing potential conflicts of interest of the Directors on  
behalf of the Board.
As disclosed at page 47 of the Corporate Governance Report,  
during the IPO process a potential conflict of interest was registered
in respect of Michael Averill who at that time was a non-executive 
director of Van Gansewinkel Groep, a competitor waste management 
company. Michael Averill has since resigned from that company  
on 1 March 2017 . 
As requested by the Board, providing advice on whether the Annual 
Report and accounts are fair, balanced and understandable.
Further information on the Committee’s role in providing advice  
on whether the Annual Report and accounts are fair, balanced

section of this report.
The Company Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer also 
regularly attend Committee meetings by invitation.
Role of the Committee
The role of the Committee is to monitor and review the Group’s 
financial reporting arrangements, the effectiveness of its internal 
controls and risk management framework, the internal and external 
audit processes and the Group’s whistleblowing procedures, 
including oversight of the internal and external audit process.
The Committee reports to the Board on its activities and makes 
recommendations, all of which have been accepted during the  
 period under review.  www.biffa.co.uk

Audit Committee Report continued
Financial Reporting and Significant Financial Judgements
The Committee assesses whether suitable accounting policies  
have been adopted and whether the Company has made appropriate 
underlying assumptions, estimates and judgements. The Committee 
reviewed accounting papers prepared by the Company which 
provide details on significant financial reporting judgements. 
Further details can be found in the Financial Reporting on page 91.
Issues Significant Financial Judgements and how they were addressed
Landfill Accounting The Committee reviewed the valuation of the landfill provisions and assets, the level of such landfill 
provision and the extent of the depreciation of such assets, it being noted that the responsibility for  
a landfill site extends beyond the cessation of land filling operations until the Group has fulfilled its 
aftercare and restoration obligations which is estimated to be up to 60 years post closure of the site.
The Committee considered the Group Landfill Capital and Provisioning Policy which includes the basis  
for cost, void space, waste compaction ratio and gas generation estimates, and the associated 
accounting methodology. 
The Committee determined that with the combination of external third party reports and guidance and  
the Group’s experience to provide for these estimated costs that the current landfill accounting treatment 
and value and level of provisions was appropriate.
Retirement Benefit Obligations The Group operates a defined benefit pension scheme known as the Biffa Pension Scheme (BPS)  
which was closed to new joiners and to future accrual on 31 October 2013. There are currently  
80 active members of the BPS who have protected defined benefit accrual either by virtue of 
contract location or legislation. The BPS was in a pension surplus of £15.4m as at 24 March 2017 .
The Committee considered reports from management and the External Auditors in relation to the 
valuation of the defined benefit pension scheme and reviewed the key actuarial assumptions used  
in calculating the defined benefit pension liabilities, especially in relation to discount rates, inflation  
rates, salary growth, rate of pension increase and mortality/life expectancy and concluded that  
the assumptions used were appropriate and were supported by independent actuarial experts. Details  
of the key assumptions used are set out in note 28 on page of the consolidated financial statements.
The Committee also reviewed reports by the External Auditors on the 
full year and half year results which highlight any issues with respect  
to the work undertaken on the audit.
The Committee reviewed financial issues through discussion with the 
Executive Directors and the External Auditors. The significant financial 
judgements considered in relation to the accounts are detailed in the 
table below: 51
www.biffa.co.uk
Corporate Governance
Biffa plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Issues Significant Financial Judgements and how they were addressed
Asset Impairment Review The Group carries different classes of intangible assets on its balance sheet, which include goodwill,  
the Biffa brand, customer contracts, and Project Fusion development costs. The Group’s assessment 
of the carrying value of goodwill and the other intangible assets is dependent on the disaggregation of 
cash generating units (CGU’s) and assumptions of future cash flows, including both short and long term 
growth rates. The Group performed its last asset impairment review between January and February 2017 
with the assistance of an external third party.
The Committee reviewed and discussed management’s report on the impairment review and considered 
the External Auditors’ testing thereof.
After due consideration, the Committee concluded that it was satisfied with the assumptions and 
judgements applied in relation to such testing and agreed that there was no recognisable indicators  
of impairment. Details of the key assumptions and judgements used are set out in note 12 to the 
consolidated financial statements.
Acquisitions For Business Combinations, the Group has a process for the identification of the fair values of the assets 
acquired and liabilities assumed including separate identification of intangible assets by undertaking a 
purchase price allocation exercise and using, if required, external valuation specialists.
The Committee reviewed this process and the methodology and assumptions used to value the assets 
and liabilities of the acquisitions completed in 2016/2017 . The Committee concluded that it was satisfied 
with management’s valuations of these assets and liabilities. 
EVP Accounting The Group is currently in dispute with HMRC in connection with the payment of Landfill Tax (LFT)  
in respect of certain materials deposited at landfill sites (Engineered into the Void, (EVP)), (see note 32  
to the consolidated financial statements of this Report for further details). A pre-payment was made to 
HMRC of £62m shortly after the IPO. The total estimated liability including an interest charge of £10m,  
is £72m. Management continues to dispute HMRC’s LFT assessment and the outcome of the tribunal 
hearing held in late November 2016 is still awaited. 
The Committee reviewed the external professional advice received at the time of the IPO and the 
accounting treatment in respect of both the EVP prepayment to HMRC and the instruments put in  
place to pay recovered funds to pre-IPO shareholders during the IPO process and its treatment whether 
or not the outcome of the tribunal hearing was in favour of the Company. The Committee determined 
that the respective assets and liabilities recorded were appropriate.  www.biffa.co.uk

Audit Committee Report continued
Risk Management
The Board has overall responsibility for setting the Group’s risk 
appetite and ensuring that there is an effective risk management 
framework. The Board has, however, delegated responsibility for 
review of the risk management methodology and effectiveness of 
internal controls to the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee has 
reviewed the work done by management on the assessment of the 
Company’s principal risks, including their impact on the prospects  
of the Company. The Company’s system of internal controls, along 
with its design and operating effectiveness, is subject to review by  
the Audit Committee, through reports received from the Company,  
along with those from both Internal and External Auditors. Any  
control deficiencies identified will be followed up with action plans 
tracked by the Committee. 
The Group’s principal risk management systems comprise: risk 
registers and reviews; and Risk Management Committee oversight. 
Further details of the Group’s risk management systems and controls, 
principal risks and statement following the viability assessment are 
included in the Strategic Report on pages 28 to 31. Further details 
of risk management and internal control are set out on page 46 of 
the Corporate Governance Report.
The Audit Committee intends to keep the risk management and 
internal control systems under review and to support the Board in 
carrying out an annual review of their effectiveness. Policies and 
procedures, including clearly defined levels of delegated authority, 
have been communicated across the Group. Internal controls have 
been implemented in respect of the key operational and financial 
processes which exist within the business.
The Audit Committee has not identified, nor been advised of,  
any failings or weaknesses in the internal control systems or risk 
management processes that are determined to be significant.
Internal Audit
The Company has an Internal Audit function which focuses on 
performing a programme of reviews of processes and controls 
implemented across the Group. Internal Audit findings are presented 
to the relevant Head of a Group division or Group function and the 
Chief Financial Officer for review. 
The Audit Committee is responsible for overseeing the work of the 
Internal Audit function. The Committee reviews the effectiveness of 
the Internal Audit function and reviews and approves the scope of the 
Internal Audit annual plan and assesses the quality of Internal Audit 
reports, along with management’s actions relating to findings and 
the closure of recommended actions. The Audit Committee will also 
consider any stakeholder feedback on the quality of Internal Audit’s 
work. In order to safeguard the independence of the Internal Audit 
functions, the Head of Internal Audit is given the opportunity to meet 
privately with the Audit Committee without any Executive Directors 
or other members of management present.
External Auditors
Deloitte LLP was appointed as the External Auditors of the Company 
on 23 August 2016. The current lead audit Partner, Makhan Chahal 
was appointed in August 2016. In accordance with the Code and EU 
legislation, the Committee must put its audit arrangements out to 
tender no later than 2026. The Committee presently intends to keep 
the Group’s audit arrangements under regular review, taking into 
account the annual performance review that will be conducted by the 
Committee. There are no contractual restrictions on the Company’s 
selection of its External Auditors.
The Audit Committee is responsible for overseeing the Group’s 
relationship with the External Auditors. The Chief Financial Officer  
and his team monitors the External Auditors’ performance, behaviour 
and effectiveness during the exercise of their duties, and this informs 
the Audit Committee’s decision whether to recommend to the Board 
their reappointment (subject to shareholder approval) or otherwise on 
an annual basis. The Committee recommended to the Board, which 
in turn is recommending to shareholders, that Deloitte LLP be 
re-appointed as the Company’s Auditors at the forthcoming AGM.
The Audit Committee also assesses the effectiveness, independence 
and objectivity of the External Auditors process by, for example:
• considering all key external auditor plans and reports;
• having regular engagement with the External Auditors during 
Committee meetings and ad hoc meetings (when required), 
including meetings without any member of management  
being present; 
• the Committee Chair having discussions with the Senior Statutory 
Auditor ahead of each Committee meeting; and
• at the end of the financial year, each Committee member shall 
complete an external audit process effectiveness review 
questionnaire. 53
www.biffa.co.uk
Corporate Governance
Biffa plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Non-Audit Services
To preserve objectivity and independence, the External Auditors  
are not asked to provide consulting services unless this is in the  
best interests of the Company, in accordance with Biffa’s non-audit 
services policy. This policy requires Audit Committee approval for  
any non-audit services the value of which exceeds £50,000. The 
engagement of the External Auditors to provide any non-audit 
services for more than £10,000 must be approved by the Chief 
Financial Officer in advance. The policy recognises that certain 
non-audit services may not be carried out by the External Auditors  
(in accordance with the EU Statutory Audit regime).
During the IPO process, non-audit services were provided by Deloitte 
LLP on the basis of the former non-audit service arrangement which 
required the former parent company’s approval to the appointment 
of Deloitte LLP for this work on the basis of their prior in-depth 
knowledge of the business. As a result, given the work on the IPO, 
the fees paid to Deloitte LLP in respect of non-audit services during 
the year totalled £1.7m, representing 71% of the total audit fee. 
Deloitte LLP has not been engaged to provide any non-audit 
services to the Company or the Group since the IPO.
Whistleblowing
The Group adopted procedures at least 12 months prior to 
Admission by which all employees may, in confidence, report any 
concerns. The Whistleblowing Policy sets out the ethical standards 
expected of all persons to whom the policy legally applies and 
includes the procedure for raising concerns in strict confidence. 
Employees are encouraged in the first instance to talk to their line 
manager or contact the central HR team directly. However,  
in circumstances when this is not possible or inappropriate the  
Group has provided an independent, external Whistleblowing hotline, 
via Safecall, for the reporting of any such matters on a named or 
anonymous basis. All reports are treated in strictest confidence and 
investigations are overseen by the Group HR Director and Company 
Secretary as appropriate, or the Head of Internal Audit, to ensure  
a thorough, fair and transparent process is undertaken and any 
actions addressed. 
The Audit Committee is responsible for monitoring the Group’s 
whistleblowing arrangements and the Whistleblowing Policy will be 
reviewed periodically by the Board. The Committee has reviewed 
these arrangements since Admission and is satisfied that they are 
effective, facilitate the proportionate and independent investigation of 
reported matters, and allow appropriate follow-up action to be taken. www.biffa.co.uk

Nomination Committee Report
Dear Shareholder, 
I am pleased to present the first Nomination Committee Report on 
behalf of the Board.
Membership
The Nomination Committee membership comprises the Chairman  
as Committee Chair, the Chief Executive Officer and the three 
Non-Executive Directors.
Meetings
Since Admission there have been no meetings of the Committee,  
for the reasons outlined in the Board Evaluation and Succession 
Planning Section below.
Role of the Nomination Committee
The Board has delegated oversight of the leadership needs and 
succession planning for the Board to the Nomination Committee,  
to ensure the Group has the best talent to perform effectively now 
and in the future.
Key Responsibilities
The Nomination Committee’s responsibilities are set out in its terms  
of reference on the Company’s website at www.biffa.co.uk  
which, includes:
• keeping under review the composition, structure and size of the 
Board and its Committees, and making recommendations to  
the Board on any desired changes;
• succession planning for the Board and Senior Executives;
• leading the process for Board appointments by identifying and 
nominating, for the approval of the Board, candidates to fill Board 
vacancies as and when they arise;
• evaluation of the balance of skills, knowledge, experience and 
diversity on the Board; and
• reviewing Directors’ external commitments and time available  
to discharge their responsibilities effectively.
Board Appointments Process
It is the intention of the Board to adopt a formal and transparent 
procedure for the appointment of new Directors to the Board.  
This procedure will include the evaluation of the balance of skills, 
knowledge, experience and diversity of the Board by the Committee 
to ensure that any new appointments complement or address any 
shortfalls in any of these areas. The Committee will ensure that the 
selection process is rigorous and transparent and if appropriate it  
will appoint a professional external search firm. Candidates from a 
wide range of backgrounds that meet the role specification will be 
considered and all appointments will be made entirely on merit,  
with due regard to the benefits of diversity on the Board, which 
includes, but is not limited purely to, gender.
Composition of the Board
Following the IPO process the Board considers the current 
membership of two Executive Directors, a Non-Executive Chairman 
and three independent Non-Executive Directors is the right blend  
of commercial and governance experience, independence and 
challenge and the diverse range of skills and backgrounds of the 
Directors prevent any undue individual or collective influence over  
the Board’s decision making.
Board Diversity
The Committee monitors diversity on behalf of the Board. In line with 
the recommendations from the Women on Boards Davies Review 
(published in 2015) and the Code, the Company is committed to 
diversity on the Board. Whilst noting the recommendations of the 
Review, the Board does not establish targets on gender as it believes 
candidates should be appointed on merit. 
Induction of Directors
As referred to on page 47 a full, formal and tailored induction 
programme will be developed for any new Directors joining the Board.
Board Evaluation and Succession Planning
Given the relatively short period between Admission and the financial 
year end, and with two of the independent Non-Executive Directors 
only joining the Group shortly prior to Admission, the Board did not 
consider it appropriate to carry out a Board evaluation process prior 
to publication of the Annual Report. 
Similarly, for the reasons above the Board did not consider  
it appropriate to undertake any Board succession planning.  
Board Succession Planning will however be reviewed before  
the end of financial year 2018 and annually thereafter. 
Continuing Professional Development
As part of the Board evaluation process, the training and 
development needs of individual Directors will be reviewed by  
the Chairman. The Company will make the necessary resources 
available to support Director development.

Directors’ Remuneration Report
Dear Shareholder,
I am pleased to welcome you to the first Directors’ Remuneration 
Report which Biffa has prepared since its IPO in October 2016, and 
to introduce myself as the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee.
The Report comprises two sections:
•  the Directors’ Remuneration Policy; and
•  the Directors’ Report on Remuneration.
The Directors’ Remuneration Policy will be subject to a binding vote 
of shareholders at the forthcoming AGM, with the Directors’ Report 
on Remuneration being subject to an advisory vote.
Summary of the Directors’ Remuneration Policy
As part of the IPO process, Biffa undertook a review of the Group’s 
Remuneration Policy for its senior management team, including the 
Executive Directors, to ensure that it is appropriate for a UK-listed 
company and took due account of the Company’s particular 
circumstances. Following this review, a new Remuneration Policy  
was established, the main features of which were outlined in the  
IPO Prospectus. The Policy for which shareholder approval is 
to be sought at the AGM contains no material changes to the 
approach outlined in the Prospectus.
The principal objectives of our Remuneration Policy are to attract, 
retain and motivate the Executive Directors and the Group’s senior 
management, provide incentives that align with, and support, the 
Group’s business strategy as it evolves, and align incentives with  
the creation of long-term shareholder value.

Directors’ Remuneration Report continued
I have set out below some key points of our approach to the 
remuneration of the Executive Directors which we believe deliver 
against these objectives:
Component
of remuneration
Summary 
of approach
Base salary 
and benefits
Appropriate level of base salary and benefits, 
reviewed annually in the light of factors such as 
individual/Group performance, scope of role, 
practice adopted by comparator companies. 
The base salaries of the Executive Directors for 
the forthcoming year (which are unchanged 
from the prior year) are:
Ian Wakelin – £510,000
Michael Topham – £325,000 
Pension Defined contribution/cash supplement  
of 20% of salary
Annual bonus Payable subject to the achievement of 
challenging financial/strategic/personal 
performance conditions. Malus/clawback 
provisions apply. Maximum bonus opportunity 
for the Executive Directors potentially payable in 
cash and deferred shares:
Ian Wakelin: 130% of salary
Michael Topham: 1 10% of salary
Long-term 
incentives
Provided via a Performance Share Plan (PSP). 
Annual awards over shares made that vest 
subject to stretching performance conditions 
generally measured over a three-year period.  
Maximum “normal” grant level is 150% of salary 
and 125% of salary for the Chief Executive 
Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO) 
respectively. Malus/clawback provisions apply.
All-employee  
share plans
Executive Directors are entitled to participate  
in all of the Company’s employee share plans, 
including the Share Incentive Plan (SIP) and 
Sharesave Plan, on the same terms as other 
employees.
Share ownership 
guidelines
CEO: 200% of salary
CFO: 200% of salary
Other Committee Activities 
In addition to designing the Remuneration Policy and generally 
dealing with the remuneration-related matters arising as a 
consequence of the IPO, the Committee undertook a number  
of other activities, including:
•  Agreeing the first awards to be made under the PSP at Admission. 
As set out later in this Report, awards were made to Messrs 
Wakelin and Topham over shares worth 200% of salary which vest 
following the announcement of Biffa’s preliminary results in 2019 
subject to performance against a blend of relative TSR and EPS 
targets. PSP awards were also made to members of the Group 
Executive Team and senior management;
•  Overseeing the launch of the all-employee SIP; 
•  Overseeing the introduction of a Sharesave Plan for all employees 
due to launch in June 2017;
•  Determining the annual bonus outturn for 2016/17 for the Executive 
Directors. As explained on page 64, Ian Wakelin received a bonus 
of £554,503 (representing 108.7% of salary and 94.5% of his 
overall bonus opportunity), with Michael Topham receiving a bonus 
of £304,610 (representing 93.7% and 100.0% of his salary and 
bonus opportunity respectively). This bonus outturn reflected both 
strong Group and individual performance over the year; 
•  Considering benchmarking pay level analysis for the roles  
of CEO and CFO;
•  Receiving an update on the Biffa Group employee  
pay and conditions; and
•  Approving the Malus and Clawback Policy.
These activities were undertaken in the context of a strong year of 
underlying financial performance in what was also a transformational 
year for Biffa, which included increasing revenues by 6.8% and 
growing Underlying Operating Margins from 6.7% to 7 .5%. The  
Group delivered good organic growth and made a series of earnings 
enhancing acquisitions. Strong cash management and tight capital 
controls resulted in year-end Reported Net Debt of £246. 1m, less 
than 1.8 times Underlying EBITDA.
We trust that you find this Report to be informative and transparent, 
and we hope to receive your support for both the Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy and the Directors’ Report on Remuneration at 
our forthcoming AGM. Indeed, we are very keen to encourage an 
open dialogue with our shareholders on executive remuneration.

Executive Directors
Base salary 
The core element of pay, 
reflecting the individual’s 
position within the 
Company and 
experience
Base salaries will be reviewed as appropriate, but typically 
not more than annually. In reviewing base salaries, the 
Remuneration Committee will consider 
the performance of the Company and individual, any 
changes in responsibilities or scope of the role, as well as 
pay practices in relevant comparator companies of 
a broadly similar size and complexity.
It is anticipated that any 
salary increases will 
generally be in line with 
those awarded to salaried 
staff. That said, 
in certain circumstances 
(including, but not limited 
to, changes in role and 
responsibilities, market 
levels, individual and 
Company performance) 
higher increases may 
be made. However, no 
incumbent Executive 
Director’s salary will 
increase no more than 
an average of 10% p.a. 
over the duration  
of this Policy.

Benefits in kind 
To provide market-
competitive benefits 
valued by recipients
The Executive Directors may receive benefits in kind 
including car allowance, fuel allowance, private family 
medical insurance and such other market competitive 
benefits as the Remuneration Committee considers 
appropriate.
Benefits may be provided  
up to an aggregate value  
of £50,000 for each 
Executive Director (or such 
higher amount as the 
Remuneration Committee 
considers appropriate).

To motivate  
Executive Directors and

Annual bonus plan levels and the appropriateness  
of measures are reviewed annually to ensure they 
continue to support our strategy.
Once set, performance measures and targets will  
generally remain unchanged for the year, except to  
reflect events (e.g. corporate acquisitions, other major 
transactions) where the Committee considers it to be  
necessary in its opinion to make appropriate adjustments. 
The Remuneration Committee retains the flexibility to pay 
annual bonus outcomes in cash and/or deferred shares 
(which may allow for dividend roll-up). The current intention 
is that one-third of any bonus earned by an Executive

For 2017/18, the maximum 
opportunity will be 130% of 
salary for the CEO and 
110% of salary for the CFO.
Bonuses will be payable subject to 
the achievement of performance 
conditions which will be set by 
the Remuneration Committee.
The targets may be financial and/or 
personal and strategic with the 
majority based on financial targets. It is 
anticipated that the financial targets will 
have a significant profit-based element.

Remuneration Policy
This Remuneration Policy, which has been approved by the 
Board, contains the material required to be set out in the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report for the purposes of Part 4 of The Large and 
Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) 
(Amendment) Regulations 2013, which amended The Large and 
Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) 
Regulations 2008 (the DRR Regulations).
The Directors’ Remuneration Policy as set out in this section of the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report will take effect for all payments made 
to Directors with effect from the conclusion of the forthcoming AGM. 
This policy has been developed with reference to the Code and is felt 
to be appropriate to support the long-term success of the Company 
while ensuring that it does not promote inappropriate risk-taking. www.biffa.co.uk

than 20% of the maximum portion of 
overall annual bonus attributable to 
that measure, with a sliding scale to full 
pay-out for maximum performance. 
Bonus payments will also be subject 
to the Committee considering that the 
proposed bonus amounts, calculated 
by reference to performance against 
the targets, appropriately reflect the 
Company’s overall performance 
and shareholders’ experience. If the 
Committee does not believe this to 
be the case, it may adjust the bonus 
outturn accordingly.
Performance  
Share Plan
To motivate Executive 
Directors and incentivise 
the delivery of sustained 
performance over the 
long term, and to 
promote alignment with 
shareholders’ interests
Awards under the PSP may be granted as nil/nominal 
cost options or conditional awards which vest to the 
extent performance conditions are satisfied over a 
period normally of at least three years.
Awards will vest at the end of the specified vesting period 
at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee and may 
be subject to a further holding period.
The PSP rules allow that the number of shares subject to 
vested PSP awards may be increased to reflect the value 
of dividends that would have been paid in respect of any 
record dates falling between the grant of awards and the 
expiry of any vesting period/holding period.
Malus/clawback provisions applied are explained in more 
detail in the notes to this Policy table.
The market value of shares 
to be awarded to Executive 
Directors in respect of any 
year will normally be up to 
150% and 125% of base 
salary for the CEO and 
CFO respectively, with 
awards of a maximum 
of 250% allowable in 
exceptional circumstances.
The Remuneration Committee  
may impose such conditions as  
it considers appropriate which 
must be satisfied before any  
award will vest.
All awards made to Executive 
Directors will be subject to 
performance conditions which 
measure performance over a 
period normally no less than  
three years.
No more than 25% of awards  
vest for attaining the threshold  
level of performance.

guidelines 
To promote stewardship 
and to further align the 
interests of Executive 
Directors with those 
of shareholders
The share ownership guidelines encourage Executive 
Directors to build or maintain (as appropriate) a 
shareholding in the Company. 
If any Executive Director does not meet the guideline, 
they will be expected to retain up to 50% of the net-of-tax 
number of shares vesting under any of the Company’s 
discretionary share incentive arrangements (including 
any deferred bonus shares) until the guideline is met.
No less than 200%  
of base salary for any  
Executive Director.

share plans 
To facilitate and 
encourage share 
ownership by employees, 
thereby allowing them to 
share in the long-term 
success of the Company 
and align their interests 
with those of shareholders
The Executive Directors will be entitled to participate in 
all of the Company’s employee share plans, including 
the SIP and Sharesave Plan, on the same terms as 
other employees.
These all-employee share plans are established under  
HMRC tax-advantaged regimes and follow the usual  
form for such plans.
The maximum participation 
levels for all-employee 
share plans will be the 
limits for such plans set by 
HMRC from time to time.
Consistent with normal practice, 
such awards would not be subject 
to performance conditions.

Chairman and Non-
Executive Director fees 
To enable the Company 
to recruit and retain 
Company Chairs and 
Non-Executive Directors 
of the highest calibre, at 
the appropriate cost
The fees paid to the Chairman and Non-Executive 
Directors aim to be competitive with other fully listed 
companies of equivalent size and complexity.
The fees payable to the Non-Executive Directors are 
determined by the Board, with the Chairman’s fees 
determined by the Committee. No Director participated 
in decisions regarding their own fees.
The Chairman and Non-Executive Directors do not 
participate in any new cash or share incentive plans 
since Admission.
Fees are paid monthly 
in cash.

Notes to the policy table
1. Stating maxima for each element of the Remuneration Policy
The DRR Regulations and related investor guidance encourages companies to disclose a cap 
within which each element of the Directors’ Remuneration Policy will operate. Where maximum 
amounts for elements of remuneration have been set within the Policy, these will operate simply 
as caps and are not indicative of any aspiration.
2. Travel and hospitality
While the Committee does not consider it to form part of benefits in the normal usage of that term, 
it has been advised that corporate hospitality, whether paid for by the Company or another, and 
business travel for Directors (and in exceptional circumstances their families) and any related tax 
liabilities may technically come within the applicable rules, and so the Committee expressly 
reserves the right for the Committee to authorise such activities.
3. Past obligations
In addition to the above elements of remuneration, any commitment made prior to, but due to be 
fulfilled after, the approval and implementation of this Remuneration Policy or appointment as a 
Director will be honoured (such as any commitments made in relation to the EVP Return Letters).
4. Malus/clawback
The Committee may apply malus (being the ability to withhold or reduce a payment/vesting) and 
clawback (the ability to reclaim some or all of a payment/vesting) to an award under the annual 
bonus or PSP where there are circumstances which would justify such action, such as those 
relating to material misstatement of accounts, errors in calculating a payment/vesting and a 
participant’s conduct.
5. Performance conditions
The performance-related elements of remuneration take into account the Group’s risk policies and 
systems, and are designed to align the senior executives’ interests with those of shareholders. The 
Committee reviews the metrics used and targets set for the Group Executive Team and senior 
management (not just the Executive Directors) every year, in order to ensure that they are aligned 
with the Group’s strategy and to ensure an appropriate level of consistency.
6. Committee discretions
The Committee will operate the annual bonus plan and PSP according to their respective rules and 
the above Remuneration Policy table. The Committee retains discretion, consistent with market 
practice, in a number of respects, in relation to the operation and administration of these plans. 
This discretion includes, but is not limited to, the following:
• The selection or participants;
• The timing of grant of awards;
• The size of an award/bonus opportunity subject to the maximum limits set out in the 
Remuneration Policy table;
• The determination of performance against targets and resultant vesting/pay-outs;
• When dealing with a change of control or restructuring of the Company;
• Determination of the treatment of leavers based on the rules of the relevant plan and the 
appropriate treatment chosen (subject to the policy on termination as set out below);
• Adjustments required in certain circumstances (e.g. rights issue and special dividends); and
• The annual review of performance measures, weightings and targets from year to year.
In addition, while performance and targets used in the annual bonus plan and PSP will generally 
remain unaltered, if events occur which the Committee determines would make a different or 
amended target a fairer measure of performance, such amended or different target can be set 
provided that it is not materially more or less difficult to satisfy, having regard to the event in question.
Any use of the above discretions would, where relevant, be explained in the Annual Report on 
Directors Remuneration and may, where appropriate and practicable, be the subject of 
consultation with the Company’s major shareholders.
The Committee may make minor amendments to the Remuneration Policy set out above for 
regulatory, exchange control, tax or administrative purposes or to take account of a change in 
legislation, without obtaining shareholder approval for that amendment.
Remuneration Policy on Recruitment
The Company’s recruitment remuneration policy aims to give the 
Committee sufficient flexibility to secure the appointment and 
promotion of high calibre executives to strengthen the management 
team and secure the skill sets to deliver our strategic aims.
In terms of the principles for setting a package for a new Executive 
Director, the starting point for the Committee will be to apply the 
general Policy for Executive Directors as set out above and structure 
a package in accordance with that Policy. Consistent with the DRR 
Regulations, any caps contained within the policy for fixed pay do not 
apply to new recruits, although the Committee would not envisage 
exceeding these caps in practice unless absolutely necessary.
The annual bonus plan and PSP , including the maximum award 
levels, will operate as detailed in the general Policy in relation to any 
newly appointed Executive Director. For an internal appointment, any 
variable pay element awarded in respect of the prior role may either 
continue on its original terms or be adjusted to reflect the new 
appointment as appropriate.
For both external and internal appointments, the Committee may 
agree that the Company will meet certain relocation expenses as it 
considers appropriate.
For external candidates, it may be necessary to make additional 
awards in connection with the recruitment to buy out awards forfeited 
by the individual on leaving a previous employer. For the avoidance  
of doubt, buy-out awards are not subject to a formal cap. Any 
recruitment-related awards which are not buy-outs will be subject  
to the limits for annual bonus plan and PSP as stated in the general 
Policy. Details of any recruitment-related awards will be  
appropriately disclosed.
For any buy-outs the Company will not pay more than is necessary 
in the view of the Committee and will be limited in value to what the 
Committee considers to be a fair estimate of the value of the awards 
foregone. The Committee will in all cases seek, in the first instance, to 
deliver any such awards under the terms of the existing annual bonus 
plan and PSP . It may, however, be necessary in some cases to make 
buy-out awards on terms that are more bespoke than the existing 
annual bonus plan and PSP . www.biffa.co.uk
60
Corporate Governance
Biffa plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Directors’ Remuneration Report continued
All buy-outs, whether under the annual bonus plan, PSP or otherwise, 
will take due account of the service obligations and performance 
requirements for any remuneration relinquished by the individual when 
leaving a previous employer. The Committee will seek, where it is 
practicable to do so, to make buy-outs subject to what are, in its 
opinion, comparable requirements in respect of service and 
performance. However, the Committee may choose to relax this 
requirement in certain cases, such as where the service and/or 
performance requirements are materially completed, or where such 
factors are, in the view of the Committee, reflected in some other way, 
such as a significant discount to the face value of the awards forfeited, 
and where the Committee considers it to be in the interests of 
shareholders.
Service Contracts
Executive Directors
Each of the Executive Directors entered into a service agreement with 
the Company which was effective upon Admission and dated 14 
October 2016. The practice is that each Executive Director’s service 
agreement should be of indefinite duration, subject to termination by 
the Company or the individual on no more than 12 months’ notice. 
However, the Committee reserves flexibility to alter these principles if 
necessary to secure the recruitment of an appropriate candidate and 
if appropriate introduce a longer initial notice period of up to two years 
(reducing over time to no more than 12 months).
The service agreements of all Executive Directors, which are  
available for inspection at the Company’s registered office,  
comply with this policy: 
• Ian Wakelin’s service agreement is terminable by either party  
on not less than 12 months’ written notice or immediately upon 
payment in lieu of notice, and contains a 12-month garden  
leave clause. 
• Michael Topham’s service agreement is terminable by the 
Company on not less than 12 months’ written notice or by  
Michael on not less than six months’ written notice. The contract 
provides for immediate termination upon payment in lieu of notice 
and contains a six-month garden leave clause.
In each case any payment in lieu of notice will be calculated by 
reference to base salary and contractual benefits only and will not 
include any entitlement to bonus or PSP . The payments in lieu will 
be paid in monthly instalments. Each director is also obliged to seek 
alternative employment/income during this period and the instalment 
payments will be reduced by the amount of such income.
Chairman and Non-Executive Directors
The Chairman and Non-Executive Directors’ appointments are subject 
to the terms of letters of appointment agreed between themselves 
and the Company dated 28 September 2016. They are not entitled to 
receive any compensation on termination of their appointment (other 
than payment in respect of a notice period where notice is served) and 
are not entitled to participate in the Company’s share, bonus or pension 
schemes, and are entitled to be reimbursed all reasonable out-of-
pocket expenses incurred in the proper performance of their duties.
Their appointment may be terminated at any time upon three months’ 
written notice. The appointment may also be terminated pursuant to 
the Articles or as otherwise required by law. They are subject to 
annual re-election by the Company in general meeting.
Remuneration Policy on Termination
The Committee will consider treatments on a termination having 
regard to all of the relevant facts and circumstances available at that 
time. This policy applies both to any negotiations linked to notice 
periods on a termination and any treatments that the Committee may 
choose to apply under the discretions available to it under the terms 
of the annual bonus plan and PSP . The potential treatments on 
termination under these plans are as follows:
Annual Bonus Plan
If an Executive Director resigns or is dismissed for cause before the 
bonus payment date, the right to receive any bonus normally lapses 
(unless the Committee determines otherwise). 
 
If an Executive Director ceases employment before the bonus date 
because of death, injury, ill health, disability or any other reason 
determined by the Committee, such bonus will be payable as the 
Committee in its absolute discretion determines taking into account the 
circumstances for leaving, time in employment and performance. Similar 
treatment will apply in the event of a change in control of the Company.
If an Executive Director ceases employment unvested deferred bonus 
awards will normally lapse. However, if employment ends because of 
death, ill health, injury or disability, retirement, redundancy, the sale or 
transfer of the employing company or business (other than on a change 
of control), or for any other reason determined by the Committee, the 
award will vest in full on the date of cessation, unless the Remuneration 
Committee decides that it should be subject to a pro-rata reduction in 
the number of shares vesting to take account of the proportion of the 
vesting period during which the participant will not be in employment 
and/or vest on the original vesting date. Alternatively, on a sale or transfer 
of the employing company or business, participants may be required to 
exchange their awards for equivalent awards in the acquiring company.
If there is a takeover, scheme of arrangement, demerger or other 
corporate reorganisation of the Company, participants may be 
required, or may be allowed, to exchange their deferred bonus awards 
for equivalent awards in the acquiring company. If awards are not 
exchanged, they will normally vest immediately, and an award granted 
in the form of an option will normally be exercisable for six months after 
the date of vesting and will lapse at the end of that period.
Performance Share Plan 
If, during the performance or vesting period, a participant:
• resigns or is dismissed for cause, awards will normally lapse in full;
• ceases to be employed due to ill health, injury or disability (evidenced 
to the Company’s satisfaction), retirement with the agreement of the 
participant’s employer, redundancy, the sale or transfer of the 
employing company or business (other than on change of control), or 
for other reasons specifically approved by the Committee, the award 
will continue and, unless the Committee determines otherwise, will 
vest on the original vesting date subject to the satisfaction of the 
performance conditions over the performance period and a pro-rata 
reduction in the number of shares vesting to take account of the 
proportion of the vesting period during which the participant was not 
in employment. Alternatively, on the sale or transfer of the employing 
company or business, participants may be required to exchange their 
awards for equivalent awards in the acquiring company;
• dies, unvested awards will vest at the date of death subject to 
performance testing and time pro-rating, unless the Remuneration 
Committee determines otherwise. 0

If there is a takeover, scheme of arrangement, demerger or other 
corporate reorganisation of the Company, participants may be 
required, or may be allowed, to exchange their awards for equivalent 
awards in the acquiring company. If awards are not exchanged, they 
will normally vest immediately, the performance conditions will apply 
and the number of shares which vest will be time pro-rated to take 
account of the proportion of the vesting period which has elapsed 
prior to the relevant event unless the Committee, acting fairly and 
reasonably, decides that it is appropriate not to apply pro-rating (or 
apply it less strictly). An award granted in the form of an option will 
normally be exercisable for six months after the date of vesting and 
will lapse at the end of that period.
The number of shares subject to an award may be adjusted in such 
manner as the Remuneration Committee considers reasonable, if 
there is a rights issue, corporate restructuring events, demerger, 
special dividends or other variation of capital.
The all-employee SIP and Sharesave Plan provide treatments for 
leavers in line with HMRC rules for such plans.
The Company has the power to enter into settlement agreements 
with Directors and to pay compensation to settle potential legal 
claims. In addition, and consistent with market practice, in the event 
of the termination of an Executive Director, the Company may make 
a contribution towards that individual’s legal fees and fees for 
outplacement services as part of a negotiated settlement. Any 
such fees will be disclosed as part of the detail of termination 
arrangements. For the avoidance of doubt, the policy does not 
include an explicit cap on the cost of termination payments.
External Appointments
The Company’s policy is to permit an Executive Director to accept 
non-executive appointments outside the Company when this does 
not conflict with the individual’s duties to the Company. When an 
Executive Director takes such a role they may be entitled to retain 
any fees which they earn from that appointment.
Statement of Consideration of Employment Conditions 
elsewhere in the Company
Pay and employment conditions generally in the Company will be 
taken into account when setting Executive Directors’ remuneration. 
The Committee will receive regular updates on overall pay and 
conditions in the Company, including (but not limited to) changes in 
base pay and any staff bonuses in operation. There is also oversight 
of the all-employee share plans which Executive Directors and all 
other Company employees can participate in the plans on the same 
terms and conditions. Reflecting standard practice, the Company 
does not currently consult with staff in drawing up the Company’s 
Remuneration Report or when determining the underlying policy, 
although it will continue to monitor developments in this area.
Differences between the policy on Remuneration for Directors 
and the Policy on the Remuneration for Other Employees
The Remuneration Policy for other employees is based on broadly 
consistent principles as described above. Annual salary reviews 
across the Company take into account Company performance, 
local pay and market conditions and salary levels for similar roles 
in comparable companies.
Other members of senior management participate in similar annual 
bonus arrangements to the Executive Directors, although award sizes 
vary by organisational level. PSP awards may also be granted to a 
broader population than the Executive Directors. The Company 
operates discretionary bonus schemes for eligible groups of 
employees under which a bonus is payable subject to the 
achievement of appropriate targets. All eligible employees 
may participate in the Company’s SIP and Sharesave Plan 
on identical terms.
Statement of Consideration of Shareholders’ Views
The 2017 AGM is the first occasion at which the Company will seek 
the formal support of its shareholders on matters relating to the 
remuneration of Executive Directors. The Committee will ensure that  
it considers all of the feedback which it receives from its shareholders 
during this process.

  As described in the Prospectus this incentive represents shares and a cash bonus paid as part of the long-term Management Incentive Plan (MIP) which was in place from 2013 until IPO in October 
2016. Certain Directors and members of Senior Management became entitled on Admission to an aggregate cash amount payable by the Group of £22.0m (of which £5.2m was reinvested in 
subscription shares upon IPO. (Prospectus page 201, paragraph 6.3)). In addition, Executive Directors purchased shares in January 2013 which vested in January 2016 and were converted to Biffa 
plc shares on Admission. The conversion ratio was determined according to the equity value of the Group at IPO. Actual targets are commercially sensitive and, since they relate to the period before 
IPO, will not be disclosed. No further payments are due in connection with the MIP (except potentially for the EVP awards referred to in the Prospectus and on page 65 of this Report). Ian Wakelin, 
Michael Topham, Steve Marshall, Michael Averill and Gerry Loftus received cash bonus payments and shares. Additionally, they agreed to purchase shares using part of the cash award. Cash and 
shares granted as part of the MIP are contained in the table below. The shares are all subject to ‘lock up’ arrangements which prohibit sale until October 2017 and to which the share ownership 
guidelines apply.

2016/17 Annual Bonus (audited)
The Executive Directors’ annual bonus targets were set at the 
beginning of the financial year, prior to Admission. As a result of 
strong underlying financial performance, the Group exceeded the 
threshold operating profit and free cash flow targets set by the Board 
for the purposes of awarding the 2016/17 annual bonuses of the 
Executive Directors. 
In addition, the strategic/personal objectives of Health and Safety 
Accident Frequency Rate & Lost Time Injury reduction measures, 
increased Employee Engagement score, progress against the 
Project Fusion Plan (business and systems transformation) and 
the successful execution of the IPO process were all achieved.
The Committee has considered it appropriate not to disclose the 
actual targets for these awards as they were set at a time when the 
Company was a private company and as such the Board considers 
the underlying targets to be commercially sensitive. It will be the 
Committee’s policy going forward to normally disclose annual bonus 
targets retrospectively, at the same time as the performance outcome 
is disclosed in the remuneration report after the end of each financial 
year (to the extent they are not considered commercially sensitive).
This performance resulted in recommended annual bonuses of 
£554,503 for Ian Wakelin and £304,610 for Michael Topham.
Payments to Past Directors (audited)
There were no payments to past Directors in the financial year 
2016/17 (2015/16: nil).
Payments for Loss of Office (audited)
No payments were made to any Director in respect of loss of office 
in the financial year 2016/17 (2015/16: nil).

EVP Awards (audited)
As described in the Prospectus, prior to Admission certain Directors 
were granted EVP Return Letters by WasteHoldco 1 Limited (then the 
parent company of the Biffa group of companies) in connection with 
a dispute with HMRC regarding the payment of landfill tax for certain 
of its operations in the UK (the EVP Dispute). These EVP Return 
Letters were granted in recompense for the diminution in value of  
their interests in the Group resulting from the EVP Dispute which  
was linked to incentive arrangements in existence prior to Admission, 
full details of which appear below (see page 1 10 of the financial 
statements for further details). As part of the proceedings, the 
Company became obliged to pay HMRC approximately £72 million 
following Admission (the EVP Paid Amount).
If the EVP Dispute is irrevocably settled in the Company’s favour and 
the EVP Paid Amount is unconditionally returned to the Company 
(less any amounts which the Group is required to pay in respect of 
costs incurred by HMRC or penalties or other associated costs of 
the EVP Dispute) (the EVP Return), the EVP Return Letters shall be 
settled and these Directors shall be entitled to a cash payment (less 
tax and national insurance contributions) under the EVP Return 
Letters as follows:
Director % of net EVP Return to which they are entitled
Ian Wakelin 7.355
Michael Topham 2.129
Steven Marshall 1.161
Michael Averill 0.194
Gerald Loftus 0.194
In the event the EVP Dispute is irrevocably settled in HMRC’s favour, 
then subject to the Group receiving a net reduction in the tax liability 
of the Group (after taking into account any increase in the tax liability 
arising in respect of any profit and loss account credits in 
WasteHoldco 1 Limited in respect of the EVP preference shares 
granted to certain shareholders prior to Admission (the Tax 
Deduction) the EVP Return Letters shall be cancelled and the 
Directors shall be entitled to a cash payment equal to a percentage 
of the Tax Deduction subject to a maximum payment (less tax and 
social security contributions) as detailed below:
Director % of Tax Deduction Maximum Cash Payment
Ian Wakelin 8.172 £817,204
Michael Topham 2.366 £236,559
Steven Marshall 1.290 £129,032
Michael Averill 0.215 £21,505
Gerald Loftus 0.215 £21,505
 
A Board Committee has been established to provide an independent 
review of the EVP Dispute proceedings and make recommendations 
to the Board. The independent Non-Executive Directors Mr Ken 
Lever and Mr David Martin, who have no financial interest in the result 
of the EVP Dispute are the members of that committee.
Implementation of Policy for 2017/18 (unaudited information)
Base salary
Base salaries will be as follows (and which are unchanged from the 
prior year):
• Ian Wakelin: £510,000 
• Michael Topham: £325,000 
Benefits in kind
Benefits will be paid in line with the Directors’ Remuneration Policy. 
Details of the benefits received by Executive Directors are set out in 
the single figure table on page 62.
There is no intention to introduce additional benefits in 2018.
Pension
Contribution rates for Ian Wakelin and Michael Topham will remain  
at 20% of base salary. Contributions may be made as cash 
supplements in full or in part.
Annual Bonus
Bonus of maxima of 130% of salary and 1 10% of salary will be 
applied for Ian Wakelin and Michael Topham respectively.
70% of the bonus will be payable by reference to performance 
against financial targets, with performance against personal/strategic 
targets determining the extent to which the remaining 30% of the 
overall bonus opportunity is payable.
More particularly:
• 50% will be payable based on a sliding scale of challenging 
Underlying Profit Before Tax targets.
• 20% will be payable based on a sliding scale of challenging 
Underlying Free Cashflow targets.
• 30% will be payable based on performance against a number of 
strategic/personal objectives relating to delivery of strategy, health 
and safety measures and employee engagement.
In addition: 
• no bonus will be payable unless the Committee is satisfied that  
the Company’s underlying performance warrants it; and
• as set out in the policy table, bonus payments will also be subject 
to the Committee considering that the proposed bonus amounts, 
calculated by reference to performance against the targets, 
appropriately reflect the Company’s overall performance and 
shareholders’ experience. If the Committee does not believe  
this to be the case, it may adjust the bonus outturn accordingly.
Due to issues of commercial sensitivity, we do not believe it is in 
shareholders’ interests to disclose any further details of these targets 
on a prospective basis. However, the Company is committed to 
adhering to principles of transparency and will, therefore, provide 
appropriate and relevant levels of disclosure of bonus targets and 
performance against these targets for the 2018 bonus in next  
year’s report.
33% of any bonus earned will be deferred into shares for three years 
to the extent that an Executive Director does not satisfy the share 
ownership guideline on the bonus payment date.  www.biffa.co.uk

of the Annual Report and the Accounts
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report,  
the Directors’ Remuneration Report and Group and parent Company 
financial statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements 
for each financial year. Under that law the Directors are required to 
prepare the Group financial statements in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the 
European Union and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation and have elected 
to prepare the parent company financial statement in accordance 
with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice 
(United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law), 
including FRS 101 “Reduced Disclosure Framework”.
Under Company law, the Directors must not approve the financial 
statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view 
of the state of affairs of the Group and parent Company and of their 
profit or loss for that period. In preparing these financial statements, 
the Directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply  
them consistently;

whole is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the 
information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s and  
the Company’s position, performance, business model and strategy 
in accordance with the Code.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of  
the corporate and financial information included on the Company’s 
website. Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and 
dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in 
other jurisdictions. A copy of the financial statements is available

Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our responsibilities under 
those standards are further described in the auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. 
We are independent of the Group and the Company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial 
statements in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical Standard as applied to listed public interest entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical 
responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We confirm that the non-audit services prohibited by the FRC’s Ethical Standard 
were not provided to the Company.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. 73

Financial Statements
Biffa plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
We designed our audit by determining materiality and assessing the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements. The risks 
of material misstatement that had the greatest effect on our audit are identified as Key Audit Matters in the table below:
Summary of our Audit Approach
Key audit matters The key audit matters that we identified in the current year were:
• Landfill Accounting
•  Retirement Benefit Obligation
• Asset Impairment
• Acquisition Accounting
• Engineered into the Void (‘EVP’) Accounting
Materiality We have determined materiality for the Group financial statements to be £2.6m. Materiality has been 
determined by applying a rate of 7% to profit before tax, exceptional items and re-measurements 
(“adjusted profit before tax”). Our materiality has been capped at the level set at the planning stage 
of our audit, resulting in materiality of 6.6% of adjusted profit before tax.
Scoping We performed full scope audits on 35 legal entities located in the United Kingdom and Malta. 
These entities account for 100% of both the Group’s revenue and net assets.
Conclusions related to principal risks, going concern and viability statement
We have reviewed the Directors’ statement regarding the appropriateness of 
the going concern basis of accounting contained within note 1 to the financial statements and 
the Directors’ statement on the longer-term viability of the Group contained within the 
strategic report, on page 27 .
We are required to state whether we have anything material to add or draw attention to in 
relation to:
• the disclosures on pages 29-31 that describe the principal risks and explain how they  
are being managed or mitigated;
• the directors’ confirmation on page 46 that they have carried out a robust assessment 
of the principal risks facing the Group, including those that would threaten its business 
model, future performance, solvency or liquidity;
• the Directors’ statement on page 67 about whether they considered it appropriate to adopt 
the going concern basis of accounting in preparing them and their identification of any 
material uncertainties to the Group and the Company’s ability to continue to do so over  
a period of at least twelve months from the date of approval of the financial statements;
• the Directors’ explanation on page 27 as to how they have assessed the prospects of 
the Group, over what period they have done so and why they consider that period to be 
appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have a reasonable expectation that  
the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over 
the period of their assessment, including any related disclosures drawing attention to any 
necessary qualifications or assumptions; or
• whether the Directors’ statements relating to going concern and the prospects of the 
Company required in accordance with Listing Rule 9.8.6R(3) are materially inconsistent 
with our knowledge obtained in the audit.
We confirm that we have nothing 
material to add or draw attention 
to in respect of these matters.
We agreed with the Directors’ 
adoption of the going concern basis 
of accounting and we did not identify 
any such material uncertainties. 
However, because not all future events 
or conditions can be predicted, this 
statement is not a guarantee as to 
the Group’s ability to continue as 
a going concern.
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of 
the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) that we identified. 
These matters included those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing 
the efforts of the engagement team.
These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we 
do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. www.biffa.co.uk

Landfill Accounting
Key audit matter 
description
The Group operates a number of landfill sites in the UK. A significant cost of owning and operating a landfill site in the 
UK arises after the land filling operation ceases due to the constructive and legal obligation to restore sites and then to 
care for them until it can be demonstrated that they present no ongoing risk to the environment. The liabilities extend 
until the waste is considered to be inert, which is generally assumed to be up to 60 years following closure of the site. 
The Group makes provision, within the financial statements, for such long-term obligations through its provisions for 
restoration. The level of costs expected is uncertain and can vary significantly from site to site. 
As these provisions arise in connection with an asset, under IAS 16 “Property, Plant and Equipment” the costs are 
capitalised and depreciated over the remaining life of the associated asset.
There are a number of significant judgements in relation to the level of the provision and depreciation required. We 
identified a risk relating to the appropriateness of the total cost and void data as well as the accuracy of the underlying 
calculations with the key variables being gross cost assumptions, void assumptions and the discount rate. 
As part of our assessment of risk of material misstatements due to fraud, we evaluated which of the judgements and 
assumptions in landfill provision might give rise to potential fraud risks. We have focused our audit procedures to 
detect the inflation of performance through the manipulation of the provision.
As at 24 March 2017 the Group holds a Landfill restoration and aftercare provision of £80.9m (2016: £66.9m).
The associated disclosure is included in note 20. The Audit Committee has included their assessment of this risk 
on page 50. For specifics of the Group's accounting policy please see page 89. 
How the scope 
of our audit 
responded to the 
key audit matter
Our audit response focused on verifying and challenging the underlying data and key assumptions used by 
management in calculating the restoration and aftercare provisions. 
Biffa uses internal and external experts to help determine the total expenditure required to remediate sites. As part of 
the audit we obtained and inspected experts’ reports and assessed their competence, objectivity and independence.
We performed procedures to understand the adequacy of the design, implementation and operating effectiveness of 
controls in place over the completeness and accuracy of accounting for landfill provisions.
We assessed and challenged the assumptions and judgements in management’s calculations with reference to market 
and historical data, including discount rates applied in the forecast cash flows. We utilised an internal valuation specialist 
to benchmark inflation and discount rates against industry and internal data. 
Furthermore, for a sample of sites, we performed an assessment of the reasonableness of the forecast costs that 
underpin the cash flows used in the calculation of the provision. We compared the forecast cost to historical financial 
information and agreed to the budget, taking into account the void consumed. We recalculated the cost of the provision 
for the selected sites and finally tested the total landfill related provisions through substantive analytical reviews.
Our procedures allowed us to gain a thorough understanding of landfill provision cycle with a variety of procedures 
performed to minimise the risk associated to potential fraud.
Key observations Based on the work performed as outlined above we conclude the assumptions to be appropriate and concur with 
management that the level of landfill provision is adequate.
Retirement Benefit Obligation 
Key audit matter 
description
The Group operates several defined benefit pension schemes which are accounted for under IAS 19 (“Employment 
Benefits”). At 24 March 2017 , the Group have recognised a net defined benefit surplus arising from these defined 
benefit schemes of £15.4m (2016:£29.5m). Included within this figure is a gross defined benefit obligation of £488.7m 
(2016: £368.2m).
Pension accounting is a specialist area requiring the exercise of significant management judgement and the use of 
technical expertise to determine the surplus or deficit of a scheme in accordance with generally accepted actuarial 
practices. There is a risk that the judgements made by management in valuing the defined benefit pension liabilities 
including the use of assumptions on the discount rate, mortality assumption, inflation level, pension increase and 
measures of longevity may be overly optimistic. These measures can have a material impact in determining the 
quantum of the retirement benefit liability. 
The associated disclosure is included in note 28. The Audit Committee has included their assessment of this risk 
on page 50. For specifics of the Group’s accounting policy please see page 87 . 75

Retirement Benefit Obligation 
How the scope 
of our audit 
responded to the 
key audit matter
We performed walk through procedures to evaluate the adequacy of the design and implementation of controls in 
place over the accounting of retirement benefit obligation.
We have tested the significant judgements made by Biffa Plc third party actuaries and assessed their competence 
and independence. We also used our internal actuarial experts to assess the key assumptions applied in determining 
the pension obligation for the main schemes, and determined whether the key assumptions are reasonable. The 
assessment included reviewing available yield curves, discount rate, inflation and mortality data to recalculate a 
reasonable benchmark for the key assumptions. We challenged management to understand the sensitivity 
of changes in key assumptions and quantify the impact of illustrative benchmark rates that could be used 
in their calculations.
Key observations Based on the work performed as outlined above, we are satisfied that the key assumptions applied in respect 
of the valuation of the scheme's liabilities are appropriate. 
Asset Impairment 
Key audit matter 
description
As at 24 March 2017 the Group held non-current assets of £618. 1m (2016: £582.2m) which could be at risk of 
impairment, including a goodwill balance of £70.4m (2016: £64.4m) as a result of the previous Group restructurings 
and acquisitions. 
Non-current assets also includes different classes of intangible assets, gas reserves, brand and customer contracts. 
In addition, the Group carries different classes of tangible assets. 
Management identified four groups of Cash Generating Units (“CGUs”) for the purpose of goodwill impairment 
assessment that are in line with their operating divisions. The recoverable amount of three of these CGUs has been 
calculated on a Value in Use basis, while the “Energy” CGU has been assessed on the basis of Fair Value less costs 
of disposal. There are key assumptions and judgements in the calculation of the recoverable amounts including: the 
discount rate; long term growth rates; forecast tonnage; and EBITDA multiples. 
As management have outlined in note 12 the Fair Value less cost of disposal of the Energy division is highly sensitive 
to changes in the assumptions which gives rise to an area of estimation uncertainty. 
The associated disclosure is included in note 12. The Audit Committee has included their assessment of this risk 
on page 50 and is included within the key sources of estimation uncertainty in note 1. For specifics of the Group's 
accounting policy please see page 89.
How the scope 
of our audit 
responded to the 
key audit matter
We held discussions with management to understand the process that the Group followed in its asset impairment 
assessment. Following these discussions we assessed the design and implementation of the controls that 
management operates over the process.
We have challenged the accuracy of future cash flow forecasts with reference to recent performance, trend analysis 
and an assessment of historical forecasting accuracy of their forecasts against actual outturn that underpin the cash 
flows used in the assessment.
We used our internal valuation specialists to determine an acceptable range of discount rates utilising market 
comparable information to compare to the rate used by management in the Value in Use calculations. 
Where Fair Value less costs of disposal was used, our internal valuation specialist also identified relevant comparable 
EBITDA multiples of similar transactions for comparison to the inputs used by management in the calculation. 
We have challenged management on the long range growth rates utilised in comparison to those used by relevant 
comparable groups and market reports on future waste volume growth. 
We further challenged management’s sensitivity analysis and performed our own sensitivity analysis on key variables. 
Having ascertained the extent of change in those assumptions that individually or collectively would be required for 
the goodwill and intangible assets to be impaired, we considered the likelihood of such movement in those key 
assumptions arising.
Key observations Based on the work performed as outlined above we consider the assumptions underlying the impairment 
assessment to be appropriate and furthermore, concur with management that as at 24 March 2017 that there 
is no impairment of the non-current assets.  www.biffa.co.uk

Acquisition Accounting
Key audit matter 
description
During the year Biffa PLC made two material acquisitions, Cory Environmental Municipal Services Ltd for £13.5m 
and Blakeley Recycling Limited for £2.4m. In accordance with IFRS 3 (Revised 2008) “Business Combinations”, 
management has recognised the identifiable assets and the liabilities at their acquisition date fair values. 
Judgement has been applied in respect of the Purchase Price Allocation (“PPA”) exercise including identifying where 
intangible assets arise and the relevant Weighted Average Cost of Capital (“WACC”) to be used in valuing these. 
Judgement is also applied in the assessment of the fair value of the contingent element of consideration. 
Intangibles have been identified relating to the customer relationships arising from four Municipal contracts held 
with the local authorities.
Management have concluded that there are no indicators of impairment of the acquired goodwill based their 
expectation of the future performance of the acquired businesses.
The associated disclosure is included in note 1 1. The Audit Committee has included their assessment of this risk 
on page 51. For specifics of the Group's accounting policy please see page 85.
How the scope 
of our audit 
responded to the 
key audit matter
We tested the acquisition balance sheet and initial fair value adjustments of the acquired businesses including challenging 
management with regards to the identification and valuation of intangible assets and liabilities post acquisition. 
We used our internal valuation specialists to consider and evaluate the appropriateness of the methodologies applied 
and to test the inputs to the valuation models used to identify and determine the value of the intangible assets, 
including the discount rates, growth rates and useful economic lives, through comparing these against industry 
benchmarks on similar assets.
We reviewed post acquisition trading for indicators of impairment of the goodwill recognised.
Key observations Based on the work performed as outlined above, we are satisfied that the acquired businesses have been 
appropriately accounted for in accordance with IFRS 3 (Revised 2008) “Business Combinations”.
Engineered into the Void (‘EVP’) Accounting 
Key audit matter 
description
As outlined in note 32, HMRC have concluded that the use of EVP in the construction of Landfill Cells is liable for 
Landfill tax. The total liability is now estimated to be approximately £62.0m, plus an interest charge currently estimated 
at £10.4m. Since 2012, management have continued to dispute with HMRC’s interpretation and therefore have been 
legally contesting this case. This has been supported by Biffa receiving external professional advice, and therefore 
management do not reasonably expect a liability to be probable. 
Following the Initial Public Offering (“IPO”), the Group ceased to qualify for hardship relief which enabled the Company 
to defer payment to HMRC. Consequently, upon IPO the Company paid the disputed amount of £62.0m plus interest 
of £1.7m to HMRC. On the basis that the Group expects to win the case the £63.7m paid has been recognised as 
receivable and none of the outstanding estimated interest has been accrued. As part of the IPO of the Group, 
arrangements were put in place to make certain payments to the shareholders and certain members of the employee 
incentive schemes of the Group immediately before listing, subject to and in respect of a successful outcome of the 
dispute in favour of the Group. As a result a total liability of £55.8m was recognised, reflecting the potential payment. 
Therefore, in the event that the outcome of the dispute is against the Group and the £63.7m prepaid is not received, 
the recognised liability of £55.8m in respect of the potential payment would be cancelled. 
There is a risk that this exposure is not recognised in line with IAS 37 “Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent 
Assets” which set outs when it is appropriate to recognise an asset and liability when there is a level of uncertainty.
The associated disclosure is included in notes 16 and 18. The Audit Committee has included their assessment of this 
risk on page 51. For specifics of the Group's accounting policy please see page 90.
How the scope 
of our audit 
responded to the 
key audit matter
We performed procedures to understand the design and implementation of controls in place to ensure the potential 
liability is appropriately accounted and disclosed in the Group’s financial statements.
We reviewed correspondence between Biffa, HMRC, Biffa’s legal counsel and tax advisor to update our 
understanding of progress of the case. This has allowed us to assess the accounting and disclosures in the Group’s 
annual report for sufficiency against the requirements of IAS 37 and assess whether this reflects the latest status of 
the dispute. We obtained direct correspondence from Biffa’s tax advisor with regard to the status of the claim and 
assessed their competence and objectivity.
Key observations Based on the procedures performed as outlined above and the evidence obtained, we concur with management’s 
assessment that the liability does not appear to be probable, therefore the £63.7m prepaid is receivable and the 
potential liability of £55.8m appropriately recognised. Furthermore, we conclude that the disclosures in the Group’s 
annual report are appropriate. 77

Our application of materiality
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements that makes it probable that the economic decisions  
of a reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced. We use materiality both in planning the scope of our audit work 
and in evaluating the results of our work. 
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:
Group materiality £2.6m
Basis for determining 
materiality
We have determined materiality for the Group financial statements to be £2.6m. Materiality has been 
determined by applying a rate of 7% to profit before tax, exceptional items and re-measurements 
(“adjusted profit before tax”, as explained further below). Our materiality has been capped at the level 
set at the planning stage of our audit, resulting in materiality of 6.6% of adjusted profit before tax.
In making this determination, we calculated an adjusted profit before tax as follows: 
• taking the statutory loss before tax;
• adding back items classed as exceptional in note 3;
• adjusting the effect of the change in discount rate on aftercare provisions, so that its impact on 
adjusted profit represents a four year normalised average figure; and
• adjusting finance costs so that their impact on adjusted profit reflects the capital structure of the 
Group post-IPO.
This materiality figure represents 1.8% of Underlying EBITDA, and less than 1% of both Net Assets 
and Revenue.
Rationale for the 
benchmark applied
We believe that using a materiality based on this benchmark reflects underlying performance of the 
Group. In calculating an adjusted PBT figure, we removed exceptional items as these are not reflective 
of the underlying performance of the Group. We consider that the impact of the change in discount rate 
on the aftercare provision is a recurring item and have therefore included it in our calculation; however, 
because of its volatility, we have taken an average over four years. We have included finance costs that 
are reflective of the Group’s cost of borrowing after the IPO because this is reflective of the Group’s 
performance as a listed company.
Levels of materiality applied to components ranged from £1.8m to £1.3m, depending on the scale of the component’s operations and our 
assessment of risks specific to each entity.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the Committee all audit differences in excess of £0. 13m, as well as differences 
below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. We also report to the Audit Committee on disclosure 
matters that we identified when assessing the overall presentation of the financial statements.
An overview of the scope of our audit
Biffa PLC primarily operates in the United Kingdom; the Group has two active overseas entities based in Malta that provide insurance 
services to the Group.
We consider the statutory reporting structure to reflect the components of the Group as this is how management monitor and control the 
business. The materiality and scope of work for each entity has been assessed based upon its significance and contributions to the Group. 
Audit procedures are then performed based upon the level of scope identified.
Based on this assessment, we performed full scope audits on 35 legal entities located in the United Kingdom and Malta. These entities 
account for 100% of both the Group’s revenue and net assets.
At the parent entity level we also tested the consolidation process and carried out review procedures to confirm our conclusion that there 
were no significant risks of material misstatement of the aggregated financial information of the remaining components not subject to a full 
scope audit or specified audit procedures.
A senior member of the Group audit team visited the Maltese entity. In addition to our visit, we sent detailed instructions to the Maltese 
component audit team, included them in our team briefings, discussed the risk assessment, attended the closing meeting and reviewed their 
audit working papers. www.biffa.co.uk

Other information
The Directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises 
the information included in the annual report including the Overview, Strategic Report, 
Governance and Financial Review sections but does not include the financial statements 
and our auditor’s report thereon.
Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to 
the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our auditor’s report, we do not express any form of 
assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other 
information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent 
with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to 
be materially misstated.
If we identify any such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are 
required to determine whether there is a material misstatement in the financial statements or 
a material misstatement of other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we 
conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to 
report that fact.
In this context, matters that we are specifically required to report to you as uncorrected 
material misstatements of the other information include where we conclude that:
• Fair, balanced and understandable – the statement given by the Directors that they 
consider the annual report and financial statements taken as a whole is fair, balanced 
and understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess 
the Group’s performance, business model and strategy, is materially inconsistent with 
our knowledge obtained in the audit; or
• Audit committee reporting – the section describing the work of the audit committee 
does not appropriately address matters communicated by us to the audit committee; or
• Directors’ Statement of Compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code – the parts 
of the Directors’ statement required under the Listing Rules relating to the Company’s 
compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code containing provisions specified for 
review by the auditor in accordance with Listing Rule 9.8. 10R(2) do not properly disclose 
a departure from a relevant provision of the UK Corporate Governance Code.
We have nothing to report in respect 
of these matters.
Responsibilities of the directors
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial 
statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary  
to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the Directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s and the Company’s ability to continue as a going 
concern, disclosing as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Directors 
either intend to liquidate the Group or the Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, 
but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. 
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be 
expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit for the financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting Council’s website 
at: www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor’s report.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. 
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them 
in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone 
other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed. 79

Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006.
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:
• the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are 
prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and
• the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.
In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and the Company and their environment obtained in the course  
of the audit, we have not identified any material misstatements in the Strategic Report or the Directors’ Report.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
Adequacy of explanations received and accounting records
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Company, or returns adequate 
for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or
• the Company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting 
records and returns.
We have nothing to report in respect 
of these matters.
Directors’ remuneration
• Under the Companies Act 2006 we are also required to report if in our opinion certain 
disclosures of Directors’ remuneration have not been made or the part of the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report to be audited is not in agreement with the accounting records 
and returns.
We have nothing to report arising from 
these matters.
Report on other legal and regulatory requirements 
Other matters

2017 and subsequent financial periods. The period of total uninterrupted engagement including previous renewals and reappointments of the 
firm is 1 year.
Consistency of the audit report with the additional report to the Audit Committee

Notes to the Consolidated  
Financial Statements
1. Accounting policies 
Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in 
accordance with International Accounting Standards (IAS) and 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and related 
interpretations issued by the IASB and the European Union (IFRS 
as adopted by EU). They are prepared on the basis of all IFRS 
accounting standards and interpretations that are mandatory for 
the periods ending 24 March 2017 and in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006 applicable to Companies reporting under 
IFRS and Article 4 of the EU IAS regulations. The comparative 
information has been prepared on the same basis.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on  
a historic cost basis, except for the recording of pensions assets  
and liabilities and the revaluation of certain derivative financial 
liabilities instruments.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS  
requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also 
requires management to exercise its judgement in the process  
of applying the Group’s accounting policies. The areas involving  
a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where 
assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated 
financial statements are disclosed on page 91.
Reorganisation
On 20 October 2016, the Group completed the initial public offering 
(IPO) of its Ordinary Shares, was admitted to the premium listing 
segment of the Official List of the Financial Conduct Authority and
is trading on the London Stock Exchange.
The Company was initially incorporated on 18 August 2016, with its 
registered office situated in the United Kingdom.
Prior to listing, the Company became the holding company of the
Group through the acquisition of the full share capital of Wasteholdco
1 Limited and its subsidiaries (the Existing Group). Shares in 
Wasteholdco 1 Limited, an entity formerly owned primarily by GL 
Europe Luxembourg S.à.r.l, Botticelli LLC and Sankaty European 
Investments S.à.r.l, the former equity sponsors and principal 
shareholders, were exchanged for 104, 194,841 shares in the 
Company. These shares were issued and credited as fully paid
of £0.01 each.
The transaction does not meet the definition of a business 
combination under IFRS 3 Business Combinations and as such,
falls outside the scope of that standard. As a consequence, following 
guidance from IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting 
Estimates and Errors, the integration of the Company has been 
prepared under merger accounting principles. This policy, which 
does not conflict with IFRS, reflects the economic substance of
the transaction.
Under these principles, the Group has presented its Financial 
Statements of the Group as though the current Group structure  
had always been in place. Accordingly, the results of the combined 
entities for both the current and prior period are presented as if the 
Group had been in existence throughout the periods presented, 
rather than from the restructuring date.
Going concern 
The Group’s business together with the factors likely to affect its 
future development, performance and position are set out in the 
business review on pages 20 to 23. The financial position of the 
company, its cashflows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities  
are described in the Financial Review on pages 24 to 25. 
The Group meets its day-to-day working capital requirements 
through its bank facilities. The current economic and political 
conditions create uncertainty, however, the Group’s forecasts and 
projections, taking account of reasonably possible changes in trading 
performance, show that the Group should be able to operate within 
the current level of its facilities. The Group has made a loss after tax in 
the reported period however having assessed the principal risks and 
other matters discussed in connection with the viability statement, the 
Directors consider it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in 
preparing the consolidated financial statements.
In addition see the Group’s viability statement set out on page 27 .
Basis of consolidation
The Group financial statements consolidate the financial statements 
of the Company and all of its subsidiaries. Subsidiaries are all entities 
over which the Group has the power to affect its returns. The Group 
reassesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and 
circumstances indicate that there are changes to its ability to govern. 
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is 
transferred to the Group and are de-consolidated from the date on 
which control ceases.
All intra-group transactions are eliminated as part of the consolidation 
process. Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed 
where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted  
by the Group. 
Changes in accounting policies and disclosures
The following standards have been adopted by the Group for the first 
time for the financial year beginning on or after 26 March 2016:
• Annual improvements to IFRS 2012
• Annual improvement to IFRS 2014
• Amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 38 Clarification of Acceptable 
Methods of Depreciation and Amortisation
• Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements
• Amendments to IFRS 1 1 Joint Arrangements
Adoption of the above has not led to any changes in accounting 
policies or had any material impact on the financial statements.
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, The Group 
has not applied the following new and revised IFRSs which have been 
issued but are not yet effective:
IFRS 9   Financial Instruments
IFRS 15    Revenue from Contracts with 
Customers
IFRS 16   Leases
IFRS 2 (amendments)  Classification and Measurement of 
Share-based Payment Transactions
IAS 7 (amendments) Disclosure Initiative
IAS 12 (amendments)  Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets  
for Unrealised Losses
IAS 40 (amendments) Investment Property
IFRIC 22    Foreign Currency Transactions and 
Advance Consideration
Annual improvements to IFRS Standard 2014-2016 cycle 85
www.biffa.co.uk
Financial Statements
Biffa plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
None of these are expected to have a significant effect on the 
consolidated financial statements of the Group, except the  
following set out below:
IFRS 9, ‘Financial instruments’, addresses the classification, 
measurement and recognition of financial assets and financial 
liabilities. IFRS 9 was issued in November 2009 and October 2010 
and endorsed by the EU in November 2016. It replaces the parts of 
IAS 39 that relate to the classification and measurement of financial 
instruments and is effective for periods commencing 1 January 2018.
 
IFRS 9 requires financial assets to be classified into two measurement 
categories: those measured as at fair value and those measured at 
amortised cost. The determination is made at initial recognition. The 
classification depends on the entity’s business model for managing 
its financial instruments and the contractual cash flow characteristics 
of the instrument. For financial liabilities, the standard retains most of 
the IAS 39 requirements. The main change is that, in cases where the 
fair value option is taken for financial liabilities, the fair value change 
due to an entity’s own credit risk is recorded in other comprehensive 
income rather than the income statement, unless this creates an 
accounting mismatch.
At this time the Group does not expect IFRS 9 will have a significant 
impact on its existing accounting policies for financial instruments, 
because the new rules have a more direct impact on the accounting 
treatment of financial assets to which the Group has limited exposure 
except for trade receivables. The key area of impact for the Group will 
be as a result of the introduction of the forward looking expected 
credit loss model.
Similarly the way that the Group currently deals with its hedge 
accounting transactions will not be significantly impacted by the move 
to IFRS 9. However it is likely that disclosures around the entity’s risk 
management strategy and the impact of hedge accounting on the 
financial statements will be increased.
As outlined above, the key area of impact for the Group will be as a 
result of the introduction of the forward looking expected credit loss 
model. During 2017 the Board will complete its detailed assessment 
of the impact of IFRS 9 ahead of adopting the standard from  
31 March 2018.
IFRS 15, ‘Revenue from contracts with customers’ deals with revenue 
recognition and establishes principles for reporting useful information 
to users of financial statements about the nature, amount, timing and 
uncertainty of revenue and cashflows arising from an entity’s 
contracts with customers.
Revenue is recognised when a customer obtains control of a  
good or service and thus has the ability to direct the use and  
obtain the benefits from the good or service. The standard replaces 
IAS 18 ‘Revenue’ and IAS 1 1 ‘Construction contracts’ and related 
interpretations. The standard is effective for annual periods beginning 
on or after 1 January 2018 and earlier application is permitted subject 
to EU endorsement. The Board is still in the process of reviewing  
the full impact of implementation but at this time the Group does  
not expect there to be any significant impact of the standard on 
revenue recognition within the Group which will continue to recognise 
revenue in line with current reporting. The standard includes detailed 
application guidance which will be considered across all business 
lines as part of the Group’s detailed review and implementation plan 
ahead of the implementation of the standard from 1 January 2018.
In January 2016 IFRS 16 – ‘Leases’ was issued. The Board is still  
in the process of reviewing the impact of IFRS 16 on the Group’s 
accounting policies. The Group currently leases both properties  
and plant and equipment under a series of operating leases which  
will be impacted by the new standard and these types of leases may 
need to be brought onto the Group’s statement of financial position 
from the date of the adoption of the new standard. As a consequence 
of this there is likely to be an impact on the Group’s statement of profit 
and loss where operating lease rentals are likely to be replaced by a 
depreciation charge and related interest charge. There will also be  
an increase to fixed assets and finance leases creditors on statement 
of financial position. The Board has not yet reached a decision 
whether the modified retrospective approach, whereby comparatives 
will not be restated on adoption of the new standards but instead  
a cumulative adjustment is reflected in retained earnings will be 
adopted or whether the prior year comparatives will be restated.
There are no other IFRSs or IFRIC interpretations that are not  
yet effective that would be expected to have a material impact  
on the Group. 
Business combinations
The Group accounts for acquisitions of businesses using the 
acquisition method. The consideration transferred in a business 
combination is measured at fair value, which is calculated as the  
sum of the acquisition-date fair values of the assets transferred to  
the Group, liabilities incurred by the Group to the former owners  
of the acquiree and the equity interests issued by the Group in 
exchange for control of the acquiree. Acquisition-related costs  
are generally recognised in profit or loss as incurred.
At the acquisition date, the identifiable assets acquired and the 
liabilities assumed are recognised at their fair value, except that:
• deferred tax assets or liabilities, and assets or liabilities related  
to employee benefit arrangements are recognised and measured 
in accordance with IAS 12 ‘Income taxes’ and IAS 19 ‘Employee 
benefits’ respectively;
• liabilities or equity measurements related to share-based payment 
arrangements of the acquiree or share-based payment 
arrangements of the Group entered into to replace share-based 
payment arrangements of the acquiree are measured in 
accordance with IFRS 2 at the acquisition date; and
• assets (or disposal groups) that are classified as held for sale in 
accordance with IFRS 5 ‘Non-current Assets Held for Sale and 
Discontinued Operations’ are measured in accordance with  
that Standard.
Goodwill is measured as the excess of the sum of the consideration 
transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interests in the 
acquiree, and the fair value of the acquirer’s previously held equity 
interest in the acquiree (if any) over the net of the acquisition date 
amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities 
assumed. If, after reassessment, the net of the acquisition date 
amounts of the identifiable assets and acquired and the liabilities 
assumed exceeds the sum of the consideration transferred, the 
amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree and the fair 
value of the acquirer’s previously held interest in the acquiree (if any), 
the excess is recognised immediately in profit or loss as a bargain 
purchase gain. www.biffa.co.uk

1. Accounting policies continued
When the consideration transferred by the Group in a business 
combination includes assets or liabilities resulting from a contingent 
consideration arrangement, the contingent consideration is  
measured at its acquisition date fair value and included as part of the 
consideration transferred in a business combination. Changes in the 
fair value of the contingent consideration that qualify as measurement 
period adjustments are adjusted retrospectively, with corresponding 
adjustments against goodwill. Measurement period adjustments are 
adjustments that arise from additional information obtained during the 
‘measurement period’ (which cannot exceed one year from the 
acquisition date) about facts and circumstances that existed at the 
acquisition date.
 
If the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete by 
the end of the reporting period in which the combination occurs,  
the Group reports provisional amounts for the items for which the 
accounting is incomplete. Those provisional amounts are adjusted 
during the measurement period (see above), or additional assets or 
liabilities are recognised, to reflect new information obtained about 
facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition date that, if 
known, would have affected the amounts recognised at that date.
Goodwill
Goodwill is initially recognised and measured as set out above.
Goodwill is tested annually for impairment or if there is an indication  
of impairment. Gains and losses on the disposal of a cash generating 
unit include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to that cash 
generating unit.
For the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to  
each of the Group’s cash-generating units (or groups of cash-
generating units) that is expected to benefit from the synergies of  
the combination. If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating 
unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss  
is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill 
allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata 
on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit.
Gains and losses on the disposal of a cash generating unit include 
the carrying amount of goodwill relating to that cash generating unit.
Segmental reporting 
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the 
internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision-maker 
(CODM). The chief operating decision-maker, who is responsible for 
allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating 
segments has been identified as the Group Executive Team.
The Group’s internal reporting structure is aligned on the same basis 
and segmental information is presented on a basis consistent with 
this reporting structure.
Revenue recognition
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received  
or receivable. Revenue is reduced for value added taxes and trade 
discounts. Landfill tax is included within both revenue and cost 
of sales.
When the outcome of a transaction involving the rendering of services 
can be estimated reliably, revenue associated with the transaction
shall be recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the 
transaction at the end of the reporting period. 
Municipal collection and environmental services revenue is  
recognised in accordance with quantities specified in the agreed 
customer contracts.
Other collection revenue is recognised on collection of waste  
from customer sites.
Revenue from waste processing, treatment and landfill facilities is 
recognised when waste is physically received at the Group sites. 
Energy generation revenue is recognised at the point that power is 
supplied to the customer based on the quantity of units supplied.
Interest income from a financial asset is recognised when it is 
probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and  
the amount of income can be measured reliably. Interest income is 
accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding 
and at the effective interest rate applicable, which is the rate that 
exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the 
expected life of the financial asset to that asset’s net carrying  
amount on initial recognition. 
 
Leasing
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the 
lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership  
to the lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Assets held under finance leases are initially recognised as assets  
of the Group at their fair value at the inception of the lease or, if  
lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments. The 
corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the consolidated 
statement of financial position as a finance lease obligation.
Lease payments are apportioned between finance expenses and 
reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of 
interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance expenses  
are recognised immediately in profit or loss, unless they are directly 
attributable to qualifying assets, in which case they are capitalised  
in accordance with the Group’s general policy on borrowing costs.
Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense on a 
straight-line basis over the lease term, except where another 
systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern in  
which economic benefits from the leased asset are consumed.
In the event that lease incentives are received to enter into operating 
leases, such incentives are recognised as a liability. The aggregate 
benefit of incentives is recognised as a reduction of rental expense  
on a straight-line basis, except where another systematic basis is 
more representative of the time pattern in which economic benefits 
from the leased asset are consumed. 87

Foreign currencies
In preparing the financial information of each individual Group entity, 
transactions in currencies other than the entity’s functional currency 
(foreign currencies) are recognised at the rates of exchange prevailing 
at the dates of the transactions. At the end of each reporting period, 
monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated  
at the rates prevailing at that date. Non-monetary items that are 
measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are  
not retranslated.
Exchange differences on monetary items are recognised in profit  
or loss in the period in which they arise except for:
• exchange differences on foreign currency borrowings relating  
to assets under construction for future productive use, which  
are included in the cost of those assets when they are  
recognised as an adjustment to interest costs on those  
foreign currency borrowings;
• exchange differences on monetary items receivable from or 
payable to a foreign operation for which settlement is neither 
planned nor likely to occur (therefore forming part of the net 
investment in the foreign operation), which are recognised initially  
in other comprehensive income and reclassified from equity to 
profit or loss on repayment of the monetary items.
For the purposes of presenting these consolidated financial 
statements, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s foreign operations 
are translated into sterling using the exchange rates prevailing at  
the end of each reporting period. Income and expense items are 
translated at the average exchange rates for the period, unless 
exchange rates fluctuate significantly during that period, in which 
case the exchange rates at the dates of the transactions are used. 
Exchange differences arising, if any, are recognised in other 
comprehensive income and accumulated in equity.
Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction 
or production of qualifying assets, which are assets that necessarily 
take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use  
or sale, are added to the cost of those assets, until such time as the 
assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale.
All other borrowing costs are recognised in profit or loss in the period 
in which they are incurred.
Government grants
Government grants are not recognised until there is reasonable 
assurance that the Group will comply with the conditions attaching  
to them and that the grants will be received.
Government grants are recognised in profit or loss on a systematic 
basis over the periods in which the Group recognises as expenses 
the related costs for which the grants are intended to compensate. 
Specifically, government grants whose primary condition is that the 
Group should purchase, construct or otherwise acquire non-current 
assets are recognised as deferred revenue in the consolidated 
statement of financial position and transferred to profit or loss  
on a systematic and rational basis over the useful lives of the  
related assets.
Employee benefits
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit plans are 
recognised as an expense when employees have rendered service 
entitling them to the contributions.
For defined benefit retirement benefit plans, the cost of providing 
benefits is determined using the projected unit credit method, with 
actuarial valuations being carried out at the end of each annual 
reporting period. Remeasurement, comprising actuarial gains  
and losses and the return on plan assets (excluding interest), is 
reflected immediately in the statement of financial position with a 
charge or credit recognised in other comprehensive income in the 
period in which they occur. Remeasurement recognised in other 
comprehensive income is reflected immediately in retained earnings 
and will not be reclassified to profit or loss. Past service cost is 
recognised in profit or loss in the period of a plan amendment. Net 
interest is calculated by applying the discount rate at the beginning  
of the period to the net defined benefit liability or asset. Defined 
benefit costs are categorised as follows:
• service cost (including current service cost, past service cost as 
well as gains and losses on curtailments and settlements);
• net interest expense or income; and
• remeasurement.
The Group presents service costs in operating costs and net interest 
expense or income is included in finance income. Curtailment gains 
and losses are accounted for as past service costs.
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the consolidated 
statement of financial position represents the actual deficit or surplus 
in the Group’s defined benefit plans. Any surplus resulting from this 
calculation is limited to the present value of any economic benefits 
available in the form of refunds from the plans or reductions in future 
contributions to the plans.
For defined contribution plans, the Group pays contributions to 
publicly or privately administered pension plans on a contractual  
or voluntary basis. The Group recognises contributions payable  
to these plans in exchange for employee services in employee  
benefit expense.
A liability for a termination benefit is recognised at the earlier of when 
the entity can no longer withdraw the offer of the termination benefit 
and when the entity recognises any related restructuring costs.
A liability is recognised for benefits accruing to employees in respect 
of wages and salaries, annual leave and sick leave in the period the 
related service is rendered at the undiscounted amount of the 
benefits expected to be paid in exchange for that service.
Liabilities recognised in respect of short-term employee benefits are 
measured at the undiscounted amount of the benefits expected to be 
paid in exchange for the related service.
Share based payment plans
The Group’s management awards employee share options, from  
time to time, on a discretionary basis which are subject to vesting 
conditions. The economic cost of awarding the share options to  
its employees is recognised as an employee benefit expense in  
the income statement equivalent to the fair value of the benefit 
awarded. The fair value is determined by reference to the schotastic 
pricing model. The charge is recognised over the vesting period of 
the award. www.biffa.co.uk

Exceptional items
Exceptional items are those that in the Directors’ view are required to 
be separately disclosed by virtue of their size or incidence to enable a 
full understanding of the Group’s performance.
Taxation
Income tax represents the sum of the tax currently payable and 
deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. 
Taxable profit differs from ‘profit before tax’ as reported in the 
consolidated statement of profit or loss because of items of income 
or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and items 
that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s current tax is 
calculated using rates that have been enacted or substantively 
enacted by the end of the reporting period.
Deferred tax is recognised on temporary differences between  
the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the consolidated 
financial information and the corresponding tax bases used in the 
computation of taxable profit. Deferred tax liabilities are generally 
recognised for all taxable temporary differences. Deferred tax assets 
are generally recognised for all deductible temporary differences  
to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available 
against which those deductible temporary differences can be utilised. 
Such deferred tax assets and liabilities are not recognised if the 
temporary difference arises from the initial recognition (other than in  
a business combination) of assets and liabilities in a transaction that 
affects neither the taxable profit not the accounting profit. In addition, 
deferred tax liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference 
arises from the initial recognition of goodwill.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end of 
each reporting period and reduced to the extent that it is no longer 
probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or 
part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax liabilities and assets are measured at the tax rates that 
are expected to apply in the period in which the liability is settled or 
the asset realised, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been 
enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period.
The measurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets reflects the tax 
consequences that would follow from the manner in which the Group 
expects, at the end of the reporting period, to recover or settle the 
carrying amount of its assets and liabilities.
Current and deferred tax are recognised in profit or loss, except when 
they relate to items that are recognised in other comprehensive 
income or directly in equity, in which case, the current and deferred 
tax are also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in 
equity respectively. Where current or deferred tax arises from the 
initial accounting of a business combination, the tax effect is included 
in accounting for the business combination.
Property, plant and equipment
Landfill sites are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation and 
accumulated impairment losses. The cost of landfill sites includes the 
cost of acquiring, developing and engineering sites. There are no 
directly attributable borrowing costs. Property, plant and equipment 
is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated 
impairment losses.
Depreciation is recognised so as to write off the cost of assets less 
their residual value over their useful economic lives. The estimated 
useful lives, residual values and depreciation method are reviewed at 
the end of each reporting period, with the effect of any changes in 
estimate accounted for on a prospective basis.
In the year depreciation was recognised so as to write off the assets 
on the below basis:
• Buildings – length of lease straight line method
• Plant, vehicles and equipment – 4-15 years straight line method 
• Landfill sites – void consumed
Where the obligation to restore a landfill site is an integral part of its 
future economic benefits, a non-current asset within property, plant 
and equipment is recognised. The asset recognised is depreciated 
based on the usage of void space and energy production.
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected 
useful lives on the same basis as owned assets. However, when there 
is no reasonable certainty that ownership will be obtained by the end 
of the lease term, assets are depreciated over the shorter of the lease 
term and their useful lives.
An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon 
disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected to arise 
from the continued use of the asset. Any gain or loss arising on the 
disposal or retirement of an item of property, plant and equipment is 
determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the 
carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in profit or loss.
Intangible assets
Intangible assets with finite useful lives that are acquired separately 
are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated 
impairment losses. Amortisation is recognised on a straight line basis 
over their estimated useful lives. The estimated useful life and 
amortisation method are reviewed at the end of each reporting
period, with the effect of any changes in estimate being accounted for 
on a prospective basis. Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives
that are acquired separately are carried at cost less accumulated 
impairment losses.
The following useful lives have been applied to the intangible assets 
during the period:
• Customer contracts – 3-20 years
• IT development – 3–5 years
• Landfill gas rights – Length of projected profitable gas extraction 
based on landfill site content degradation  89

Financial Statements
Biffa plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
An internally generated intangible asset arising from development  
(or from the development phase of an internal project) is recognised  
if, and only if, all of the following have been demonstrated:
• the technical feasibility of completing the intangible asset so that  
it will be available for use of sale;
• the intention to complete the intangible asset and use or sell it;
• the ability to use or sell the intangible asset;
• how the intangible asset will generate probable future  
economic benefits;
• the availability of adequate technical, financial and other resources 
to complete the development and to use or sell the intangible 
asset; and
• the ability to measure reliably the expenditure attributable to the 
intangible asset during its development.
The amount initially recognised for internally-generated intangible 
assets is the sum of the expenditure incurred from the date when  
the intangible asset first meets the criteria listed above. When no 
internally generated intangible asset can be recognised, development 
expenditure is recognised in profit or loss in the period in which it is 
incurred. Expenditure on research activities is recognised as an 
expense in the period in which it is incurred.
Subsequent to initial recognition, internally generated intangible 
assets are reported at cost less accumulated amortisation and 
accumulated impairment losses on the same basis as intangible 
assets that are acquired separately.
An intangible asset is derecognised on disposal, or when no future 
economic benefits are expected from use or disposal. Gains or 
losses arising from derecognition of an intangible asset, measured  
as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying 
amount of the asset, are recognised in profit or loss when the asset  
is derecognised.
Pre-contract costs
Pre-contract costs are expensed as incurred until the group is 
appointed preferred bidder. Preferred bidder status provides  
sufficient confidence that the conclusion of the contract is probable, 
the outcome can be measured reliably and is expected to generate 
sufficient net cash inflows to enable recovery.
 
Pre-contract costs incurred subsequent to appointment as preferred 
bidder are capitalised onto the statement of financial position. The 
capitalised balance is expensed to the statement of profit or loss over 
the period of the contract. Costs, which have been expensed, are not 
subsequently reinstated when a contract award is achieved.
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets other  
than goodwill
Assets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to  
amortisation and are tested annually for impairment.
Assets that are subject to amortisation or depreciation are reviewed 
for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the 
carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is 
recognised for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount 
exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the 
higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. For the 
purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the  
lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash  
flows (cash generating units).
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. 
Costs of inventories are determined on a first-in-first-out basis. 
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price for 
inventories less estimated costs of completion and costs 
necessary to make the sale. Full provision is made for obsolete  
or defective stock.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation 
(legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that the 
Group will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate 
can be made of the obligation.
The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the 
consideration required to settle the present obligation at the end of 
the reporting period, taking into account the risks and uncertainties 
surrounding the obligation. When a provision is measured using the 
cash flows estimated to settle the present obligation, its carrying 
amount is the present value of those cash flows (when the effect
of the time value of money is material). The effects of inflation and 
unwinding of the discount element on existing provisions are  
reflected in the financial statements as a finance charge.
When some or all of the economic benefits required to settle  
a provision are expected to be recovered from a third party, a 
receivable is recognised as an asset if it is virtually certain that 
reimbursement will be received and the amount of the receivable  
can be measured reliably.
Provisions for the cost of restoring landfill sites and aftercare costs are 
made as the obligation to restore the site arises. Costs are charged to 
the profit or loss over the operational life on the basis of the usage of 
void space for each landfill site. The restoration obligation is typically 
fulfilled within 2 years of the landfill site being closed to waste.
Provisions for aftercare costs are made as the aftercare liability arises. 
Costs are charged to the profit or loss over the operational life of each 
landfill site on the basis of usage of void space. When the obligation 
recognised as a provision gives access to future economic benefits, 
an asset in property, plant and equipment is recognised. The asset is 
depreciated over the period of gas generation. Aftercare costs are 
provided for based on the Directors’ expectation that the obligation 
will have been fulfilled 60 years post closure of the site.
Onerous contracts
Present obligations arising under onerous contracts are recognised 
and measured as provisions. An onerous contract is considered to 
exist where the Group has a contract under which the unavoidable 
costs of meeting the obligations under the contract exceed the 
economic benefits expected to be received from the contract. www.biffa.co.uk

1. Accounting policies continued
Financial Instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when a  
group entity becomes a party to the contractual provisions of  
the instruments.
Financial assets and financial liabilities are initially measured at fair 
value. Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition 
or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities (other than financial 
assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss) are 
added to or deducted from the fair value of the financial assets or 
financial liabilities, as appropriate, on initial recognition. Transaction 
costs directly attributable to the acquisition of financial assets or 
financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are recognised 
immediately in profit or loss.
Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date the entity 
becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument and 
are subsequently remeasured at their fair value at each balance sheet 
date. The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends 
on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument and 
the nature of the item being hedged.
The Group designates certain derivatives as either a) fair value hedge 
(hedges of the fair value of recognised assets or liabilities; or b) cash 
flow hedge (hedges of a particular risk associated with a recognised 
asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction); or c) net 
investment hedge (hedges of net investments in foreign operations).
The Group documents the transaction relationship between the 
hedging instruments and hedged items at inception. At inception and 
at each reporting date the Group assesses whether the derivatives 
used have been highly effective in offsetting changes in the fair value 
of hedged items.
The fair values of derivative instruments used for hedging are shown 
in note 18. Movements in the hedging reserve are shown in the 
statement of changes in equity.
At the reporting date the Group has no fair value hedges or net 
investment hedges.
Cash flow hedge
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that  
are designated as cash flow hedges are recognised in equity. The 
Group’s cash flow hedges in respect of forward foreign exchange 
contracts result in recognition in either profit and loss or in the 
hedging reserve.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when the hedge no 
longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain  
or loss in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when
the forecast transaction occurs. When a forecast transaction is no 
longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was 
reported in equity will be transferred to the statement of profit or loss.
Changes in the fair value of any derivative instruments that do not 
qualify for hedge accounting are recognised immediately in the 
statement of profit or loss.
Financial assets 
All regular way purchases or sales of financial assets are recognised 
and derecognised on a trade date basis. Regular way purchases or 
sales are purchases or sales of financial assets that require delivery  
of assets with the timeframe established by regulation or convention 
in the marketplace.
Financial assets are classified into the following specified categories: 
financial assets at ‘fair value through profit or loss’ (FVTPL) and ‘loans 
and receivables’.
Effective interest method
The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised 
cost of a debt instrument and of allocating interest income over the 
relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly 
discounts estimated future cash receipts (including all fees and points 
paid or received that form an integral part of the effective interest rate, 
transaction costs and other premiums or discounts) through the 
expected life of the debt instrument, or, where appropriate, a shorter 
period, to the net carrying amount on initial recognition.
Income is recognised on an effective interest basis for debt 
instruments other than those financial assets classified as at FVTPL.
Financial assets at FVTLP
Financial assets are classified as at FVTPL when the financial asset  
is either held for trading or it is designated as at FVTPL.
A financial asset is held for trading if:
• it has been acquired principally for the purpose of selling it in the 
near term; or
• on initial recognition it is part of a portfolio of identified financial 
instruments that the Group manages together and has a recent 
actual pattern of short-term profit-taking; or
• it is a derivative that is not designated and effective as a  
hedging instrument.
A financial asset other than a financial asset held for trading may be 
designated as FVTPL upon initial recognition if:
• such designation eliminates or significantly reduces a 
measurement or recognition inconsistency that would otherwise 
arise; or
• the financial asset forms part of a group of financial assets or 
financial liabilities or both, which is managed and its performance 
is evaluated on a fair value basis, in accordance with the Group’s 
documented risk management or investment strategy, and 
information about the grouping is provided internally on that  
basis; or
• it forms part of a contract containing one or more embedded 
derivatives, and IAS 39 permits the entire combined contract to  
be designated as FVTPL.
Financial assets at FVTPL are stated at fair value, with any gains or 
losses arising on re-measurement recognised in profit or loss.
Trade and other receivables
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value less any provision 
for impairment. They are subsequently held at amortised cost less 
provision for impairment. A provision for impairment is established 
when there is objective evidence that amounts due will not be 
recoverable. When a trade receivable is considered uncollectible,  
it is written off and recognised in the statement of profit or loss. 91

Financial Statements
Biffa plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Impairment of financial assets
Financial assets, other than those at FVTPL, are assessed for 
indicators of impairment at the end of each reporting period.  
Financial assets are considered to be impaired when there is 
objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events that 
occurred after the initial recognition of the financial asset, the 
estimated future cash flows of the investment have been affected. 
For certain categories of financial assets, such as trade receivables, 
assets are assessed for impairment on a collective basis even if they 
were assessed not to be impaired individually. Objective evidence  
of impairment for a portfolio of receivables could include the Group’s 
past experience of collecting payments, an increase in the number of 
delayed payments in the portfolio past the average credit period, as 
well as observable changes in national or local economic conditions 
that correlate with default on receivables. 
The carrying amount of the financial asset is reduced by the 
impairment loss directly for all financial assets with the exception  
of trade receivables, where the carrying amount is reduced through 
the use of an allowance account. When a trade receivable is 
considered uncollectible, it is written off against the allowance 
account. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off  
are credited against the allowance account. Changes in the carrying 
amount of the allowance account are recognised in profit or loss.
Derecognition of financial assets
The Group derecognises a financial asset when the contractual  
rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or when it transfers  
the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of 
ownership of the asset to another party.
On derecognition of a financial asset, the difference between the 
asset’s carrying amount and the sum of the consideration received 
and receivable and the cumulative gain or loss that had been 
recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in 
equity is recognised in profit or loss.
Financial liabilities and equity instruments
Borrowings
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction 
costs incurred. Any difference between the amount initially 
recognised (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value
is recognised in the statement of profit or loss over the period of  
the borrowings using the effective interest method.
Commitment and borrowing fees are capitalised as part of the
loan and amortised over the life of the relevant agreement. All other 
borrowing costs are recognised in the statement of profit or loss in 
the period in which they are incurred.
Borrowings are classified as non-current liabilities where the Group 
has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 
12 months after the balance sheet date.
Derecognition of financial liabilities
The Group derecognises financial liabilities when, and only when,  
the Group’s obligations are discharged, cancelled or they expire.  
The difference between the carrying amount of the financial liability 
derecognised and the consideration paid and payable is recognised 
in profit or loss.
Equity instruments
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest 
in the assets of an entity after deducting all of its liabilities. Equity 
instruments issued by a group entity are recognised as the proceeds 
received, net of direct issue costs.
Debt and equity instruments issued by a group entity are classified as 
either financial liabilities or as equity in accordance with the substance 
of the contractual arrangements and the definitions of a financial 
liability and an equity instrument.
Other financial liabilities (including borrowings and trade and other 
payables) are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the 
effective interest method.
Share capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity and recorded at par value  
of proceeds received. Where shares are issued above par value, the 
proceeds in excess of par value are recorded in the share premium 
account net of direct issue costs. 
Dividend distribution
Final dividend distribution to the Company’s shareholders is 
recognised as a liability in the financial statements in the period  
in which the dividends are approved. Interim dividends are 
recognised when paid.
Critical accounting judgements and key sources of  
estimation uncertainty
The Group does not have any critical judgements in the process  
of applying the Group’s accounting policies.
The Group’s valuation of goodwill in the Energy division is supported 
by the valuation of the operating segment assets which is based on 
derived market valuations and projected EBITDA. The valuation is 
sensitive to both changes in the market conditions and changes in 
the estimates used in calculating budgeted EBITDA. Budgets 
comprise forecasts of revenue, staff costs and overheads based on 
current and anticipated market conditions that have been considered 
and approved by the Board. The valuation is sensitive to changes  
in these assumptions which could cause a material adjustment to  
the carrying amount of segmental assets and liabilities within the  
next year.
The Group is required to make annual estimates and assumptions  
in relation to the discount rate, inflation rate and life expectancy for 
defined benefit schemes, see note 28.
The Group activities result in commitments for environmental and 
aftercare costs and accordingly the Group is required to make 
estimates for provisions. These estimates depend upon the outcome 
of future events and may need to be revised if circumstances change. www.biffa.co.uk

2. Segmental information
The Group is managed by type of business and is organised into four 
operating divisions. These divisions represent the business segments 
in which the Group reports its primary segment information and are 
consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating 
decision maker. The chief operating decision maker, who is 
responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of 
the operating segments, has been identified as the Group Executive 
Team. The activities of the divisions are detailed on page 4. The 
Group’s segmental results are as follows: 
Revenue within segments is eliminated on consolidation.
Revenue between and within segments is eliminated  
on consolidation.

there is therefore no secondary reporting format by geographical 
segment. There is no single customer that accounts for more than

3. Other items
The Group’s financial performance is analysed into two components; 
underlying performance (which excludes other items), and other 
items. Underlying performance is used by management to monitor 
financial performance as it is considered it aids comparability of the 
reported financial performance year to year.
Other items includes exceptional items, amortisation of acquisition 
intangibles and the impact of real discount rate changes in landfill 
provisions.
Management utilises an exceptional item framework which has been 
approved by the Board. This follows a three step process which 
considers the nature of the event, the financial materiality involved and 
the particular facts and circumstances. Items of income and expense 
that are considered by management for designation as exceptional 
items include items such as significant corporate restructuring costs, 
acquisition related costs, write downs or impairments of non-current 
assets, movements on onerous contract provisions and strategy 
related costs including the implementation of Project Fusion.

Acquisition related costs
The £1.2 million of acquisition related expenditure in the 52 weeks 
ended 24 March 2017 relates to professional fees and other costs 
which are directly attributable to acquisitions. This includes £0.8m  
in relation to the acquisition of 100 % of the issued share capital of 
Cory Environmental Municipal Services Limited.
The £0.4 million of acquisition related expenditure in the 52 weeks 
ended 25 March 2016 includes £0.3 million in relation to the 
acquisition of PHS Chemical Waste Limited and the trading assets  
of Enviroco Limited’s Sheffield-based hazardous waste business. 
Corporate restructuring costs
Corporate restructuring costs are largely professional fees directly 
related to the admission of the Group’s share capital to the London 
Stock Exchange including amounts relating to the ongoing EVP case.
Finance charges and income were incurred on the early repayment of 
the pre-IPO borrowing facilities as part of the corporate restructuring. 
Onerous contracts
Onerous contract costs reflect all movement on onerous service 
contract provisions.
Strategy related costs
Strategy related costs relate to discontinued operations, any major 
business turnaround and Project Fusion.
Strategy related costs in the 52 weeks ended 24 March 2017 primarily 
relate to the Group’s system replacement programme Project Fusion 
(£0.5 million in the 52 weeks ended 25 March 2016).
Amortisation of acquisition intangibles
Amortisation of acquisition intangibles represents the amount 
amortised by the Group in each period in respect of intangibles from 
prior acquisitions, which are reported separately from the Group’s 
depreciation and amortisation charges.
Impact of real discount rate changes to landfill provisions
Impact of real discount rate changes to landfill provisions reflects the 
impact on provisions which arises wholly due to the change in 
discount rate on landfill provisions as this is not reflective of 
operational performance.
The tax impact of other items is calculated as 20% (2016: 20%) of the 
expenses allowable in calculating the taxable profit.

Finance (No.2) Act 2016, which provides for reductions in the  
main rate of corporation tax from 20% to 19% effective from  
1 April 2017 and to 17% effective from 1 April 2020, was enacted  
on 15 September 2016. As deferred tax assets and liabilities are 
measured at the rates that are expected to apply in the periods of 
the reversal, deferred tax balances at the balance sheet date have 
been calculated at the rate at which the relevant balance is expected 
to be recovered or settled.
Continuing focus on tax reform during 2016/17 specifically the 
OECD’s Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) project to address 
mismatches in international rules resulted in draft legislation on areas 
such as interest deductibility being issues during the year. We will 
continue to monitor developments and assess the potential impact 
for Biffa of these and any further initiatives.
Whilst the UK remains part of the EU the evolution of the application 
of EU tax competition regulations continues to create uncertainty 
over tax legislations and at this stage it is not possible to quantify the 
impact on the financial statements.
As the Group’s presence is mainly in the UK we do not envisage a 
significant impact on the Group following the decision of the UK 
government to invoke Article 50 to leave the EU.

Basic earnings per ordinary share are based on the Group profit for 
the year and a weighted average of 121,889,489 (2016: 27 ,038,437)

An adjusted earnings per ordinary share figure has been presented to 
eliminate the effects of exceptional items, amortisation of acquisition 
intangibles and the impact of the change in the real discount rate to 
long term provisions. The presentation shows the trend in earnings 
per ordinary share that is attributable to the underlying trading 
activities of the Group.

11. Acquisitions
52 weeks ended 25 March 2016
On 29 September 2015, Biffa Waste Services Limited, a 100% 
owned subsidiary of Wasteholdco 1 Limited, acquired 100% of  
the share capital of PHS Chemical Waste Limited owned by PHS 
Group Limited. 
Assets with a fair value of £0.3 million and liabilities of £1. 1 million
were acquired for consideration of £3. 1 million, resulting in goodwill of
£3.9 million being recognised. Since acquisition the PHS Chemical 
Waste business has generated revenue of £4.6 million and profit 
before tax of £0.6 million. If the acquisition of PHS Chemical Waste 
had been completed on the first day of the financial year, Group 
revenues for the period would have increased by £9.2 million to 
£936.7 million and loss before tax would have increased by £1.2 
million to £4. 1 million. 
On 1 November 2015, Biffa Waste Services Limited acquired 100% 
of the share capital of Commercial Waste Limited.
Assets with a fair value of £1.4m and liabilities of £1.2m were acquired 
for consideration of £2.0m, resulting in goodwill of £1.8m being 
recognised. Since acquisition the Commercial Waste business has 
generated revenue of £1.8 million and profit before tax of £0.3 million. 
If the acquisition of Commercial Waste Limited had been completed 
on the first day of the financial year, Group revenues for the period 
would have increased by £4.7 million to £932.2 million and profit 
before tax would have increased by £0.7 million to £3.6 million.
Biffa Waste Services Limited acquired the business and assets of  
six further businesses during the 52 weeks ended 25 March 2016. 
Tangible assets with a fair value of £1.9 million were acquired for 
consideration of £3.6 million, resulting in goodwill of £1.7 million 
recognised. If the acquisition of these six businesses had been 
completed on the first day of the financial year, Group revenues for 
the period would have increased by £12.9 million to £940.4 million 
and profit before tax would have increased by £1.4 million to 
£4.3million.
The goodwill recognised on acquisition of £7 .4 million represents 
future opportunities in the UK integrated waste management sector. 
None of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for corporation  
tax purposes.
52 weeks ended 24 March 2017
On 8 June 2016, the Group acquired 100% of the issued share 
capital of Cory Environmental Municipal Services Limited. Cory 
Environmental Municipal Services Limited is a waste management 
business servicing commercial customers in the South East and 
South West of England and municipal customers in Cornwall, Lincoln, 
Rutland and Tunbridge Wells. Cory Environmental Municipal Services 
Limited was acquired in order to extend the Group’s commercial and 
municipal customer base.
During the year, the Group acquired the trade waste collection 
business of McGrath Bros Waste Control Limited on 1 June 2016,  
the business of Blakeley’s Recycling Limited on 1 November 2016 
and the trade waste collection business of Orion Support Services 
Limited on 1 December 2016, and trade and assets of Yorwaste  
Limited on 6 March 2017 . Tangible assets of £1.7 million were 
acquired for cash consideration of £3.4 million resulting in goodwill of 
£1.4m being recognised. If these acquisitions had been completed on 
the first day of the financial year, group revenues for the period would 
have increased by £5.9m and group profit would have increased by
£0. 1 million.

assets acquired and liabilities assumed are as set out in the

cash flows not to be collected is £0.2 million.
No contingent liabilities were identified at the acquisition date.
Acquisition-related costs included in exceptional costs amount to 
£0.8 million.
Cory Environmental Municipal Services Limited contributed  
£26.3 million revenue and £1. 1 million to the Group’s profit before  
tax for the period between the date of acquisition and the balance 
sheet date.
If the acquisition of Cory Environmental Municipal Services Limited 
had been completed on the first day of the financial year, group 
revenues for the period would have increased by £31.6 million and 
group profit would have increased by £1.3 million. 97

The preliminary total goodwill of £6. 1 million arising from these

The Group reviews at each reporting period whether there are any 
indicators of impairment in accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of 
assets. An annual impairment review is completed by comparing the 
carrying amount of the goodwill for each operating segment to its 
recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of its fair 
value less costs of disposal and its value in use. If the recoverable 
amount is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is 
allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of the goodwill and then 
to the assets of the cash generating unit. In the current year the 
Energy division has been valued on the basis of fair value less costs 
of disposal rather than value in use on the basis that it is the higher  
of the two valuations. This is a different method to the prior period.
The key assumptions when calculating the value in use are forecast 
revenue and costs. Management’s calculation of value in use has 
been developed from forecast five year cash flows which are 
prepared on the basis of past performance, expectation of future 
performance and market information. The value in use has been 
calculated on the basis of up to 20 years discounted future cash flow. 
The final year growth rate assumption used beyond the 5 year plan 
period based on market trends, after adjusting for assumed inflation 
is 2.0% (2016: 2.0%). This is considered appropriate based on the 
long term nature of the business. A pre-tax discount rate of 7 .5% 
(2016: 7 .0%,) was applied across all CGUs as the inherent risks have 
been included in the segmental cash flow forecasts. No reasonably 
foreseeable change in the assumptions used in the value in use 
calculations would cause an impairment.
The cash generating unit recoverable amount for the Energy division 
has been based on operating segment in accordance with IAS 36 as 
this is the level at which the chief operating decision maker is 
provided with internal reporting for the purpose of allocating 
resources and assessing performance. For the purpose of calculating 
the fair value less costs of disposal the segment has been split into 
key components that have been identified as the AD business, landfill 
gas business and the West Sussex contract. The calculation of fair 
value less costs of disposal utilises a price to earnings multiple 
approach based on the most recent Board approved budget for  
the landfill gas and AD businesses. The price to earnings multiple  
is derived from market observable data for a broadly comparable 
business. The West Sussex contract has been valued on the basis  
of the present value of the cash flows over the remaining life of the 
contract. The determination of the fair value less costs of disposal 
uses Level 3 valuation techniques.
The valuation of goodwill allocated to the Energy CGU group is most 
sensitive to the achievement of the 2017/18 budget. Budgets 
comprise forecasts of revenue, staff costs and overheads based on 
current and anticipated market conditions that have been considered 
and approved by the Board. The Group has the ability to manage 
staff costs, direct costs and overheads, but the revenue projections 
are inherently uncertain due to the nature of the market. 
As at 24 March 2017 the recoverable amount exceeds the carrying 
amount by £13.7 million. A change to the key assumptions could 
potentially lead to a material misstatement in the future.  www.biffa.co.uk

All amortisation charges are recognised in profit or loss. The

IFRS 3 requires that on acquisition, intangible assets are recorded at 
fair value. The Biffa brand was first created in the early 20th century 
and has been used throughout the Group since then. It remains a 
highly recognisable brand. Given the longevity of the brand, the 
Directors consider the asset to have an indefinite life. The Directors 
reconsider the valuation of the brand at each reporting date. The 
brand and landfill gas rights initially arose during the fair value exercise 
undertaken following the acquisition of the Biffa Group by 
Wasteshareholderco 1 in 2008. The values were subsequently 
remeasured following the restructuring of the Group in 2013.

receivables approximate their book value. The average credit period 
taken on invoices was 37 .3 days (2016: 43. 1 days). 
Credit limits for new customers are assigned based on the potential 
customer’s credit quality. An external credit scoring system is used 
before assigning any credit limit over £500. Management monitors 
the utilisation of credit limits regularly. The trade receivables balance 
consists of a large number of customer balances, represented largely 
by local account customers, and there is no significant concentration 
of credit risk. 
Included in the Group’s trade receivables balances are debts with a 
carrying amount of £18.9 million (2016: £31.3 million) which are past 
due at the reporting date for which the Group has not provided as 
there has not been a significant change in credit quality and the 
amounts are still considered recoverable. The Group does not hold

Derivative financial instruments
The derivatives that the Group has entered into during the year qualify 
for hedge designation as a cash flow hedge under IAS 39. The Group 
has entered into forward foreign exchange rate contracts which all 
mature within one year.
The forward foreign exchange contracts have resulted in the 
recognition of a derivative asset of £0.3 million. During the year  
a gain of £0.3 million has been recognised in the statement of other 
comprehensive income.
The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts are calculated  
by discounting the contracted forward values and translating at
the balance sheet rates. The fair value measurements are classified as 
Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy as defined by IFRS 13 ‘Fair value 
measurement’, as the inputs are from observable quoted exchanges.

On 20 October 2016, the Group’s existing Senior and Super Senior 
debt were repaid in full and a new £200 million facility was drawn 
down. The new facility is repayable on 20 October 2021 and includes 
standard leverage and interest cover covenants for a facility of this 
type. The facility also includes an undrawn £100 million RCF .
The holders of the Junior Facility Agreement were issued with 
preference share capital in Wasteholdco1 Limited in exchange
for settlement of the amount owing under this. In the event that
the Group is successful in its EVP case (see note 32) with HMRC,  
the EVP preference shareholders will be entitled to certain funds 
recovered from HMRC by the Company. The Directors consider it 
likely that the Group will be successful in the case and accordingly 
have recognised a liability in respect of the EVP preference shares.  
In the event that the Group is unsuccessful in the EVP proceedings 
and does not recover the amount prepaid to HMRC the Group 
expects to release the majority of the associated EVP liability as 
disclosed in note 32.
All borrowings are measured at amortised cost. All financial assets 
and financial liabilities have been categorised as level 2. Level 2 
financial instruments have been valued using inputs other than 
quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability either

Interest rate swaps are measured at the present value of future cash

derived from quoted interest rates.
The fair value of non-derivative financial assets and liabilities are 
determined based on discounted cash flow analysis using current 
market rates for similar instruments.
Financial risk management
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market 
risk (including capital risk management, cash flow interest rate risk 
and price risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group’s overall risk 
management programmes focus on the unpredictability of financial 
markets and seek to minimise potential adverse effects on the 
Group’s financial performance. Financial risk management in the 
above areas is carried out under a policy approved by the Board  
of Directors. 
Capital risk management
The Group manages its capital structure using a number of measures 
and taking into account its future strategic plans. Such measures 
include its net interest cover, liquidity and leverage ratios. Total capital 
is calculated as ‘equity’ as shown in the consolidated statement of 
financial position plus net debt. Net debt is calculated as total 
borrowings (including ‘current and non-current borrowings’ as shown 
in the consolidated statement of financial position) less cash and cash 
equivalents. The Directors are satisfied that the current risk 
management strategy is appropriate and effective. 
Cash flow interest rate risk
The Group’s interest-bearing assets include cash and cash 
equivalents which earn interest at floating rates. The Group’s income 
and operating cash flows are substantially independent of changes  
in market interest rates. The Group’s interest rate risk arises from 
long-term borrowings. Borrowings issued at variable rates expose the 
Group to cash flow interest rate risk. Group policy is to maintain an 
appropriate proportion of its borrowings at fixed rate using interest 
rate swaps to achieve this when necessary. 
The interest rate risk profile of the Group’s financial assets and 
liabilities were as follows:

Currency risk
The Group is exposed to currency risk arising from currency 
exposures primarily related to the disposal of RDF via export to 
Europe. The Group enters into forward contracts to purchase  
Euros based upon expected costs. These derivatives are classified  
as cash flow hedges.
Price risk
The Group is not materially exposed to any equity securities price 
risk. All four divisions are exposed to commodity price risks to a 
greater or lesser degree on their outputs. The commodities that the 
Group are exposed to commodity price risks on fuel, electricity, 
paper, glass, cardboard, steel, aluminium and plastics (including 
HDPE and PET). The price risk associated with commodities is 
considered to be in the ordinary course of business for the Group.
Credit risk
Credit risk is managed on a group basis as appropriate. Credit  
risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial 
instruments and deposits with banks and financial institutions, as well 
as credit exposures to customers, including outstanding receivables. 
For banks and financial institutions, only independently rated parties 
with a minimum rating of ‘A’ are accepted.
Management does not expect any significant losses of receivables 
that have not been provided for as shown in note 16. Further detail  
on trade receivables is included in note 16.
The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the financial 
information, which is net of impairment losses, represents the Group’s 
maximum exposure to credit risk. These amounts include receivable 
balances from local authority clients, hence are not exposed to 
significant credit risk. Given the above factors, the Board does not 
consider it necessary to present a detailed analysis of credit risk.
Liquidity risk
The Group ensures that there are sufficient committed loan facilities in 
order to meet short term business requirements, after taking into 
account the cash flows from operations and its holding of cash and 
cash equivalents. The expected undiscounted cash flow of the 
Group’s financial liabilities (including derivatives), by remaining 
contractual maturity, at the balance sheet date is shown below.  103

Interest rate sensitivity analysis
The sensitivity analyses below have been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for both derivative and non-derivative 
instruments at the balance sheet date. For floating rate liabilities, the analysis is prepared taking an average of the liability outstanding  
over the period.
If interest rates had been 2% higher/1% lower and all other variables were held constant, the Group’s result for the 52 weeks ended 24 March 
2017 would increase/decrease by the amounts shown in the table below. This analysis assumes that, where interest rates are currently less 
than 1%, any reduction is capped at zero.

Landfill restoration and aftercare
As part of its normal activities, the Group undertakes to restore its 
landfill sites and to maintain the sites and control leachate and 
methane emissions from the sites. Provision is made for these 
anticipated costs. A number of estimate uncertainties affect the 
calculation including the impact of regulation. Accuracy of site 
surveys, transportation costs and changes in the discount rate. The 
provisions incorporate our best estimates of the financial effects of 
these uncertainties, but future changes in any of these estimates 
could materially impact the calculation of the provision. Restoration 
costs are incurred as each site is filled, and in the period immediately 
after its closure. 
Maintenance and leachate and methane control costs are  
incurred as each site is filled and for a number of years post closure.  
Long-term aftercare provisions included in landfill restoration and 
aftercare provisions have been discounted at an average rate of  
2.3% (2016: 3.53%). An increase of 1% in the discount rate (at  
current cost) would result in a decrease of environmental provisions  
of approximately £17 million.
Aftercare costs are incurred as each site is filled and for a number of 
years post closure. This period can vary significantly from site to site, 
depending upon the types of waste landfilled and the speed at which 
it decomposes, the way the site is engineered and the regulatory 
requirements specific to the site.
The associated outflows are estimated to arise over a period of up  
to 60 years depending on the date of each site closure.
Insurance
The associated outflows are estimated to arise over a period of up  
to five years from the balance sheet date.
Other
Other provisions include a provision for dilapidations for £10.4 million 
(2016: £10.5 million) and £2.7 million (2016: £5.0 million) relating to 
onerous contracts. The associated outflows are estimated to arise 
over a period of up to 20 years from the balance sheet date. 105

Deferred tax has been recognised in the current year using the tax rate of 17% (2016: 18%). Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when 
there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities.
The deferred tax asset of £28.5 million (2016: £16.9 million) has been recognised in the accounts because the Group considers, based upon 
its financial projections, that it is probable that future taxable profits will arise against which the assets can be utilised.
As at 24 March 2017 , the Group has unused tax losses of £75.8 million (2016: £85.6 million) available for offset against future profits.  
A deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of £3.6 million (2016: £9.7 million) of such losses. No deferred tax asset has been 
recognised in respect of the remaining £72.2 million (2016: £75.9 million) as it is not considered probable that there will be future taxable  
profits available in the statutory entity in which these losses are being carried forward.

The Group has used the stochastic model to value its share awards.
The expected volatility is a measure of the amount by which a share price is expected to fluctuate during the period. It is typically calculated 
based on statistical analysis of daily share prices over the length of the award period. Due to the recent listing of Biffa plc, this information is 
not available. Instead it has been based on the volatility of another company of a similar size which operates in the same market. 
A reconciliation of movements in the number of share awards can be summarised as follows:

The Performance Share Plan (PSP) provides for the grant of awards 
in the form of conditional free shares or nil costs options. Shares in 
relation to the award will be released to participants subsequent to 
the date of the preliminary announcement of results for the 2018/19 
financial year dependant upon the extent to which the performance 
conditions of achievement of adjusted EPS targets for the fiscal year 
ended March 2019 and performance of the Company’s relative total 
shareholder growth have been satisfied. The EPS fair value is 
equivalent to the share price at date of grant on the basis that it  
is a non-market based measure. www.biffa.co.uk

Defined benefit schemes
The Group operates a defined benefit scheme, the Biffa Pension 
Scheme (the Scheme), formerly the UK Waste Pension Scheme, for 
employees of Biffa Corporate Holdings Limited, Biffa Waste Services 
Limited, Island Waste Services Limited, Biffa Leicester Limited and 
Biffa West Sussex Limited. The scheme offers both pensions in 
retirement and death benefits to members. As at 1 November 2013, 
the defined benefit section of the Scheme closed to future accrual for 
the majority of members. Contributions to the Scheme by the Group 
for the year beginning 25 March 2017 are currently expected to  
be £4.4 million.
The Scheme is administered by Trustees and the assets are held 
separately to the legal entity that is the Group. The Trustee board of 
the Scheme is composed of an independent Trustee, and other 
employer and member nominated trustees (where the legal minimum 
proportion of member nominated trustees has been upheld). The 
Trustees are required by law to act in the best interests of the 
members of the Scheme. The Trustees are responsible for the 
investment policy with regard to the assets of the Scheme.
The scheme has a surplus that is fully recognised on the basis that 
future economic benefits are unconditionally available in the form  
of a reduction in the future cash contributions or as a cash refund.
There is an additional £1.7 million (2016: £1.4 million) of unfunded 
defined benefit commitment which has been included within liabilities. 
The accounting policy used to recognise the actuarial gains and 
losses is the Other Comprehensive Income (OCI) approach.
The Group is also an admitted body in the Cornwall Pension Fund 
following the acquisition of Cory Environmental Municipal Services 
Limited (CEMS) on 8 June 2016. The Cornwall Pension Fund is part 
of the Local Government Pension Scheme and the Group’s 
participation in the Cornwall Pension Fund will cease when the CEMS 
contract with Cornwall Council expires in 2020. On an accounting 
basis the Cornwall Pension Fund was in surplus at the point of 
acquisition. On cessation of participation, CEMS is required to pay a 
lump sum to the Fund in respect of any deficit that may exist at that 
time on a basis determined by the Fund’s actuary and if a surplus 
exists at this time it is retained by the Fund and not refunded to 
CEMS. The Group does not therefore recognise any accounting 
surplus in the Cornwall Pension Fund as it is not expected to be 
recoverable. Contributions to the Cornwall Fund for the year 
beginning 25th March 2017 are expected to be £0.2 million.
The Group is an admitted body in four other schemes that are part of 
the Local Government Pension Scheme, the contractual terms of the 
commercial agreements that admit the Group to the schemes limit 
the actuarial risk that the Group is exposed to, consequently these 
schemes have been accounted for as defined contribution schemes.
The Scheme typically exposes Biffa plc to actuarial risks such as: 
investment risk; interest rate risk; longevity risk and inflation risk.
Investment risk
The present value of the defined benefit Scheme liability is calculated 
using a discount rate determined by reference to yields available on 
high quality AA rated corporate bond yields; in other words, from the 
position of being fully funded then if the return on the Scheme assets 
was below this rate, it would create a deficit in the Scheme. Currently 
the Scheme has around 55% of assets invested in return seeking 
assets and 45% of assets in protection assets in order to manage the 
investment risk. www.biffa.co.uk

Biffa plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Notes to the Consolidated  
Financial Statements continued
28. Pension and post-retirement benefits continued
Interest risk
A decrease in the corporate bond yield will increase the Scheme 
liability; however, this will be partially offset by an increase in the value 
on the Scheme’s corporate bond assets.
Longevity risk
The present value of the defined benefit Scheme liability is calculated by 
reference to the best estimate of the mortality of Scheme members both 
during and after their employment. An increase in the life expectancy of 
the Scheme members will increase the Scheme’s liability.
Inflation risk
The present value of the defined benefit Scheme liability is calculated 
by reference to the future expected pension indexation (both 
indexation in deferment and pension increases in payment), which  
will depend on future inflation expectations. As such, an increase in 
the expectation of future inflation will increase the Scheme’s liability. 
The lump sum death benefits paid to the dependants of Scheme 
members are insured with an external insurance company.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation, and the related 
current service cost and past service cost, were measured using the 
projected unit credit method.
A full actuarial valuation of the scheme was carried out as at 31 
March 2015 and has been updated to 24 March 2017 by a qualified 
independent actuary. The major assumptions used by the actuary 
were (in nominal terms) as follows:

classified as Level 2 instruments and hedge funds and property as 
Level 3 instruments. It is the policy of the Scheme to use hedge funds 
and liability driven investments to hedge some of its exposure to 
interest rate and inflation risks. This policy has been implemented 
during the current and prior years.

Net asset/( liabilities) arising from  
defined benefit obligation 15.4 29.5
Significant actuarial assumptions for the determination of the defined 
benefit obligation are the discount rate, expected future inflation and 
mortality. The sensitivity analyses below have been determined based 
on reasonably possible changes of the respective assumptions 
occurring at the end of the reporting period, while holding all other 
assumptions constant.
If the discount rate is 0.5% lower the defined benefit asset would 
decrease by £60.7 million.
If the inflation assumption increases by 0.5% the defined benefit asset 
would decrease by £45.6 million.
If the life expectancy increases by one year for both men and women, 
the defined benefit asset would decrease by £18.0 million.
The sensitivity analysis presented above may not be representative of 
the actual change in the defined benefit obligation as it is unlikely that 
the change in assumptions would occur in isolation of one another as 
some of the assumptions may be correlated.
Furthermore, in presenting the above sensitivity analysis, the present 
value of the defined benefit obligation has been calculated using the 
projected unit credit method at the end of the reporting period, which 
is the same as that applied in calculating the defined benefit 
obligation liability recognised in the statement of financial position.
The Scheme’s participating employers are Biffa Waste Services 
Limited, Island Waste Services Limited, Biffa Leicester Limited and 
Biffa West Sussex Limited. These subsidiaries fund the cost of any 
protected members’ future accrual (to the extent that any protected 
members remain working for each of these companies) earned on a 
yearly basis. 
Protected members pay a range of fixed contributions of pensionable 
salary depending on what section of the Scheme they are in. These 
contributions range from 3% to 6% of pensionable salary. The 
residual contribution (including past service augmentations) is paid by 
the above entities of the Group. These contributions, required to fund 
accrual, are agreed between Biffa Corporate Holdings Limited (the 
Principal Employer) and the Trustees of the Scheme following each 
triennial valuation of the Scheme. 
In accordance with the Pensions Act 2004, the Scheme’s liability is 
measured using a prudent discount rate at the triennial valuation,  
but some asset outperformance is allowed for when calculating the 
deficit recovery contributions paid for by the participating employers. 
Additional liabilities stemming from past service due to augmentation 
of benefits are added to the Scheme’s deficit. 
The average duration of the benefit obligation at 24 March 2017 is 
approximately 23 years (2016: 22 years).
The Group expects to make a contribution of £4.4 million  
(2016: £3.5 million) to the Scheme during the financial year  
to 24 March 2017 .
29. Related party transactions
There have been no material related party transactions in the year

31. Contingent liabilities
The Group must satisfy the financial security requirements of 
environmental agencies in order to ensure that it is able to discharge 
the obligations in the licences or permits that the Group holds for its 
landfill sites. The Group satisfies these financial security requirements 
by providing financial security bonds. The amount of financial security 
which is required is determined in conjunction with the regulatory 
agencies, as is the method by which assurance is provided. The 
Group has existing bond arrangements in England and Wales of 
approximately £82. 1 million outstanding at 24 March 2017 (2016: 
£84.3 million) in respect of the Group’s permitted waste activities 
where the Group has obligations under the Environment Agency’s  
“fit and proper person” test to make adequate financial provision in 
order to undertake those activities. Additionally the Group has bonds 
to a value of £18.6 million (2016: £10.4 million) in connection with 
security for performance of certain contracts. No liability is expected 
to arise in respect of these bonds.
The Group is engaged in a dispute with HMRC in relation to the 
landfill tax treatment of certain materials used in the engineering  
of landfill sites from September 2009 to May 2012. The Group  
has recognised in long term debtors, the payment of the initial 
assessment for landfill tax but is awaiting an assessment from  
HMRC in relation to the expected interest which it expects to pay in 
the coming year and which will be recognised in long term debtors.
32. EVP related items
The Group is engaged in a dispute with HMRC concerning historic 
landfill tax. 
 
HMRC claims that the Group is liable for £62m of Landfill tax in 
respect of certain waste materials deposited in Biffa’s landfill sites 
from 2009 to 2012 (‘EVP’). Biffa contests that the material was used 
in the sites for an engineering purpose and is not therefore subject to 
Landfill tax. Notwithstanding the Group’s opinion on the tax treatment 
of this material, since 2012 all materials of this nature have been 
subjected to Landfill Tax. The matter has been heard by the First Tier 
Tax Tribunal and we are awaiting judgment. Appeals to higher courts 
are expected following this judgment.
The contested amount was originally unpaid under a hardship 
agreement with HMRC but was paid to HMRC following the 
refinancing of the Group upon its IPO in October 2016. In addition  
to the payment of £62m, the Group expected to be required to pay 
interest of approximately £10.4m at the same time. Interest of £1.7m 
was paid on request prior to the year end, although to date no 
request has been made for the remaining £8.7m of interest, although 
we expect one to be received and to make this payment in the 
coming months. 
The Directors, having taken appropriate advice, do not believe that a 
liability to tax exists, and accordingly have treated the payment of the 
tax and associated interest as a prepayment. 
As part of the IPO of the Group, arrangements were put in place to 
make certain payments to the shareholders and certain members  
of employee incentive schemes of the Group immediately prior  
to its listing, subject to and in respect of the outcome of the dispute.  
A liability of £42.8m has been recognised in borrowings, an accrual  
of £13m has been recognised in non-current liabilities, and a 
non-underlying non-cash interest charge of £1m has been 
recognised in finance charges in respect of these obligations.  
The liability of £42.8m in borrowings has been excluded from 
Reported Net Debt.
33. Service concession arrangements
The Group has two integrated waste management contracts with 
Leicester City Council (25 years – awarded in 2003) and West  
Sussex County Council (25 years – awarded in October 2010).  
The concessions vary as to the extent of their obligations, but 
typically require the construction and operation of an asset during  
the concession period including scheduled maintenance and capital 
expenditure. The operation of the assets includes the provision of 
waste management services such as collection, recycling and 
disposal. Typically at the end of concession periods the assets are 
returned to the concession owner.
These contracts generated revenue of £54.7 million in the 52 weeks 
ended 24 March 2017 (2016: £52. 1 million).

Accounting Policies to the Parent Company  
Financial Statements
Basis of preparation
These financial statements relate to Biffa plc, a publicly traded 
company incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales. The 
registered address is Coronation Road, Cressex, High Wycombe, 
Buckinghamshire, HP12 3TZ.
These financial statements present the results of the Company as  
an individual entity and are prepared on the going concern basis,  
in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced 
Disclosure Framework (FRS101) and the Companies Act 2006.
The Company is part of a larger group and participates in the Group’s 
centralised treasury and banking arrangements. The Company is 
expected to generate positive cash flows to continue to operate in  
the foreseeable future.
The Company has not presented its own income statement or 
statement of comprehensive income as permitted by section 408  
of the Companies Act 2006.
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with  
the accounting policies set out below, which have been consistently 
applied to all the years presented except where the Company has 
elected to take the following exemptions under FRS 101:
• The requirements of IAS 7 Statement of cashflows
• The requirements of paragraph 17 of IAS 24 Related Party 
disclosures in respect of key management personnel
• Requirements of IAS 24 Related Party disclosures to  
disclose transactions between wholly owned members  
of the Biffa plc group
• The requirements of IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures,  
as equivalent disclosures are provided in the consolidated financial 
statements of the group to which the Company belongs
• The requirements of IFRS 2 Share based payments
• The requirements of paragraphs 91 to 99 of IFRS 13 Fair Value 
Measurements, as equivalent disclosures are presented in the 
consolidated financial statements
Critical accounting judgements and key sources of  
estimation uncertainty
The Company does not have any key assumptions concerning the 
future, or other key areas of estimation uncertainty in the reporting 
period that may have a significant risk of causing material adjustment 
to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities within the next  
financial year. 
Investments
Investments are initially stated at cost. Investments are tested for 
impairment when an event that might affect asset value has occurred. 
An impairment loss is recognised to the extent that the carrying 
amounts cannot be recovered either by selling the asset or by the 
discounted future cashflows from the investment.
Dividend distribution
Final dividend distribution to the Company’s shareholders is 
recognised as a liability in the Company’s financial statements in  
the period in which the dividends are approved by the Company’s 
shareholders. Interim dividends are recognised when paid.
Other receivables
Other receivables are recognised initially at fair value less any 
provision for impairment. They are subsequently held at amortised 
cost less any provision for impairment. 
Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative 
contract is entered into and subsequently remeasured at fair value at 
each balance sheet date. The method of recognising the resulting 
gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a 
hedging instrument and if so, the nature of the item being hedged.
The Company designates certain derivatives as either a) fair value 
hedge (hedges of the fair value of recognised assets or liabilities);  
or b) cash flow hedge (hedges of a particular risk associated with a 
recognised asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction); 
or c) net investment hedge (hedges of net investments in  
foreign operations).
The Company documents the transaction relationship between the 
hedging instruments and hedged items at inception. At inception  
and at each reporting date the Company assesses whether the 
derivatives used have been highly effective in offsetting changes in 
the fair value of hedged items.
The fair values of derivative instruments used for hedging are shown 
in note 5. Movements in the hedging reserve are shown in the 
statement of changes in equity.
At the reporting date the Company has no fair value hedges or net 
investment hedges.
Cash flow hedge
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that  
are designated as cash flow hedges are recognised in equity. The 
Company’s cash flow hedges in respect of forward foreign exchange 
contracts result in recognition in either profit and loss or in the 
hedging reserve.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when the hedge no 
longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain  
or loss in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when 
the forecast transaction occurs. When a forecast transaction is no 
longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was 
reported in equity will be transferred to the income statement.
Changes in the fair value of any derivative instruments that do not 
qualify for hedge accounting are recognised immediately in the 
income statement.
Other payables
Accounts payables are classified as current liabilities if payment  
is due within one year or less. If not, they are presented as  
non-current liabilities.
Share capital
Ordinary Shares are classified as equity and are recorded at nominal 
value of proceeds received. Where shares are issued above nominal 
value, the proceeds in excess of par value are recorded in the share 
premium account net of direct issue costs. 115
