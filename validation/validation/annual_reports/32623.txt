CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
I AM PLEASED TO REPORT THAT THE GROUP 
CONTINUES TO MAKE GOOD PROGRESS AND 
HAS DELIVERED ANOTHER SIGNIFICANT 
INCREASE IN UNDERLYING PROFITABILITY. 
OVERVIEW
I am pleased to report that the Group continues to make good progress 
and has delivered another significant increase in underlying profitability. 
This result was achieved despite the impact of the flood suffered at 
our fabric printing factory, Standfast & Barracks, in December 2015 
and reflects the success of our continued strategic focus on developing 
our product offering, international expansion, market penetration, 
lifestyle product extension and investment in manufacturing.
It also reflects an initial contribution from the acquisition in October 
2016 of Clarke & Clarke, a fabrics and wallcoverings business with two 
international brands, Clarke & Clarke and Studio G. This acquisition 
continues to trade in line with the Board’s expectations and is expected 
to make a material contribution to earnings during the current financial 
year ending 31 January 2018. We continue to seek further acquisitions 
to complement our organic growth initiatives. 
We were very pleased with the support from both new and existing 
investors for the equity fundraising of £17.0 million as part-funding for 
the acquisition of Clarke & Clarke. 
The adjusted underlying profit before tax for the year, excluding the 
LTIP accounting charge and the net defined benefit charge, was 
£10.4 million (2016: £8.9 million), an increase of 16.9%. The reported 
financial results include a first-time contribution from Clarke & Clarke  
of £1.0 million. 
The Group’s results were impacted by the flood in December 2015 at 
Standfast & Barracks, though the financial impact has been mitigated 
by the Group’s comprehensive insurance policy. The results include £2.8 
million as a result of interim insurance payments for loss of profits. 
To date, the Group has received a total of £16.9 million of flood-related 
insurance payments in respect of damage to business assets, 
reimbursement of cleaning costs and loss of profits. As previously 
announced, we will be seeking to negotiate a final settlement of the 
insurance claim with our insurers and anticipate that a settlement will 
be agreed in the first half of the current financial year. 
The flood halted production at Standfast & Barracks for a period of 16 
weeks, thereby removing the Group’s internal capacity to print fabric for 
its own Brands and third party customers. Full production was restored 
in October 2016 and the Brands were fully restocked by the financial 
year end.
Total Brand sales, which include Clarke & Clarke, were up 12.8% during 
the year to £76.6 million, including sales of £7.3 million from the first 
18 weeks’ ownership of Clarke & Clarke. Like-for-like sales are down due 
to the flood. The impact of this has been mitigated by insurance 
reimbursement. 
Excluding Clarke & Clarke, total Brand sales for the year were up 2.2% 
compared with the same period last year, to £69.3 million. In the UK, 
our largest market, sales were down by 4.0% to £38.4 million, reflecting 
the impact of the flood. Overseas Brand sales were up 10.0% in 
reportable currency, up 0.5% in constant currency. Sales in the US, the 
Group’s second largest market, were up 8.3% in reportable currency, 
down 5.2% in constant currency. In Western Europe, our third largest  A WARM WELCOME TO FIONA HOLMES,

market, Brand sales were up 22.4% in reportable currency, up 7.9% in 
constant currency, with strong sales growth in most regions. Sales in the 
Rest of the World grew 0.3% in constant currency. 
During the year we have continued to develop our product offering. 
We have been pleased with the performance of our Woodland Walk 
collection from Sanderson, which has been its best-selling collection for 
several years, and the success of Morris & Co. Pure, a range of classic 
William Morris designs produced for the first time in neutral colours. 
We are particularly pleased with licensing income of £2.6 million, which 
was up 25.6% in reportable currency, up 13.1 % in constant currency. 
We are continuing to pursue the extension of our product offering 
through new licensing agreements to take the Company’s Brands 
further into new lifestyle products and geographical territories. We are 
excited about the future potential for this important contributor to our 
growth strategy.
Walker Greenbank’s vertically integrated high-quality UK 
manufacturing base, comprising our Loughborough-based wallpaper 
printing business, Anstey Wallpaper Company, and Lancaster-based 
fabric printing business Standfast & Barracks, differentiates us from 
others in our industry.
The flood at Standfast & Barracks resulted in reduced sales and 
profitability, with total Manufacturing sales down 6.7% compared with 
the same period last year. The insurance-funded replacement of 
flood-damaged printing equipment means that the factory is now 
operating with the latest machinery, increasing our production capacity 
and capabilities.
FINANCIALS 
Total sales increased 5.2% to £92.4 million (2016: £87.8 million) 
including Clarke & Clarke sales of £7.3 million.
Although statutory profit from operations is down 3.7% to £7.9 million 
(2016: £8.2 million) due to acquisition, restructuring and reorganisation 
costs, the underlying profit from operations has increased 19.5% to 
£9.8 million (2016: £8.2 million). 
The total statutory profit after tax was £5.4 million (2016: £5.9 million), 
and basic adjusted earnings per share were up 14.6% after removing 
the LTIP accounting charge, net defined benefit charge and non-
underlying items.
DIVIDEND
The Directors recommend the payment of a final dividend of 3.06p per 
share (2016: 2.45p), which will be payable on 11 August 2017 to 
shareholders on the register on 21 July 2017. This brings the total 
dividend for the year to 3.61p per share (2016: 2.89p) an increase of 
24.9%, reflecting the Board’s confidence in the future prospects and 
the financial strength of the Group.

PEOPLE
On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank all of our management 
and employees for their contribution to another successful year. 
I was delighted to welcome Fiona Holmes to the Walker Greenbank 
Board as Managing Director of Brands during the year. Fiona brings a 
wealth of brand, digital and multi-channel retail experience to the 
Company. I would like to say a particular thank you to Fiona’s 
predecessor, David Smallridge, for his invaluable contribution during his 
15 years of service. I would also like to thank all of the team members 
at Standfast & Barracks for their huge part in bringing the factory back 
to full production.
During the year, we continued to strengthen the operational 
management and organisational structure of the Group, including the 
appointment of an MD of Manufacturing and a Group HR Director.
OUTLOOK 
We began the new financial year with Standfast & Barracks back to full 
production capacity and our warehouse fully restocked, giving us a 
strong platform for the year ahead. In addition, we are excited by our 
recent acquisition of Clarke & Clarke, which marks the next step in our 
growth strategy. 
Brand sales in the first quarter are on an improving trend, though they 
continue to reflect the flood-constrained product launches in the spring 
of last year and partially constrained autumn launches. Consequential 
loss of profits continue to be mitigated by our insurance policy though, 
as we look ahead, the flood’s impact on trading will be reduced. In 
the first 12 weeks of the current financial year, Brands sales were up 
4.4% in reportable currency and up 0.9% in constant currency. Brands 
sales exclude Clarke & Clarke, which is trading in line with the Board’s 
expectations and is an exciting addition to our product portfolio. 
Sales in the year ahead are expected to benefit from the new 
collections launched this spring, from the continued momentum of our 
licensing activities and from the significant contribution from Clarke & 
Clarke. With this backdrop, we remain confident in meeting the Board’s 
expectations for the current financial year.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S 
STRATEGIC REVIEW 
WE ARE PLEASED TO REPORT THAT, IN A 
CHALLENGING YEAR FOR THE GROUP, WE HAVE 
CONTINUED TO MAKE GOOD PROGRESS WITH 
THE IMPLEMENTATION OF OUR STRATEGY.
We are pleased to report that, in a challenging year for the Group due 
to the significant business interruption suffered as a result of the flood 
at Standfast & Barracks in December 2015, we have continued to make 
good progress with the implementation of our strategy, which comprises:
• international expansion; 
• market penetration;
• lifestyle product extension; 
• British manufacturing capability; and 
• acquisitions.
To read more about our strategy go to pages 7 to 17
THE BRANDS 
This segment incorporates global trading from our internationally 
recognised brands and includes our overseas subsidiaries in the US and 
France. In addition to Sanderson, Morris & Co, Harlequin, Zoffany, Scion 
and Anthology, the Brands now include Clarke & Clarke and Studio G, 
which were acquired by the Company in October 2016. 
Fiona Holmes joined the Company in October 2016 as Managing 
Director of Brands, a role in which she has responsibility for all of the 
brands apart from Clarke & Clarke and Studio G, which operate on a 
standalone basis. Fiona is playing a key role in further developing and 
delivering our strategic ambitions.
Total Brands sales increased during the year despite the impact of the 
flood at Standfast & Barracks. Total Brands sales increased by 12.8% 
compared with last year to £76.6 million. This included an 18-week 
contribution from Clarke & Clarke of £7.3 million. Underlying Brands 
profit from operations increased by 14.3% to £9.2 million.
Excluding Clarke & Clarke, total Brands sales were up 2.2% during the 
year at £69.3 million. In the UK, Brands sales decreased 4.0% to £38.4 
million, reflecting the flood along with challenging UK trading conditions. 
Sales in the US grew by 8.3% in reportable currency, down 5.2% in 
constant currency, to £9.2 million and were impacted by the flood. 
The US is our second largest market and is strategically important, 
meriting our recent investment in more directly employed sales 
representatives and an intended investment in our second directly 
controlled showroom, in Chicago, to add to our recent investment in  
our flagship showroom in New York. 
Brand sales in Western Europe were up 22.4% in reportable currency, 
up 7.9% in constant currency, to £8.5 million with most regions 
performing strongly, particularly the Republic of Ireland, up 7.9% in 
constant currency to £1.9 million. Other highlights include sales in 
Scandinavia, up 15.8% in constant currency to £2.5 million, and growth 
in Eastern Europe, up 3.6% in constant currency to £2.3 million. 
Global licensing income is a key part of our strategy and an important 
developing income stream for the Group. It extends our lifestyle 
offering and gives our brands greater consumer awareness both in the 
UK and internationally. Income was up 25.6% in reportable currency, 
13.1 % in constant currency, to £2.6 million. Substantial growth has 
been achieved by our bedlinen and blinds partners in particular, with 
range extensions into new product areas and new licensing agreements 
in the US and China. 
HARLEQUIN INCORPORATING SCION AND ANTHOLOGY
Harlequin remains the UK’s leading mid-market contemporary brand. 
Its worldwide sales reduced 1.3% to £31.3 million in reportable currency 
compared with the same period last year. Sales in the UK decreased by  Walker Greenbank PLC

7.2% and were particularly impacted by the flood at Standfast & 
Barracks. In the US, sales were up 5.3% in reportable currency, down 
8.2% in constant currency, and sales in Western Europe have grown 
30.6% year on year in reportable currency, 14.9% in constant currency. 
The Scion brand has recently celebrated its fifth anniversary and 
continues to grow well with its fifth collection, Lokho, and its first 
children’s collection, Guess Who, both having been well received. 
This cutting edge, accessibly priced brand continues to be a success 
with young, aspirational and fashion-aware customers. Scion has also 
quickly become established as a valuable brand for licensing partners 
where the contemporary and graphic nature of the designs translates 
particularly well.
The Anthology brand, launched in April 2014, also continues to show 
strong growth. The range now includes five innovative collections of 
wallcoverings complemented by a growing range of fabrics, which are 
design-led and aspirational while remaining inherently suitable for 
contract applications.
ARTHUR SANDERSON & SONS INCORPORATING THE 
MORRIS & CO. BRAND
Sales were up 4.7% at £22.5 million in reportable currency compared 
with the same period last year. The flood at Standfast & Barracks 
continued to impact UK sales, which saw a decline of 1.2% compared 
with the same period last year. However, sales in the US saw significant 
growth, up 18.9% in reportable currency, 4.1 % in constant currency, 
and sales in Western Europe were up 16.8% in reportable currency, up 
3.1 % in constant currency. Sanderson’s Woodland Walk collection has 
been the brand’s best-selling collection for several years now and has 
been universally appreciated as quintessential Sanderson. 
The Morris & Co. brand enjoyed a very positive sales performance last 
year driven by the launch of the Pure Morris collection. This collection 
interprets William Morris’ iconic designs in a new neutral colour palette. 
This has broadened the brand’s appeal, making it more accessible to a 
wider audience, working equally well in both traditional and 
contemporary settings.
ZOFFANY
Zoffany is positioned at the upper end of the premium market. 
Total sales grew by 3.5% compared with the same period last year  
to £12.2 million in reportable currency. This growth has been driven  
by sales of recent collections which reflect the focus on design strategy 
and direction to position the brand for sustained growth. Sales in the 
US were up 11.9% in reportable currency, down 1.9% in constant 
currency, and sales in Western Europe were up 12.8% in reportable 
currency, down 0.4% in constant currency. 
CLARKE & CLARKE 
Clarke & Clarke’s two brands, Clarke & Clarke and Studio G, are at the 
more affordable end of the market, complementing the Group’s 
existing Brands. Studio G launched its first collection in spring 2016, 
comprising of four books in a variety of modern styles of which the 
highlight was Lustro, a book of three glamorous velvet designs, which 
are practical, competitively priced and widely appealing. Total sales for 
the first 18 weeks of ownership grew by 6.8% compared with the same 
period last year to £7.3 million in reportable currency, with performance 
in line with the Board’s expectations. 
MANUFACTURING
Our Manufacturing capabilities are one of the Group’s key assets and 
differentiates us from our peer group. They are an integral part of our 
growth strategy. The flood at Standfast & Barracks had a significant 
impact on our Manufacturing activities, with the result that total 
Manufacturing sales fell 6.7% to £32.0 million, leading to a decrease  
in profits of 58.7% to £1.0 million. 
This shortfall has been mitigated by interim insurance payments. 
The factory has recovered from the flood and is back in full production 
and the Company’s Milton Keynes warehouse was fully stocked with 
the Company’s printed textiles by the financial year end. The 
construction of flood defences to protect the Standfast & Barracks 
factory has also been completed.
ANSTEY WALLPAPER COMPANY
Sales at Anstey, our wallpaper printing business, fell 9.1 % to 
£16.9 million. Third party sales in the UK were down 23.3% and third 
party export sales were down 6.2%. Internal sales to our own Group 
Brands grew by 9.7%, reflecting a higher level of new product launches 
compared with the prior year. Sales were impacted by the consequences 
of the Standfast & Barracks flood but, as the weakness of sterling feeds 
through, we see a great opportunity to grow sales overseas.
STANDFAST & BARRACKS
Standfast, our fabric printing factory, saw a decrease in sales of 3.7% 
to £15.1 million as a direct result of the flood in December 2015. 
Third party sales in the UK fell by 28.9% while sales to our own Group 
Brands increased by 17.7%.
As a result of the flood, Standfast has experienced a period of significantly 
disrupted production and loss of stock, machinery and profits. To date we 
have received £16.9 million in insurance receipts, covering costs plus 
business interruption losses and interim cash flow requirements, with 
further business interruption reimbursements expected. 
During the period, two of the digital printing machines were replaced 
with next-generation digital printers with higher throughput and 
additional capabilities.
SUMMARY
Despite the significant challenges faced as a result of the flood in 2015, 
I am pleased that we have been able to continue to invest in our Brands 
both in the UK and internationally. 
We have also made significant progress in growing our licensing 
income, boosting our lifestyle product extension and greater consumer 
awareness. We have successfully completed our first significant 
acquisition since 2003 with the purchase of Clarke & Clarke, which will 
accelerate the Group’s market penetration and extend our reach in the 
US. Furthermore, we have made some key senior appointments which, 
combined with our ongoing investment in our key UK manufacturing, 
will help to drive growth in 2017 and help to further develop and deliver 
our strategic objectives.

in 2016.
In addition to growing our product offer and

product categories, including giftware, 
kitchenware, kitchen textiles and fashion.
As well as securing product line extensions 
with almost all of our established partners in 
the UK, Japan, France, Holland and Australia, 
new and exciting partnerships have been 
forged in the US and China, which will expose 
the brands to a high level of consumer

Beyond conventional licensing partnerships, 
we are increasingly extending the reach of our 
brands through further product categories 
such as cushions and blinds.

INCOME STATEMENT
The Chairman’s Statement and Chief Executive’s Strategic Review 
provide an analysis of the key factors impacting revenue and operating 
profit. In addition to the information on our Brands and Manufacturing 
divisions included in these reports, the Group has included in note 3 to 
the accounts further information on our reporting segments. This is the 
basis on which the Group presents its operating results to the Board of 
Directors, which is considered to be the Chief Operating Decision Maker 
(‘CODM’) for the purposes of IFRS 8. 
NON-UNDERLYING
Statutory profit before tax of £6,965,000 (2016: £7,338,000) included 
non-underlying charges of £2,164,000 (2016: £nil). These charges are 
analysed below.

LTIP accounting charge 756 924
Net defined benefit pension charge 527 685
Adjusted profit before tax 10,412 8,947
Acquisition-related costs incurred were in respect of the acquisition  
of Clarke & Clarke. These include professional fees of £1,552,000; 
amortisation of intangible assets of £342,000 and a cost of £1,061,000 
associated with the fair value adjustment recognised on the inventory 
as at the date of acquisition. A charge of £181,000 has been recognised 
in respect of the unwind of the contingent consideration payable for 
Clarke & Clarke.
Standfast net other income comprises of proceeds of £2,780,000 from 
the reimbursement of costs to replace impaired plant and equipment, 
less flood defence costs of £253,000 and additional insurance costs of 
£279,000 not reimbursed.
Restructuring and reorganisation costs of £1,276,000 reflect the 
rationalisation of certain operational and support functions. These 
costs mainly comprise professional fees, employee severance and 
property costs associated with the reorganisation process. 
NET OTHER INCOME
The substantial flooding at Standfast & Barracks resulted in extensive 
stock and machinery damage as well as a period of disrupted printing, 
resulting in lost sales revenue. Our Brands business was also impacted 
by the lack of printing capacity at Standfast, resulting in a loss of 
profits. We have recovered the costs of machinery loss and other 
incremental costs together with interim business interruption losses 
from our insurance providers for the period to 31 January 2017. The 
insurance claim in respect of losses for future financial years is ongoing. Walker Greenbank PLC
Annual Report and Accounts 2017
19
To date, £16,933,000 cash has been received as interim payments from 
our insurers of which £518,000 has been recognised and included 
within accruals and deferred income as at 31 January 2017. In the 
Income Statement, in addition to the non-underlying net other income 
described above, a further £2,837,000 has been recognised in 
underlying net other income which represents business interruption 
losses for the period to 31 January 2017.
CLARKE & CLARKE ACQUISITION
The acquisition of 100% of the issued share capital of Clarke & Clarke 
was completed during the year, for an initial cash consideration of 
£25,000,000 and a contingent consideration of up to £17,500,000,  
in aggregate, payable in the Company’s shares and linked to the 
performance of the acquired business over a four-year period, giving  
a total potential consideration of up to £42,500,000 excluding working 
capital adjustments.
In order to finance the initial cash consideration, a placing of a total  
of 8,947,369 new ordinary shares of 1p each in the Company was also 
undertaken. These shares were placed at a price of 190.0 pence per 
share, raising gross proceeds of approximately £17,000,000.
LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN (‘LTIP’)
There was a new award of shares during the financial year under the 
LTIP with vesting conditions half based on Total Shareholder Return 
(‘TSR’) with an adjusted profit before tax floor and half based on 
Earnings Per Share (‘EPS’) growth. There was a charge of £756,000 
(2016: £924,000) in the Income Statement relating to LTIP awards.  
The charge in the year is lower than last year driven by a reduction  
in the expected number of shares that will vest in future awards 
compared with the prior year.
INTEREST
The net underlying interest charge for the year was £186,000 (2016: 
£179,000) including amortisation of capitalised debt issue costs 
reflecting higher borrowings as a result of utilisation of £5,000,000 of 
the Group’s existing accordion tranche of its bank facilities following 
the acquisition of Clarke & Clarke. 
NET DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION
The Group operates two defined benefit schemes in the UK for its 
employees. These comprise the Walker Greenbank Pension Plan and 
the Abaris Holdings Limited Pension Scheme, which are both closed to 
new members and to future service accrual from 30 June 2002 and 
1 July 2005 respectively.
The charge during the year was £527,000 (2016: £685,000). 
The decrease reflects an increase to the expected return on  
pension scheme assets.
CURRENT TAXATION
There was a corporation tax charge of £1,445,000 (2016: £1,410,000) 
which has been impacted by the Clarke & Clarke transaction costs not 
being eligible for tax relief. The effective tax rate has increased to 
23.0% (2016: 20.0%) due to transaction costs and the amortisation of 
acquired intangible assets being non-deductible for UK corporation tax.
DEFERRED TAXATION
There was a deferred tax charge of £155,000 (2016: £56,000) driven  
by the intangible assets recognised in respect of the Clarke & Clarke 
acquisition. 
The Group also continues to recognise the deferred tax asset arising 
from the pension deficit and LTIP. 
EARNINGS PER SHARE (‘EPS’)
Basic reported EPS for the year was 8.55p (2016: 9.79p). The Group  
also reports an adjusted EPS which removes the impact of the LTIP 
accounting charge, net defined benefit pension charge and other 
non-underlying items as these can fluctuate due to external factors 
outside the control of the Group. A better understanding of the 
underlying performance of the business is given after adjusting for these 
items. The adjusted basic EPS for the year was 13.67p (2016: 11.93p).
OPERATING CASH FLOW AND NET DEBT
The Group generated net cash inflow from operating activities during 
the year of £9,925,000 (2016: £6,324,000) driven by a reduction to the 
insurance reimbursement debtor compared with the prior year.
Capital expenditure was £6,768,000 (2016: £2,510,000) and includes 
investment in new next-generation digital printers and other 
equipment at Standfast & Barracks amounting to £4,627,000 and 
development costs relating to the design of new collections for the 
Brands. The depreciation and amortisation charge during the period 
was £3,191,000 (2016: £2,638,000). During the prior year there was 
also a property, plant and equipment impairment in respect of the 
flood of £988,000. 
The defined benefit scheme’s triennial valuation was formally 
completed during the financial year. This is based on continuing the 
current level of deficit repayments but has resulted in a modest 
extension of one year in the recovery plan. 
The Group made additional payments to the pension schemes of 
£1,374,000 (2016: £1,307,000) to reduce the deficit, part of the 
ongoing planned reduction, along with £392,000 (2016: £380,000)  
of pension fund scheme expenses.
Income tax and national insurance of £664,000 (2016: £967,000)  
that arose on the vesting of an LTIP award was paid during the year.
The Group had net debt at the year end of £5,309,000 (2016: net  
funds £2,306,000). Average debt during the year varies due to the 
timing and seasonality of revenues and investment in product. The 
average monthly net debt decreased by £881,000 to £3,040,000 
(2016: £3,921,000) as a result of the Group starting the financial year 
with net funds which reduced the need to utilise the bank facilities.
The Group utilises facilities provided by Barclays Bank PLC. There is 
a term property facility of £200,000 (2016: £600,000) at the year 
end expiring in July 2017. In December 2015, the Group entered 
into a new £12.5 million multi-currency revolving credit facility with 
Barclays Bank PLC for a five-year period and cancelled the existing 
receivables facilities. The agreement also includes a £10 million 
accordion facility option to further increase available funds, which 
provides substantial headroom for future growth. There were 
£7,500,000 borrowings at the end of the year for the revolving 
facility (2016: £nil). Under these facilities there was borrowing 
headroom of £12,391,000 (2016: £15,405,000). The total facilities 
have a current limit of £22.70 million (2016: £23.10 million).
All of the Group’s bank facilities remain secured by first fixed and 
floating charges over the Group’s assets. Walker Greenbank PLC

CHIEF FINANCIAL 
OFFICER’S REVIEW  
CONTINUED
PENSION DEFICIT
The pension deficit has increased this year. The increase in liabilities is a 
result of a lower discount rate being applied due to a reduction in the 
bond rates. The impact of these factors is shown as follows:
2017
£000
Deficit at beginning of the year (4,313)
Scheme expenses (392)
Interest cost (2,199)
Expected return on plan assets 2,064
Contributions 1,766
Return on scheme assets 8,107
Actuarial loss from the change in discount factor (12,615)
Experience adjustments on benefit obligation 169
Gross deficit at the end of the year (7,413)
DIVIDENDS
During the year, the Group paid a final dividend for the year ended 
31 January 2016 of 2.45p per share and an interim dividend of 
0.55p per share. 
The Directors have recommended the payment of a final dividend of 
3.06p per share (2016: 2.45p) which will be payable on 11 August 2017 
to shareholders on the register on 21 July 2017. This brings the total 
dividend for the year to 3.61p per share (2016: 2.89p), an increase 
of 24.9%.
GOING CONCERN
The Directors are confident, after having made appropriate enquiries, 
that the Group and Company have adequate resources to continue 
trading for the foreseeable future. For this reason they continue to 
adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK
All foreign currencies are bought and sold centrally on behalf of the 
Group. Regular reviews take place of the foreign currency cash flows 
and unmatched exposures are covered using forward contracts and 
working capital exposures are hedged using currency swaps where 
deemed appropriate.
The Group does not trade in financial instruments and hedges are used 
for highly probable future cash flows and to hedge working capital 
exposures. There is no hedging liability (2016: £26,000 liability) at the 
end of the year in relation to US dollar forward contracts. There is no 
liability (2016: £nil) arising from US dollar and euro swaps used to 
hedge working capital exposures.
CREDIT RISK
The Group no longer seeks credit insurance as this is not a commercial 
solution to reducing credit risk. The Board reviews the internal credit 
limits of all major customers and reviews the credit risk regularly.  
The aging profile of trade debtors shows that payments from 
customers are close to terms however, there have been specific 
expenses during the year. The current economic environment still 
presents a level of risk and in addition to specific provisioning against 
individual receivables, a provision has been required of £65,000 
(2016: £241,000) which is a collective assessment of the risk against 
non-specific receivables.

PRINCIPAL RISKS
THE GROUP HAS PUT IN PLACE AN ONGOING PROCESS TO  
IDENTIFY, MONITOR AND MANAGE THE RISKS FACED BY THE GROUP. 
RISKS ARE RANKED ACCORDING TO THEIR POTENTIAL FINANCIAL 
IMPACT AND PROBABILITY. THE BOARD REGULARLY REVIEW THE  
RISKS FACED BY THE GROUP.
The Audit Committee, on behalf of the Board, has reviewed the 
effectiveness of the internal controls and risk management and no 
significant failings in control were found. 
There are general business risks faced by the Group that are 
comparable to those faced by most other businesses. General business 
risks include:
• Marketplace – changes in the economic environment, weakening of 
the eurozone and changes in consumer discretionary spending.
• Financial – availability of bank borrowing and costs of borrowing, 
taxation and pension fund liability.
• Operational – market penetration, international expansion and 
information security (IT systems and cyber risk).
In addition, there are a number of more specific risks which are more 
relevant to Walker Greenbank and the industry in which we operate. 
These risks are principal risks and uncertainties facing the Group that 
are material to our strategy. 
EMPLOYEES
The Group is a responsible employer, compliant with all relevant human 
resources and health and safety regulations. The Group keeps its 
employees informed on matters affecting them and on the progress of 
the Group by way of informal meetings and consultation with 
employees’ representatives. 
All Group businesses apply the principles of equal opportunity in 
recruitment, career progression and remuneration. Disabled persons  
are given full and fair consideration for employment where an 
appropriate vacancy occurs, having regard to their particular aptitudes 
and abilities. Whenever possible, arrangements are made for the 
continuing employment of persons who have become disabled during 
service and for appropriate training of all disabled employees, who are 
given equal consideration with all other employees in promotion and 
career development.
ENVIRONMENT
Both factories have environmental policies and actively seek to reduce 
their impact on the environment through responsible sourcing of raw 
materials, responsible waste handling and recycling where 
economically viable, and emissions monitoring in accordance with 
environmental permits.
Third party suppliers to the Brands are issued a set of quality and 
operational standards to which they are expected to adhere, which 
includes their confirmation that they conduct their business within all 
applicable laws with regard to human rights, pay, working conditions 
and health and safety.
This report was approved by the Board of Directors on 25 April 2017 
and signed on its behalf by

Group Chief Executive
VIABILITY STATEMENT 
The Group meets its day-to-day working capital requirements 
through its bank facilities of up to £12.5 million. The Group’s 
forecasts, taking into account the Board’s future expectations of  
the Group’s performance, indicate that there is sufficient headroom 
within these bank facilities and the Group will continue to operate 
well within the covenants attaching to those facilities. The Directors’ 
assessment has been made with reference to the resilience of the 
Group and its strong financial position, the Group’s current strategy, 
the Board’s risk appetite and the Group’s principal risks and how 
these are managed, as described in the Strategic Report. 
An assessment period of three years has been chosen as it is 
consistent with the Board’s strategic review of the Group’s strategy 
at which the prospects of each business are discussed; assumptions 
are made regarding entering into new markets and geographies, 
about future growth rates of the existing businesses and potential 
acquisitions and about the acceptable performance of existing 
businesses. Based on the results of this analysis, the Directors have a 
reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in 
operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the three-year 
period of their assessment. Walker Greenbank PLC

RISK CHANGE CONTROLS TO MITIGATE
MARKETPLACE
Trading environment
The Group operates in major 
international markets which have 
experienced headwinds and there is 
ongoing uncertainty around the 
economic outlook for some markets.
Given that our products may be 
viewed as discretionary, there  
is a risk that these are impacted  
by consumer confidence.
Change in consumer trends in 
interior decoration.
The Group continues to focus on strong cost control to try to ensure that it remains well positioned to 
deal with an uncertain environment.
Focus on product diversification through licensing opportunities as well as geographic expansion to 
strengthen our product offering. 
The Group offers a well-balanced, diverse product range to meet the demands of different customers. 
The recent acquisition of Clarke & Clarke, which is at the affordable end of the market, accelerates the 
Group’s market penetration strategy. 
The Group is broad based, carries out consumer research and the design teams constantly monitor 
trends within and outside our marketplace.
Competition
The Group operates in markets that 
are highly competitive.
The Group has sought to differentiate itself through high-quality luxury products and continues to 
develop new product categories and extension of market positions.
We have continued to invest in our British manufacturing sites through innovative printing techniques 
and market-leading factories to provide quality, added-value products.
There is focus on product extension through global recognition of the Group’s heritage brands and  
the contemporary design excellence, broadening the product range and exploring worldwide 
licencing opportunities. 
The Group’s focus is on international expansion through the distribution and marketing of our brands  
in the important US, European and Asia Pacific markets. Our recent acquisition of Clarke & Clarke has 
helped to enhance our international reach, particularly in the US.
We are continuing to make progress with consumer e-commerce development and gaining greater 
consumer insight.
FINANCIAL
Foreign exchange
A large proportion of the Group’s 
activities and earnings are 
denominated in US dollars and 
euros, giving rise to foreign currency 
exposure. 
The Group hedges a portion of revenue and earnings to minimise exposure to foreign exchange losses.
Increasing exchange rate volatility may have an adverse effect on balance sheet and/or profit and  
loss account.
The recent reduction in the value of sterling and ongoing currency fluctuations as a result of Brexit  
will lead to higher input costs; however, we are taking actions to reduce some of this impact. 
Our manufacturing businesses are likely to become more competitive, helping exports.
OPERATIONAL
Recruitment and retention of  
key employees
The Group is reliant upon a number 
of key employees to design, 
manufacture and sell its products.
The Group’s employees are its key asset. The depth of their experience is a real benefit to the business. 
In recognition of this, the Group has developed programmes to help attract and retain employees and 
encourage personal development across all levels.
In addition, the Group offers competitive remuneration packages including long-term incentive schemes 
designed to retain key individuals and during the year has appointed a Group HR director.
Reputation risk
The Group prides itself on the high 
quality of its product range.
There is ongoing emphasis on high quality control throughout the various stages, right from 
manufacturing through to delivery of the finished product and customer satisfaction. 
The Group has invested in customer market research which has helped to identify further areas  
of improvement. 
There is regular monitoring at the monthly Board meetings of the Group’s image and reputation. 
Acquisition risk
Acquiring the wrong company or at 
the wrong price would impact our 
financial return and any benefits 
from the acquisition, as well as 
causing disruption to other business 
activities. 
Management actively evaluate acquisition opportunities that fit synergistically with our brand portfolio. 
We have a rigorous pre-acquisition due diligence process which seeks to evaluate each opportunity. 
Close monitoring of the integration of any acquisition would take place to ensure planned revenue and 
cost synergies are realised to enable further earnings growth.
Sound project discipline would be implemented in the event of an acquisition and would be resourced  
by dedicated and appropriately qualified personnel to ensure minimum disruption to our core  
business activities.
The recent acquisition of Clarke & Clarke was completed following a thorough due diligence process and 
involved a significant number of professional advisers. Trading performance for the first 18 weeks of 
ownership has been in line with expectations. 
Risks are further mitigated through the retention and appropriate incentivisation of acquisition targets’ 
senior management. Where appropriate, the consideration is structured to include deferred and 
contingent elements which are dependent on financial performance for a number of years following 
completion of the acquisition.
Major incident or disaster such as  
fire/flood
An incident affecting one or more 
of the Group’s key locations could 
significantly impact its operations. 
Business continuity and disaster recovery plans are regularly reviewed to ensure the uninterrupted 
operation of the Group’s core business operations.
Business continuity plans are in place to manage the impact of such an event and insurance cover 
mitigates the financial consequences. 
The segregation of the Group’s central warehousing facility with two warehouses has helped to mitigate 
risk to stock.
Flood defence measures have been installed at the Lancaster production site.

CELEBRATE THE ENGLISH COUNTRYSIDE
Founded in 1860 and granted the Royal Warrant in 1923, Sanderson is one of the most 
renowned interiors brands worldwide. Sanderson is famous for its signature style that is 
informed by its heritage and designed for modern living. Combining classic, country-inspired,

BEAUTIFULLY CRAFTED PRODUCTS THAT 
UPHOLD THE LEGACY OF WILLIAM MORRIS
Steeped in history, Morris & Co. dates back to 1861 when the acclaimed designer William Morris

STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the 
financial statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for 
each financial year. Under that law, the Directors have prepared the 
Group financial statements in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (‘IFRSs’) as adopted by the European Union and 
the Company financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom 
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting 
Standards, comprising FRS 101 ‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’, and 
applicable law). Under company law the Directors must not approve the 
financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and 
fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and Company and of the 
profit or loss of the Group and Company for that period. 
In preparing the financial statements, the Directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• state whether applicable IFRSs as adopted by the European Union 
have been followed for the Group financial statements and United 
Kingdom Accounting Standards, comprising FRS 101, have been 
followed for the Company financial statements, subject to any 
material departures disclosed and explained in the financial 
statements;
• make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent; and
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless 
it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and Company will 
continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records 
that are sufficient to show and explain the Group and Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the Group and Company and enable them to 
ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 
2006 and, as regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the 
IAS Regulation.
The Directors are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the 
Group and Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the 
prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the 
Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the 
preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions.
The Directors consider that the Annual Report and Accounts, taken as a 
whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the 
information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group and 
Company’s performance, business model and strategy.
Each of the Directors, whose names and functions are listed in the 
Governance section of the Annual Report, confirm that, to the best of 
their knowledge:
• the Company financial statements, which have been prepared in 
accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting 
Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards, comprising FRS 
101 ‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’, and applicable law), give a 
true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and 
profit of the Company;
• the Group financial statements, which have been prepared in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, give a 
true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and 
profit of the Group; and
• the Strategic Report includes a fair review of the development and 
performance of the business and the position of the Group and 
Company, together with a description of the principal risks and 
uncertainties that it faces. 
In the case of each Director in office at the date the Directors’ Report  
is approved: 
• so far as the Director is aware, there is no relevant audit information 
of which the Group and Company’s auditors are unaware; and
• they have taken all the steps that they ought to have taken as a 
Director in order to make themselves aware of any relevant audit 
information and to establish that the Group and Company’s 
auditors are aware of that information.

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT
INTRODUCTION
As a company listed on the Alternative Investment Market (‘AIM’), the 
Company is not required to comply with the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report requirements set out in Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium-
sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 
as amended in August 2013 (‘the Regulations’). However, while the 
Company is not required to comply with the Regulations, the Company 
has used them as guidance and voluntarily presents selected 
disclosures in this report, where relevant and appropriate.
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
The members of the Remuneration Committee during the financial 
year were Terry Stannard (Non-executive Chairman) and Fiona 
Goldsmith (Non-executive Director). Terry Stannard is Chairman of the 
Remuneration Committee. There have been no changes in the 
composition or chairmanship of the Remuneration Committee during 
the year. The Chief Executive Officer is invited to attend meetings of 
the Committee but no Director is involved in any decisions relating to 
their own remuneration.
None of the Committee has any personal financial interest (other than 
as shareholders), conflicts of interests arising from cross directorships, 
or day-to-day involvement in running the business. 
The Committee is responsible for setting the framework and policy for 
the remuneration of the Executive Directors and designated senior 
managers. It determines specific elements of their remuneration, their 
contractual terms and, where necessary, compensation arrangements.
The Committee keeps itself informed of all relevant developments and 
best practice in the field of remuneration and seeks advice from 
external advisers when it considers it is appropriate. Aon Hewitt was 
retained during the financial year to provide independent advice to the 
Committee where required. 
REMUNERATION POLICY
The Group’s remuneration policy is designed to ensure that the 
remuneration packages attract, motivate and retain Directors and 
senior managers of high calibre and to reward them for enhancing value 
to shareholders. The Company’s policy is that a substantial proportion 
of the total potential remuneration of the Executive Directors should be 
performance related and aligned to performance measures that benefit 
all shareholders and promotes the long-term success of the Company. 
The performance measurement of the Executive Directors and the 
determination of their annual remuneration package, including 
performance targets, is undertaken by the Remuneration Committee. 
There are four main elements of the remuneration package for 
Executive Directors and other senior management:
• basic annual salary and benefits;
• annual bonus payments;
• long-term incentives; and
• pension arrangements.
The remuneration of the Non-executive Directors comprises only 
Directors’ fees and is determined by the Executive Directors.
BASIC SALARY AND BENEFITS IN KIND
Salary is normally reviewed annually in February, or when 
responsibilities change. In deciding the appropriate levels, the 
Committee takes into account factors which it considers necessary, 
including Group and individual performance, market levels of, and 
trends in, executive remuneration and relative pay levels within 
the Group.
In addition to basic salary, each Executive Director is provided with 
health care benefits. 
ANNUAL PERFORMANCE-RELATED BONUS
Each Executive Director’s remuneration package includes a 
performance-related bonus. 
The maximum bonus potential was 100% of basic salary for the year 
ended 31 January 2017. Payouts are based on profit targets and 
performance against individual objectives. Details of the bonus awards 
for 2016/17 are set out on page 39.
LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN (‘LTIP’)
The Company operates the Walker Greenbank Long-Term Incentive 
Plan (‘LTIP’) as its primary senior executive incentive arrangement. 
The LTIP was approved by shareholders at the 2015 Annual General 
Meeting. The LTIP seeks to motivate and retain Executive Directors  
and other senior management within the Group, to enable them to 
potentially benefit from delivering above-market Total Shareholder 
Return (‘TSR’) and earnings growth. The key terms of the LTIP are 
as follows:
• the LTIP has a maximum annual limit of 150% of basic salary;
• awards are normally granted in May each year. In 2016, the highest 
grant equated to a maximum of 150% of basic salary; 
• awards are normally structured as nil cost options; 
• awards only vest (i.e. become exercisable) subject to continued 
service and to the extent that relevant performance conditions  
are met.
The 2017 grant will again be a three-year measurement with the 
performance conditions based on a combination of TSR and EPS.  
This combination rewards both earnings growth and relative stock 
market performance and is consistent with market practice in the 
FTSE All-Share. 
A summary of the performance conditions attaching to outstanding 
awards can be found on page 40. To the extent that these performance 
conditions are not met at the end of the vesting period, the options 
will lapse. 
DILUTION
All equity-based awards are subject to an overall limit on the number 
of new shares issued of 10% within any 10-year period. The current 
dilution against this limit is 2.9%.  Walker Greenbank PLC

personal performance objectives.
PENSIONS
John Sach is a member of the defined benefit section of the Walker 
Greenbank Pension Plan and the Abaris Holdings Pension Scheme.  
Both schemes were closed to new entrants from April 1997 and April 
1998 respectively. Both schemes were closed to future accrual of 
benefits on 30 June 2002 and 30 June 2005 respectively.
 
John Sach, David Smallridge, Fiona Holmes and Mike Gant are 
members of a Group Flexible Retirement Plan (‘the Plan’) sponsored  
by the Group. Part way through the year, due to HMRC changes in tax 
relief, the Remuneration Committee agreed a cash allowance in lieu  
of pension contribution, for those who wished to opt out of the Plan. 
For the purposes of determining employer contributions to that 
scheme, annual performance-related bonuses are not included in  
the pensionable pay of the Executive Directors. 
DIRECTORS’ CONTRACTS
It is the Company’s policy that Executive Directors should have 
contracts with an indefinite term providing for a maximum of one 
year’s notice.
In the event of early termination, the Executive Directors’ contracts 
provide for compensation of an amount equal to the gross salary and 
benefits that they would have received during the balance of the notice 
period, plus any bonus, once declared, to which they would have 
become entitled had contractual notice been given.
NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
All Non-executive Directors have service contracts with an indefinite 
term subject to a six-month notice provision. Their remuneration is 
determined by the Board taking into account their duties and the  
level of fees paid to Non-executive Directors of similar companies.  
The Non-executive Directors do not participate in the Company’s 
bonus or long-term incentive schemes and no pension contributions  
are made in respect of them. Walker Greenbank PLC

The LTIP awards granted in 2013 vested on 16 May 2016.  
The performance conditions attached to this award were based  
both on compound growth in adjusted EPS* and relative TSR against 
a comparator group of AIM companies. The comparator group chosen 
was the AIM companies ranked 101 to 200 by market capitalisation  
as at the day preceding the respective date of grant. The performance 
of the Company over the three-year measurement period resulted in 
a vesting level of 83.625% of the total awards granted. The share price 
on the vesting date was 191.5p. 
The performance conditions for the 2014 and 2015 awards are based 
both on compound growth in adjusted EPS* and relative TSR against a 
comparator group of AIM companies. The comparator group chosen 
was the AIM companies ranked 101 to 200 by market capitalisation as 
at the day preceding the respective date of grant, and the relevant TSR 
measurement is on a sliding scale, with no vesting until the Company 
reaches at least median position within the comparator group. 
The performance conditions for the 2016 awards are also a mixture of 
compound growth in relative TSR against a comparator group of AIM 
companies, and an EPS measurement, with the EPS element based on 
an absolute adjusted EPS* for the period ending 31 January 2019. 
The comparator group chosen was the AIM companies ranked 101 to 
200 by market capitalisation as at the day preceding the respective 
date of grant, and the relevant TSR measurement is on a sliding scale, 
with no vesting until the Company reaches at least median position 
within the comparator group.  Walker Greenbank PLC

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT
As a company listed on the Alternative Investment Market (‘AIM’),  
the Company is not required to issue a Corporate Governance 
Statement of Compliance with the principles and provisions of the  
UK Corporate Governance Code (‘the Code’); however, the Company 
voluntarily presents disclosures that reflect the extent of the Company’s 
application of the Code. 
CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
The Board supports the principles and aims of the Code. Good 
governance reduces risk and adds value to our business. Delivering 
growth and long-term shareholder value with effective and efficient 
decision making is of high importance to the Board. 
THE BOARD
The Company is supervised by the Board of Directors. The Board 
comprises three Executive and two Non-executive Directors.  
There is a clear division of responsibilities between the Chairman,  
who is responsible for the effective leadership and smooth running  
of the Board, and the Chief Executive Officer who, with the other 
Executive Directors, is responsible for the running of the Company.
THE DIRECTORS
The Board of Directors who served during the year ended 31 January 
2017 and their attendance at meetings is shown in the adjacent table. 
Biographical details of the current Board are given on pages 34 and 35.
BOARD PROGRAMME
The Board meets at least eight times each year in accordance with its 
scheduled meeting calendar and the attendance by each Board 
member at scheduled meetings is shown in the adjacent table.
THE ROLE OF THE BOARD
The Board is responsible for the long-term success of the Company. 
There is a formal schedule of matters reserved to the Board. It is 
responsible for overall Group strategy; approval of major capital 
expenditure projects; approval of the annual and interim results; annual 
budgets; dividend policy; and Board structure. It monitors the exposure 
to key business risks and reviews the strategic direction of all trading 
subsidiaries, their annual budgets, their performance in relation to 
those budgets and their capital expenditure.
All Directors receive regular and timely information on the Group’s 
operational and financial performance. Relevant information is 
circulated to the Directors in advance of meetings. The business reports 
monthly on its performance against its agreed budget, and the Board 
reviews the monthly update on performance and any significant 
variances are reviewed at each meeting.
Senior executives below Board level attend Board meetings where 
appropriate to present business updates.
Board meetings throughout the year are held at the Company’s  
various sites giving, in particular the Non-executive Directors, access  
to the manufacturing sites to gain a greater understanding of the 
Group’s activities.
INDEPENDENT ADVICE
All Directors are able to take independent professional advice in the 
furtherance of their duties, if necessary, at the Company’s expense.  
In addition, the Directors have direct access to the advice and services 
of the Company Secretary.
BOARD COMMITTEES
The Board has Remuneration, Audit and Nomination committees, each 
of which has written terms of reference which are available on the 
Company’s website. The Company Secretary acts as secretary to the 
committees. The Board is satisfied that the committees discharged 
their responsibilities appropriately.

The Board scheduled eight meetings during the year and additional 
meetings were convened to deal with specific matters and approval  
of the financial results.
INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS
The Board considers, after careful review, that the Non-executive 
Directors bring an independent judgement to bear. All Non-executive 
Directors have contracts which contain six-month notice clauses.  
These are available for inspection at the Company’s registered office 
and at the Annual General Meeting (‘AGM’). All Directors retire by 
rotation at regular intervals in accordance with the Company’s Articles 
of Association and the principles of the Code. The Non-executive 
Directors continue to retire for re-election at least every third year and 
their other time commitments are reviewed regularly. Further details of 
each of the independent Directors are set out on page 34.
All Directors undergo a performance evaluation before being proposed 
for re-election to ensure their performance continues to be effective, 
that where appropriate they maintain their independence and that 
they are demonstrating continued commitment to the role.
NOMINATION COMMITTEE
The Nomination Committee is chaired by Terry Stannard, Non-
executive Chairman, and comprises Fiona Goldsmith, the other 
Non-executive Director, and John Sach, the Chief Executive Officer.
It makes recommendations to the Board on all new Board 
appointments. The Company’s Articles of Association stipulate that 
one-third of the Directors, or the nearest whole number below 
one-third, shall retire each year. The Company requires all Directors  
to submit themselves for re-election at least every three years.  Walker Greenbank PLC
Annual Report and Accounts 2017
43
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
The Remuneration Committee is chaired by Terry Stannard and 
comprises himself and Fiona Goldsmith. The Remuneration Committee 
is responsible for making recommendations to the Board in relation to 
all aspects of remuneration for Executive Directors and designated 
senior managers. The Remuneration Committee believes that the 
presence of the Chief Executive Officer is important when determining 
the remuneration of the other Executive Directors.
In framing its policy the Remuneration Committee takes into account 
any factors which it deems necessary, including industry standard 
executive remuneration, differentials between executive and employee 
remuneration and differentials between executives. The remuneration 
of the Non-executive Directors is determined by the Executive Directors.
AUDIT COMMITTEE
The Audit Committee is chaired by Fiona Goldsmith and comprises 
herself and Terry Stannard. Although all the Committee members are 
considered to be appropriately experienced to fulfil their role, Fiona 
Goldsmith is considered as having significant and relevant experience in 
line with the Code. Further details of the work of the Committee is 
contained in the Audit Committee Chairman’s report on page 46.
INTERNAL CONTROL
The Board acknowledges that it is responsible for the Group’s system  
of internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness. 
The Board keeps its risk control procedures under constant review 
particularly with regard to the need to embed internal control and risk 
management procedures further into the operations of business, both 
in the UK and overseas, and to deal with areas of improvement which 
come to management’s and the Board’s attention.
As might be expected in a group of this size, a key control procedure is 
the day-to-day supervision of the business by the Executive Directors, 
supported by the senior managers with responsibility for key operations.
The Executive Directors are involved in the budget setting process, 
regularly monitor key performance indicators and review management 
accounts on a monthly basis, noting and investigating any major 
variances. All significant capital expenditure decisions are approved  
by the Board as a whole.
RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS
The Group’s significant risks, together with the relevant control and 
monitoring procedures, are subject to regular review to enable the 
Board to assess the effectiveness of the system of internal control. 
During the course of its reviews the Board has not identified nor been 
advised of any failings or weaknesses which it has determined to be 
significant other than disclosed in the Strategic Report and the Report 
of the Directors.
The Group’s system of internal control is designed to manage rather 
than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives, and can 
only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material 
misstatement or loss. The Group’s systems are designed to provide 
reasonable assurance as to the reliability of financial information, 
ensuring proper control over income and expenditure, assets 
and liabilities.
The Board has considered the need for an internal audit function,  
but because of the size and nature of its operations does not consider  
it necessary at the current time.
RELATIONS WITH SHAREHOLDERS
The Group encourages two-way communications with both its 
institutional and private investors and responds in a timely fashion  
to all queries received. 
The Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have regular 
dialogue with individual institutional investors in order to develop  
an understanding of their views. Presentations are made to  
analysts, investors and prospective investors covering the annual  
and interim results.
The Company website (www.walkergreenbank.com) has an Investors 
section giving private investors direct access to business information 
and Company reports. There is also an enquiries mailbox facility.
All shareholders receive notice of the AGM, at which all committee 
chairs will be available for questions. Walker Greenbank PLC

AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT
Each meeting is attended by the Committee’s members as well as, by 
invitation, the Executive Directors and the external auditor. A record of 
the meeting attendance by Committee members is set out on page 42. 
During the year, the Audit Committee held a private meeting with  
the external auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (‘PwC’), without 
management being present, in order to receive feedback from them. 
The Committee Chairman also met with PwC separately on several 
occasions.
The Committee supports the Board in carrying out its responsibilities in 
relation to financial reporting, risk management and assessing internal 
controls. The need for an internal audit department is also examined 
on a continuing basis. The Committee also manages the relationship 
with the external auditor.
The Committee undertook the following activities during the course  
of the year:
FINANCIAL REPORTING
The Committee reviews the half-year and annual financial statements 
and matters raised by management and the auditors.
• The accounting policies used are consistent both year on year  
and across the Group (other than as disclosed in note 1 of the 
financial statements).
• The methods used to account for significant transactions 
are appropriate.
• The financial statements give a true and fair view and the 
disclosures made are balanced and understandable.
• Appropriate estimates and judgements have been used, taking  
into account the views of the external auditor.
• The appropriate accounting standards have been applied.
INTERNAL CONTROLS AND RISK MANAGEMENT
There is an ongoing process to identify, evaluate and manage the risks 
faced by the Group.
The Committee reviews this risk management process annually, and 
the process is continually being developed and improved. Each business 
unit reports monthly on key risks identified and measures that are being 
taken to mitigate the risk. The Strategic Report includes further detail 
as to the business risks identified and actions being taken. 
The Audit Committee, on behalf of the Board, has reviewed the 
effectiveness of the internal controls and risk management and no 
significant failings in control have been found.
Fiona Goldsmith
Audit Committee Chairman
MEMBERSHIP
The Committee is comprised solely of independent Directors,  
being myself as Chairman, and the other Non-executive Director, 
Terry Stannard. The Board is satisfied that I have significant and 
relevant experience in line with the Code.
RESPONSIBILITIES
The objective of the Committee is to provide oversight and 
governance to the Group’s financial reports, its internal controls  
and processes in place, its risk management systems and the 
appointment and relationship with the external auditors.
• Monitor the integrity of the financial statements of the 
Company, reviewing any significant reporting issues and 
judgements they contain.
• Advise on the clarity of disclosure and information contained  
in the Annual Report and Accounts.
• Ensure compliance with applicable accounting standards and 
review the consistency of methodology applied.
• Review the adequacy and effectiveness of the internal control 
and risk management systems.
• Oversee the relationship with the external auditors, reviewing 
performance and advising the Board on their appointment  
and remuneration.
• Ensure appropriate arrangements are in place for individuals  
to raise concerns regarding breach of conduct and legal and 
regulatory compliance.
TERMS OF REFERENCE
Updated terms of reference were adopted by the Board in 2012. 
These are available on the website.
MEETINGS
The Committee meets three times per year: in April and September, 
being the appropriate time to review the Annual Report and 
Accounts and the interim report respectively; and also in January to 
review the previous year and plan for the year ahead. At meetings 
the findings of the external audit are discussed, and the 
effectiveness of the Company’s system of internal controls and risk 
management is reviewed. Walker Greenbank PLC
Annual Report and Accounts 2017
45
EXTERNAL AUDIT
The Committee considers a number of areas when reviewing the external 
auditor appointment, namely their performance in discharging the audit, 
the scope of the audit and terms of engagement, their independence 
and objectivity, and their reappointment and remuneration.
The Committee reviews the objectivity and independence of the 
auditors when considering reappointment. The external auditor reports 
to the Committee on actions taken to comply with professional and 
regulatory requirements and is required to rotate the lead audit partner 
every five years. 
PwC provide a range of other services which include tax compliance 
and advisory services. 
To ensure auditor objectivity and independence, the Committee has 
adopted a policy on the engagement of external auditors for the 
provision of non-audit services, which include financial limits above 
which the Audit Committee must approve. The policy is available on 
the website.
Any non-audit fees above £15,000 per engagement must be approved 
by the Chairman of the Audit Committee before the work commences. 
Details of fees paid to PwC during the year are disclosed in note 8 of 
the financial statements.
The Committee had discussions with the external auditor on audit 
planning, fees, accounting policies, audit findings and internal controls. 
The effectiveness of the audit was assessed through the review of audit 
plans, reports and conclusions and through discussions with 
management and the external auditor.
The Committee has confirmed it is satisfied with the independence, 
objectivity and effectiveness of PwC and has recommended to the 
Board that the auditors be reappointed, and there will be a resolution  
to this effect at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.

REPORT ON THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
OUR OPINION
In our opinion, Walker Greenbank PLC’s Group financial statements (the 
‘financial statements’):
• give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 
31 January 2017 and of its profit and cash flows for the year then 
ended;
• have been properly prepared in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRSs’) as adopted by the European 
Union; and
• have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the 
Companies Act 2006.
WHAT WE HAVE AUDITED
The financial statements, included within the Annual Report and 
Accounts (the ‘Annual Report’), comprise:
• the Consolidated Balance Sheet as at 31 January 2017;
• the Consolidated Income Statement and the Consolidated 
Statement of Comprehensive Income for the year then ended;
• the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement for the year then ended;
• the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity for the year then 
ended; and
• the notes to the financial statements, which include a summary of 
significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the 
preparation of the financial statements is IFRSs as adopted by the 
European Union, and applicable law.
In applying the financial reporting framework, the Directors have 
made a number of subjective judgements, for example in respect 
of significant accounting estimates. In making such estimates, 
they have made assumptions and considered future events.
OPINIONS ON OTHER MATTERS PRESCRIBED BY THE 
COMPANIES ACT 2006
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:
• the information given in the Strategic Report and the Report of the 
Directors for the financial year for which the financial statements 
are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and
• the Strategic Report and the Report of the Directors have been 
prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.
In addition, in light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group 
and its environment obtained in the course of the audit, we are required 
to report if we have identified any material misstatements in the 
Strategic Report and the Report of the Directors. We have nothing to 
report in this respect.
INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT TO THE MEMBERS 
OF WALKER GREENBANK PLC
 
OTHER MATTERS ON WHICH WE ARE REQUIRED TO REPORT 
BY EXCEPTION
ADEQUACY OF INFORMATION AND EXPLANATIONS RECEIVED
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in 
our opinion, we have not received all the information and explanations 
we require for our audit. We have no exceptions to report arising from 
this responsibility. 
DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in 
our opinion, certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by 
law are not made. We have no exceptions to report arising from this 
responsibility. 
RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND 
THE AUDIT
OUR RESPONSIBILITIES AND THOSE OF THE DIRECTORS
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities 
set out on page 37, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of 
the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true 
and fair view.
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial 
statements in accordance with applicable law and International 
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) (‘ISAs (UK & Ireland)’). Those 
standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s 
Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for 
the Company’s members as a body in accordance with Chapter 3 of 
Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do 
not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any 
other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or 
into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior 
consent in writing.
WHAT AN AUDIT OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INVOLVES
We conducted our audit in accordance with ISAs (UK & Ireland). An 
audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in 
the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that 
the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether 
caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: 
• whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s 
circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately 
disclosed; 
• the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the 
Directors; and 
• the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
We primarily focus our work in these areas by assessing the Directors’ 
judgements against available evidence, forming our own judgements, 
and evaluating the disclosures in the financial statements. Walker Greenbank PLC
Annual Report and Accounts 2017
47
We test and examine information, using sampling and other auditing 
techniques, to the extent we consider necessary to provide a 
reasonable basis for us to draw conclusions. We obtain audit evidence 
through testing the effectiveness of controls, substantive procedures or 
a combination of both. 
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information 
in the Annual Report to identify material inconsistencies with 
the audited financial statements and to identify any information 
that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially 
inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course 
of performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent 
material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the 
implications for our report. With respect to the Strategic Report 
and Report of the Directors, we consider whether those reports 
include the disclosures required by applicable legal requirements.
OTHER MATTER
We have reported separately on the Company financial statements of 
Walker Greenbank PLC for the year ended 31 January 2017.

• The maintenance and integrity of the Walker Greenbank PLC website is the 
responsibility of the Directors; the work carried out by the auditors does not involve 
consideration of these matters and, accordingly, the auditors accept no responsibility 
for any changes that may have occurred to the financial statements since they were 
initially presented on the website.
• Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of 
financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions. Walker Greenbank PLC

1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND GENERAL INFORMATION
GENERAL INFORMATION
Walker Greenbank PLC (‘the Company’) and its subsidiaries (together ‘the Group’) is a luxury interior furnishings group whose brands include 
Sanderson, Morris & Co, Harlequin, Zoffany, Scion, Anthology, Clarke & Clarke and Studio G. The brands are targeted at the mid to upper end  
of the premium market. They have worldwide distribution including prestigious showrooms at Chelsea Harbour, London and the D&D building, 
Manhattan, New York. Half of the Brands’ turnover is sourced in-house from the Group’s own specialist manufacturing facilities of Standfast & 
Barracks, the fabric printing business situated in Lancaster, and Anstey Wallpaper Company situated in Loughborough. The Manufacturing 
businesses produce for other interior furnishing businesses both in the UK and throughout the world. The Company is a public limited company 
which is listed on the Alternative Investment Market of the London Stock Exchange and is registered and domiciled in the UK. The company 
registration number is 61880 and the address of its registered office is Chalfont House, Oxford Road, Denham UB9 4DX.
BASIS OF PREPARATION
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the 
European Union (‘IFRSs as adopted by the EU’) and IFRS Interpretations Committee (‘IFRS IC’) interpretations and the Companies Act 2006 
applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention,  
as modified by the valuation of derivative financial instruments at fair value through profit and loss, and with the accounting policies set out  
below which have been consistently applied to all periods presented unless otherwise indicated. 
The Group meets its day-to-day working capital requirements through its banking facilities. The Group’s forecasts and projections, taking account 
of reasonably possible changes in trading performance, show that the Group will be able to operate within the level of its current facilities as 
disclosed in note 23.
The Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable 
future. Therefore the Group continues to adopt the going concern basis in preparing its consolidated financial statements.
In preparing these financial statements the Group has applied the IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and the IFRS IC interpretations where 
the effective date is relevant to the financial year commencing on 1 February 2016 or ending 31 January 2017. 
Since the Group’s previous annual financial statements for the year ended 31 January 2016 the following pronouncements are now effective and 
have been adopted by the Group:
• Amendment to IAS 1 ‘Presentation of Financial Statements’, on disclosure initiative – effective periods beginning on or after 1 January 2016
• Amendments to IAS 16 ‘Property, Plant and Equipment’ and IAS 38 ‘Intangible Assets’ – Amendments relating to Clarification of Acceptable 
Methods of Depreciation and Amortisation – effective periods beginning on or after 1 January 2016
There has been no material effect on the Group’s financial statements following the introduction of the above.
The Group has not applied the following new standards, amendments and interpretations for which adoption is not mandatory for the year ending 
31 January 2017 and/or which have not yet been endorsed by the EU. With the exception of IFRS 15 and IFRS 16 where the Group is continuing to 
assess the materiality of the impact of these new standards, the Group has concluded its evaluation of the impact of these pronouncements but 
at this stage does not expect there to be any material impact on the financial statements:
• IFRS 9 ‘Financial instruments’ – classification and measurement – effective periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018
• IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’ – effective periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018
• IFRS 16 ‘Leases’ – effective periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019 
• Amendment to IAS 7 ‘Cash flow statements’ on disclosure initiative – effective periods beginning on or after 1 January 2017
In addition, a number of exposure drafts of new or amended standards and interpretations have been announced by the International Accounting 
Standards Board (‘IASB’). Until final details of these exposure drafts have been concluded by the IASB, the Group is not able to evaluate the 
potential impact on the Group of these pronouncements.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires 
management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgement 
or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements, are disclosed in note 3.
The financial statements of the Company as an entity are prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101, ‘Reduced Disclosure 
Framework’ (‘FRS 101’) and the Companies Act 2006 and are presented separately from the consolidated financial statements (pages 92 to 108).

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Walker Greenbank PLC
Annual Report and Accounts 2017

1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND GENERAL INFORMATION CONTINUED
BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION
The consolidated financial information incorporates the financial statements of the Company and all its subsidiary undertakings made up to 
31 January each year. Subsidiaries are entities where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies, generally 
accompanying a shareholding of more than one half of the voting rights. The existence and effect of potential voting rights that are currently 
exercisable or convertible are considered when assessing whether the Group controls another entity.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the Income Statement from the effective date on which control is 
transferred to or from the Group, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring accounting policies used into line with those used by 
the Group.
The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the purchase method. The cost of the acquisition is measured as the aggregate of the fair 
values, at the date of exchange, of the assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group, in exchange for 
control of the acquiree. Any acquisition costs are expensed as incurred. The identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a 
business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date. 
Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the Group is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. Subsequent changes to the fair 
value of the contingent consideration that is deemed to be an asset or liability is recognised in accordance with IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments: 
Recognition and Measurement’ either in profit or loss or as a change to other comprehensive income. Contingent consideration that is classified as 
equity is not remeasured, and its subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity.
Goodwill arising on acquisition is recognised as an asset in accordance with the policy described below.
All inter-company transactions and balances are eliminated on consolidation. Profits and losses resulting from inter-company transactions that are 
recognised in assets, such as inventory, are eliminated in full. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an 
impairment of the assets transferred.
The Employee Benefit Trust (‘EBT’) controlled by the Group is also included by consolidation. Until shares held by the EBT vest unconditionally in 
and are transferred to employees, the consideration paid for those shares is deducted from consolidated equity. No gain or loss is recognised in the 
statement of comprehensive income on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of shares, including transfers to and from treasury shares. 
Dividends receivable on shares held by the EBT are excluded from the Income Statement, and are excluded from amounts recognised as dividends 
payable by the Group. 
FOREIGN CURRENCIES
For the purpose of the consolidated financial statements, the results and financial position are expressed in sterling, which is the functional 
currency of the Company, and the presentation currency for the consolidated financial statements.
Transactions in foreign currencies, which are those other than the functional currency of the Company, are recorded at the rate ruling at the date 
of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency are translated at the rate ruling at the Balance Sheet date. All 
unhedged exchange differences are recognised in the Income Statement for the period within administration expenses.
The assets and liabilities of the Group’s overseas subsidiaries on consolidation are translated at the rates of exchange ruling at the Balance Sheet 
date. The income and expenses are translated at the weighted average rate during the period. Differences on translation are recognised in a 
separate foreign currency translation reserve within equity.
INTANGIBLE ASSETS – GOODWILL
Goodwill arising on acquisition of subsidiaries is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the fair value of the consideration for the acquisition, 
which includes the amount of any non-controlling interest recognised, over the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the acquired entity’s 
identifiable assets and liabilities and any non-controlling interest in the acquiree at the date of acquisition. 
Goodwill is not amortised, but reviewed for impairment annually; any impairment is recognised immediately in the Income Statement and is not 
subsequently reversed. If a significant event occurs that may affect the carrying value of goodwill, an impairment review will be carried out. No 
such events have occurred in the current or previous financial year. Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units for the purpose of impairment 
testing. The allocation is made to those cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the business combination in which the goodwill 
arose. The measurement basis for goodwill is cost less accumulated impairment.
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED  
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
CONTINUED Walker Greenbank PLC
Annual Report and Accounts 2017
55
On disposal of a subsidiary or cash-generating unit, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on 
disposal.
INTANGIBLE ASSETS – ARTHUR SANDERSON AND WILLIAM MORRIS ARCHIVE 
The Arthur Sanderson and William Morris Archive comprises an historical record of unique designs that can be used at any point going forward and 
is regularly used to generate a significant royalty income in the business. The Directors believe that the Archive has an indefinite useful life and is 
therefore not subject to amortisation. The carrying value of this asset is reviewed annually and provision made for any impairment in the carrying 
value if required. If a significant event occurs that may affect the carrying value of the Archive, an additional impairment review will be carried out. 
No such events have occurred in the current or previous financial year. The measurement basis used for the Archive is historical cost less 
accumulated impairment.
INTANGIBLE ASSETS – SOFTWARE 
Acquired computer software licences are capitalised at the cost incurred to bring the asset into use, including where relevant, directly attributable 
internal costs incurred in preparing the software for operation. The costs are amortised to their estimated residual value over their estimated 
useful lives which range from three to 10 years on a straight-line basis. Software amortisation commences when the asset goes into operational 
use by the business. The measurement basis used for software is cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment.
INTANGIBLE ASSETS – COLLECTION DESIGN
Research expenditure is recognised as an expense as incurred. Costs incurred on development projects relating to the design of new collections are 
recognised as intangible assets when the following criteria are fulfilled:
• It is technically feasible to complete the new collection so that it will be available for use or sale.
• Management intends to complete the new collection and use it or sell it.
• There is an ability to use or sell the new collection.
• It can be demonstrated how the new collection will generate probable future economic benefits.
• Adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the new collection are available. 
• The expenditure attributable to the new collection during its development can be reliably measured.
Any costs relating to the design of new collections that do not meet these criteria are recognised as an expense as incurred. Any such costs 
recognised as an expense in previous periods are not recognised as an asset in a subsequent period. Capitalised collection design costs are 
recognised as intangible assets and are amortised to their estimated residual value, which is 25% of their historical cost, on a straight-line basis 
over the life of the asset, and are tested for impairment if any impairment trigger events are identified in accordance with IAS 36. The 
measurement basis used for collection design is cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment.
INTANGIBLE ASSETS – BRANDS
Brands acquired, separately or as part of a business combination, are capitalised if they meet the definition of an intangible asset and the 
recognition criteria are satisfied. Strategic brands are well-known international/local brands with a strong market position and an established brand 
name. 
Strategic brands have a finite useful economic life and are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation. Brands are amortised on an individual 
straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the brands being 20 years. 
INTANGIBLE ASSETS – CUSTOMER-RELATED INTANGIBLES
Customer-related intangibles are capitalised if they meet the definition of an intangible asset and the recognition criteria are satisfied. If the 
amounts are not material, these are included in the brand valuation. The relationship between brands and customer-related intangibles is carefully 
considered so that brands and customer-related intangibles are not both recognised on the basis of the same cash flows.
Customer-related intangibles acquired as part of a business combination are valued at fair value. Customer-related intangibles acquired separately 
are measured at cost. 
Customer-related intangibles are amortised on a straight-line basis over the remaining useful life of the customer relationships, currently being 
six years.
PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT
Property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment loss. Historical cost 
comprises the purchase price and costs directly incurred in bringing the asset into use. The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed 
annually and adjusted, if appropriate, at each Balance Sheet date. Walker Greenbank PLC
Annual Report and Accounts 2017
56
1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND GENERAL INFORMATION CONTINUED
Depreciation is charged on a straight-line basis on the original costs (excluding freehold land) after deduction of any estimated residual value. The 
principal annual rates are:
Freehold buildings   2%
Leasehold improvements  Over the length of the lease
Plant, equipment and vehicles  Between 5% and 33%
Computer hardware   33%
Government grants received for property, plant and equipment are included within other payables and deferred revenue and released to the 
Income Statement over the life of the asset. 
IMPAIRMENT OF NON-FINANCIAL ASSETS
Intangible assets with finite useful lives and property, plant and equipment are tested for impairments if events or changes in circumstances 
(assessed at each reporting date) indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. When an impairment test is conducted, the 
recoverable amount is assessed by reference to the higher of the value in use (net present value of expected future cash flows of the relevant 
cash-generating unit), or the fair value less cost to sell.
Goodwill and other intangible assets with an indefinite useful life are tested for impairment at least annually.
If a cash-generating unit is impaired, provision is made to reduce the carrying amount of the related assets to their estimated recoverable amount. 
Impairment losses are allocated firstly against goodwill, and secondly on a pro rata basis against intangible and other assets.
Non-financial assets other than goodwill that suffer impairment are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at each reporting date.
INVENTORIES
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost comprises direct materials, on a first-in, first-out basis, and direct labour, 
plus attributable production overheads based on a normal level of activity. Net realisable value is based on estimated selling prices less anticipated 
costs of disposal. Provision is made for any slow-moving and obsolete inventory.
MARKETING MATERIALS
Marketing materials consist of patterning books and other saleable marketing assets used to support the sale of the Group’s products. They are 
recognised at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost comprises direct materials plus costs of production. 
Net realisable value is based on estimated recoveries from customers and distributors for those pattern books expected to be sold, less the 
anticipated cost of disposal. 
As books are sold or otherwise utilised and are no longer within the control of the Group, their cost is charged to the Income Statement as an 
expense. An impairment allowance is made for any slow-moving and obsolete marketing materials including those expected to be given away free 
of charge. The Group’s policy is to classify marketing materials on the Balance Sheet within trade and other receivables.
Non-saleable marketing materials are expensed to the Income Statement once the collection that these marketing materials relate to has been 
launched. Any subsequent costs or development expenditure are expensed as incurred.
FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES – MEASUREMENT BASIS
Financial assets and liabilities are recognised on the date on which the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument 
giving rise to the asset or liability. Financial assets and liabilities are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs and are continually 
reviewed for impairment going forward. Any impairment of a financial asset is charged to the Income Statement when incurred. Financial assets 
are derecognised when the Group’s rights to cash inflows from the asset expire; financial liabilities are derecognised when the contractual 
obligations are discharged, cancelled or expire.
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED  
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
CONTINUED Walker Greenbank PLC
Annual Report and Accounts 2017
57
Non-derivative financial assets are classified as ‘loans and receivables’ according to the purpose for which the asset was acquired. This category 
includes:
• ‘trade and other receivables’ – these are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active 
market. They arise when the Group provides goods directly to a customer, or advances money, with no intention of trading the loan or 
receivable. Subsequent to initial recognition, loans and receivables are included in the Balance Sheet at amortised cost using the effective 
interest method less any amounts written off to reflect impairment, with changes in the carrying amount recognised in the Income Statement 
within distribution and selling or administration expenses; and 
• ‘cash and cash equivalents’ – these comprise deposits with an original maturity of three months or less with banks and financial institutions, 
bank balances, bank overdrafts with the right of offset and cash in hand.
A provision for impairment of trade and other receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect 
all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables. Significant financial difficulties of the receivable, probability that the receivable 
will enter bankruptcy or financial reorganisation, default or delinquency in payments, and the unavailability of credit insurance at commercial rates 
for receivables are considered indicators that the trade receivable may be impaired. The amount of the provision is the difference between the 
asset’s carrying amount and the net present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate. The carrying 
amount of the asset is reduced through the use of a provision account, and the amount of the loss is recognised in the Income Statement within 
distribution and selling expenses. When a trade receivable is uncollectible, it is written off against the provision account for trade receivables. 
Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against distribution and selling expenses in the Income Statement.
The Group’s non-derivative financial liabilities are classified as ‘other liabilities’. Other liabilities are financial liabilities with fixed or determinable 
payments that are not quoted in an active market. They arise when the Group receives goods or services directly from a payable or supplier, or 
borrows money, with no intention of trading the liability. This category includes:
• ‘trade and other payables’ – these are typically non-interest bearing and following initial recognition are included in the Balance Sheet at 
amortised cost using the effective interest method;
• ‘bank loans and overdrafts’ – these are initially recorded at fair value based on proceeds received net of issue costs and subsequently held at 
amortised cost using the effective interest method; and
• ‘borrowings’ – these are recorded initially at the fair value, net of direct issue costs, and are subsequently stated at amortised cost. Finance 
charges, including premiums payable on settlement, or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for in the Income Statement, using 
the effective interest method, and are included within the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the 
period in which they arise. Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the 
liability for at least 12 months after the end of the reporting period.
Borrowing costs are capitalised as an increase to the carrying value of software or property, plant and equipment on major projects where their 
impact is material. 
DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGE ACCOUNTING – MEASUREMENT BASIS 
The Group’s activities expose it to the financial risks of changes in exchange rates, and the Group uses forward exchange rate contracts and swap 
exchange rate contracts to manage these exposures. The use of derivative financial instruments is governed by the Group’s policies approved by 
the Board of Directors, which provide written principles on the use of derivative financial instruments.
The Group documents at the inception of the transaction the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items. The Group also 
documents its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are 
highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items. The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives 
that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognised in equity. 
The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the Income Statement within ‘Other operating income/(expense)’. 
Amounts accumulated in equity are released to the Income Statement when the hedged item affects the Income Statement, and are also 
classified in the Income Statement within ‘Other operating income/(expense)’. 
Derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting under IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement’ are classified as 
‘financial assets or liabilities at fair value through profit or loss’. They are initially recognised at fair value, with fair value being remeasured at each 
reporting date. The fair value of the derivative is based on the market price of comparable instruments at the Balance Sheet date. Changes in fair 
value are included in the Income Statement within finance costs. 
The Group has no embedded derivatives that are not closely related to the host instrument. Walker Greenbank PLC
Annual Report and Accounts 2017
58
1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND GENERAL INFORMATION CONTINUED
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
Cash and cash equivalents represent only liquid assets with original maturity of 90 days or less. Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand, 
deposits held at call with banks and bank overdrafts. Bank overdrafts that cannot be offset against other cash balances are shown within 
borrowings in current liabilities on the Balance Sheet.
For the purposes of the Cash Flow Statement, it is the Group’s policy to classify interest income and expense within ‘cash flows from operating 
activities’. 
OFFSETTING FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the Balance Sheet when there is a legally enforceable right to offset the 
recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. The legally 
enforceable right must not be contingent on future events and must be enforceable in the normal course of business and in the event of default, 
insolvency or bankruptcy of the Company or the counterparty.
LEASES
Leases are classified as finance leases where the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the Group. All 
other leases are classified as operating leases.
Operating lease rentals are charged to the Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease. Rent-free periods receivable on 
entering an operating lease are released on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. 
EMPLOYEE BENEFITS – RETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS 
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due. 
For defined benefit retirement schemes, the funding of benefits is determined using the projected unit credit method, with full actuarial valuations 
being carried out triennially.
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the Balance Sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit obligation as adjusted for 
unrecognised service cost, and as reduced by the fair value of the scheme assets. Any asset resulting from this calculation is limited to past service 
cost, plus present value of available refunds and reductions in future contributions to the plan.
The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by qualified independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method. The present value 
of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the future cash outflows using interest rates of high quality corporate bonds that 
have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension liability. 
Scheme expenses met by the Group, expected returns on plan assets, and interest on pension scheme liabilities are classified within ‘Net defined 
benefit pension charge’ within the Income Statement as the scheme is now closed to future accruals. 
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised in full in the period in which 
they occur. They are recognised outside the Income Statement and presented in the Statement of Comprehensive Income. 
Past service costs are recognised immediately to the extent that the benefits are already vested, and otherwise are amortised on a straight-line 
basis over the average period until the benefits become vested.
EMPLOYEE BENEFITS – SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS UNDER LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLANS (‘LTIP’)
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees which must be measured at fair value and recognised as an expense 
in the Income Statement with a corresponding increase in equity. 
The fair values of these payments are measured at the date of grant, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the awards are 
granted. The fair value is recognised over the period during which employees become conditionally entitled to the awards, subject to the Group’s 
estimate of the number of awards which will lapse, either due to employees leaving the Group prior to vesting or due to non-market based 
performance conditions not being met. 
The total amount recognised in the Income Statement as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of awards that vest. National insurance 
contributions related to the awards are recognised as an expense in the Income Statement with a corresponding liability on the Balance Sheet.

EMPLOYEE BENEFITS – SHORT-TERM BONUS PLANS
The Group recognises a liability and an expense for bonuses where contractually obliged or where there is a past practice that has created a 
constructive obligation. 
SHARE CAPITAL
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Costs directly attributable to the issue of new ordinary shares are shown in equity as a deduction, net of 
tax, from the proceeds. Dividend distribution is set by the Board on a regular basis so long as sufficient funds are available.
SHARE PREMIUM
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new ordinary shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the 
proceeds.
TREASURY SHARES
Consideration paid including any directly attributable incremental costs (net of income taxes) on the purchase of the Company’s equity share 
capital (treasury shares) is deducted from equity attributable to the Company’s equity holders until the shares are cancelled or reissued. Where 
such shares are subsequently reissued, any consideration received, net of any directly attributable incremental transaction costs and the related 
income tax effects, is included in equity attributable to the Company’s equity shareholders. The EBT is treated as an agent of the Group and, as 
such, EBT transactions are treated as being those of the Group.
REVENUE
The Group revenue is measured at fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts recoverable by the Group for 
goods and services provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts, VAT and other sales-related taxes. Revenue comprises:
• Sales of goods – sales of goods are recognised when the Group has transferred to the buyer the significant risks and rewards of ownership, 
which is usually at the point of delivery of the goods.
• Royalty revenue – royalties are received from licence holders under the terms of various agreements, and are recognised on an accruals basis in 
accordance with the substance of the relevant agreement.
Deposits received from customers in advance of the delivery of goods or services are recognised as deferred revenue. Amounts receivable from 
customers representing the recovery of expenses incurred by the Group for design and set-up costs, delivery and marketing materials are not 
considered to be revenue, and are credited to the relevant expense within the Income Statement.
NON-UNDERLYING ITEMS
Items that are both material and whose nature is sufficient to warrant separate disclosure and identification are disclosed within the financial 
statements and classified within their relevant category in the Income Statement as non-underlying. 
Where some or all of the expenditure required to settle a provision is expected to be reimbursed by another party, the reimbursement shall be 
recognised when, and only when, it is virtually certain that reimbursement will be received if the entity settles the obligation. The reimbursement 
shall be treated as a separate asset and recognised as an ‘other receivable’.
TAXATION INCLUDING DEFERRED INCOME TAX
The tax expense represents the sum of the current tax and deferred tax charges or credits. 
Current tax is based on the taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from the net profit as reported in the Income Statement because it 
excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or 
deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the Balance Sheet 
date. Current tax includes withholding taxes from sales and licensing income in overseas territories. 
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial 
statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability 
method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and such assets and liabilities are not recognised if 
the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in 
a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit. Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences 
arising on investments in subsidiaries except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the 
temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Walker Greenbank PLC

1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND GENERAL INFORMATION CONTINUED
IAS 12 ‘Income taxes’ requires that the measurement of deferred tax should have regard to the tax consequences that would follow from the 
manner of expected recovery or settlement at the Balance Sheet date of the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities. In calculating its deferred 
tax liability the Group’s policy is to regard the depreciable amount of the carrying value of its property, plant and equipment to be recovered 
through continuing use in the business, unless included within assets held for resale, where the policy is to regard the carrying amount as being 
recoverable through sale.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which temporary differences 
can be utilised. The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each Balance Sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer 
probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised. Deferred tax 
is charged or credited in the Income Statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred 
tax is also dealt with in equity. Deferred tax relating to retirement benefit obligations is also recognised in equity where the tax relief arises from 
contributions paid to fund deficits arising in previous periods that were recognised in equity. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities and 
when the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the same taxable entity or 
different taxable entities and there is an intention to settle the balances on a net basis.
SEGMENTAL REPORTING
The Group is a designer, manufacturer and distributor of furnishings, fabrics and wallpaper and manages its operations as two reportable 
segments, which are Brands and Manufacturing. 
Reportable segments consist of one or more operating segments. Aggregation of operating segments into reportable segments occurs when 
aggregation criteria, as laid down in IFRS 8 ‘Operating Segments’ are satisfied, including similar economic characteristics or when operating 
segments are less than the quantitative limits as laid down in IFRS 8. After applying aggregation, segmental information is disclosed in a manner 
consistent with the internal reporting to the Chief Operating Decision Maker (‘CODM’). 
The Group considers its CODM to be the Board of Directors, who are responsible for the allocation of resources and assessing performance of the 
operating segments. 
INTEREST RECEIVED
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable.
2. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including foreign exchange risk and interest rate risk), credit risk and 
liquidity risk. The Group’s overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential 
adverse effects on the Group’s financial performance. The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures.
Risk management is carried out at Board level under policies approved by the Board of Directors. Executive Directors identify, evaluate and where 
appropriate, hedge financial risks in close co-operation with the Group’s operating units. 
A) FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK
The Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currency exposures, primarily with respect to the 
US dollar and the euro. Foreign exchange risk arises when future commercial transactions or recognised assets or liabilities are denominated in a 
currency that is not the entity’s functional currency.
The Group’s policy is, where possible, to allow the Group’s entities to settle liabilities in their functional currency with the cash generated from their 
operations in that currency. Where the Group’s entities have liabilities denominated in a currency other than their functional currency (and have 
insufficient reserves of that currency to settle them) cash already denominated in that currency will, where possible, be transferred from elsewhere 
in the Group.
To manage the foreign exchange risk arising on future transactions, it is the Group’s policy to enter into forward currency contracts to hedge  
the exposure.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Annual Report and Accounts 2017

For the year ended 31 January 2017, the average sterling to US dollar translation rate applied by the Group, including the impact of hedging 
contracts was £1: US$1.35. If the rate had been £1: US$1.25 with all other variables held constant, profit before tax would have been higher by 
£314,000. If the rate had been £1: US$1.45 with all other variables held constant, profit before tax would have been lower by £270,000. 
For the year ended 31 January 2017, the average sterling to euro translation rate applied by the Group, including the impact of hedging contracts 
was £1: €1.13. If the rate had been £1: €1.03 with all other variables held constant, profit before tax would have been lower by £60,000. If the rate 
had been £1: €1.23 with all other variables held constant, profit before tax would have been higher by £50,000.
The sensitivities tested above reflect movements in the foreign currency exchange rates over the financial year. The sensitivity of movements in 
other currencies is not considered material to the performance of the Group. 
B) INTEREST RATE RISK
As the Group has no significant interest-bearing assets its revenue and cash generated from operations are substantially independent of changes 
in market interest rates. 
The Group’s interest rate risk arises from borrowings. Borrowings issued at variable rates expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk. The 
Group’s borrowings at variable rate are denominated in either UK pounds or euros. The Group regularly analyses its interest rate exposure 
calculating the impact on profit and loss of a defined interest rate shift. Based on the calculations the Board considers refinancing, renewal of 
existing positions, alternative financing and hedging. The Group has not felt there has been a requirement during the current or previous financial 
year to enter into any of these options.
In December 2015, the Group entered into a new multi-currency revolving credit facility with Barclays Bank PLC and cancelled the existing 
receivables facility. Variable interest rates were negotiated on all the loans. The Board continues to monitor the interest rates monthly.
For the year ended 31 January 2017, had the benchmark interest rate levels been 0.5% higher/(lower) than the actual experience, with all other 
variables held constant, the profit before tax of the Group would have been (lower)/higher by £27,000 due to the change in interest rate expense 
on variable rate borrowings. The 0.5% sensitivity is deemed a reasonable sensitivity analysis based on expected movements in the base rate for 
the next financial year.
C) CREDIT RISK
Credit risk arises from the Group’s trade receivables, cash held with banks and derivative financial instruments. It is the risk that the counterparty 
fails to discharge its obligation in respect of the instrument. Cash at bank and derivative financial instruments are predominantly held with the 
Group’s major relationship bank, Barclays Bank PLC, and the Group considers this credit risk to be minimal.
The Group does not have any significant credit risk exposure to any single company or group of companies within trade receivables, as the nature 
of the Group’s operations mean that trade receivables consist of a large number of customers spread across diverse industries and geographical 
areas. 
Prior to accepting new customers an independent credit check is obtained. Based on this information individual credit limits and payment terms 
are established. If no independent credit ratings are available, customers are asked to pay on a proforma basis until creditworthiness can be 
established. The utilisation of credit limits is regularly monitored. Credit limits may only be exceeded with the authorisation from key management; 
this is dependent on the amount expected to exceed the limit and the Group’s trading history with that customer.
There is no difference between the carrying amount and the maximum credit risk exposure. No collateral is held as security by the Group.
D) LIQUIDITY RISK
Liquidity risk arises from the Group’s management of working capital and the finance charges and principal repayments on its debt instruments. It 
is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting its financial obligations as they fall due. The maturity profile of the Group’s debt and 
other financial liabilities is disclosed in note 23.
During the year the Group had facilities with Barclays Bank PLC which are disclosed in note 23.
Management monitors rolling forecasts of the Group’s cash and loan facility utilisation on a monthly basis. The Group ensures that it has 
adequate facilities available to cover both its short-term and medium-term commitments and complies with bank covenants. In addition, the 
Group’s liquidity management policy is to project cash flows in major currencies and consider the level of liquid assets necessary to meet these 
liabilities as they fall due. Surplus cash held over and above the balance required for working capital requirements is transferred to the Group 
treasury and held in interest-bearing accounts. Walker Greenbank PLC

2. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED
E) CAPITAL RISK MANAGEMENT
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are:
• to safeguard the entity’s ability to continue as a going concern, so that it can provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other 
stakeholders; and
• to provide an adequate return for shareholders by pricing products and services commensurately with the level of risk.
The Group sets the amount of capital in proportion to risk. The Group manages the capital structure and makes adjustments to it in light of 
changes in economic conditions and the risk characteristics of the underlying assets. In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group 
may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares, buy back issued shares, or sell assets to 
reduce debt.
The Group monitors capital on the basis of the average net debt to adjusted capital ratio (or ‘gearing ratio’). The ratio is calculated as average net 
debt divided by adjusted capital. Average net debt is calculated as the total debt less cash and cash equivalents during the year. Adjusted capital 
comprises all components of equity (i.e. share capital, share premium, retained earnings, and other reserves) other than amounts recognised in 
equity relating to cash flow hedges and forward currency contracts.
During the year to 31 January 2017, the Group’s strategy, which was unchanged from the previous year, was to reduce the average gearing ratio. 
The average gearing ratios for 2017 and 2016 were as follows:
Year ended 31 January
2017 
£000
2016
 £000
Average net debt 3,040 3,921
Total equity 51,293 35,284
Add: amounts recognised directly in equity relating to currency contracts – 26
Adjusted capital 51,293 35,310
Average net debt to adjusted capital ratio 5.9% 11.1%
Year end net debt/(funds) to adjusted capital ratio 10.4% (6.5)%
The Group considers the average net debt to adjusted capital ratio to be appropriate at this time, but it will continue to reduce the pension deficit 
by cash generated from operations and will also invest within the Group through capital expenditure and working capital.
The gearing ratio at the year end is higher than the average gearing ratio due to the seasonal nature of trading in the months of December and 
January.
F) FAIR VALUE ESTIMATION
The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is determined using quoted forward exchange rates at the Balance Sheet date provided by 
relationship banks. Under the revisions to IFRS 7 these amounts are classified within level two of the fair value hierarchy. 
The carrying value less impairment provision of trade receivables and payables and cash and cash equivalents approximate their fair values. 
3. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS
The Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning future events. The resulting accounting estimates will seldom precisely equal the related 
actual results. The Group applies its best endeavours in setting accounting estimates, and uses historical experience and other factors, including 
input from experienced and specialist management. Estimates and assumptions are periodically re-evaluated and the resulting accounting 
balances updated as new information, including actual outcomes, become apparent. 
The estimates and judgements that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within 
the next financial year are discussed below. 
A) RETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS
The Group recognises its obligations to employee retirement benefits. The quantification of these obligations is subject to significant estimates 
and assumptions regarding life expectancy, discount and inflation rates, wage and salary changes, the rate of increase in pension payments, and 
the market values of equities, bonds and other pension assets. In making these assumptions the Group takes advice from a qualified actuary 
about which assumptions reflect the nature of the Group’s obligations to employee retirement benefits. The assumptions are regularly reviewed to 
ensure their appropriateness. 
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED  
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
CONTINUED Walker Greenbank PLC
Annual Report and Accounts 2017

The Group determines the appropriate discount rate at the end of each year. This is the interest rate that should be used to determine the present 
value of estimated future cash outflows expected to be required to settle pension obligations. In determining the appropriate discount rate, the 
Group considers the interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that 
have terms to maturity approximating the terms of the related pension liability. Details of the estimates and assumptions applied, and carrying 
amounts of retirement benefit obligations and pension assets, are set out in note 24.
B) IMPAIRMENT OF NON-FINANCIAL ASSETS
The Group tests annually whether goodwill or its indefinite life intangible asset has suffered any impairment, in accordance with its accounting 
policy. Other intangibles and property, plant and equipment are also reviewed whenever impairment triggers are apparent. The recoverable 
amounts of cash-generating units have been determined based on value in use (‘VIU’) calculations. These calculations require use of estimates of 
future sales, margins, and other operating and administration expenses, and of discount rates. Further disclosures relating to the estimates and 
assumptions applied, and carrying amounts of the non-financial assets, are set out in notes 15 and 16.
The Group makes provision for impairment in the carrying amount of its inventories and marketing materials. The nature of the Group’s products 
are exposed to changes in taste and attitudes from time to time, which can affect the demand for those products. The Group has skilled and 
experienced management who utilise historical sales information, and exercise their judgement, in making estimates about the extent of 
provisions necessary based on the realisable value of inventory and expected future benefit to the Group of marketing materials, taking into 
account the estimated price and volume of future sales or usage, less the further costs of sale and holding costs. Further disclosures relating to the 
effect on the Income Statement of the establishment and reversal of such provisions against inventory are included in note 8. Details of the 
carrying amount of inventories are disclosed in note 18 and of marketing materials in note 19. The carrying values of the non-financial assets are 
not considered to be sensitive due to the nature of the assets. 
C) DEFERRED TAX RECOGNITION
The Group considers it appropriate to recognise at the Balance Sheet date deferred tax assets resulting from historical trading losses and other 
temporary differences including pension deficits and the impact of awards under the long-term incentive plan. The amount of deferred tax 
recognised is based on estimates of the timing and amount of future taxable profits of companies within the Group, which in turn relies upon 
estimates of future operating profits and the occurrence, timing and tax treatment of significant items of income and expenditure including 
contributions to pension schemes and the vesting of LTIP payment awards. Further disclosures relating to the effect on the Income Statement of 
the recognition of deferred tax assets are included in note 13 and the amount of deferred tax asset recognised and other relevant disclosures are 
included in note 17. The Group considers the sensitivity on deferred tax recognition to be based on profits generated by the Group and tax rates 
substantively enacted. There has been no material impact on sensitivity in the current or previous financial year.
D) LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN PAYMENT AWARDS
The Group has granted awards to Executive Directors and senior management which include vesting conditions relating to the future financial 
performance of the Group as measured by adjusted profit before tax (‘PBT’) and the relative performance of the Group’s Total Shareholder Return 
(‘TSR’) against comparator companies. The fair value of the awards granted is charged against the Income Statement over the vesting period; the 
amount of that charge including the national insurance component of the charge, is dependent upon the Group’s estimates of how many awards 
will ultimately vest, which is linked directly to its estimates regarding future PBT and TSR achievement. Further disclosures relating to performance 
targets are included in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 38 to 41 and in note 27.
E) BUSINESS COMBINATIONS
The Group applies judgement in determining whether a transaction is a business combination, which includes consideration as to whether the 
Group has acquired a business or a group of assets. For business combinations, the Group estimates the fair value of the consideration transferred, 
which includes assumptions about the future performance of the business acquired and an appropriate discount rate to determine the fair value of 
any contingent consideration. There is some sensitivity in determining this accounting estimate as there is a range of outcomes. If the EBITDA of 
the acquired business increases by 10%, then the contingent consideration would be £127,000 higher and if it decreased by 10%, it would be 
£127,000 lower. Judgement is also applied in determining whether any future payments should be classified as contingent consideration or as 
remuneration for future services. The Group estimates the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the business combination, 
including any separately identifiable intangible assets and considering contingent liabilities. These estimates also require inputs and assumptions 
including future earnings, customer attrition rates and discount rates. The Group engages external experts to support the valuation process, where 
appropriate.
The fair value of the contingent consideration recognised in business combinations is reassessed at each reporting date, using updated inputs and 
assumptions based on the latest financial forecasts for the relevant business. Judgement is applied as to whether changes should be applied at the 
acquisition date or as post-acquisition changes. Fair value movements and the unwinding of the discounting is recognised within finance costs in 
the Income Statement. Walker Greenbank PLC

£1,407,000) and represents business interruption reimbursements to cover loss of profits.
7. NON-STATUTORY PROFIT MEASURES
UNDERLYING PROFIT MEASURES
The Group seeks to present a measure of underlying performance which is not impacted by material non-recurring items or items considered 
non-operational in nature. This measure of profit is described as ‘underlying’ and is used by management to measure and monitor performance. 
The excluded items are referred to as ‘non-underlying’ items.
NON-UNDERLYING ITEMS
The non-underlying items included in profit before tax are as follows:

FACTORS AFFECTING CURRENT AND FUTURE TAX CHARGES
No overseas taxation is anticipated to become payable within the immediate future due to the availability of gross tax losses of approximately 
£2.8 million (2016: £1.3 million).
The deferred tax balance at 31 January 2017 included within these financial statements has been calculated at a rate of 17%, as this is the rate at 
which the majority of the balances are expected to unwind.
A change to the UK corporation tax rate was announced in the Chancellor’s Budget on 16 March 2016 and became substantively enacted in the 
Finance Bill 2016 on 6 September 2016 to reduce the main rate to 19% from 1 April 2017 and to 17% from 1 April 2020. Walker Greenbank PLC

14. EARNINGS PER SHARE
Basic earnings per share (‘EPS’) is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of 
shares outstanding during the year, excluding those held in the Employee Benefit Trust (‘EBT’) and those held in treasury (note 27), which are 
treated as cancelled. The adjusted basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the adjusted earnings by the weighted average number of 
shares. As a consequence of the improved profitability of the Group, PBT performance criteria within LTIPs 8, 9 and 10 are now being met and as a 
consequence these LTIP awards are now dilutive.

As detailed in note 33, in order to finance the initial cash consideration to acquire 100% of the issued share capital of Clarke & Clarke, a placing of 
a total of 8,947,369 new ordinary shares of 1p each in the Company was announced on 12 October 2016. These shares, which represented 
approximately 12.9% of the Company’s issued ordinary share capital on admission to trading on AIM (excluding treasury shares), were placed at a 
price of 190.0 pence per share, raising proceeds of approximately £17,000,000.
On 16 May 2016, 773,393 shares vested under the Company’s Long-Term Incentive Plan. To satisfy the vesting, 431,788 shares of 1 pence each 
were allotted at par value.
Following these transactions, Walker Greenbank’s issued ordinary share capital with voting rights consists of 69,551,678 (2016: 60,172,521) 
ordinary shares of which no (2016: nil) ordinary shares are held in treasury and 4,909 (2016: nil) ordinary shares are held by the Walker Greenbank 
PLC EBT. Shares held in treasury or by the EBT are treated as cancelled when calculating EPS.
 
On 18 May 2015, 1,090,326 shares vested under the Company’s LTIP, of which 188,272 shares were issued from the Walker Greenbank PLC EBT.
The market value of shares held by the EBT at 31 January 2017 was £9,941 (2016: nil). The total number of shares held in the EBT at the year end 
represented 0.01 % (2016: 0%) of the issued shares.

During the year, goodwill (£14,736,000), brand (£5,566,000) and customer related intangibles (£4,427,000) have been recognised on the business 
combination of Clarke & Clarke (note 33).
The Arthur Sanderson and William Morris Archive was purchased as part of the acquisition of Arthur Sanderson & Sons on 29 August 2003. It 
comprises an historical record of unique designs that are used to generate royalty income in the business. 
The total amortisation expense of £1,019,000 (2016: £602,000) is split between administration expenses £666,000 (2016: £594,000), distribution 
and selling costs £11,000 (2016: £8,000) and £342,000 (2016: £nil) in non-underlying items. The amount included in non-underlying items relates 
to the amortisation of acquired intangible assets.
IMPAIRMENT TESTS FOR GOODWILL AND ARTHUR SANDERSON AND WILLIAM MORRIS ARCHIVE 
Out of the total carrying value of goodwill at year end of £15,295,000 (2016: £559,000), £14,736,000 (2016: £nil) is attributable to the Brands 
segment and £559,000 (2016: £559,000) to the Manufacturing segment.
The carrying value of the Archive at the year end of £4,300,000 (2016: £4,300,000) is attributable to the Brands segment. 
The Group tests goodwill and the Archive for impairment annually or more frequently if there are indications that they might be impaired. There 
was no impairment charge recognised in the year (2016: £nil). 
In assessing whether an impairment of goodwill is required, the carrying value of the cash-generating unit (‘CGU’) or group of CGUs is compared 
with its recoverable amount. The recoverable amounts for each CGU, being a division of the business operated at a separate site, and collectively 
for groups of CGUs that make up the segments of the Group’s business have been based on the value in use (‘VIU’). 
The Group estimates the VIU using a discounted cash flow model (‘DCF’), where the projected cash flows for separate or collective groups of CGUs 
are discounted using a pre-tax rate of 11.34% (2016: 11.11 %). The discount rate used is the same across all segments. Walker Greenbank PLC
Annual Report and Accounts 2017
74
15. INTANGIBLE ASSETS CONTINUED
The Group has used formally approved budgets for the first two years (2016: two years) of its VIU calculation, with extrapolation beyond the last 
explicit year using an assumption of growth for future years ranging from 1 % to 2% (2016: 1 % to 2%) depending upon the CGU being tested. 
The cash flows used in the calculation of the VIU are derived from past experience and are based on operating profit forecasts, which in turn rely 
upon assumptions relating to sales growth, margins and operating and administration expenses. The cash flows have not included the benefits 
arising from any future asset enhancement expenditure and therefore exclude significant benefits anticipated from future capital expenditure. The 
growth rates included within the assumptions supporting the VIU calculations do not therefore represent the Group’s anticipated total forecast 
growth, but rather only the growth deriving from capital expenditure completed at the Balance Sheet date.
The recoverable amount of the Archive intangible asset is estimated based on VIU, and comprises estimated future cash flows from royalty 
income relating to the Archive. A discount rate of 11.34% (2016: 11.11 %) is applied.
The Group does not consider it reasonably probable that any significant changes to the key assumptions will arise that would result in impairment 
of either goodwill or the Archive as at 31 January 2017.

A deferred tax credit of £484,000 (2016: charge of £1,114,000) arising on retirement benefit obligations has been recognised within the Statement 
of Comprehensive Income.
At 31 January 2017 the Group has gross unused UK tax losses of £3,225,000 (2016: £3,225,000) available for offset against future profits. 
Potential deferred tax assets at 31 January 2017 of £613,000 (2016: £674,000) relating to UK tax losses and deductible temporary differences 
have not been recognised as it is not considered probable that recovery of the potential deferred tax asset will arise under existing tax legislation. 
These are summarised in the table below and comprise the following: 
• No deferred tax has been recognised on £3,225,000 (2016: £3,225,000) of gross UK losses as these are not readily available for offset against 
the Group’s future profits under existing tax legislation and therefore the realisation of these losses is not considered probable. 
• In addition, there are gross tax losses in overseas subsidiaries of £2,782,000 (2016: £1,302,000) which are available for offset against future 
taxable profits by those subsidiaries. However, the realisation of these losses is not considered probable in the foreseeable future. 
• Other deductible temporary differences which predominantly arise on LTIP payment reserves.

There are also unutilised capital tax losses at 31 January 2017 of £4,881,000 (2016: £4,881,000) but no deferred tax asset has been recognised as

CREDIT QUALITY OF FINANCIAL ASSETS
(i) Neither past due nor impaired
Included in the Group’s trade receivable balances are receivables with a carrying value of £8,782,000 (2016: £6,637,000) which are neither past 
due nor impaired at the reporting date. The nature of the Group’s business means that it has a long-standing relationship with the majority of its 
customers, who either have no experience of historical default or only temporary late payments with full recovery of balances due.

(ii) Past due – not individually impaired
Included in the Group’s trade receivable balances are receivables with a carrying value of £4,248,000 (2016: £3,134,000) which are past due at the 
reporting date for which the Group does not consider the need to create a specific impairment provision against individually identified receivables. 
The table below shows the aging analysis of the receivables:

61–90 days past due 515 –
91+ days past due 154 –
4,248 3,134
The Directors believe, however, that in the current economic environment there is objective evidence of credit deterioration and an impairment of 
£65,000 (2016: £241,000) representing a collective assessment of risk against receivables that are yet to be specifically identified. Due to the 
nature of the Group’s products, there is a limited amount of inventory left in the possession of customers that could act as collateral under terms of 
trade. As the value of this inventory is immaterial, it has not been disclosed in the financial statements. 
(iii) Past due – individually impaired
As at 31 January 2017, trade receivables of £272,000 (2016: £692,000) were individually determined to be impaired and provided for. The amount 
of the provision was £133,000 (2016: £157,000). The main factor used to assess the impairment of trade receivables is the circumstances of the 
individual customer. 
The carrying amounts of the Group’s trade and other receivables are denominated in the following currencies:

20. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
2017
 £000
2016 
£000
Forward foreign exchange contracts – cash flow hedges – (liability) – (26)
FORWARD FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTRACTS
The Group’s US-based subsidiary, Walker Greenbank Inc., sells products to local customers with sales invoiced in US dollars. As the Group’s 
presentation currency is sterling, it is exposed to changes in the reported sterling value of these sales. The Group considers that it is highly probable 
that future sales of this nature will continue to arise over at least the next 12 months. 
The Company enters into monthly forward foreign exchange contracts with a third party to buy sterling and sell US dollars. The Group designates 
these contracts as cash flow hedges of the foreign currency risk arising from the highly probable future forecast sales transactions. As at the 
reporting date, there were no US dollar forward exchange contracts and, therefore, the fair value of the forward foreign currency contracts relating 
to the benefit on these anticipated future transactions was £nil (2016: liability of £26,000). 
The amounts deferred in equity are released into the Income Statement in the period or periods during which the hedged forecast transactions 
impact the Income Statement, which is normally within one month of the Balance Sheet date.
The Brands make more purchases from the eurozone than sales made to the eurozone. As the Group’s presentation currency is sterling it is exposed 
to changes in the reported sterling value of the purchases. The Group considers that the level of this exposure will reduce over the next 12 months. 
As at the reporting date there were no euro forward foreign currency contracts. 
SWAP FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTRACTS
The Group uses swap contracts to manage its working capital exchange risk from both the foreign subsidiaries and the balances on receivables, 
payables and cash held in foreign currency. These swap contracts are designated as fair value through the Income Statement.
The use of swaps are reviewed monthly and renewed when necessary.
As at the reporting date, there were no US dollar swap contracts (2016: fair value liability of £nil) and no euro swap contracts (2016: fair value asset 
of £nil).

In December 2015, the Group entered into a new £12,500,000 multi-currency revolving credit facility with Barclays Bank PLC for a five-year period and 
cancelled the existing receivables facilities. The agreement also includes a £10,000,000 accordion facility option to further increase available credit 
which provides substantial headroom for future growth. An initial bank arrangement fee of £100,000 and an additional £40,000 incurred during the 
year is amortised over the life of the loan. The total facilities from Barclays Bank PLC comprises: a variable rate term loan secured on the Group’s 
freehold property which is being repaid on a five-year profile and a revolving credit facility which may be drawn down in either sterling or euro. 
The total Barclays Bank PLC facilities are capped at £22,700,000 (2016: £23,100,000); the utilisation of the facilities at the year end was 
£6,825,000 (2016: £596,000). The term loan bears interest at variable rates based on a margin above the Bank of England base rate. The revolving 
credit facility bears interest at a variable rate based on a margin above LIBOR (for sterling loans) or the EURIBOR (for euro loans).
Under the Barclays Bank PLC facilities, the Group is subject to a financial covenant which applies to the term loan, being interest cover. The 
revolving credit facility is also subject to compliance of two financial covenants, being interest cover and leverage. Any non-compliance with 
covenants could, if not remedied or waived, constitute an event of default with respect to any such arrangements. The Group has reported to 
Barclays Bank PLC that it was in full compliance with its covenants throughout each of the periods presented and expects to be for the remaining 
term of the agreement. 
For the Group’s cash at bank, and the receivable component of derivative financial instruments, the counterparty to the financial instruments is a 
major UK bank, and the Group does not consider there to be any significant credit risk from holding these financial assets. 
The fair value of current borrowings approximates their carrying amount, as the impact of discounting is not significant. The carrying amounts and 
fair value of the non-current borrowings are as follows:
 Carrying amount Fair value
2017

24. RETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATION
DEFINED CONTRIBUTION SCHEMES
The Group contributes to the defined contribution section of the Abaris Holdings Limited Pension Scheme and to a Group Personal Pension Plan 
which is also a defined contribution scheme. Contributions are charged to the Income Statement as incurred and amounted to £405,000 (2016: 
£495,000). There are no outstanding or prepaid contributions at 31 January 2017 (2016: nil). Active members of the schemes are also able to 
make contributions. 
DEFINED BENEFIT SCHEMES
Walker Greenbank PLC operates two defined benefit schemes in the UK which both offer pensions in retirement and death benefits to members: 
the Walker Greenbank Pension Plan and the Abaris Holdings Limited Pension Scheme. Pension benefits are related to the members’ final salary at 
retirement and their length of service. The schemes are closed to new members and to future accrual of benefits. This disclosure excludes any 
defined contribution assets and liabilities.
The Group’s contributions to the schemes for the year beginning 1 February 2017 are expected to be £1,907,000.
Plan assets held in the fund are governed by local regulations and practice in the UK. Responsibility for the governance of the plan, including 
investment decisions and contributions schedules, lies with the Trustees of the schemes.
Actuarial valuations of the schemes were carried out as at 31 January 2017, based on membership data at 5 April 2015, updated to take account 
of benefit outgo since 5 April 2015, using actuarial assumptions at 31 January 2017. The major assumptions used by the actuary were (in nominal 
terms) as follows:
2017 2016
Discount rate 2.80% 3.75%
Inflation assumption (RPI) 3.35% 2.85%
Inflation assumption (CPI) 2.35% 1.85%
Rate of increase in salaries 3.35% 2.85%
Rate of increase to pensions in payment, that increase in line with RPI subject to a maximum of 5% p.a. 3.10% 2.80%
Rate of increase to pensions (in excess of GMP) in deferment 2.35% 1.85%

*  With corresponding changes to the salary and pension increase assumptions.
RISK EXPOSURE
Through its defined benefit pension plans, the Group is exposed to a number of risks, the most significant of which are detailed below: 
• Asset volatility
 The plan liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields; if plan assets underperform this yield, this 
will create a deficit. 
• Changes in bond yields
 A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase plan liabilities, although this will be partially offset by an increase in the value of the plans’ 
bond holdings. 
• Inflation risks
 Some of the Group’s pension obligations are linked to salary inflation, and higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities (although, in most cases, 
caps on the level of inflationary increases are in place to protect the plan against extreme inflation). The majority of the plan’s assets are either 
unaffected by (fixed interest bonds) or loosely correlated with (equities) inflation, meaning that an increase in inflation will also increase the 
deficit. 
• Life expectancy 
 The majority of the plans’ obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member, so increases in life expectancy will result in an increase 
in the plans’ liabilities.
The weighted average duration of defined benefit obligations is 17 years.

For the financial assets and liabilities, subject to enforceable master netting arrangements or similar arrangements above, each agreement 
between the Group and the counterparty allows for the net settlement of the relevant financial assets and liabilities when both elect to settle on a 
net basis. In the absence of such an election, financial assets and liabilities will be settled on a gross basis; however, each party to the master 
netting agreement or similar agreement will have the option to settle all such amounts on a net basis in the event of default of the other party.

All holders of ordinary shares have the right to vote at general meetings of the Company and to distributions from dividends or on winding up of 
the Company. 
As detailed in note 33, in order to finance the initial cash consideration to acquire 100% of the issued share capital of Clarke & Clarke, a placing of 
a total of 8,947,369 new ordinary shares of 1p each in the Company was announced on 12 October 2016. These shares, which represented 
approximately 12.9% of the Company’s issued ordinary share capital on admission to trading on AIM (excluding treasury shares), were placed on 
12 October 2016 at a price of 190.0 pence per share, raising proceeds of approximately £17,000,000.
On 16 May 2016, 773,393 shares vested under the Company’s Long-Term Incentive Plan. To satisfy the vesting, 431,788 shares of 1 pence each 
were allotted at par value.
Following these transactions, Walker Greenbank’s issued ordinary share capital with voting rights consists of 69,551,678 (2016: 60,172,521) 
ordinary shares of which no (2016: nil) ordinary shares are held in treasury and 4,909 (2016: nil) ordinary shares are held by the Walker Greenbank 
PLC EBT. Shares held in treasury or by the EBT are treated as cancelled when calculating EPS.
 
On 18 May 2015, 1,090,326 shares vested under the Company’s LTIP, of which 188,272 shares were issued from the Walker Greenbank PLC EBT.
The market value of shares held by the EBT at 31 January 2017 was £9,941 (2016: nil). The total number of shares held in the EBT at the period end 
represented 0.01 % (2016: nil) of the issued shares.
Shares held by the EBT and the treasury shares are held for the purpose of satisfying awards under long-term incentive plans to Executive Directors 
and senior management. 
LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLANS (‘LTIPS’)
The Group operates an LTIP. There have been 10 awards under this plan, in which Executive Directors and senior management of the Group 
participate. The first award vested during 2009, the second vested during 2011, the third, fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh vesting in subsequent 
years. The LTIP has previously been approved by the shareholders at an Annual General Meeting.

Awards under the scheme are granted in the form of nil-priced share options, and are to be satisfied either using market-purchased shares or by the 
issuing of new shares. The awards vest in full or in part dependent on the satisfaction of specified performance targets at the end of the vesting 
period applying to each plan. The number of awards that vest is dependent upon both the adjusted profit before tax (‘PBT’) achieved for the 
relevant year or the Group’s Total Shareholder Return (‘TSR’) during the vesting period within a comparator group. Details are set out below:

Awards Eight and Nine have half the award based on vesting conditions that are market based and half based on the growth in adjusted EPS. 
Award Ten has half the award based on vesting conditions that are market based and half based on the absolute adjusted EPS. The weighted 
average fair value of options granted during the year (Award Ten) that related to market-based vesting conditions was determined using the 
Monte-Carlo valuation model was 119.33p per option. The significant inputs into the model were weighted average share price of 204.5p at the 
grant date, exercise price shown above, dividend yield of 1.47%, an expected option life of three years, and an annual risk-free interest rate of 
0.24%. The volatility measured at the standard deviation of continuously compounded share returns is based on statistical analysis of daily share 
prices over the last three years. The fair value of the options granted based on vesting conditions of growth in EPS was determined using the 
Black-Scholes valuation model was 195.70p. Refer to note 11 for the total expense recognised in the Income Statement for share options granted 
to Directors and employees.

33. BUSINESS COMBINATIONS
On 12 October 2016, the Group conditionally acquired 100% of the issued share capital of Globaltex 2015 Limited, a company registered in the 
UK, for an initial cash consideration of £25,000,000 and a contingent consideration of up to £17,500,000, in aggregate, payable in the Company’s 
shares linked to the performance of the acquired business over a four-year period, giving a total potential consideration of up to £42,500,000 
excluding working capital adjustments. The completion date for the transaction was 31 October 2016.
Globaltex 2015 Limited is the parent entity and owns 100% of the issued share capital of Globaltex Limited, trading as Clarke & Clarke, which is a 
UK-based designer and worldwide distributor of interior fabrics and wallpapers. 
In order to finance the initial cash consideration, a placing of a total of 8,947,369 new ordinary shares of 1p each in the Company was announced 
on 12 October 2016. These shares, which represented approximately 12.9% of the Company’s issued ordinary share capital on admission to 
trading on AIM (excluding treasury shares), were placed at a price of 190.0 pence per share, raising proceeds of approximately £17,000,000. The 
remaining portion of the cash consideration is being funded from the Company’s existing accordion tranche of its bank facilities and from the 
Company’s existing cash resources. 
The following tables summarise the consideration for Clarke & Clarke, the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date.

(a) Acquisition-related costs charged to the Income Statement for the year ended 31 January 2017 are detailed in note 7.
(b) The fair value of the acquired identifiable intangible assets of £9,993,000 is provisional pending receipt of the final valuations of those assets.
(c) In accordance with IFRS, the inventory value was uplifted to fair value at the date of the acquisition by £1,243,000 and this adjustment 
increased cost of sales in the post-acquisition period. £1,061,000 cost in respect of unwind of the fair value uplift adjustment is considered an 
exceptional cost of sale (note 7). The balance of the fair value uplift which is still to be unwound included within inventories as at 31 January 
2017 was £182,000. 
(d) Included in trade and other receivables were trade receivables with a carrying value of £3,524,000 expected to be recoverable in full. The fair 
value of trade receivables acquired approximates their carrying value. 
(e) Goodwill is mainly attributable to growth opportunities identified for the acquired business, both in the UK and globally, plus cost synergies 
expected to arise. None of the goodwill recognised is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.
(f) No contingent liabilities other than the contingent consideration of £5,148,000 at the acquisition date were recognised as a result of the 
business combination. The contingent consideration arrangement requires the Group to pay, in shares, to the former owners of Clarke & Clarke, 
for four years from 2017 to 2020 based on a target EBITDA number up to a maximum undiscounted amount of £17,500,000 in Group shares. 
 The fair value of the contingent consideration arrangement of £5,148,000 was estimated by applying the income approach. The fair value 
estimates are based on a discount rate of 10.9% and assumed probability-adjusted profit in Clarke & Clarke of £22,100,000 to £22,600,000. 
This is a level 3 fair value measurement. The key unobservable assumptions in calculating this profit are: the EBITDA projections of the Clarke & 
Clarke business for the four years from 2017 to 2020 and the discount rate applied (10.9%). 
 As of 31 January 2017, there was an increase of £181,000 recognised in the Income Statement for the contingent consideration arrangement, 
as the assumed probability adjusted contingent consideration was recalculated to be approximately £5,329,000. Assuming all other variables 
are held constant: an increase of 10% in EBITDA projections would result in an increase in contingent consideration of £127,000 and a 
decrease of 1 % in the discount rate would result in an increase in contingent consideration of £74,000. An increase of 10% in revenue would 
result in an increase in contingent consideration of £317,000.
(g) The revenue included in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income since 12 October 2016 contributed by Clarke & Clarke was 
£7,276,000. Clarke & Clarke also contributed a profit before tax of £1,014,000 over the same period.
(h) Had Clarke & Clarke been consolidated from 1 February 2016, the Consolidated Statement of Income would include pro-forma revenue of 
£21,509,000 and profit before tax of £3,462,000. 
Net cash outflow arising on acquisition:
£000
Total cash consideration paid 29,736
Less: cash and cash equivalents acquired (2,663)
Net cash outflow 27,073

reporting period the Group has been reimbursed £1,500,000 as an interim payment which has been recognised and included within other 
receivables as at 31 January 2017, bringing the total cash received to date to £16,933,000 to cover the costs of stock and machinery loss and other 
incremental costs, along with business interruption losses. Further business interruption reimbursements are expected to cover future loss of profits 
up to a period of two years following the flood.  Walker Greenbank PLC

REPORT ON THE COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
OUR OPINION
In our opinion, Walker Greenbank PLC’s Company financial statements 
(the ‘financial statements’):
• give a true and fair view of the state of the Company’s affairs as at 
31 January 2017;
• have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom 
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and
• have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the 
Companies Act 2006.
WHAT WE HAVE AUDITED
The financial statements, included within the Annual Report and 
Accounts (the ‘Annual Report’), comprise:
• the Company Balance Sheet as at 31 January 2017;
• the Company Statement of Comprehensive Income for the year 
then ended;
• the Company Statement of Changes in Equity for the year then 
ended; and
• the notes to the financial statements, which include a summary of 
significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the 
preparation of the financial statements is United Kingdom Accounting 
Standards, comprising FRS 101 ‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’, and 
applicable law (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting 
Practice).
In applying the financial reporting framework, the Directors have 
made a number of subjective judgements, for example in respect 
of significant accounting estimates. In making such estimates, 
they have made assumptions and considered future events.
OPINIONS ON OTHER MATTERS PRESCRIBED BY THE 
COMPANIES ACT 2006
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:
• the information given in the Strategic Report and the Report of the 
Directors for the financial year for which the financial statements 
are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and
• the Strategic Report and the Report of the Directors have been 
prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.
In addition, in light of the knowledge and understanding of the 
Company and its environment obtained in the course of the audit, we 
are required to report if we have identified any material misstatements 
in the Strategic Report and the Report of the Directors. We have 
nothing to report in this respect.
INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT TO THE MEMBERS 
OF WALKER GREENBANK PLC
 
OTHER MATTERS ON WHICH WE ARE REQUIRED TO REPORT 
BY EXCEPTION
ADEQUACY OF ACCOUNTING RECORDS AND INFORMATION 
AND EXPLANATIONS RECEIVED
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in 
our opinion:
• we have not received all the information and explanations we 
require for our audit; or
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Company, 
or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from 
branches not visited by us; or
• the financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting 
records and returns.
We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.
DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in 
our opinion, certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by 
law are not made. We have no exceptions to report arising from this 
responsibility.
RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND 
THE AUDIT
OUR RESPONSIBILITIES AND THOSE OF THE DIRECTORS
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities 
set out on page 37, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of 
the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true 
and fair view.
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial 
statements in accordance with applicable law and International 
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) (‘ISAs (UK & Ireland)’). Those 
standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s 
Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for 
the Company’s members as a body in accordance with Chapter 3 of 
Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do 
not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any 
other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or 
into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior 
consent in writing. Walker Greenbank PLC

WHAT AN AUDIT OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INVOLVES
We conducted our audit in accordance with ISAs (UK & Ireland). An 
audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in 
the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that 
the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether 
caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: 
• whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Company’s 
circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately 
disclosed; 
• the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the 
Directors; and 
• the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
We primarily focus our work in these areas by assessing the Directors’ 
judgements against available evidence, forming our own judgements, 
and evaluating the disclosures in the financial statements.
We test and examine information, using sampling and other auditing 
techniques, to the extent we consider necessary to provide a 
reasonable basis for us to draw conclusions. We obtain audit evidence 
through testing the effectiveness of controls, substantive procedures or 
a combination of both. 
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information 
in the Annual Report to identify material inconsistencies with 
the audited financial statements and to identify any information 
that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially 
inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course 
of performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent 
material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the 
implications for our report. With respect to the Strategic Report 
and Report of the Directors, we consider whether those reports 
include the disclosures required by applicable legal requirements.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES
BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION
These financial statements present information relating to the entity Walker Greenbank PLC (‘the Company’), and are not consolidated. The 
consolidated financial statements of Walker Greenbank PLC and its subsidiaries (‘the Group’) of which the Company is the parent are separately 
presented within the Annual Report and Accounts and are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by 
the European Union (‘IFRSs’).
BASIS OF PREPARATION
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101, ‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’ 
(‘FRS 101’) and the Companies Act 2006. The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the 
valuation of derivative financial instruments at fair value through profit and loss, and with the accounting policies set out below which have been 
consistently applied to all periods presented unless otherwise indicated. 
The Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable 
future. Therefore the Company continues to adopt the going concern basis in preparing its financial statements.
No Income Statement is presented for the Company as it has applied the exemption provided by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006.

The preparation of financial statements requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise its 
judgement in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas 
where assumptions and estimates are significant to the financial statements, are disclosed in note 2. Walker Greenbank PLC
Annual Report and Accounts 2017

1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
Since the Company’s previous annual financial statements for the year ended 31 January 2016 the following pronouncements are now effective 
and have been adopted by the Company:
• Amendment to IAS 1 ‘Presentation of Financial Statements’, on disclosure initiative effective periods beginning on or after 1 January 2016
• Amendments to IAS 16 ‘Property, Plant and Equipment’ and IAS 38 ‘Intangible Assets’ – Amendments relating to Clarification of Acceptable 
Methods of Depreciation and Amortisation – effective periods beginning on or after 1 January 2016
There has been no material effect on the Company’s financial statements following the introduction of the above.
FOREIGN CURRENCIES
For the purpose of the financial statements, the results and financial position are expressed in sterling, which is the functional and presentation 
currency of the Company.
Transactions in foreign currencies, which are those other than the functional currency of the Company, are recorded at the rate ruling at the date 
of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency are translated at the rate ruling at the Balance Sheet date. All 
unhedged exchange differences are recognised in the Income Statement for the period within administration expenses.
Further disclosures of the Group’s financial risk management policies are included in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements of the Group, 
which are presented separately from these financial statements.
PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT
Property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment loss. Historical cost 
comprises the purchase price and costs directly incurred in bringing the asset into use. The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed 
annually and adjusted, if appropriate, at each Balance Sheet date.
Depreciation is charged on a straight-line basis on the original costs after deduction of any estimated residual value. The principal annual rates are:
Plant, equipment and vehicles   Between 5% and 33%
Computer hardware   33%
INVESTMENTS
Investments in subsidiary undertakings are recorded at cost plus incidental expenses less any provision for impairment. Impairment reviews are 
performed by the Directors when there has been an indication of potential impairment.
IMPAIRMENT OF NON-FINANCIAL ASSETS
Property, plant and equipment are tested for impairment if events or changes in circumstances (assessed at each reporting date) indicate that the 
carrying amount may not be recoverable. Where impairment triggers are identified, the recoverable amount of the relevant asset or group of 
assets within a cash-generating unit is determined, being the higher of value in use and net realisable value. If the carrying amount of the asset 
exceeds its recoverable amount an impairment loss is calculated. Any impairment is recognised in the Income Statement in the year in which it 
occurs. Non-financial assets that suffer impairment are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at each reporting date.
FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES – MEASUREMENT BASIS
In accordance with FRS 101, financial assets and liabilities are recognised on the date on which the Company becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions of the instrument giving rise to the asset or liability. Financial assets and liabilities are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction 
costs and are continually reviewed for impairment going forward. Any impairment of a financial asset is charged to the Income Statement when 
incurred. Financial assets are derecognised when the Company’s rights to cash inflows from the asset expire; financial liabilities are derecognised 
when the contractual obligations are discharged, cancelled or expire.
Non-derivative financial assets are classified as ‘loans and receivables’ according to the purpose for which the asset was acquired. This category 
includes:
• ‘trade and other receivables’ – these are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active 
market. They arise when the Company provides goods directly to a customer, or advances money, with no intention of trading the loan or 
receivable. Subsequent to initial recognition, loans and receivables are included in the Balance Sheet at amortised cost using the effective 
interest method less any amounts written off to reflect impairment, with changes in the carrying amount recognised in the Income Statement 
within distribution and selling or administration expenses; and 
• ‘cash at bank and in hand’ – this comprises deposits repayable on demand with banks and financial institutions, bank balances and cash in hand.
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
CONTINUED Walker Greenbank PLC
Annual Report and Accounts 2017

The Company’s non-derivative financial liabilities are classified as ‘other liabilities’. Other liabilities are financial liabilities with fixed or determinable 
payments that are not quoted in an active market. They arise when the Company receives goods or services directly from a payable or supplier, or 
borrows money, with no intention of trading the liability. This category includes:
• ‘creditors’ – these are typically non-interest bearing and following initial recognition are included in the Balance Sheet at amortised cost using 
the effective interest method;
• ‘bank loans and overdrafts’ – these are initially recorded at fair value based on proceeds received net of issue costs and subsequently held at 
amortised cost using the effective interest method; and
• ‘borrowings’ – these are recorded initially at the fair value, net of direct issue costs, and are subsequently stated at amortised cost. Finance 
charges, including premiums payable on settlement, or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for in the Income Statement, using 
the effective interest method, and are included within the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the 
period in which they arise. Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Company has an unconditional right to defer settlement of 
the liability for at least 12 months after the end of the reporting period.
Borrowing costs are capitalised as an increase to the carrying value of software or property, plant and equipment on major projects where their 
impact is material. 
DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGE ACCOUNTING – MEASUREMENT BASIS 
The Group’s activities expose it to the financial risks of changes in exchange rates, and the Company uses forward exchange rate contracts and 
swap exchange rate contracts to manage these exposures. The use of derivative financial instruments is governed by the Group’s policies approved 
by the Board of Directors, which provide written principles on the use of derivative financial instruments.
The Company documents at the inception of the transaction the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items. The Company also 
documents its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are 
highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items. The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives 
that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognised in equity. 
The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the Income Statement within administration expenses. Amounts 
accumulated in equity are released to the Income Statement when the hedged item affects the Income Statement, and are also classified in the 
Income Statement within administration expenses. 
Derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting under IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement’ are classified as 
‘financial assets or liabilities at fair value through profit or loss’. They are initially recognised at fair value, with fair value being remeasured at each 
reporting date. The fair value of the derivative is based on market price of comparable instruments at the Balance Sheet date. Changes in fair 
value are included in the Income Statement within finance costs. 
The Company has no embedded derivatives that are not closely related to the host instrument.
OFFSETTING FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the Balance Sheet when there is a legally enforceable right to offset the 
recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. The legally 
enforceable right must not be contingent on future events and must be enforceable in the normal course of business and in the event of default, 
insolvency or bankruptcy of the company or the counterparty.
LEASES
Leases are classified as finance leases where the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the Company. All 
other leases are classified as operating leases.
Operating lease rentals are charged to the Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease. Rent-free periods receivable on 
entering an operating lease are released on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. 
EMPLOYEE BENEFITS – RETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS
The Walker Greenbank Group operates both defined benefit and defined contribution pension schemes for the benefit of its employees. Further 
details of these schemes are included in note 24 of the consolidated financial statements of the Group. 
Defined benefit pension schemes are accounted for within the separate financial statements of the Company’s trading subsidiary, Abaris Holdings 
Limited. The Company recognises contributions to defined contribution schemes in respect of its employees as expenses when incurred. Walker Greenbank PLC

1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
EMPLOYEE SHARE OWNERSHIP PLAN (‘ESOP’)
Where the Company’s issued share capital is acquired by an ESOP trust sponsored by the Company, the cost of acquisition is deducted from 
retained earnings.
EMPLOYEE BENEFITS – SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS UNDER LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLANS (‘LTIP’)
The Company issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees which must be measured at fair value and recognised as an 
expense in the Income Statement with a corresponding increase in equity. 
The fair values of these payments are measured at the date of grant, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the awards are 
granted. The fair value is recognised over the period during which employees become conditionally entitled to the awards, subject to the 
Company’s estimate of the number of awards which will lapse, either due to employees leaving the Company prior to vesting or due to non-market 
based performance conditions not being met. 
The total amount recognised in the Income Statement as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of awards that vest. National insurance 
contributions related to the awards are recognised as an expense in the Income Statement with a corresponding liability on the Balance Sheet.
The financial effect of awards by the Company of options over its equity shares to employees of subsidiary undertakings are recognised by the 
Company as an increase in its investment in subsidiaries with a credit to equity equivalent to the IFRS 2 cost in subsidiary undertakings.
EMPLOYEE BENEFITS – SHORT-TERM BONUS PLANS
The Company recognises a liability and an expense for bonuses where contractually obliged or where there is a past practice that has created  
a constructive obligation. 
SHARE CAPITAL
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Costs directly attributable to the issue of new ordinary shares are shown in equity as a deduction, net  
of tax, from the proceeds. Dividend distribution is set by the Board on a regular basis so long as sufficient funds are available.
SHARE PREMIUM
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new ordinary shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the 
proceeds.
TREASURY SHARES
Consideration paid including any directly attributable incremental costs (net of income taxes) on the purchase of the Company’s equity share 
capital (treasury shares), is deducted from equity attributable to the Company’s equity holders until the shares are cancelled or reissued. Where 
such shares are subsequently reissued, any consideration received, net of any directly attributable incremental transaction costs and the related 
income tax effects, is included in equity attributable to the Company’s equity shareholders. The EBT is treated as an agent of the Company and  
as such, EBT transactions are treated as being those of the Company.
TAXATION INCLUDING DEFERRED TAX
The tax expense represents the sum of the current tax and deferred tax charges or credits. 
Current tax is based on the taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from the net profit as reported in the Income Statement because  
it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or 
deductible. The Company’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the Balance 
Sheet date. Current tax includes withholding taxes from sales and licensing income in overseas territories. 
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial 
statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability 
method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and such assets and liabilities are not recognised if 
the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in 
a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit. Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences 
arising on investments in subsidiaries except where the Company is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that 
the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
CONTINUED Walker Greenbank PLC
Annual Report and Accounts 2017
99
IAS 12 ‘Income taxes’ requires that the measurement of deferred tax should have regard to the tax consequences that would follow from the 
manner of expected recovery or settlement at the Balance Sheet date of the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities. In calculating its deferred 
tax liability, the Company’s policy is to regard the depreciable amount of the carrying value of its property, plant and equipment to be recovered 
through continuing use in the business, unless included within assets held for resale, where the policy is to regard the carrying amount as being 
recoverable through sale.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which temporary differences 
can be utilised. The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each Balance Sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer 
probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised. Deferred tax 
is charged or credited in the Income Statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred 
tax is also dealt with in equity. Deferred tax relating to retirement benefit obligations is also recognised in equity where the tax relief arises from 
contributions paid to fund deficits arising in previous periods that were recognised in equity. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities and 
when the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the same taxable entity or 
different taxable entities and there is an intention to settle the balances on a net basis.
DIVIDEND INCOME
Dividend income is recognised when the right to receive payment is established.
DIVIDEND DISTRIBUTIONS
Dividend distributions to the Company’s shareholders are recognised as a liability in the Company’s financial statements in the period in which the 
dividends are approved by the Company’s shareholders.
2. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS
The Company makes estimates and assumptions concerning future events. The resulting accounting estimates will seldom precisely equal the 
related actual results. The Company applies its best endeavours in setting accounting estimates, and uses historical experience and other factors, 
including input from experienced and specialist management. Estimates and assumptions are periodically re-evaluated and the resulting 
accounting balances updated as new information, including actual outcomes, become apparent. 
The estimates and judgements that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within 
the next financial year are discussed below. 
A) IMPAIRMENT OF NON-FINANCIAL ASSETS
Property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment whenever impairment triggers are apparent. The recoverable amounts of cash-
generating units are determined based on value in use (‘VIU’) calculations. These calculations require use of estimates of future sales, margins, 
and other operating and administration expenses, and of discount rates. The carrying values of the non-financial assets are not considered to be 
sensitive due to the nature of the assets.
B) DEFERRED TAX RECOGNITION
The Company considers it appropriate to recognise at the Balance Sheet date deferred tax assets resulting from historical trading losses and other 
temporary differences including pension deficits and the impact of awards under the long-term incentive plan. The amount of deferred tax 
recognised is based on estimates of the timing and amount of future taxable profits of the Company, which in turn relies upon estimates of future 
operating profits and the occurrence, timing and tax treatment of significant items of income and expenditure including contributions to pension 
schemes and the vesting of LTIP payment awards. Further disclosures relating to the amount of deferred tax asset recognised and other relevant 
disclosures are included in note 8. The Company considers the sensitivity on deferred tax recognition to be based on profits generated by the 
Company and tax rates substantively enacted. There has been no material impact on sensitivity in the current or previous financial year.
C) LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN PAYMENT AWARDS
The Company has granted awards to Executive Directors and senior management which include vesting conditions relating to the future financial 
performance of the Group as measured by adjusted profit before tax (‘PBT’) and the relative performance of the Group’s Total Shareholder Return 
(‘TSR’) against comparator companies. The fair value of the awards granted is charged against the Income Statement over the vesting period; the 
amount of that charge including the national insurance component of the charge, is dependent upon the Company’s estimates of how many 
awards will ultimately vest, which is linked directly to its estimates regarding future PBT and TSR achievement.  Walker Greenbank PLC
Annual Report and Accounts 2017
100
2. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS CONTINUED
The financial effect of awards by the Company of options over its equity shares to employees of subsidiary undertakings are recognised by the Company 
as an increase in its investment in subsidiaries with a credit to equity equivalent to the IFRS 2 cost in subsidiary undertakings.
D) CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION ON BUSINESS COMBINATIONS
For business combinations, the Company estimates the fair value of the consideration transferred, which includes assumptions about the future 
performance of the business acquired and an appropriate discount rate to determine the fair value of any contingent consideration. There is some 
sensitivity in determining this accounting estimate as there is a range of outcomes. If the EBITDA of the acquired business increases by 10%, then the 
contingent consideration would be £127 ,000 higher and if it decreased by 10%, it would be £127 ,000 lower. Judgement is also applied in determining 
whether any future payments should be classified as contingent consideration or as remuneration for future services. 
The fair value of the contingent consideration recognised in business combinations is reassessed at each reporting date, using updated inputs and 
assumptions based on the latest financial forecasts for the relevant business. Judgement is applied as to whether changes should be applied at the acquisition 
date or as post-acquisition changes. Fair value movements and the unwinding of the discounting is recognised within finance costs in the Income Statement.

On 11 May 2016, the Company and its wholly owned subsidiary, Abaris Holdings Limited (‘Abaris’), entered into a Deed of Assignment assigning to 
Abaris absolutely and with full title guarantee the inter-company balance of US$5 million payable to the Company by its US subsidiary (the 
‘Receivable’). The Receivable was always intended to be equity to help fund the US business with no expectation of payment. In consideration, 
Abaris made an allotment against the fair value of the Receivable and issued to the Company 2,400,000 ordinary shares of £1 each at a premium 
of £0.43 per share. Consequently, the Company de-recognised the Receivable and recorded an investment of £3,432,000 (US$5 million). Since the 
assignment of the Receivable was an inter-Group transaction, there has been no effect on the consolidated financial statements of the Walker 
Greenbank Group for the year ended 31 January 2017.
On 12 October 2016, the Company conditionally acquired 100% of the issued share capital of Globaltex 2015 Limited, a company registered in the 
UK, for an initial cash consideration of £25,000,000 and a contingent consideration of up to £17,500,000, in aggregate, payable in the Company’s 
shares linked to the performance of the acquired business over a four-year period, giving a total potential consideration of up to £42,500,000 
excluding working capital adjustments. The completion date for the transaction was 31 October 2016. Full details of the acquisition are included in 
note 33 of the consolidated financial statements of the Group which are separately presented within the Annual Report and Accounts.
During the year, the Company disposed of seven (2016: none) wholly owned subsidiaries which did not trade in any of the periods presented. The 
cost and net book amount of these subsidiaries held by the Company had already been written off in prior years and therefore their disposal had 
no impact on the Company’s equity or profit for the current and previous year.

The deferred tax asset on LTIP payments is expected to unwind after more than one year.
At 31 January 2017, the Company has gross unused UK tax losses of £3,225,000 (2016: £3,225,000) available for offset against future profits. 
Potential deferred tax assets at 31 January 2017 of £613,000 (2016: £674,000) relating to UK tax losses and deductible temporary differences 
have not been recognised as it is not considered probable that recovery of the potential deferred tax asset will arise under existing tax legislation.

There are also unutilised capital tax losses at 31 January 2017 of £4,881,000 (2016: £4,881,000) but no deferred tax asset has been recognised  
as it is not considered probable that these losses will be utilised. 
The deferred tax balance at 31 January 2017 included within these financial statements has been calculated at a rate of 17%, as this is the rate  
at which the majority of the balances are expected to unwind.
A change to the UK corporation tax rate was announced in the Chancellor’s Budget on 16 March 2016 and became substantively enacted in the 
Finance Bill 2016 on 6 September 2016 to reduce the main rate to 19% from 1 April 2017 and to 17% from 1 April 2020. Walker Greenbank PLC

2016 
£000
Forward foreign exchange contracts – cash flow hedges – (liability) – (26)
FORWARD FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTRACTS
The Group’s US-based subsidiary, Walker Greenbank Inc., sells products to local customers with sales invoiced in US dollars. As the Group’s 
presentation currency is sterling, it is exposed to changes in the reported sterling value of these sales. The Group considers that it is highly probable 
that future sales of this nature will continue to arise over at least the next 12 months. 
The Company enters into monthly forward foreign exchange contracts with a third party to buy sterling and sell US dollars. The Group designates 
these contracts as cash flow hedges of the foreign currency risk arising from the highly probable future forecast sales transactions. As at the 
reporting date, there were no US dollar forward exchange contracts and, therefore, the fair value of the forward foreign currency contracts relating 
to the benefit on these anticipated future transactions was £nil (2016: liability of £26,000). 
The amounts deferred in equity are released into the Income Statement in the period or periods during which the hedged forecast transactions 
impact the Income Statement, which is normally within one month of the Balance Sheet date.
The Brands make more purchases from the eurozone than sales made to the eurozone. As the Group’s presentation currency is sterling it is exposed 
to changes in the reported sterling value of the purchases. The Group considers that the level of this exposure will reduce over the next 12 months. 
As at the reporting date there were no euro forward foreign currency contracts. 
SWAP FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTRACTS
The Group uses swap contracts to manage its working capital exchange risk from both the foreign subsidiaries and the balances on receivables, 
payables and cash held in foreign currency. These swap contracts are designated as fair value through the Income Statement.
The use of swaps are reviewed monthly and renewed when necessary.
As at the reporting date, there were no US dollar swap contracts (2016: fair value liability of £nil) and no euro swap contracts (2016: fair value asset 
of £nil).

In December 2015, the Group entered into a new £12,500,000 multi-currency revolving credit facility with Barclays Bank PLC for a five-year period and 
cancelled the existing receivables facilities. The agreement also includes a £10,000,000 accordion facility option to further increase available credit 
which provides substantial headroom for future growth. An initial bank arrangement fee of £100,000 and an additional £40,000 incurred during the 
year is amortised over the life of the loan. The total facilities from Barclays Bank PLC comprises: a variable rate term loan secured on the Group’s 
freehold property which is being repaid on a five-year profile and a revolving credit facility which may be drawn down in either sterling or euro. 
The total Barclays Bank PLC facilities are capped at £22,700,000 (2016: £23,100,000); the utilisation of the facilities at the year end was 
£6,825,000 (2016: £596,000). The term loan bears interest at variable rates based on a margin above the Bank of England base rate. The revolving 
credit facility bears interest at a variable rate based on a margin above LIBOR (for sterling loans) or the EURIBOR (for euro loans).
Under the Barclays Bank PLC facilities, the Group is subject to a financial covenant which applies to the term loan, being interest cover. The 
revolving credit facility is also subject to compliance of two financial covenants, being interest cover and leverage. Any non-compliance with 
covenants could, if not remedied or waived, constitute an event of default with respect to any such arrangements. The Group has reported to 
Barclays Bank PLC that it was in full compliance with its covenants throughout each of the periods presented and expects to be for the remaining 
term of the agreement. 
For the Company’s cash at bank, and the receivable component of derivative financial instruments, the counterparty to the financial instruments  
is a major UK bank, and the Company does not consider there to be any significant credit risk from holding these financial assets.
The fair value of current borrowings approximates their carrying amount, as the impact of discounting is not significant. The carrying amounts  
and fair value of the non-current borrowings are as follows:

The fair values are based on cash flows discounted using a weighted average rate based on the borrowing rate of 1.75% (2016: 1.75%). 
The table below analyses the Company’s financial liabilities into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period to contractual 
maturity at the Balance Sheet date. The amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual undiscounted cash flows. The maturity profile of
