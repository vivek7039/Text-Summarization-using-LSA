Strategic report
Chairman’s statement
2017 was another year of strong progress for 
CYBG, with good momentum in the execution of 
the three pillars of our strategic plan – sustainable 
customer growth, efficiency and capital optimisation 
– and with it the successful delivery of our financial 
targets for 2017. The hard work of the Board, the 
Executive Leadership Team and all of our colleagues 
means I am pleased to be able to reiterate our 
medium-term guidance with renewed confidence. 
The Group’s successful delivery this year means 
that I am pleased to announce that the Board is 
recommending the payment of our inaugural dividend 
of 1.0 pence per share. Since the Initial Public 
Offering (IPO) we have talked about being a dividend 
paying stock and this proposed dividend represents 
a landmark event in the process of transforming 
CYBG into a bank that generates and distributes a 
sustainable return on its equity to shareholders. The 
continued delivery of our strategy should help us to 
build on this firm foundation as we move forward.
As well as their commitment to our customers, I am 
very proud of the way my colleagues support the 
communities in which we operate. Almost 7,000 
volunteering hours were undertaken during 2017 
and, with matching through our charity foundation, 
we have raised over £5.8m for our charity partner 
Hospice UK among a number of other initiatives. 
Economic conditions in the UK remain muted 
but, for the moment at least, stable. Despite the 
uncertainty surrounding Brexit negotiations and 
increased inflation causing real wage deflation, 
we have not seen a deterioration in the quality of 
our assets and we remain focused on delivering 
sustainable growth within our prudent risk appetite.
I would like to thank all of our colleagues, the 
Executive Leadership Team and the Board for 
their continued dedication and commitment to 
the transformation of CYBG. I would also like to 
personally thank Richard Gregory who left the Board 
in January for his contribution over many years. 
Our performance in 2017 represents a significant 
achievement. It is only the first step in delivering our 
three-year plan. We therefore remain focused on 
executing the strategy we outlined at our Capital 
Markets Day in September 2016, in order to deliver 
an exceptional customer experience for our 
personal and SME customers and sustainable 
returns to our shareholders.
 
Jim Pettigrew
Chairman
20 November 2017
 I am pleased to report on another 
year of strong progress for CYBG as 
we continue to execute our strategy

Strategic report
Our strategy
This means continuing to focus on transforming 
our culture and being recognised as a leading 
consumer brand and a great place to work.
Our strategy is simple, is working and remains 
unchanged – our strategic priorities of sustainable 
customer growth, efficiency and capital optimisation 
are being delivered through a strong customer-
focused culture, a robust change management 
and investment approach and parallel development 
of our omni-channel capabilities, and all of these 
within a framework of prudent risk management 
and governance. Our primary focus is on building 
a better organisation for our customers and staff 
and our organic plan is predicated on continuing 
to improve the areas of our performance that we 
can control, such as costs, efficiency and customer 
experience improvements.
We will continue to evaluate potential inorganic 
opportunities to enhance our business provided they 
are in line with our strategic objectives and create 
value for our shareholders. We have established a 
set of capabilities that gives us significant confidence 
in our ability to execute, should such inorganic 
opportunities arise.
Our strategic priorities
Drive 
sustainable  
customer 
growth
 – A ‘deposit first’ philosophy – secure primary account relationship
 – Acquire customers in key target segments (younger, more affluent) 
 – Leverage our third party mortgage broker relationships
 – Agile approach to product development
 – Enhance our SME offering to meet the needs of an under-served marketplace
 – Simplify operational processes 
 – Focus on end-to-end product profitability
 – Further integration of product and service across channels 
Improve 
efficiency
 – Improve our cost structure by delivering:
 - Network efficiency through our customer banking transformation
 - Operational efficiency through improved customer service
 - A streamlined lower cost management model
 - More for less through improved central cost management
 – Clear internal accountability for delivery
 – Providing capacity to reinvest in our digital and growth agenda 
Capital 
optimisation
 – Secure IRB accreditation for:
 - Mortgage book during 2018
 - Remainder of bank in 2019
 – Improve capital deployment decisioning and reduce exposure  
to lower yielding mortgages and SME lending
 We are committed to delivering a 
strong, customer-centric banking 
proposition in the UK.  
Underpinned by omni-channel delivery CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 7
Strategic report Governance Financial results Risk report Financial statements Additional information
 Whether it is prototyping new 
technologies, opening our first 
consumer innovation lab, Studio B, 
or collaborating with Fintech partners 
with the development of our new 
small business e-lending solution, 
we are building a bank focused on 
a differentiated customer experience 
that will put customers more in 
control of their money. 
I am delighted to report that we have maintained 
momentum in delivering our strategic priorities and 
commitments and, as a result, we are delivering 
significantly improved financial performance, have 
recorded our first statutory profit in over five years 
and are recommending an inaugural dividend to 
shareholders. 
As the only truly full-service challenger bank of 
scale across both Retail and SME in the UK market, 
we have delivered ahead of market growth in both 
mortgages and SME lending and we remain on track 
to deliver our commitment to provide up to £6bn 
of lending to SMEs by the end of 2019. 
Our results show improved underlying profit, 
sustainable loan growth, a stable margin and 
improved returns – all achieved in a highly 
competitive market and a continuing low growth, 
low interest rate environment. Our cost efficiency 
programme is also ahead of plan, with underlying 
operating costs coming in at £675m, down 7% year 
on year. We have also continued to work through 
our legacy conduct issues and our statutory profit 
includes the impact of a conduct charge of £58m 
primarily due to historical payment protection 
insurance (PPI) mis-selling.
CYBG is perfectly placed to disrupt the market – 
we have the size and full-service Retail and SME 
capabilities that no other UK challenger bank can 
offer, yet we are smaller and more agile than the 
complex structures of the ‘big five’ UK banks.  
We are well capitalised, have a high-quality loan 
book and prudent risk appetite, along with powerful, 
established local brands. These have now been 
joined by an innovative brand in B, which has 
broadened our customer demographic and reach 
outside of our core regions. We have over 100,000 
B customers since launch in 2016 and we were 
proud to receive the FStech Award 2017 for Digital 
Launch of the Year. 
The pace and scale of transformation across our 
business has been considerable in 2017. We have kept 
up our relentless focus on enhancing our customers’ 
Strategic report
Chief Executive Officer’s review
experience through operational improvements and 
have maintained excellent progress on the delivery 
of our plan to provide a truly omni-channel model 
for customers. As part of our digital journey, over 
the past year we have introduced straight-through 
online account opening, Apple and Android Pay, as 
well as piloting an innovative new online SME lending 
facility through one of our Fintech partnerships. 
In addition, our migration of our Clydesdale and 
Yorkshire Bank accounts to our digital platform, iB, is 
well advanced and we expect all personal customers 
to begin migrating to iB on the web by the end of 
2017 with SME customers to begin migration onto 
iB, both mobile and web, in 2018. 
Like other banks and high street retailers we are 
seeing a shift in the way customers choose to do 
business with us and more often customers are 
using telephone, internet and mobile channels to 
do day-to-day banking. As a result, the number of 
transactions which take place in branches is falling, 
with customers increasingly using a branch only 
when they want to speak with us about a significant 
life event. We are constantly reviewing our branch 
footprint and while a number of branches were 
closed this year, we opened new flagship branches 
in Edinburgh and Birmingham as part of a broader 
multiyear strategy to expand our presence in key 
northern cities. 
In April, we opened our innovation lab, Studio B, 
in London. Unlike anything else on the high street, 
Studio B enables us to collaborate directly with 
customers and other interested parties on the 
design of future banking products and services, then 
showcase and test our best ideas with colleagues, 
customers and members of the public – all within 
a fully functioning customer banking centre. While 
in September we expanded our UK presence into 
Birmingham with the opening of a next generation 
B store which, as well as being a fully operational 
branch, is also a showcase for customers to 
experience our digital innovations. 
Over the next 12 months I am confident we have 
both the opportunity and the ability to create a 
differentiated customer experience that positions us 
as a progressive, forward-looking organisation able to 
thrive today, tomorrow and in the future, delivering 
on commitments to our customers, our people and 
our shareholders. Finally, I am very grateful to the 
Chairman, the Board and our colleagues for their 
backing and insight as we continue on our journey.

OUR FIRST AGM  
AS A LISTED BUSINESS
Our Board and members of our Executive Leadership 
Team travelled to Australia in January for our first AGM 
as a listed business. We fully recognise that a significant 
proportion of our shareholders are not based in the UK 
and we believe it’s important that we are able to speak 
to people face to face about CYBG and our strategy for 
growing the business.
The decision to host the AGM in Melbourne was warmly received and well 
attended – we welcomed more than 250 people to the event and an even 
wider audience joined via a live webcast.
The overall tone of the event was positive, reflecting on the solid progress 
we have made in our landmark first year.

commitment to our medium-term 
financial guidance.  
In September 2016, CYBG announced a number of 
medium-term financial targets which represented an 
acceleration of the strategic plan articulated at the 
time of the Group’s demerger and IPO. Following 
our strong performance in FY2017, the Board has 
reiterated its commitment to the Group’s strategy 
and the medium-term targets.

 The UK economy has remained 
resilient over the past year, despite 
the uncertain political environment, 
although recent economic data 
releases suggest that the UK consumer 
is starting to feel spending pressures 
heading into 2018.  
UK GDP has continued to grow but the rate of 
growth has started to slow. The preliminary estimate 
of GDP growth of 0.4% in the July to September 
quarter was up slightly from second quarter growth 
of 0.3%, but year-on-year growth reduced to 1.5%, 
down from 1.7% the previous quarter. In response to 
this slowing growth, the Bank of England (BoE) has 
reduced its economic growth forecasts for both 
2017 and 2018, to 1.7% and 1.6% respectively.
Other key UK macroeconomic indicators continued 
to improve in 2017, with unemployment falling 
to 4.3%, which is the joint lowest level since 1975, 
and the employment rate remaining high at 75.0%.
Inflation, as measured by the Consumer Price Index 
(CPI), has picked up considerably during 2017 and 
rose to 3.0% in the year to September. This remains 
relatively high in comparison to recent years and is 
above the BoE’s target of 2.0%. As inflation outpaced 
wage growth, real earnings fell by 0.4% in the 
3 months to September from the same period 
in 2016, meaning households will start to feel 
a squeeze on disposable incomes.
In response to this, the BoE increased the base rate 
by 25 basis points to 0.50% at the Monetary Policy 
Committee meeting on 2 November 2017 and 
guided that any future increases would be expected 
to be at a gradual pace and to a limited extent. 
Further base rate increases are expected to be 
positive for the earnings of UK banks, particularly 
those banks with a high proportion of current 
account funding, including CYBG.
The rate of UK mortgage growth slowed in 2017 
with balances up 2.9% in the year to September 
versus a 3.1% increase in 2016. This was 
predominantly due to lower buy-to-let (BTL) 
mortgage lending, following stamp duty and tax 
changes and lower owner occupied growth, which 
has been attributed to uncertainty caused by Brexit. 
Mortgage approvals were up 2.4% in comparison 
to the previous year and housing transactions were 
down 3.7%. The outlook for the mortgage market 
remains muted but broadly solid with pressures 
from any potential base rate rises, UK economic 
uncertainty and a squeeze on disposable income, 
partially offset by continued government support.
Strategic report
Environment and market outlook 
Growth in UK average house prices overall 
continued in 2017, up 5% in the year to September. 
This continues the strong growth seen since the end 
of 2013 as a result of resilient economic conditions, 
together with sustained low mortgage rates and 
government support. However, there is evidence 
of an emerging divergence now appearing between 
London and the rest of the country, with London 
prices growing at a slower rate than the rest of 
the UK.
The outlook for SMEs remains more cautious, 
particularly with regards to Brexit, although the 
CYBG SME Health Check Index showed that the 
operating environment for Britain’s small and 
medium sized businesses improved in the second 
quarter of 2017 with a number of improvements 
including increased lending to SMEs and a falling 
number of business bankruptcies. The index rose 
from 46.9 to 58.9 in Q2 2017, which is the highest 
reading since 2015, although confidence dipped in 
the quarter. Confidence will be a key driver of the 
SME market over the coming period as investment 
decisions are deferred.
Pricing in the customer deposit market is now 
beginning to intensify. In addition to some larger 
banks aiming to fund their mortgage growth 
ambitions there is also competition from some of 
the smaller institutions who have funded recent 
growth from the TFS and this will need to be 
replaced with customer funding over time.
Overall, the economic environment for CYBG 
remains broadly supportive of our growth ambitions 
but uncertainty over future conditions remains. Financial results

Regulatory and political environment
The Group continues to operate in a demanding 
regulatory and political climate. Following the result 
of the EU referendum in 2016, in March this year 
the Government formally triggered Article 50, giving 
notice of the UK’s intention to leave the EU. While 
formal negotiations are underway between the EU 
and UK regarding the terms of the UK’s exit from the 
EU, the terms of ‘Brexit’ are still unknown. In June’s 
general election the Government lost its majority in 
Parliament, which has added to this uncertainty. 
The regulatory environment in which the Group 
operates continues to develop and the Group is 
responding to the following key changes: 
 – General Data Protection Regulation comes into 
effect on 25 May 2018. Key changes include a 
requirement to notify regulators of breaches 
within 72 hours, responding to subject access 
requests within 30 days and the imposition of 
financial sanctions of up to 4% of annual global 
turnover for serious breaches. The Group has 
a programme of activity underway to meet the 
requirements;
 – Payment Services Directive 2 (PSD2) comes 
into force on 13 January 2018. The Group is 
progressing the necessary developments which 
include changes to information and transparency 
requirements on payments, new security 
requirements including ‘strong customer 
authentication’ (the date for this is still unknown)
and faster handling of payment-related 
complaints. In the innovation and competition 
space two new types of service are brought 
within the regulation – third-party payment 
instructions from accounts and account 
aggregation. The Group is continuing to develop 
its long-term strategy in this respect;
 – the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has 
implemented a time bar on PPI complaints 
of August 2019 with a two year consumer 
communications campaign already launched;
 – over 2018, the Group will be taking steps to 
ensure compliance with ring-fencing legislation 
that takes effect from 1 January 2019. The Group 
will achieve compliance with the legislation with 
no material changes to its business operations or 
corporate structure and so there will be very little 
impact on the Group’s customers; 
 – the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) 
retail banking investigation identified a number 
of adverse effects on competition in the personal 
and business current account and SME banking 
markets. Consequently the CMA introduced a 
package of remedies designed to address these, 
some of which are now in force. The remainder 
will come into effect by summer 2018 with the 
Group on track to meet these remedies;
 – the FCA and PRA have published a number of 
papers which relate to consumer credit. While 
the PRA is focusing on firms’ asset quality and 
underwriting practices the FCA is focusing on 
consumer protection, with specific interest in 
assessing creditworthiness including affordability 
and the high cost credit market which includes 
overdrafts. The FCA has also set out a package of 
remedies designed to make the credit card market 
work better and the Group has a project in place 
to meet a number of the requirements by January 
2018 and the remainder by June 2018; 
 – the European Commission published a package 
to amend CRD IV in November 2016. The 
amendments cover a variety of areas including 
Pillar 2; counterparty credit risk; trading book/
market risk; large exposures; IRRBB; the 
SME supporting factor; and, support for 
infrastructure lending; 
 – the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision 
(BCBS) revisions to the standardised approach to 
credit risk (CRSA), operational risk, and IRB floors 
are yet to be finalised. Uncertainty remains around 
the final shape of these rules. The strategic intent 
to pursue IRB accreditation will minimise some 
of the impacts to the Group of the revised CRSA, 
although those rules will also affect the IRB floors;
 – the recovery and resolution regime for UK banks 
is still being finalised. The BoE has established a 
framework on setting the minimum amount of 
loss absorbing resources (MREL) banks should 
hold so they can be resolved when failing. The 
Group has been advised of its interim MREL and 
has submitted a plan to the BoE on how its market 
issuance will be phased to reach this. The PRA has 
also finalised its rules on ensuring banks’ critical 
shared services are able to continue operating 
while in resolution. The Group is well placed to 
comply with these requirements; and
 – the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II 
(MiFID II) and Packaged Retail and Insurance-
Based Investment Products (PRIIPs) Regulation 
come into effect in January 2018. MiFID II 
imposes significant changes in a number of areas 
including transparency, market structure and 
transaction reporting. The PRIIPs Regulation 
requires firms producing or selling packaged retail 
investment products and insurance-based 
investment products to produce key information 
documents to make it easier for retail investors to 
compare products. The Group has a programme 
in place to implement these requirements.

Strategic report
Risk overview
 Effective management of risk is a 
key capability for a successful financial 
services provider and is fundamental 
to the Group’s strategy. The Group has 
continued to advance and strengthen 
its risk management capabilities, 
evolving in line with industry 
developments and best practice. 
The Group’s approach to risk
Risk exists in every aspect of the Group’s business, is 
an integral part of the operating environment, and is a 
core consideration inherent within the Strategic Plan.
The Group’s approach to risk management is based 
on the principle that risk management capability 
must be embedded across all areas of the Group 
to be effective. 
The Group has a clearly defined strategy in place to 
monitor, manage and mitigate risk and that strategy 
is defined with the Group’s Risk Management 
Framework (RMF).
The risk strategy includes: ensuring all principal and 
emerging risks are identified and assessed; that risk 
appetite is clearly articulated and influences the 
Group’s strategic plan; the maintenance of a clearly 
defined risk culture which emphasises risk 
management while maintaining independent 
oversight; the need for ongoing analysis of the 
environment in which the Group operates to 
proactively address potential risk issues as they arise; 
and a requirement to ensure that appropriate risk 
processes, systems and controls exist to support all 
colleagues in their decision making.
Integral to the RMF is the Group’s process for setting 
its Risk Appetite. The Risk Appetite Statement (RAS) 
defines the level and types of risk the Group is willing 
to assume within the boundaries of its risk capacity, 
to achieve its strategic objectives. Ultimately, the RAS 
provides the definitive view on the broad direction of 
risk taking activity the Board is comfortable that the 
Group undertakes and allows decision makers to 
exercise judgement with greater confidence and speed.
Risk culture 
The consistent fair treatment of customers is 
fundamental to the success of the Group’s business 
model and strategy and is underpinned by a risk 
culture which shapes behaviours and decision making 
at all levels of the Group. The interests of customers, 
colleagues, shareholders and the communities within 
which the Group operates are all aligned to deliver 
the Group’s strategic aim of sustainable customer 
growth. This is supported by the RMF, underpinned 
by a robust risk framework and independent risk 
management function driven by the Group’s expected 
behavioural standards and values. 
A strong risk culture is founded on a risk management 
accountability model and formal delegation 
framework where personal accountability empowers 
colleagues to take ownership. It is a consideration 
in all people management practices, particularly 
performance management. It is supported by a formal 
whistleblowing framework that allows colleagues, in 
confidence and anonymously, to raise concerns about 
matters of conduct, including inappropriate behaviour 
and breaches of the Group’s Code of Conduct.
Risk Management Framework (RMF)
The Group identifies and manages risk using the 
RMF (see diagram below), which is the totality of 
systems, structures, policies, processes and people 
that identify, measure, evaluate, control, mitigate, 
monitor and report all internal and external sources 
of material risk. The Group’s Policy Framework is 
a key component of the RMF providing structure 
and governance for the consistent, effective 
management of Policies. This aligns with the 
behavioural expectations for all colleagues which 
form a core part of our performance management 
approach. Policy statements and supporting policy 
standards define the minimum control requirements 
which must be observed across the Group to 
manage material sources of risk within risk appetite.
The Group manages risk using a “Three Lines 
of Defence” model. The Three Lines of Defence 
are the operational Business Units, the Risk 
Management function and Internal Audit. Control 
is exercised through a clearly defined delegation 
of authority, with communication and escalation 
channels throughout the Group.

Principal risks are overseen by the dedicated 
second line risk management function
Credit risk is the risk of loss of principal or interest stemming from 
a borrower’s failure to meet contracted obligations to the Group 
in accordance with the terms agreed. Credit risk is evident at both 
a portfolio and transactional level.
How this risk is managed
 – Significant credit risk strategies, credit risk appetite and 
tolerances for credit risk are approved and reviewed by 
the Board and Boards’ Risk Committee.
 – The credit portfolio is closely monitored with actions initiated 
where required.
Balance sheet and prudential regulation risk covers a number 
of categories of risk, which affect the manner in which the Group 
can support its customers in a safe and sound manner. The risks 
include the need to withstand times of stress for the loss of 
funding (liquidity), the impact of restricted access to future sources 
of deposits (funding), the impact of providing a defined benefit 
scheme to colleagues (pension) and the need to withstand severe 
unexpected losses (capital). 
How this risk is managed
 – Liquidity is managed in accordance with standards that are 
approved by the Board and supported by annual Funding and 
Contingency Funding Plans. The Group also completes a formal 
annual assessment of liquidity adequacy which is shared with 
the PRA.
 – The Group completes a formal annual assessment of its capital 
requirements which is shared with the PRA. 
 – The Group’s Pension Risk Management Committee has 
implemented a range of reforms to benefits to reduce the 
Group’s exposure to Pension Risk.
Regulatory and compliance risk is the risk of failing to identify, 
understand, monitor and comply with relevant laws, regulations, 
licence conditions, supervisory requirements, self-regulatory 
industry codes of conduct and voluntary initiatives. In doing so, 
the Group risks damaging its relationship with its regulator. It is also 
the failure of not keeping regulators informed of relevant issues 
and not responding effectively to information requests and 
regulatory reviews. 
How this risk is managed
Continued and significant Board and senior management focus 
is directed towards maintaining regulatory compliance. The Board 
or Executive Risk Committee approves all material changes to 
regulatory policy and protocols. 
Conduct risk is the risk of undertaking business in a way which is 
contrary to the interests of our customers, resulting in the delivery 
of inappropriate customer outcomes, customer detriment, 
regulatory censure, redress costs and/or reputational damage.
How this risk is managed
 – The Group has a Conduct Framework, with supporting target 
outcomes and operating principles. Governance oversight and 
reporting are in place to ensure those objectives are met.
Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate 
or failed internal processes and systems or from external events. 
It includes legal risk, and operational risks associated with the 
execution of the strategy. 
How this risk is managed
 – The Group has an established Operational Risk Framework to 
enable identification, management and mitigation of operational 
risks. Risk categories are used to categorise and facilitate the 
consistent identification, assessment, mitigation, monitoring and 
reporting of risks and events.
Financial crime risk is the risk that the Group’s products and 
services will be used to facilitate financial crime against the Group, 
its customers or third parties. 
How this risk is managed
 – The Group has an established Financial Crime Framework 
supporting ongoing management, monitoring and mitigation 
of financial crime risk. The Group operates zero tolerance for 
financial crime risk and has a control framework in place to 
mitigate this risk.
Strategic, business and financial performance risk is the 
risk of significant loss, loss of earnings and/or damage arising 
from business decisions that impact the long-term interests 
of stakeholders or from an inability to adapt to external 
developments.
How this risk is managed
 – The Board approves and oversees the execution of the 
Strategic Plan and associated strategic risk following the 
recommendations of the CEO and Executive Leadership Team. 
The Group’s risk appetite statement (RAS) sets out the risks it is 
able and willing to take to achieve its strategic objectives. 
People risk is the risk of not having sufficiently skilled and 
motivated colleagues who are clear on their responsibilities and 
accountabilities and who behave in an ethical way.
How this risk is managed
 – Roles, responsibilities and performance expectations are 
defined in role profiles and expanded through objective 
setting and ongoing performance management.
 – The quality and continuity of our leadership is reviewed 
and assessed through succession planning and talent 
management activity. 20 CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017
STUDIO B OPENS
We opened our innovation lab in London during April. 
Studio B is a physical manifestation of our digital 
ambitions and gives us the opportunity to lead the way 
on innovation and shape the future of our industry.
It allows us to collaborate directly with customers and third parties, 
including Fintechs, to solve the banking problems of tomorrow, offering 
insight into the sort of technologies and services that could be available in 
the future. We are able to rapidly develop new concepts with consumers 
in a test and learn environment, with the best being deployed across our 
channels and customers.

Deposits/funding
We offer a wide range of current accounts, savings 
accounts and term deposit products for personal 
and business customers. At 30 September 2017, the 
Group had £13.9bn of current account balances, 
£7.7bn of savings account balances and £6.0bn of 
term deposit balances.
CYBG has a loyal personal current account (PCA) 
customer base that represents a stable source of 
funding and sets us apart from most other 
challenger banks. We had approximately 1.8m PCA 
customers as at 30 September 2017, of which 37% 
also held savings accounts, 14% held CYBG credit 
cards and 6% held mortgages with us. Last year we 
identified key customer demographics in which we 
are underweight and have targeted growth across 
younger and more affluent customers. A key 
element of our strategy that supports our targeted 
growth in these demographics is the launch of B 
– our digital banking proposition, with current 
account, linked savings account, and credit card 
products that help customers manage their money 
and plan their savings through the use of customer-
defined savings pots. As B develops, further features 
will become available for customers in the future 
including loans and mortgages.
B’s product offering and advanced functionality has 
resulted in a market-leading customer experience 
and, at September 2017, B had a Net Promoter 
Score (NPS) of over 40. As a result, since its launch 
in May 2016, B has over 100,000 accounts and 
deposit balances of c.£1bn. B’s success to date, 
combined with its low cost to serve and nationwide 
presence, means it remains a key element of our 
customer and deposit strategy. 
We made improvements to our PCA proposition 
during the year, including a reduction in the time to 
open a bank account from 45 minutes when opened 
within a branch and 12 days on phone, down to 
20 minutes for each. We also introduced Android Pay, 
in addition to Apple Pay that was introduced last year.

Operational review
Above: The first B store 
in Birmingham opened 
in September – a flagship 
property for CYBG in the 
heart of the Midlands.
CYBG’s long-established Retail and SME franchises have significant scale and 
strong market share in personal current accounts, business current accounts, 
mortgages and SME business lending in our core regions. In 2017, we made 
significant operational progress with improvements in our customer experience 
taking effect. This in turn is enabling us to deliver the mid-single digit loan growth 
we are targeting and which is prudently funded through our strong customer 
deposit franchise.
B’s product offering and advanced 
functionality has resulted in a  
market-leading customer experience  CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 23
Strategic report Governance Financial results Risk report Financial statements Additional information
Business current accounts have shown healthy 
growth over the year, both in terms of volumes and 
the number of customers. This is partly due to our 
renewed investment and commitment to the SME 
market, which we believe is underserved by the 
larger incumbent banks, and the 25 months fee 
free offer currently available to new customers 
or switchers. Progress is currently being made to 
extend the B account for micro and small business 
customers in 2018, so that businesses can manage 
their money and forecast in the same way as 
personal customers.
Term deposits and cash ISA savings products remain 
an important part of our customer offering and a 
key element in our funding strategy. In line with our 
channel development strategy, a range of digital 
and omni-channel offers have been tested with 
customers. Demand has been high for these offers 
and very positive feedback has been received from 
customers on the process and proposition.
Total term deposit and savings account balances 
did reduce over the course of the year as CYBG 
took advantage of relatively low cost funding from 
the TFS and used the opportunity to run off more 
defensive term deposit and savings balances. 
However, these reductions were partially offset  
by an increase in B savings account balances.
Overall customer deposit balances including current 
accounts increased by 2.5% or £0.7bn in the year 
as part of a balanced approach to funding our 
loan growth.
We continue to have a diverse wholesale funding 
strategy which includes balances secured on our 
high-quality mortgage book and deposits with other 
banks. During the year we drew down £1.9bn from 
the BoE’s TFS and completed our inaugural MREL 
issuance transaction which was £300m of senior 
debt and was well received by the market.
Mortgages
We have a strong and growing mortgage franchise, 
with the majority of customers sourced through 
a network of brokers that allows us to diversify risk 
across the entire UK. As at 30 September 2017, 
we had 164,000 retail mortgage accounts, 
diversified across multiple regions in the UK.
The total mortgage book increased by 7.5% in the 
year to £23.5bn, compared with market growth of 
2.9% over the same period. We advanced £5.5bn of 
new mortgages in the year with 80% of this coming 
through our broker network, while our proprietary 
mortgage business delivered 20% to our retail and 
private banking customers. The UK mortgage 
market continues to be dominated by brokers and, 
while digital capability is emerging, this remains a 
very small part of the market. The journey customers 
go through when choosing a mortgage with us is a 
key area of focus, with multiple enhancements made 
to our service offering in 2017, most notably a 50% 
reduction in time from application to offer for all 
customers and the delivery of a fully packaged 
application to offer in less than 10 days. This 
enhanced customer journey makes a real difference 
to both customers and brokers, with customers 
having certainty quickly over our ability to lend to 
them. We are committed to enhancing both 
customer and broker journeys, which will position 
us well as the market continues to evolve.
We are continually looking to enhance our 
mortgage offering and 2017 saw further progress 
in improving our customer proposition. For example, 
our mortgage offers are now valid for 180 days, up 
from the previous 90 days. We have also reduced 
the amount of documentation we request from 
brokers as part of the application process without 
compromising our data capture, making it easier for 
brokers to do business with CYBG.
These incremental process improvements have 
enabled us to increase our share of broker business 
and reduce the proportion of consumers that drop 
out part way through the application process. This 
has enabled us to capture market share in the 
mortgage market without compromising on pricing 
or weakening our underwriting standards.
Left: In the B app, customers can set up and name ‘savings pots’ 
making it easier to put money aside regularly. Other B smart tools, 
such as the sweep facility and budgets, have also been designed to 
help make saving simpler. CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 24
We also have a successful mortgage retention 
proposition and customers are now able to switch 
to a new deal up to three months before the end  
of a fixed rate term without incurring an early 
repayment charge. We have also launched an online 
broker switch portal that makes it easier for brokers 
to switch to a new deal for their customers.
Incremental process improvements 
have enabled us to increase our  
share of broker business and reduce 
the proportion of consumers that 
drop out part way through the 
application process.
The BTL market represented a smaller proportion of 
the growth in the mortgage portfolio in the year to 
30 September 2017, due to regulatory changes and 
our continued focus on the owner occupier market. 
The changes in the taxation regime, coupled with 
tightening underwriting standards, have slowed 
growth in the market as a whole. Our BTL strategy 
remains unchanged and we continue to lend to this 
segment within our clear and prudent risk appetite.
The average loan to value (LTV) of the mortgage 
book is 57.5% and the average LTVs of the owner 
occupied and BTL portfolios are 56.9% and 58.6% 
respectively. The loss rate on the mortgage portfolio 
continues to be at historically low levels and the book 
is well diversified across the UK. This strong position 
is partly due to the underwriting process, where the 
Group primarily uses automated credit decision tools 
to support its underwriting services, supplemented 
by a robust manual underwriting process. Successful 
IRB accreditation should enable CYBG to be more 
competitive in other areas of the mortgage market, 
while maintaining a healthy risk position.
SMEs
SMEs are the engine of the British economy and we 
believe CYBG has a critical role to play in providing 
banking services for start-ups, cultivating established 
businesses as they scale up and encouraging sector 
expansion and innovation. At CYBG, we have a 
proven track record of being a regional economic 
champion and in April we announced a £6bn lending 
commitment, available to UK SMEs over three years 
to 2019. We advanced over £2bn of new loans and 
facilities in the first year and our SME business is a 
key differentiator for us in the market.
We have a strong belief that we need to understand 
how SMEs are performing UK-wide, both now and 
in the future, in order to support them in the best 
way possible. With this is mind, we launched our 
SME Health Check Index, a quarterly report, in 
collaboration with the Centre for Economics and 
Business Research (Cebr), in June, which analyses 
different statistics to evaluate the health of the business 
and macroeconomic environment. Despite being in 
its infancy, the index has already been well received by 
business and industry – our business banking teams 
are relishing the opportunity to discuss the regional 
results with current and potential customers, while 
analysts have used the report findings in their work.

This year has seen excellent momentum in our SME 
business, with a strong pipeline and drawdowns up 
13% year on year. In support of our lending pledge 
our core SME balances grew 6%, in line with 
our expectations. 
We provide SME customers with a full range of 
products and services including a deposit portfolio, 
which consists of business current accounts, variable 
rate savings accounts and fixed rate term deposits. 
We also have a range of lending products and 
services for SMEs across a £7.3bn portfolio, which 
consists of term lending, overdrafts, revolving credit 
facilities, working capital, trade and treasury solutions. 
We also offer business banking products and services 
to larger SMEs and mid-corporate businesses 
where we have the sector expertise, experience 
and relationships to do so competitively and have a 
range of propositions designed for specific industries. 
We are proud that 57% of our business customers 
have been with the Bank for more than 10 years 
and retain a commitment to local relationship 
management for all businesses with turnover 
above £2m. 
SMEs are the engine of the British 
economy, and we believe CYBG has 
a critical role to play in providing 
banking services for start-ups, 
cultivating established businesses 
as they scale up and encouraging 
sector expansion and innovation.
We are continuing to develop our product, service 
and sector propositions for key customer segments 
as we actively seek to grow our lending portfolio 
and support our SME customers. The Fintech 
partnership we have launched will provide an 
innovative online lending facility for our small 
business customers who will benefit from faster 
decision making and fulfilment of funds, through 
an easy to use online application. The technology 
will eventually provide a fully automated review 
and approval for the customer, with funding 
provided on acceptance.
In addition, SME customers will begin to migrate 
onto iB for both mobile and web in 2018; this will 
enhance our service offering for small businesses by 
leveraging the capabilities of our iB platform already 
built and tested in other channels.
We also provide relationship banking for our small 
business customers delivered through 79 centrally 
based relationship managers via telephone (Business 
Direct). This channel will also next year be migrated 
to our iB digital platform enabling an integrated 
approach to banking. 
Given our history of supporting the economies of 
the north of England, we are very supportive of the 
Government’s Northern Powerhouse initiative and 
its aim to spread economic growth more evenly 
across the UK. CYBG believes passionately that 
the Northern Powerhouse offers significant 
opportunities for SMEs in the North of England 
and we believe that we are uniquely placed to help 
them benefit from this opportunity.
Our non-core portfolio continued to run off as 
planned, reducing by 30% in the year and is now 
£0.5bn or less than 7% of the total portfolio.
Personal
lending
The Group has taken a cautious approach to the 
unsecured lending market and has continued to 
invest judiciously in our digital capabilities as part 
of our omni-channel approach. During the year, 
our personal loans book increased by 2.7%, while 
the credit card book reduced by 1.1% due to the 
competitive pricing environment and long duration 
balance-transfer periods from peers, which CYBG 
has chosen not to compete with. We also introduced 
the B credit card in June of this year which has 
attractive features like an absence of charges for 
purchases made abroad as well as the ability to tag 
and track spending on the innovative B app, and this 
has been well received by our customers with over 
10,000 cards already active.
We remain comfortable with the asset quality of 
our unsecured lending book and will continue to 
offer personal unsecured lending to customers in 
a manner reflecting our risk appetite and the 
emerging economic environment. FINANCIAL INJECTION  
DOUBLES PRODUCTION AT 
SHETLAND MUSSELS
At CYBG, we understand that SMEs are the engine 
room of the UK’s economy – with SMEs accounting for 
99% of businesses in the private sector. It’s therefore 
vital that we are supporting businesses offering the 
right support and finance to ensure their success.
One example of this is our support of Shetland Mussels Ltd, which is set to 
double production thanks to our multimillion pound finance package.
The company already supplies over 900 tonnes of mussels to restaurants, 
wholesalers and retailers up and down the UK every year, but it’s expected 
that this will grow significantly by 2020. A family business, Shetland Mussels 
is owned by father and sons Lollie, Richard and Michael Tait. The company 
already provides jobs in Shetland and expects to increase their number of 
employees over the coming few years.

Delivering to our stakeholders
Customers
We care about our customers and their individual 
needs. Our strategy is designed to help us support 
our existing customers, as well as attract new ones, 
and achieve sustainable growth. We aim to help 
our customers develop a healthy relationship with 
money and make their day-to-day management 
of money simple through the development of our 
products such as B.
Listening to our customers and anticipating their 
needs, as well as addressing the root cause of 
any concerns, is a key input into the ongoing 
development of our products and services.

Communities
Our support for our customers and the wider 
communities, through our range of initiatives, 
form part of our corporate responsibilities. Our 
community initiatives, together with our community 
partnerships, collectively support the communities 
where we live and work and help demonstrate how 
‘we care about here’. 
For more detail see page 32
Colleagues
Our colleagues are integral to our ongoing success 
and our overall business performance is dependent 
on their engagement and advocacy. In the same 
way that we are transforming our business for our 
customers, we are investing in our colleagues. We are 
creating a workplace where every colleague can reach 
their full potential in an environment which nurtures 
a diverse, inclusive and committed workforce. We 
are striving to build a high-performing culture where 
colleagues can use their initiative, act with greater 
autonomy, and connect with each other to deliver 
the right customer-focused outcomes, regardless of 
where they work or what they do across the Group.

Environment
The Group’s commitment to operating in a 
sustainable way is underpinned by our Environmental 
Standard that recognises our need to meet key 
legislative compliance requirements, voluntary 
commitments and covers our approach to 
environmental management, controls and reporting. 
The Group acts to prevent pollution and the use 
of natural resources through increased recycling 
and transition to lower emissions energy sources 
where practicable.

Customers
Understanding our customers is part of our DNA. 
We constantly seek customer feedback and put this 
at the core of the development of our products and 
services. Customer advocacy is monitored continually 
through various ways, including NPS. This focus on 
our customers’ perception of our offering enables us 
to respond, build and innovate around real customer 
needs and ambitions. Indeed our digital banking 
solution - B - was built as a direct result of what 
our customers told us they needed from a bank 
in today’s always-on world. 
We also understand that customers can become 
vulnerable at any point in their lives and as a result 
may need our support. We encourage our 
customers to let us know if they need our support 
and through our omni-channel service and 
empathetic staff, are able to work with customers 
as individuals, identifying solutions and providing 
the appropriate support as and when they need it.
Progress in FY2017
We continue to serve over 2.7m customers, 
with overall customer numbers remaining stable, 
while our B customer numbers have grown to over 
100,000. Customer satisfaction and advocacy are 
key measures and we have enjoyed steady levels of 
satisfaction across all of our brands. The highest 
levels of satisfaction being for B customers – with 
86% happy with the service they received, and 45% 
giving the service the maximum 10 out of 10. 
At the forefront of our strategy to drive sustainable 
customer growth is the need to continually innovate, 
creating unique, customer-led propositions that 
attract new customers to the Group. In April we 
opened the doors of Studio B in Kensington, an 
innovation lab which operates on the high street 
within a fully operational customer banking centre. 
The mission of Studio B is for the next generation of 
customers to design the next generation of banking. 
The lab within Studio B works directly with 
customers to co-create new concepts and solutions, 
publishing the best concepts to a public website to 
gather direct customer feedback. The best of these 
concepts are taken forward into full development 
and deployment across our channels. 
We aim to get our service right first time every time, 
learning from any mistakes and driving continuous 
improvement. This year the Financial Conduct 
Authority (FCA) changed the way customer 
complaints are reported. To comply with these new 
rules on improving complaints handling we now 
include complaints resolved in shorter timescales 
when reporting our complaints numbers.  
When we do make mistakes, our goal is to provide 
our customers with fair outcomes consistently 
and promptly.
Development of B and the iB platform
B is our digital first brand, offering customers a 
current account, savings account, credit card and 
app that together help customers to take effortless 
control of their money. B is supported by the 
existing CB and YB customer banking centre 
network, and a 24/7 dedicated B contact centre. 
As the primary brand for attracting new target 
retail customers, the customer centric development 
of B drives the underlying development of the 
iB platform, to the broader benefit of CB and 
YB customers. 
Throughout 2017 a range of B and iB developments 
have been implemented, responding directly to 
customer feedback. Examples of these 
improvements include:
 – the redesign of the navigation within B to make 
it easier for customers to use on the go;
 – the introduction of fingerprint login to make 
it easier to securely login to the app;
 – the launch of the B credit card to give customers 
greater control of their everyday finances; and
 – the introduction of digital statements to enable 
customers to go paperless without losing control.
In August, we relaunched the CB and YB mobile apps 
on the iB platform, migrating existing customers 
from a 3rd party provided service. By moving 
customers onto the iB platform, they are able to 
benefit from some of the customer experience 
improvements first developed for B, such as the 
fingerprint login and digital statements. Our ambition 
to grow our customer base outside of our traditional 
CB and YB heartlands means the launch of our B 
store in Birmingham was a hugely exciting milestone, 
enabling us to increase our presence in one of the 
UK’s most vibrant regional economies. The design 
and customer experience within the B store has 
been directly influenced by the design and concepts 
developed and tested within Studio B (London). 
As well as being a fully operational customer banking 
centre, the store provides an exciting and inspiring 
location for customers to experience our digital 
services and to participate in concept co-creation. CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 30

Serving our business customers
As we continue to digitise our bank and create a 
more innovative business, we are driving growth in 
the business sector through strategic associations 
with Fintech companies. Our first Fintech 
collaboration is an innovative online lending 
solution for SME customers.
This year we announced that we would lend at least 
£6bn to SMEs over three years to help promote 
the growth of these businesses in the UK. In June, 
we launched our SME Health Check Index, taking 
the temperature of small businesses in the UK – 
this quarterly report with the Centre for Economics 
and Business Research (Cebr) is a new industry 
report that measures business performance and 
the macroeconomic environment affecting SMEs, 
including business costs, capacity, confidence, lending 
and revenue.
Recognition for our work
We have won a number of awards this year, including:
 – Best Digital Bank United Kingdom at the 
Capital Finance International Awards;
 – Fairbanking Foundation – best current account 
with overdraft for B;
 – Digital Launch of the Year for B at the 2017 
FStech Awards; and
 – Challenger Bank of the Year at the Corporate 
Entrepreneur Awards 2016.
Colleagues
Our colleagues are integral to our ongoing success 
and our overall business performance is dependent 
on their engagement and advocacy, with significant 
progress made during the year to improve our 
offering, including: 
Our culture
This year, we began a major programme to  
develop the positive culture we are aiming for. 
This programme has several critical elements:
 – Our values and behaviours were refreshed in 
June and define the desired behaviours for every 
colleague in the Group. Our values (Be ambitious, 
Be courageous, Be curious, Be all over it and 
Be connected) are brought to life through their 
associated behaviours. Every team has 
personalised the behaviours to their business 
area, and every colleague has a personal goal 
in relation to our values to support their own 
development. By turning these words into 
actions, we are helping to build a Group where 
colleagues are focused on meeting the needs 
of both their own development and our current 
and future customers.
 – Great leadership is our new leadership 
framework and was introduced at the same time 
as our refreshed values. All leaders play a critical 
role in creating culture and driving performance 
and so Great Leadership sets the expectations 
of all leaders. Our leaders are being supported 
with targeted leadership development to help 
them to Lead with Purpose, Drive Inclusion, 
be Always Agile, Grow Trust, Be Connected 
and Stretch Possibilities.
 – Recruitment and performance management 
have both been updated to reflect our cultural 
aims. Internal and external selection is now based 
on our values, ensuring we recruit and promote 
colleagues who align with our culture. Our 
performance management approach has been 
transformed to a team-focused, forward-looking 
approach, which helps every colleague to achieve 
their personal best. 
Engagement and communication
This has been a year of transformational change 
and ensuring that our colleagues remain engaged 
is critical. MyVoice (our annual colleague feedback 
survey) provides us with insight in relation to our 
values and behaviours, alignment with our strategy 
and focus on serving our customers. 90% of 
colleagues understand how the work they do 
contributes to the Group’s goals while 84% fully 
support our values. 
Our primary digital communications channel is our 
intranet home page, Our World, and in its first year 
(to August 2017) there was an average of c.6,000 
unique visitors per day, with over 370 articles 
published relating to our leadership, strategy, culture, 
business success and community activity. This site is 
increasingly used for two-way engagement through 
the use of polls, discussion threads and invitations 
to get involved in activities. This year our 
communications won the award for the ‘Best Use 
of Interactive Media’ at the IoIC Scotland Awards. 
Inclusion
Inclusion is at the heart of our culture. It’s written 
into our values. We are committed to fostering 
and sustaining a truly inclusive culture where every 
colleague and customer feels they belong. We want 
all colleagues to recognise this and work together 
to ensure that inclusion achieves its promise. 
We ensure equality, diversity and inclusion by 
concentrating on ensuring that every colleague 
feels comfortable to be themselves, to ask questions, 
to be curious and operate at their personal best.  CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 31
Strategic report Governance Financial results Risk report Financial statements Additional information
Reflecting the importance of inclusion, this year 
our five network groups for gender, age, disability, 
ethnicity and sexual orientation were re-energised 
and sponsored by members of the Executive 
Leadership Team, unlocking access across the Group 
and acting as ambassadors for the Group externally. 
Some specific highlights of the year include:
 – events and activities held to celebrate 
and improve awareness of World Aids Day, 
International Women’s Day, International 
Transgender Day of Visibility, National Inclusion 
Week, Carers Week, and religious celebrations 
including Ramadan and Vaisakhi; 
 – becoming a signatory of the Women in Finance 
Charter. With a long-term objective to be 
gender-balanced in senior management, we have 
committed to a target of 40% of those in senior 
management roles to be female by 2020. We are 
making good progress and as at 30 September 
2017, 35% of our senior managers are female;
 – helping ensure colleagues have the right tools 
available to break down the stigma of talking 
about mental health by launching new 
enablement and wellbeing resources. These 
included a new mental health awareness training 
module, a people leader toolkit and online 
support materials. We also supported Mental 
Health Awareness Week in May; and
 – worked closely with LGBT Youth Scotland 
to broaden our reach and connection in the 
community. We have also significantly increased 
our participation in Pride Glasgow, connecting 
campaigning, social responsibility and commercial 
opportunity.
As at 30 September 2017, our strong, diverse and 
engaged network of colleagues included:
 – 5,813 permanent FTE, 63% of which are female, 
37% male
 – three women and nine men on our Board
 – three women and seven men in our Executive 
Leadership Team
Gender pay gap
An important element of inclusion is to reduce our 
gender pay gap. As part of this year’s Annual Report 
and Accounts, for the first time, we are disclosing 
our April 2017 gender pay gap in accordance with 
the UK Government regulations for gender pay 
gap reporting. 
Our overall mean and median gender pay and bonus 
gap based on a snapshot date of 5 April 2017 (pay) 
and bonus paid in the 12 months to 5 April 2017 is: 
Pay and bonus – difference between males 
and females

We are confident that we do not have equal pay 
issues, and conduct a biannual equal pay audit in 
partnership with our trade union, Unite. Through 
this audit we review the gender distribution of 
performance, base pay, allowances and bonuses paid 
to our staff. We are confident that performance is 
not gender biased and where pay gaps exist they 
are not driven by gender.
Our gender pay gap is largely driven by the fact that 
we have more men than women in senior roles. 
Our Women in Finance Charter commitments are a 
public demonstration of our ambition to increase the 
proportion of women in senior roles. We are also 
working to increase career progression at all grades. 
This commitment includes:
 – reviewing our approach to parental leave 
to encourage shared parental leave;
 – reviewing other working policies to make flexible 
working easier, particularly in more senior roles;
 – ensuring our recruitment processes attract 
a diverse range of candidates;
 – making our unconscious bias training mandatory 
for all colleagues;
 – establishing a sponsorship programme to develop 
more diverse leaders;
 – formally linking executive reward to our 
inclusion targets;
 – continuing to undertake our equal pay audits 
in conjunction with our trade union Unite;
 – transforming our performance management 
approach to encourage ongoing personal 
improvement, removing the risk of any 
gender bias; and
 – reviewing our reward practices to ensure they 
help us reduce any gender pay gaps.
Through all of these practices we are aiming to 
create meaningful progress with regards to inclusion 
in senior management, based on robust pipelines of 
diverse talent.
Community
We bring our social purpose to life through our 
commitment to make a positive contribution to 
the local communities in which we live and work. 
This is expressed through a series of community 
partnerships and initiatives that deliver our  
‘We care about here’ ethos. The Group recognises 
the important role we play as an enabler of change 
in local communities and society at large. 
Our charitable foundation supports our colleagues 
by enabling them to help causes they support 
regularly in their local communities by providing 
grants and encouraging volunteering of their time 
and expertise. The Group supported National 
Volunteering Week in June and encouraged 
colleagues to use their two day entitlement to 
support local charities. 287 employee grants were 
awarded totalling over £141,000 and almost 7,000 
volunteering hours were undertaken during the year.
Support for charities is provided through our annual 
Spirit of the Community Awards. Now in its fifth 
year, awards of £5,000 were made to 30 charities 
under three categories of Employability, Financial 
Education and Environment. Over 300 applications 
were received and the charities collected their 
awards at ceremonies in Leeds and Glasgow in June. 
The event in Glasgow was attended by the full CYBG 
Board. Awards totalling £160,000 were given out 
and the total over five years amounts to £860,000 
awarded to 143 charities.
Financial education – Our ‘Count me in 123’ 
financial education programme is available in our 
branches, online and via public libraries in Leeds and 
Glasgow. The materials support parents and carers 
to engage with their pre-school children and have 
fun with maths. Over 65,000 booklets have been 
distributed via our branches and the game is available 
to download on Apple and Android tablets. Our 
colleagues also support children in schools by 
volunteering with reading and numbers programmes. 
Hospice UK charity partnership – We celebrated 
our 10th year supporting Hospice UK. Through 
the tremendous enthusiasm of our colleagues 
and the matched funding through our foundation 
we raised £5.8m for the charity to help provide 
hospice care across the country. In addition to fun 
events throughout the year, colleagues took part  
in a marathon challenge in the Tweed Valley of 
the Scottish Borders in September and raised 
over £100,000.

European City of Culture – During the year, 
Yorkshire Bank supported Leeds’ bid to be European 
City of Culture 2023. The Group is supporting a 
programme of cultural events in 2017 and 2018 
that aim to showcase and enhance existing Leeds 
festivals, as well as giving scope for new ones.
Community partnerships
The Royal Zoological Society of Scotland (RZSS) 
– Our ‘Wild about Scotland’ educational outreach 
programme, in partnership with RZSS, continued to 
travel the length and breadth of Scotland teaching 
primary school aged children about Scotland’s native 
species and natural environment. It helped engage 
the next generation of conservationists, while 
bringing RZSS’ expertise to communities that might 
not otherwise have been able to benefit from it.
A team of volunteers supported the programme 
at a series of community events across the country 
at weekends and school holidays. Families hopped 
on the bus to take part in fun activities on Scottish 
wildlife, such as guess the animal skulls, build a beaver 
dam and look at minibeasts under microscopes.
An extra special community event took place at 
RZSS’ Edinburgh Zoo on Father’s Day in June, when 
over 400 guests from five different Scottish charities 
visited the Zoo and took part in the second annual 
Wild about Scotland Day. 
Scotland’s Charity Air Ambulance (SCAA) 
– Our support for SCAA is now in its third year and 
has helped to keep the aircraft in the air saving lives 
across Scotland. Last year the aircraft responded 
to over 300 emergency call outs.
Volunteers from the Group supported the charity 
at the Blair Atholl Horse Trials. Our colleagues, along 
with our agencies, also dedicated their expertise to 
help design and print customer communications, 
including their Annual Report and Accounts.
SSE Hydro – Our support for the SSE Hydro, 
the world’s second busiest music venue, continued 
during the year. We continued to use the SSE Hydro 
to reward customers and the wider public for playing 
an active role in their local communities through 
our ‘Centre Stage’ reward programme and to date, 
over 250 people have enjoyed attending a series 
of concerts. Our unique seat upgrade initiative, ‘Get 
me in the Vault’, together with other competitions, 
proved very popular with more than 46,000 entries 
into 250 competitions.
Yorkshire Bank Bike Libraries (YBBL) – The 
legacy community initiative from the Grand Departé 
of the Tour de France in 2014 rolled into its third 
year. A total of 46 bike libraries have been 
established across the county and the public 
continued to donate their old and unwanted bikes 
with over 5,000 being distributed. This resulted in 
over 48,000 opportunities for children and their 
families to borrow a bike.
The initiative was recognised and shortlisted for 
three prestigious awards during the year from the 
European Sponsorship Association, The Sponsorship 
Awards 2017 and BT Sports Industry Award for 
Community Programme of the Year.
The YBBL programme was the official partner of 
Stage 3 of the Tour de Yorkshire, with children’s 
parades and activation tents promoting the service. 
We supported the Tour de Yorkshire in our 
customer banking centres and our colleagues 
volunteered to help with the free fun activities 
for the local communities in large tents at the start 
and finish towns each day. The Tour de Yorkshire 
attracted 2.2m spectators along the route and 
was viewed by c.10m people in 180 countries. CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 34
Environment
During the year, the Group made a contribution 
towards the drive for a low carbon and more 
resource efficient economy through:
 – establishing a standalone Environmental Standard 
for the Group and setting up a standalone group 
system to capture and report on greenhouse gas 
(GHG) emissions;
 – procuring 100% renewable green energy for 
electricity within Group’s direct control; 
 – continuing to roll out advanced building efficiency 
management systems as part of the branch 
refurbishment programme. Such systems help 
automate controls to ensure we only operate

Reporting on GHG emissions
The reporting period for GHG emissions in the 
Group ran from 1 July 2016 to 30 June 2017. 
Total emissions for the Group have reduced by 14% 
in the last year. Nearly half of the reduction is driven 
by changes in the emission factors as defined by 
the Department for Business, Energy & Industrial 
Strategy guidelines. The Group used the 2016 
Department for Business, Energy & Industrial 
Strategy conversion factors due to the timing of the 
release of the 2017 conversion factors. The largest 
change in emission factors is the decarbonisation of 
electricity generated by the National Grid. Using the 
same emission factor for both the 2016 and 2017 
reporting years and accounting for the impact of 
FTE and portfolio changes, the reduction in 
emissions would be 3%.

Intensity ratio
The Group has chosen to use an intensity ratio of 
GHG per average FTE for scope 1 and 2 emissions. 
Using FTE offers a simple way to measure and 
monitor Group performance on emissions and 
is also a useful way to benchmark and compare 
with others. 
Scope (1 & 2)
2017 2016
GHG emissions per 
average FTE 2.61 2.83
The only estimated emissions in the GHG emission 
data relate to energy consumed in properties where 
the landlord controls the supply and recharges the 
Group via a service charge arrangement or where 
actual meter readings were not available before 
year end. In these instances an average rate per 
kWh has been used. 
Independent limited assurance
The Group engaged KPMG LLP to undertake an 
independent limited assurance engagement over the 
selected information highlighted in this report with a 
r. KPMG has issued an unqualified opinion over the 
selected information. The full statement is available 
on the CYBG website.
Use of resources
In 2017, we created four new environmental targets 
to measure the Group’s performance over the next 
three years in comparison to a baseline in 
June 2016. We have made good progress 
against three, but there is work to do in the next 
12 months to increase the volume of recycling 
across the Group’s operational business through 
promoting staff awareness and improving in-house 
recycling processes.

COLLEAGUES STRIDE OUT TO 
SUPPORT HOSPICE UK
Supporting local communities across the UK is 
important to the Group and our colleagues undertake 
around 11,000 volunteer hours a year in support of our 
charity partners. In September, 150 colleagues pulled 
on their walking boots and trekked the rolling hills 
of the Scottish Borders in a fundraising challenge to 
support Hospice UK.
This is the fifth time we have supported a large fundraising event for 
Hospice UK and this year the challenge raised £50,000 for the charity’s 
work across the UK, which was matched by the Group to a total of 
£100,000, adding to the £5.8m raised for hospice care by colleagues 
since 2008.

Overview of Group results
Our FY2017 results reflect a year of strong financial performance as we have 
delivered on our strategic priorities in a period of challenging market and 
economic conditions. We have grown our customer lending without compromising 
on asset quality, delivered cost savings well ahead of our targets in the first phase 
of our three year efficiency programme, and taken concrete steps to improve 
our capital position. We are firmly focused on building a solid base for delivering 
sustainable returns to our shareholders.

Profits up overall
The Group has successfully delivered on each financial target set out at the Capital Markets Day in 
September 2016 and reported a statutory profit for the first time since 2011 of £182m (2016: loss of 
£164m). Significant progress has been made against the Group’s strategic priorities, which has led to FY2017 
underlying profit before tax increasing to £293m, up £72m (33%). Together with a stable capital base, this has 
been the primary driver of the increase in underlying RoTE, from 5.2% to 7.5% and underlying basic earnings 
per share (EPS) from 16.2p to 21.5p. Our disciplined approach to managing our balance sheet has enabled us 
to increase tangible net asset value (TNAV) from 284.1p to 295.6p per share.
As a result of the progress we have made in improving the performance of our business, we are pleased 
to declare our intention to pay an inaugural dividend to our equity shareholders.
£1.8bn growth in customer lending
The Group’s performance was delivered against a backdrop of challenging economic and market conditions, 
as the effects of the base rate cuts in 2016 and the corresponding fall in LIBOR rates, together with lower 
UK credit growth competitive pricing across the industry, prevailed throughout the year. In spite of these 
pressures, we delivered growth in our mortgage and core SME lending portfolios, up £1.6bn and £0.4bn 
respectively, and saw an increase in our mortgage market share. We remain cautious in the unsecured 
lending market, taking a disciplined approach to pricing in a competitive market; nevertheless, our 
unsecured lending portfolio saw a modest increase in balances year on year.
Growth in the customer lending book has been achieved without compromising asset quality. The 
Group’s cost of risk has remained relatively low at 14bps (2016: 9bps), reflective of the quality and mix  
of our book with the mortgage portfolio accounting for a high proportion of total customer lending  
(2017: 73.4%; 2016: 72.4%).
Active management of customer deposits
Customer deposits increased year on year as we saw 5.3% growth in current account balances, with strong 
recruitment of business current accounts and substantial growth in B savings balances. This growth more 
than offset the managed reduction in volumes of variable rate savings accounts as we rationalised and 
repriced our ISA portfolio. 
This repricing was part of an overall plan to improve our funding mix, with a shift from higher cost deposits 
towards lower cost funding. The Group’s participation in the Government’s TFS was another element of this 
plan, and together these actions helped to drive down the Group’s funding costs, with the blended rate on 
interest-bearing liabilities falling by 25bps to 75bps.
While the rate environment dampened growth in interest income, the actions taken across the liability 
portfolio allowed us to grow net interest income by £38m (4.7%). Overall, these factors combined to drive 
a 1bps increase in NIM to 227bps.

Cost savings well ahead of plan
We continued to improve our operational efficiency during the year through the restructuring and 
streamlining of our business. We incurred restructuring charges of £67m to deliver gross run rate cost 
savings of £90m, we saw the benefits of these actions as the year progressed as our full year underlying 
costs fell by £54m (7%) to £675m, well below our FY2017 guidance of £690m–£700m. As a result, and 
combined with the increase in income, our underlying cost to income ratio improved from 74% to 67%.
Optimisation of our capital base – CET1 ratio 12.4%
Our key capital ratios remain within our required operating range. The core business generated 13bps 
of CET1 capital over the year. Offsetting the growth in our core business were the costs associated with 
restructuring, separation from our former parent and legacy conduct issues which together absorbed 
61bps of CET1.
The capital position benefited from the closure of the defined benefit pension scheme (the Scheme) to 
future accrual for the majority of employees, improving the IAS 19 position by £88m and contributing to an 
IAS 19 surplus of £207m at the year end. In addition, the trustees completed the 2016 triennial valuation, 
which resulted in a reduction in the Scheme deficit (on a trustee funding basis) from £450m to £290m and 
no change to the existing deficit repayment schedule agreed with the Trustee in June 2014.
In April 2017 we submitted our application to the PRA for permission to use the IRB approach to calculating 
credit RWA. This marked a key milestone in our path to IRB accreditation. 
Outlook for 2018
The lending market will, we expect, remain competitive, especially for home loans. However, our pipeline in 
both our mortgage and SME businesses is strong and supports our plans to deliver continued asset growth. 
It is likely that we will see further price pressure in the mortgage and unsecured personal loan markets. 
Our strong deposit-gathering capability, founded on our personal and business current account franchise, 
will ensure that we fund our growth in a sustainable and cost-effective manner. We expect to see modest 
pressure on net interest margin and our NIM guidance for FY2018 is 220bps.
Our efficiency programme will capitalise on the momentum seen over the past 12 months, and will focus 
on procurement and organisational design enhancements in the coming year. With a track record of 
achieving sustainable cost savings, we are confident in our ability to deliver savings in line with our guidance 
and further reduce our cost income ratio.
We will manage our capital base within our stated operating range for CET1 of 12 to 13%.

Financial performance review
1. Sustainable customer growth
2017 has been a year of strong business growth against of a highly competitive backdrop and uncertain 
economic conditions. In targeting sustainable growth in our customer balances we enhanced our product 
offerings to attract the right mix of customer profile to deliver longer-term value. In doing so we have 
delivered growth while maintaining asset quality, adhering to our underwriting standards and controlled 
risk appetite leading to a well-balanced and diverse portfolio.
The asset quality of the Group’s credit exposures remains stable relative to the growth in portfolio size, 
evidenced by the reduction in the level of impaired assets to £179m (2016: £233m) and a modest increase 
in 90 days past due (DPD) to £161m (2016: £150m). In aggregate, impaired assets and 90 DPD represent 
1.06% of gross loans (2016: 1.27%).
We have managed our deposits base throughout the year – growing balances, improving the mix and 
reducing funding costs.

Mortgages
The mortgage book remains the Group’s largest asset portfolio and has a significant impact on our overall 
financial performance. This year we delivered record levels of new mortgage business, which supported net 
growth of 7.5% in the year, higher than system growth
(3)
 of 2.9%, and saw our market share increase from 
1.67% to 1.73%. 
In line with our competitors, we continued to see a growing number of customers favour fixed rate mortgage 
products, as they sought to further capitalise on the prevailing low interest rate environment. As a result, the 
fixed rate book grew to 73% of mortgage balances (2016: 68%) and accounted for 95% of mortgages drawn 
in the year (2016: 93%).
The split of our mortgage book between BTL and owner occupied properties remained broadly stable, 
although owner occupied accounted for 70% of drawdowns in the year (2016: 59%) as we focused on our 
strategy to support the residential market and manage within our risk appetite limits. The average LTV of 
new lending was 71% and, as a consequence, the average LTV of the mortgage book increased from 55.8% 
to 57.5%.
Our proportion of residential mortgages 90 days in arrears has remained stable at 0.52%  
(September 2016: 0.51%).

SME lending
Our core SME lending portfolio increased by £383m (5.9%) in the year, ahead of system growth
(1)
 of 3.9%. 
The main drivers for the increase were improved origination flows, coupled with lower attrition in the 
second half of the year as we implemented a number of new propositions and developed new capabilities to 
better support the funding needs of our SME customers. These included a new proposition for the financial 
services sector, and the establishment of an agency capability. Growth finance and cash flow finance also 
performed well.
We maintained a robust approach to credit decisions on new lending in the year, reflective of the continued 
reduction in the impaired asset portfolio to £126m (2016: £146m). Notwithstanding an increase in specific 
provisions on a small number of exposures, the underlying credit quality of the portfolio has remained stable.
In line with our strategy we continued to run off our non-core portfolio, which reduced from £720m to £504m.
Unsecured personal lending
Following a brief period of contraction in our unsecured personal lending book, which comprises credit cards, 
personal loans and overdrafts, the second half of the year saw modest growth of £9m year on year. Within 
this, the fixed rate personal loan book was the largest contributor, showing growth of £33m (5%) from 
£625m at 30 September 2016 to £658m at 30 September 2017. This growth was driven in the main by the 
launch of an improved personal loan proposition with competitive pricing in the third quarter, supported by 
enhanced scorecards and a simplified online application process. The uptake in this new offering contributed 
to higher loan origination in the second half of the year. 
Credit card balances were broadly flat at £396m (2016: £400m).
The smallest element of our unsecured lending portfolio is comprised of variable rate personal loans and 
overdrafts, which fell by £20m in the year from £131m to £111m. Variable rate loans continue to reduce  
as although these products remain on sale, they are not actively promoted or targeted.
Current accounts
Funding provided by current accounts increased by £0.7bn (5.3%) since September 2016, due principally  
to continued growth in business current account balances (up £387m) driven by the 25-month fee free 
offer we launched in December 2016, and system growth. Personal current account balances also continued 
to grow, with the B current account (up £200m) attracting both existing and new to bank customers 
throughout the year as we delivered further enhancements in product functionality. Our Current Account 
Plus product also contributed growth of £140m with the average case size offsetting a declining stock balance. 
While stock levels across the book fell overall, new account openings were in line with our strategy to grow 
sustainably in a way that recruits the right profile of customer with whom we have an opportunity to build 
a long-term relationship.

Variable rate savings accounts
Funding from variable rate savings accounts benefited from growth of £0.7bn in B savings accounts 
and £0.3bn in business savings accounts. This partially offset attrition of £1.2bn following the product 
rationalisation and repricing of our ISA portfolio. In addition we saw attrition of £0.2bn across other savings 
products as, in line with market trends, we saw a shift in consumer behaviour towards easier access accounts 
such as instant access and current accounts. 
Fixed rate term deposits
Our fixed rate term deposit book increased by £483m (8.8%) as a result of actions taken in the second half 
of the year, including the repricing of maturing term deposits and competitive retail product launches in the 
digital bond space and fixed rate cash ISAs, along with the launch of new notice accounts for SME depositors.
Funding and liquidity
The Group continues to maintain its strong funding and liquidity position and seeks to achieve an appropriate 
balance between profitability, liquidity risk and capital optimisation. Our focus on delivering customer growth, 
together with a managed reduction in volumes of variable rate savings accounts, and drawdown of £1.9bn 
of lower cost funding from the Bank of England’s Term Funding Scheme, has resulted in an increase in LDR 
from 112% to 115%, well within our guidance for the year of <120%. 
The Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) was higher at 164% at 30 September 2017 (2016: 140%) due to  
the pre-funding of residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) callable in November 2017. Net Stable 
Funding Ratio (NSFR) was 118% at 30 September 2017 (2016: 124%).
The Group has evolved its approach to managing the liquid asset buffer (LAB) to more efficiently utilise 
cash to reduce the cost of the LAB while still holding high quality, low risk liquid assets, by broadening the 
composition of the portfolio. The Group has diversified by investing in a broader range of supranational and 
covered bond issuances. Previously, liquidity was mainly held in BoE accounts, earning base rate, alongside 
holdings of UK Sovereign bonds (Gilts).
The issue of £300m of senior debt in June provided further funding to the Group and marked an important 
first step in our journey towards meeting the BoE’s Minimum Requirement for Own Funds and Eligible 
Liabilities (MREL) by 2022. CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 44 CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 44

The growth in our customer lending in the year has tempered the impacts of base rate cuts and, together 
with lower funding costs driven by active management of rates across the savings portfolio, has contributed 
to an increase in net interest income of £38m (4.7%). As average interest-bearing assets saw a similar 
increase, Group NIM similarly increased by 1bps to 2.27% (2016: 2.26%).
This was achieved in spite of rate pressures across the board, as a consequence of the base rate reduction 
in August 2016 and a corresponding fall in LIBOR rates, which together impacted 45% of the Group’s 
customer lending portfolio which is on a variable rate. The effects of these rate reductions combined with 
competition in the market continued to exert downward pricing pressure on the Group’s lending portfolio, 
with average yields reducing by 19bps to 2.85%. Conversely, average rates on interest-bearing liabilities 
reduced by 25bps to 0.75% as a result of the rate cuts, a shift in mix in the deposits portfolio and lower 
wholesale funding costs.
Non-interest income
Non-interest income reduced by £11m (6.0%), largely driven by a reduction in fees and commission income, 
principally in relation to insurance revenues from off-sale products which have continued to unwind, lower 
account fees on the Signature current account and lower home insurance profit share due to a higher level 
of claims, CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 45

Impairment losses on credit exposures
The increase in impairment charge, from £39m to £48m, reflects a modest increase in charges taken on 
our unsecured Retail portfolios together with impairment of a small number of individual SME exposures. 
The cost of risk has consequently increased by 5bps, but remains low reflecting the continuing benign

This year marked the first phase of the Group’s three-year efficiency programme, during which we 
demonstrated our ability to execute on our strategy with clear focus and at pace, and have set a strong 
foundation to deliver the next phase of savings in 2018.
We continued to improve our operational efficiency during the year through the restructuring and 
streamlining of our business. As our strategic initiatives gathered pace, the costs required to deliver the 
programme amounted to £67m in the year. These largely comprised property closure, redundancy and 
consultancy costs and arose in the main as we implemented our branch closure and voluntary severance 
programmes. We started to reap the benefits of these actions as the year progressed, and saw our full 
year underlying costs reduce by £54m (7%) from £729m to £675m, exceeding our FY2017 cost guidance 
of £690m–£700m. As a result, and combined with the increase in net interest income, our underlying cost 
to income ratio improved from 74% to 67% for the full year (61% for the second half).
During the year we implemented a new reward programme for colleagues across the business, including a 
revised pensions proposition. As part of these reforms, the Group closed the defined benefit pension scheme 
to future accrual on 1 August 2017, for the majority of current employees, with affected employees’ future 
benefits being provided through an enhanced defined contribution scheme. The closure of the Scheme 
resulted in the recognition of a past service credit of £88m.
On an underlying basis, personnel expenses reduced by £32m in line with headcount, which reduced from 
6,718 to 6,040
(1)
. Other operating and administrative expenses fell by £21m due to the impact of branch 
closures and tighter cost control across the board.
(1)  Based on average core FTEs during the year. Actual core FTEs were 5,739 as at 30 September 2017 (2016: 6,313). Core FTEs exclude 
legacy conduct FTEs. CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 46 CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 46
While our priorities have been focused on maximising efficiencies across the business, we have nevertheless 
sought to maintain investment in our key strategic priorities. During the year we invested heavily in 
significantly transforming the personal customer experience, through increasing online account opening 
capability, enhancing service functionality and releasing new applications across all brands. In addition, we 
continued to invest to ensure we remain compliant with our regulatory obligations, and in enhanced security, 
to maintain and strengthen the resilience of our operations. 
During the year the Group continued to make progress on removing its reliance on National Australia Bank 
(NAB) for certain processes and systems. Spend in the year in relation to separation costs was £8m 
(2016: £11m) and the Group is on track to exit all NAB services provided under Transitional Services 
Agreements by December 2018.

The Group continued to maintain its strong capital position throughout the year, delivering a fully loaded 
total capital ratio of 17.9% and CET1 ratio of 12.4% at September 2017. 
Underlying capital generation by the core business post AT1 distribution was 13bps, largely driven by 
strong underlying profits offset by growth in mortgages and SME lending and investment spend, with  
RWAs increasing by £649m. After absorbing the net impact of AT1 distributions, pension movements,  
and exceptional charges such as restructuring charges, separation costs and the Group’s proportion of 
conduct provision charges, the Group's CET1 ratio was 20bps lower at 12.4%.
During the year the Group reassessed the level of provision that was considered appropriate to meet current 
and future expectations in relation to the mis-selling of PPI policies and concluded that a further charge of 
£494m was required, incorporating the Group’s estimate of the impact of the Regulator’s policy statement 
issued on 2 March 2017 relating to a proposed time bar for complaints in August 2019. It also incorporated 
a reassessment of the costs of processing cases and the impact of experience adjustments. The Group also 
raised further provisions of £98m for other non-PPI conduct related matters. In aggregate, only 9.7% of the 
charge, or £58m, impacts the income statement as a result of the Capped Indemnity, and has absorbed 
27bps of capital in the year. 
Strengthening our capital base
The Group continually considers opportunities to further strengthen its capital base. The closure of the 
Scheme to future accrual for the majority of employees, coupled with the impact of the Scheme’s triennial 
valuation, resulted in a reduction in the Scheme deficit (on a trustee funding basis) from £450m to £290m.
In addition, the submission of our waiver application to the PRA requesting permission to apply IRB modelling 
in the calculation of credit risk RWAs marked a key milestone in our path to IRB accreditation.

The Group is working towards implementation of the requirement to meet the minimum requirements for 
own funds and eligible liabilities (MREL) on 1 January 2022, and issued £300m of senior bail-in debt in June 
as the first step to meeting this requirement. The BoE provided the Group’s MREL guidance, including 
transitional arrangements, in late 2016. An interim MREL requirement of 18% of RWAs has been set at the 
Group level from 1 January 2020 until 31 December 2021. The BoE will advise the Group on its ultimate 
MREL requirement in 2020. The Group expects to issue further senior debt gradually over the next four 
years to ensure compliance with MREL in 2022.
Reconciliation of statutory to underlying results
The underlying results presented within this Financial performance review reflect the Group’s results 
prepared on an underlying basis and as presented to the CEO and his Leadership Team and the Board. These 
exclude certain items that are included in the statutory results, as management believes that these items are 
not reflective of the underlying business and do not aid meaningful year-on-year comparison. The table 
below reconciles the statutory results to the underlying basis, and full details on the adjusted items are

Dear shareholder,
I am pleased to present our Corporate governance report for 
2017, our first full year since IPO. 
Your Board firmly believes that strong and effective corporate 
governance underpins our commitment to delivering a strong 
customer centric banking proposition in the UK and to generating 
sustainable returns for shareholders. The Board is focused on 
ensuring corporate governance is embedded across our business 
supporting better decision making and accountability. 
This report sets out our approach to governance in practice, the 
work of the Board in 2017 and includes reports from the Board’s 
four principal committees. 
Strategy
The Board’s role is to focus on the creation of long-term 
sustainable value for our shareholders. During the year the Board’s 
focus was on supporting the Executive Leadership Team to deliver 
the Group’s strategy. The Board spent considerable time in 2017 
exploring the challenges arising from the evolving external 
economic, political and regulatory environment to ensure the 
continued effective execution and delivery of our strategic 
priorities against this backdrop and ongoing competitive success. 
The Board held several strategy focused sessions which are 
described on pages 62 and 63 and ensured that appropriate risk 
monitoring and oversight was taking place with plans in place to 
mitigate the impact of principal risks as described on page 19 of 
the Strategic report. 
Culture
Our approach to culture and values is led by the Board which sets 
the tone from the top. The Board is committed to ensuring we 
continue to build a high performing culture which recognises that 
our colleagues are integral to our business success. During the 
year the Board supported the launch of our new Values and 
Behaviours and Great Leadership framework (described on page 
30) which underpin our commitment to deliver the right customer 
focused outcomes by encouraging colleagues to use their initiative, 
act with autonomy and to work together. 
The Board also spent time hearing about colleague feedback 
from our annual MyVoice survey which highlighted colleagues’ 
commitment to deliver a strong customer-focused culture. 
Governance
Chairman’s letter
 Strong and effective corporate 
governance underpins our business.  CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 51
Strategic report Governance Financial results Risk report Financial statements Additional information
The importance of a genuinely diverse and inclusive culture where 
every colleague and customer feels they belong is a core part of 
our Values and Behaviours. During the year the Board refreshed 
its diversity commitment to maintain a minimum of 25% female 
representation on the Board with a target to achieve 33% by 2020. 
The Board recognises the value in having a membership which 
reflects diversity in the widest sense and which represents a broad 
range of social perspectives. While we have not set any diversity 
target beyond gender we will take opportunities through the 
natural refreshing of the Board to consider a number of diversity 
factors, however, it will always be the case that appointments 
to the Board are based on merit and breadth and depth of skills 
and experience. 
Building stakeholder relationships 
Hearing from our stakeholders supports us in delivering our 
strategy and helps us focus on the things that are important 
to them. Our stakeholders include our customers, shareholders 
and colleagues in addition to government, regulatory bodies, 
our suppliers and wider society. This year the Board adopted a 
refreshed stakeholder engagement programme to broaden its 
reach among stakeholder communities and we will further develop 
this in 2018. During the year the Board, either collectively or 
individually, undertook site visits, met with customers and 
representatives from our wider communities and the Board now 
receives a formal stakeholder update on a regular basis. 
We engage with our shareholders through a calendar of meetings 
and events, including the AGM, and we use webcasting to allow all 
shareholders the opportunity to join the key meetings throughout 
the year. The Board is updated regularly on both retail shareholder 
and institutional investor feedback and my fellow Directors and I 
very much look forward to having the opportunity to meet with 
our shareholders at our 2018 AGM. 
Board changes
Richard Gregory retired from the Board on 10 January 2017. 
Clive Adamson became Chair of the Risk Committee in January 
2017 on Richard’s retirement and Tim Wade became Chair of the 
Audit Committee in November 2016. The structure, size and 
composition of the Board and its committees will continue  
to be kept under review in 2018. 
Board effectiveness
An important part of my role as Chairman is to ensure that the 
Board – both collectively and its individual members – operates 
effectively. This year the Board undertook its first externally 
facilitated performance evaluation since becoming a listed 
company. I am pleased to report that the key conclusion of the 
evaluation was that the Board and its committees are effective. 
The process and principal findings are described on pages 68 to 
70 of this report. The Board adopts a continuous improvement 
approach to its effectiveness with a focus on achieving best 
practice across all aspects of corporate governance. The Board 
will therefore keep its corporate governance arrangements 
under review through 2018 to ensure they adapt to changes 
in regulation or legislation and remain effective. 
Looking ahead 
The Board remains focused on executing the agreed strategy 
and delivering an exceptional customer experience and 
sustainable returns to our shareholders and will continue to 
strengthen the effectiveness of the corporate governance 
framework to support this. 
Finally, I would like to thank the Board and our colleagues for their 
support and commitment throughout 2017.

Statement of compliance
The Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 
30 September 2017 has been prepared in accordance with the 
UK Corporate Governance Code 2016 (‘Code’) which was issued 
in April 2016. The Code is publicly available at www.frc.org.uk. 
The Board confirms that the Company has applied the main 
principles and complied with the provisions of the Code.
The Group has also adopted the British Bankers‘ Association 
Code for Financial Reporting Disclosure, which is available at 
www.bba.org.uk, and the financial statements have been 
prepared in compliance with its principles.
Leadership
The Board is the principal decision-making body of the Group 
and is collectively responsible to shareholders for promoting 
the long-term success of the Company.
The Board’s role is to provide leadership to the business as a whole 
within a framework of prudent and effective controls which enable 
risk to be assessed and managed. It sets strategy and oversees its 
delivery and establishes its culture, values, ethics and standards. It 
sets the Group’s risk appetite, monitors operational and financial 
performance and reporting, ensures the Group is adequately 
resourced and has effective controls and remuneration policies, 
and that there are appropriate succession planning arrangements.
In order to assist the Board in carrying out its functions and to 
ensure that there is independent oversight of financial reporting, 
internal controls, risk management, governance and remuneration 
matters, the Board delegates certain clearly defined responsibilities 
to its four principal committees. Reports from the Governance 
and Nomination Committee, the Audit Committee and the Risk 
Committee are contained in this report. A report from the 
Remuneration Committee is included in the Directors’ 
remuneration report.
As required, the Board may also establish special purpose 
Committees to assist the Board in the oversight of specific areas 
that may require more detailed attention. The Board established 
a special purpose IRB and Credit IFRS 9 Committee to oversee 
the transition from a standardised approach to calculating capital 
requirements for credit risk to an IRB approach, and the 
implementation of the credit element of the IFRS 9 accounting 
standard which will be effective for the Group in the reporting 
period beginning 1 October 2018. During the year, the activities of 
the Committee included overseeing the submission of the Group’s 
application to the PRA for IRB accreditation and system changes 
covering critical delivery of IFRS 9 and stress testing to embed an 
advanced Credit Risk Management capability.
The chart on page 132 of the Risk report illustrates the Board and 
management structure as at 30 September 2017.
Matters reserved to the Board and delegated authorities
In order to retain control of key decisions and ensure there is a 
clear division of responsibilities at the head of the Company, the 
Board has identified certain ‘reserved matters’ that only it can 
approve. Other matters, responsibilities and authorities have been 
delegated to its committees and the Chief Executive Officer.
The matters reserved to the Board are set out in the Charter 
for the Board and this, as well as the Charters for each principal 
Board committee, is available to view on the Company’s website 
(www.cybg.com/about-us/corporate-governance). The Charters 
are also available on request from the Company Secretary at the 
Company’s registered office. During the year the Board and each 
of the Board committees reviewed its Charter.
The authorities delegated by the Board to the Chief Executive 
Officer are set out in the Delegation of Authority Framework.
Board and strategic planning
During the year the Board’s focus was on supporting executive 
management to deliver the Group’s strategy. The strategy 
communicated at our Capital Markets Day in September 2016 
is unchanged and the Board’s discussions throughout the year 
focused on overseeing delivery of the strategic priorities of 
sustainable customer growth, improved efficiency and capital 
optimisation. 
A key objective during the year was to deepen and embed the 
strategy to align with the evolving competitive, economic and 
regulatory environment with a focus on execution and de-risking 
delivery. As part of this process the Board was engaged in three 
in-depth strategic review and planning sessions with the 
management team and received regular updates on the initiatives 
under way to build core capabilities and support strategic delivery. 
During the first half of the year the areas of focus for the Board 
included discussing the impacts of the challenging external 
environment including the political uncertainty arising from the 
UK’s exit from the European Union and the potential for a second 
Scottish Independence Referendum. It was also updated on 
progress in transforming the distribution model and evolving 
channel capabilities, developments in building digital capability and 
improving customer service and the banking experience. Potential 
inorganic strategic opportunities, including Fintech partnerships, 
to achieve scale and asset growth and to capitalise on existing 
operational leverage were considered, as was performance against 
the target cost structure and our structured approach to cost 
reduction. The Board also monitored progress in delivering the 
refreshed people strategy, the simplification of the governance 
framework and on the cultural transformation to enable 
strategic delivery.

Strategic report Governance Financial results Risk report Financial statements Additional information
In the second half of the year the Board continued its review 
and discussion of strategic performance in the context of the 
economic, political and competitive environment. In addition 
the Board was deeply engaged in discussing the evolving UK 
banking landscape and the Group’s future participation choices. 
The Board also participated in an evaluation of the underpinning 
fundamentals of the strategy in the context of the market 
environment and considered different growth alternatives to 
increase value for investors. The Board also held a challenge 
session on potential inorganic opportunities and alignment with 
the Group’s strategic priorities and broader market dynamics. 
Each of these areas of strategic focus was informed by external 
insights and input which strengthened the debate. 
The Board also spent time considering updates from the Board 
committees which informed the Group’s strategy. 
The output of the review and planning sessions was a refreshed 
strategic and financial plan to be approved by the Board along with 
a revised RAS. During the process the Board considered very 
carefully the issues informing the strategic and financial plan to 
ensure that the business will be able to continue to drive sustained 
performance for the benefit of all stakeholders, to be monitored 
by the Board through a set of key performance indicators. 
Board attendance
The core activities of the Board were carried out in 11 scheduled 
meetings of the Board. Two additional ad hoc meetings of the 
Board were arranged when matters required to be brought to 
the Board’s attention or when decisions were required outside 
scheduled meetings.

Board activity
Setting the Board agenda
There is a comprehensive and continuous process in place for 
ensuring the Board has full and timely access to all relevant 
information in an insightful format.
The Chairman is responsible for setting the Board agenda and is 
assisted by the Chief Executive Officer and Company Secretary. 
The Board agenda is structured to ensure it covers each of the 
three strategic priorities and underpinning core capabilities to 
support strategy engagement and the challenge and debate on 
performance and delivery at Board level. The Chairman reviews 
the time allocation with the Company Secretary to ensure 
adequate time is allowed to discuss material matters. The Company 
Secretary keeps the Chairman informed of any agenda items 
requested by Non-Executive Directors. In order to carry out its 
work, a yearly planner is prepared by the Company Secretary to 
map out the flow of key items of business to the Board and to 
ensure that sufficient time at the meeting is provided for debate 
and challenge. Directors are sent papers for Board meetings up to 
five working days in advance of the meeting (whether they are able 
to attend or not) in order that they may have the time to consider 
the proposals put forward, seek clarification or, if required, request 
further information. CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 64
Governance
Corporate governance report
At each main meeting the Board discusses:
 – the Chief Executive Officer’s report – including performance 
against the strategic plan, key developments in the external 
environment, the economic outlook and impacts for the Group, 
business performance, product and proposition developments, 
stakeholder engagement and investor relations matters, 
material regulatory issues, and key matters relating to people, 
cultural and organisational transformation and capability;
 – the Chief Financial Officer’s report – including performance 
against the financial plan, key performance indicators, capital, 
liquidity and funding matters;
 – the Chief Operating Officer’s report – including delivery 
against customer service commitments, operational efficiency, 
IT service and security, and the status of major investment 
programmes; and
 – the Group Chief Risk Officer’s report – including the risk profile 
and risk categorisation and principal and emerging risks, key risk 
issues and RAS performance and trends.
How Board meetings are run
Prior to the start of a scheduled Board meeting, the Senior 
Independent Non-Executive Director meets with Non-Executive 
Directors (excluding the Chairman and then with the Chairman 
present) to discuss matters of concern or focus. Both the 
Chairman and the Senior Independent Non-Executive Director 
report to the Board on issues to be brought to the Board’s 
attention at the commencement of each meeting and these are 
recorded in the Board minutes. The Chairman ensures Board 
meetings are structured to facilitate open discussion, debate and 
challenge with dissenting views of Directors being freely expressed 
and discussed within the decision-making process, leading to Board 
decisions being made on a sound and well-informed basis. 
All Directors are expected to attend each Board meeting and 
committee meeting for which they are members, save for in 
exceptional circumstances. Reasons for non-attendance are 
generally unavoidable conflicts with prior business commitments, 
personal reasons or illness, and non-attendance must always be 
notified in advance to the Chairman, relevant committee Chair 
or the Company Secretary. In the rare event of a Director being 
unable to attend a meeting, he/she has the opportunity to discuss 
with, or notify, the Chairman, relevant committee Chair or the 
Company Secretary of any matters he/she wishes to raise and to 
follow up the decisions made at the meeting. The Chairman and 
Company Secretary, together with members of the Executive 
Leadership Team, are available to discuss issues relating to 
meetings or other matters with Directors.
During the year, the Chairman held a number of meetings 
with Non-Executive Directors without the Executive Directors 
being present.
Board committees
The Board delegates certain clearly defined responsibilities to 
its four principal Board committees, namely: the Governance 
and Nomination Committee; the Audit Committee; the Risk 
Committee; and the Remuneration Committee.
The committee Chairs report to the Board on the activities of 
the committees at each Board meeting. Each principal committee 
membership comprises Non-Executive Directors only and is 
chaired by an experienced Chair. Committee memberships are 
spread between the Non-Executive Directors, drawing on each

Deep dives and Board briefings
The Board has a programme of ‘deep dive’ sessions focusing 
on thematic updates aligned to the strategic priorities and core 
capabilities which give Directors the opportunity to engage with 
management in a more informal way outside of the structure of 
a Board meeting to gain insight on topics of interest or focus for 
the Board. Additionally the Board receives briefings on regulatory 
and corporate governance change. Listed below are the ‘deep dive’ 
topics and Board briefings during the year.
Deep dives
Mortgage market and performance
UK banking landscape and strategic update
Small and medium business segments

Stakeholder engagement
Directors, either collectively or individually, undertook site visits 
and met with customers and representatives from our wider 
communities. Site visits provide an opportunity to get closer to 
business operations, current issues and customer service in an 
operational environment. This provides insight into customer 
experiences and allows Directors to connect with management 
and colleagues alike. In April 2017, the Board visited Studio B, our 
new innovation lab in London which has been designed to inspire a 
new way of thinking that could shape the future of banking. It also 
visited the new flagship Customer Banking Centre in Edinburgh 
in July 2017, which has a modern design and facilities to reflect 
the new way in which the Group interacts with and serves its 
customers. In June, Directors met the winners of our annual 
Spirit of the Community Awards which are described in more 
detail on page 32.
Effectiveness
Board size and composition
The Board comprises a Non-Executive Chairman, three Executive 
Directors and eight independent Non-Executive Directors. The 
size of the Board is considered to be suitable in the context of a 
highly complex commercial and regulatory operating environment 
with the appropriate combination of Executive and Non-Executive 
Directors such that no individual or small group of individuals can 
dominate the Board’s decision making. The names of the Directors 
together with their full biographical details, including the skills 
and experience they each bring to the Board, are on pages 55 
to 59. Further details on the composition of the Board and 
independence of the Non-Executive Directors are provided in 
the Governance and Nomination Committee report on page 77.
Time commitments
The Board recognises that it is vital that Directors should be able 
to dedicate sufficient time to the Company to effectively discharge 
their responsibilities. The time commitment is considered by the 
Board on appointment and kept under review. The letters of 
appointment of the Chairman and of each of the Non-Executive 
Directors set out the minimum time commitment for their roles 
and that they undertake to allocate sufficient time to the Company 
as is necessary for the effective discharge of their duties.
The Chairman is expected to commit at least 60 days per year on 
Company business, the Deputy Chairman 45 days per year and 
Non-Executive Directors at least 35 days. Time commitment 
increases for other Board roles such as the Senior Independent 
Non-Executive Director and committee Chairs and for 
involvement in a committee as a member.
As described within the relevant sections of this Corporate 
governance report, the Non-Executive Directors’ preparation 
for and attendance at Board and committee meetings is only 
part of their role.
The other significant commitments of the Chairman and 
Non-Executive Directors are disclosed to the Board before 
appointment, with an indication of time involved. During the year, 
the Governance and Nomination Committee kept under review 
the number of external directorships held by each Director and 
considered the limits on the number of directorships which 
Directors may hold as a result of PRA Rulebook ‘General 
Organisational Requirements 5.4’ (having regard to General 
Organisational Requirements 5.5 and 5.6) and FCA Handbook 
Senior Management Arrangements, Systems and Controls (SYSC) 
4.3A.5R (having regard to SYSC 4.3A.6R and 4.3A.7R). Details of 
the Chairman’s other significant commitments are set out on page 
55. Details of the Non-Executive Directors’ other significant 
commitments are set out on pages 55 to 58. Any changes to the 
Non-Executive Directors’ time commitments were reported by 
the Governance and Nomination Committee to the Board. The 
Board is satisfied that each Non-Executive Director is able to 
devote sufficient time to their role. CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 67
Strategic report Governance Financial results Risk report Financial statements Additional information
Executive Directors are encouraged to take non-executive 
positions in other companies and organisations to broaden their 
experience. The appointment to such positions is subject to the 
approval of the Board which considers, in particular, the time 
commitment required.
Board changes
Richard Gregory, Senior Independent Non-Executive Director, 
retired from the Board on 10 January 2017.
Further details about the Group’s approach to succession planning 
and diversity can be found in the Governance and Nomination 
Committee report on page 77. Changes to committee 
memberships are set out on pages 76, 81 and 90.
Board independence
It is the Company’s policy that at least half the Board should be 
independent Non-Executive Directors. The Board assesses the 
independence of Directors on an annual basis following a review 
by the Governance and Nomination Committee. The Board 
considers each of its current Non-Executive Directors to be 
independent in character and judgement. The Chairman was 
considered independent on appointment. Further information 
is given in the Governance and Nomination Committee report 
on page 77.
Conflicts of interest
Pursuant to the Companies Act 2006, the Directors have a 
statutory duty to avoid situations in which they have or can have 
a direct or indirect interest in the Company, unless that interest is 
first authorised by the other Directors. This duty is in addition to 
the existing duty that a Director owes to the Company to disclose 
to the Board any transaction or arrangement under consideration 
by the Company. Prior to appointment, potential conflicts of 
interest are disclosed and assessed to ensure that there are no 
matters which would prevent the incoming Director from taking 
the appointment, and during their tenure Directors are asked to 
consult with the Company Secretary and the Chairman before 
taking up any external appointment or responsibilities. Any 
changes to the commitments of Directors are reported to the 
Governance and Nomination Committee and the Board. Directors 
are reminded, at each Board meeting, of their duty to report any 
actual or potential conflict as soon as they become aware of any 
such events. If any actual or potential conflict arises, the relevant 
Director will excuse himself/herself from any meeting or 
discussions where the potential conflicts are considered and all 
relevant material will be restricted including Board papers and 
minutes. A Director with a potential or actual conflict will not be 
permitted to form part of the quorum or vote upon the matter 
giving rise to the conflict. Directors do not participate in decisions 
concerning their own remuneration or interest. All potential 
conflicts authorised by the Board are recorded in a Register 
of Directors’ Conflicts of Interests which is reviewed by the 
Board annually.
Board induction
The Chairman ensures that each newly appointed Director 
receives a full and formal induction on joining the Board which is 
tailored to reflect a Director’s skills, experience and Board role. 
The Company Secretary designs and facilitates the induction 
programme having consulted with the Chairman and having 
regard to the particular needs of the new Director. Progress is 
reported to the Chairman and reviewed regularly by the Chairman 
with each Director. 
The aim of the induction programme is to quickly provide a new 
Director with an understanding of how the Group works and the 
key opportunities and challenges that it faces to enable them to 
contribute fully in Board and Committee meetings and covers at 
least the following: 
 – the Group and its strategy;
 – key business drivers of performance and the competitive 
environment and regulatory landscape in which the Group 
operates;
 – major strategic and investment programmes and priorities;
 – the key current and emerging risk issues and challenges for the 
business and risk appetite;
 – the organisational culture and capabilities, the role of the Board 
and its committees, and the Company’s corporate governance 
practices; and
 – training on the role and responsibilities of a Director, including 
statutory duties.
The induction programme is delivered through a combination of: 
one-to-one briefings with the Chairman, Company Secretary, 
current Directors and members of the Executive Leadership 
Team; site visits to some of the Group’s customer facing and 
operational areas; and reading materials including archive Board 
and committee papers and other key corporate governance 
documents. Meetings are also arranged with other selected 
senior managers, including the Group Director Internal Audit, 
and with external stakeholders including the External Auditor. 
Directors joining the Board to perform a specific role or holding a 
senior management function role, such as a committee Chair, are 
provided with additional in-depth training including meeting with 
the outgoing role holder or committee Chair where possible and 
completing a documented handover. Particular attention is given 
to the tailored components of the programme where a Director 
is appointed from outside the financial services sector or where a 
Director has not previously served on a UK listed company board. 
Directors who take on or change role during the year participate 
in an induction programme tailored to their new role. 
As described on page 68 the Board has in place a professional 
development and training programme which ensures that Director 
development continues after the initial induction programme has 
been completed.  CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 68
Governance
Corporate governance report
Professional development and training
Continuing professional development is an important aspect of a 
Director’s role. Skills and knowledge need to be kept up to date to 
ensure the effectiveness of the Board as a whole and allow every 
Director to contribute fully in Board and committee meetings. 
During the year the Board Development Programme was 
refreshed so as to provide a more structured approach. The Board 
Development Programme includes components covering: Board 
‘deep dive’ sessions (details on page 66); stakeholder engagement 
(see page 66); opportunities for wider stakeholder engagement in 
the community in which the Group operates; seminars, courses 
and roundtables to provide external insights on topical issues, 
technical briefings and peer group debates; and Board briefings 
(see page 66).
The Chairman reviews with each Non-Executive Director their 
individual training and development need and progress at regular 
one:one meetings.
The Company Secretary maintains a training and development log 
for each Director.
Board performance evaluation
During 2017, the Board engaged an external company, Advanced 
Boardroom Excellence, to facilitate the 2017 assessment of the 
effectiveness of the Board and of its committees. Advanced 
Boardroom Excellence is an independent consultancy with 
extensive experience undertaking evaluations for publicly listed 
companies and with no other connection to the Group. The review 
was led by Helen Pitcher, the Chairman of Advanced Boardroom 
Excellence, and took place between March and July 2017. 
The key conclusion of the evaluation was that the Board and 
committees operate effectively with a high degree of integrity and 
appropriate challenge and support. Significant progress has been 
made since the last external Board evaluation in 2015 before 
listing. Indeed the Board was recognised as having operated 
effectively to complete a successful demerger and IPO. The key 
theme from the review was therefore evolutionary development 
of the Board recognising the changes to both Board and Board 
Committee composition during 2016, the integration of new 
members which continued through 2017 and the transition 
to an independent publicly listed company. 
2017 review process
The Board performance evaluation was coordinated by the 
Company Secretary and Fiona MacLeod, a Non-Executive 
Director on the Governance and Nomination Committee, and 
overseen by the Governance and Nomination Committee. 
The Governance and Nomination Committee, with the support of 
the Board, agreed the themes to be assessed: use of Board time 
and efficiency of meetings; quality of the information received by 
the Board; the Board as a team; succession planning, induction and 
training; and depth of engagement on areas including strategy, risk 
and customer related topics. The evaluation was conducted against 
the Financial Reporting Council’s (FRC) best practice framework 
‘Guidance on Board Effectiveness March 2011’ which is publicly 
available at www.frc.org.uk
The 2017 process included various elements. 
2017 review process
 – Briefing between Advanced Boardroom Excellence, the 
Company Secretary and Fiona MacLeod during March to 
agree the scope, process and timetable for the review
 – Structured one:one meetings between Helen Pitcher and all 
Directors, in addition to senior leaders who regularly interface 
with the Board and Board committees
 – Observation of meetings of the Board, Audit Committee 
and Risk Committee
 – Facilitated roundtable discussions with the Governance 
and Nomination Committee and with the Remuneration 
Committee
 – Review of the Board and Board committee charters, papers 
and other key governance documentation
 – Draft discussion document discussed with the Governance 
and Nomination Committee in May
 – Presentation and facilitated discussion of key evaluation 
outcomes, led by Advanced Boardroom Excellence
 – Presentation by Advanced Boardroom Excellence to the 
Chair of each Board committee
 – Production of a final report of findings and recommendations
 – Agreement by the Board of the key areas of focus and 
continuous improvement actions for the future development 
of Board effectiveness CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 69
Strategic report Governance Financial results Risk report Financial statements Additional information
The approach was designed to facilitate and encourage open 
and constructive dialogue and the exchange of ideas and 
viewpoints between the reviewer and participants. As such, a 
tailored discussion guide was used to structure the one:one 
meetings held with each Director, the Company Secretary, 
Group General Counsel, Group Chief Risk Officer, Group Human 
Resources Director and Group Director Internal Audit. In the 
one:one meetings participants were asked for their views on 
the elements of Board effectiveness identified by the FRC. 
While a formal assessment of each individual Director was not 
sought due to the relatively short period the current Board 
composition had been in place, the process elicited a number 
of useful insights which were shared by the Chairman with 
each Non-Executive Director in his regular one:one meetings. 
A more formal assessment of individual Directors will be 
addressed in future years. 
Due to evolving corporate governance best practice and 
regulatory requirements impacting the remit of governance 
and nomination committees and remuneration committees, 
facilitated roundtable discussions were held with the Chair and 
members of the Governance and Nomination Committee and 
of the Remuneration Committee. This approach enabled the 
committees to openly discuss how their areas of focus could 
evolve over the next 12–24 months and what should be the 
principal areas of committee activity and priorities. 
The information gathered during the individual meetings, Board 
and committee observations, documentation review and 
roundtable discussions was independently reviewed by Helen 
Pitcher to produce an analysis of strengths, challenges, 
development opportunities and recommendations which was set 
out in a draft discussion document reviewed by the Governance 
and Nomination Committee. This was followed by a facilitated 
discussion with the Board at which Helen Pitcher presented the 
key outcomes of the evaluation and the Board agreed the key 
areas of focus and priority actions for the future development 
of Board effectiveness. 
In addition a report on the evaluation of each principal Board 
committee was produced and discussed with the Chair of each 
committee. The Senior Independent Non-Executive Director 
received a report on the Chairman which was shared with the 
Chairman individually and with the Non-Executive Directors 
without the Chairman being present. 
Principal findings
The conclusions of the 2017 review were positive and have 
confirmed that the Board and its committees operate effectively. 
A benchmark provided by Advanced Boardroom Excellence against 
a FTSE 100 comparator group (the Company is currently in the 
FTSE 250) showed a good balance of strengths and areas to 
further develop. The Board was found to be detailed in its 
governance, committed to its continuous improvement and 
development and showed a desire to achieve best practice on all 
fronts. The review recognised that the Board comprises a group 
of accomplished individuals. With a number of relatively new 
members at Executive Leadership Team and Non-Executive 
Director level there is a clear focus on further consolidating and 
building its own dynamic to become an even more integrated and 
effective team. It was recognised that the team dynamic had been 
well demonstrated at the successful IPO. 
The four key areas for the future development of the Board’s 
effectiveness were:
 – Board oversight – Increase the opportunities for engaging the 
full Board in evolving the Group’s strategy including developing 
the knowledge and insight of the whole Board and encouraging 
Directors to bring external insights; 
 – Board development and engagement – As the Board evolves it 
continues to focus on the development of the Board itself as 
a cohesive unit able to continue to challenge consistently and 
effectively while maximising the diversity of contribution, 
expertise and knowledge on the Board; 
 – Leadership role of the Board – Provide for greater engagement 
of the Board with broader stakeholder communities, including 
customers, in a more proactive and consistent way; and
 – Board planning – Continue to develop an efficient, effective 
and balanced governance support process including creating 
capacity for the Board to undertake reflective challenge and 
debate on strategic performance.  CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 70
Governance
Corporate governance report
Continuous improvement actions
The Board performance evaluation report from Advanced 
Boardroom Excellence sets out a series of recommendations 
that have been carefully considered by the Board. The Board has 
agreed a suite of priority actions aligned to the key areas for the 
future development of the Board’s effectiveness. Pleasingly a 
number of these actions had already been discussed and in some 
cases instigated by the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. It 
was positive to see these recommendations reinforced by external 
expert evaluation. The priority actions agreed by the Board 
include:
 – ensuring the already robust strategy process allows greater time 
for input, debate, challenge and discussion at the Board – prior to 
the evaluation the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer had 
agreed a full programme of Board engagement in relation to 
the FY2018-FY2022 strategic planning process. The Board 
performance evaluation added some helpful suggestions 
around seeking an even broader suite of external insights; 
 – reviewing the Board’s role in the process of both creating 
and monitoring culture and values to develop a programme of 
effective feedback to the Board – the Board is very engaged 
around the culture and values of the organisation. As agreed 
by the Board the Group Human Resources Director is working 
with the Governance and Nomination Committee and the 
wider Board to ensure a deep rooted and sustained Board 
role in culture and values going forward;
 – ensuring that work on executive succession and pipeline is integrated 
into the activities of the Governance and Nomination Committee and 
more widely shared with the Board – to this end the Governance 
and Nomination Committee has identified succession planning, 
including the Committee’s role in executive and senior 
management succession planning, as a further priority area 
of focus for 2018. The Board will review the senior talent and 
diversity, succession and development plans on an annual basis;
 – mapping in conjunction with Non-Executive Directors, 
a programme of external input to strengthen the debate 
and discussion on the key areas of the business strategy 
and transformation;
 – considering the development opportunities for the Board both from 
a business and Board dynamics perspective – the Board annual 
calendar will be refreshed to include more opportunities for the 
Board members to spend informal time together. The Chairman 
will continue to focus on further enhancing the strong Board 
culture and positive and constructive relations between the 
Directors as a collective and between the Board and the 
Executive Leadership Team;
 – focusing specifically on further developing the Board members into 
a coherent, collective, innovative strategic oversight team – the 
Board agenda has been restructured as recommended by 
Advanced Boardroom Excellence to provide more agenda 
space for effective debate and challenge at Board meetings 
on topics such as strategy, culture and stakeholder, including 
colleague, engagement; and
 – providing the broader executive team with the opportunity to align 
with the Board more closely – the Chairman will encourage all 
Non-Executive Directors to have more one:one time with the 
members of the Executive Leadership Team (not limited to 
those members who are Executive Directors on the Board) 
with progress to be discussed during the Chairman’s regular 
scheduled one:one meetings with each Non-Executive Director 
and recorded on their individual training and development plan. 
Follow up
The Chairman and Board very much regard the Board 
performance evaluation as an opportunity for continuous 
improvement, not a one-off event. 
The Governance and Nomination Committee, with the support 
of the Company Secretary, prepared a detailed action plan 
incorporating the priority actions agreed by the Board and 
addressing the other recommendations agreed by the Board 
to be taken forward. 
The Governance and Nomination Committee will coordinate the 
implementation of the actions which will be fully owned across 
the Board and all Board committees. 
Information and support
The Board has processes in place to ensure that it is supplied in a 
timely manner with information in a form and of a quality to enable 
it to effectively discharge its duties. The Chairman, through the 
Company Secretary, is responsible for ensuring communication 
flows between the Board and its committees with the support of 
the Executive Directors and management, and ensures that this 
information is of high quality in terms of its currency, clarity, 
accuracy, appropriateness and comprehensiveness. All Directors 
have access to the advice of the Company Secretary in relation to 
the discharge of their duties and matters of governance. Directors 
are able to seek clarification or further detail from management 
where necessary. The Company Secretary is also responsible for 
facilitating communications with shareholders, as appropriate, and 
ensuring due regard is paid to their interests. All Directors are 
provided with sufficient resources to undertake their duties. In 
appropriate circumstances, Directors may obtain, at the Group’s 
expense, independent professional advice where they judge it 
necessary to discharge their responsibilities as Directors. The 
appointment and removal of the Company Secretary is a matter 
reserved for the Board as a whole.

Internal control
Board responsibility
The Board is responsible for the Group’s systems of internal 
control. The internal control framework is designed to facilitate 
effective and efficient operations, ensure a high quality of internal 
and external reporting, and ensure compliance with applicable laws 
and regulations. The Directors and management are committed to 
maintaining a robust control framework as the foundation for the 
delivery of effective risk management. Owing to the limitations 
inherent in any internal control framework, the controls have been 
designed to manage and mitigate, rather than eliminate, the risk of 
failure to achieve the Group’s business objectives and can provide 
only reasonable, not absolute, assurance against material 
misstatement or loss. The Directors acknowledge their 
responsibilities in relation to the Group’s internal control 
framework and for reviewing its effectiveness.
The Board confirms that throughout the year ended 
30 September 2017 and up to the date of approval of this Annual 
Report and Accounts, there have been rigorous processes in place 
to identify, evaluate and manage the principal risks faced by the 
Group, including those that would threaten its business model, 
future performance, solvency or liquidity, the likelihood of a risk 
occurring and the costs of control in accordance with the 
Guidance on Risk Management, Internal Control and Related 
Financial and Business Reporting published by the FRC.
In order to assist in the identification and management of the 
principal risks, the Board has established an RMF which is 
integrated into the Group’s overall framework for risk governance 
and has developed a system of regular reports from management. 
The Board has authorised the Risk Committee to oversee the 
Group’s compliance with the Board’s approved RAS, RMF and risk 
culture. Further details can be found in the Risk report on pages 
127 to 175.
Reviews by the Board
The effectiveness of the risk management and internal control 
systems is reviewed regularly by the Risk Committee and the Audit 
Committee, including an annual review. The Risk Committee is 
responsible for providing oversight and advice to the Board in 
relation to current and potential future risk exposures. The Audit 
Committee assists the Board in discharging its responsibilities 
with regard to external and internal audit activities and controls 
including reviewing audit reports, internal controls and risk 
management systems.
The Group’s risk management and internal control systems are 
regularly reviewed by the Board and are consistent with the 
guidance on Risk Management, Internal Control and Related 
Financial and Business Reporting issued by the FRC and compliant 
with the requirements of the Capital Requirements Directive IV 
(CRD IV). They have been in place for the year under review and up 
to the date of the approval of the Annual Report and Accounts.
Control effectiveness
A review of the effectiveness of controls is regularly undertaken 
across the Group, providing an assessment and statement on the 
effectiveness of the Group’s control environment. This provides 
assurance to the Risk Committee that no new material control 
issues have been identified and that robust management actions 
are in place to address specific known gaps.
Overall assessment
Over the past year, the Group has further enhanced the RMF, 
simplifying and improving the risk categories and impact 
classification. The control environment remains stable with the 
2017 Control Effectiveness Statement providing assurance that 
ineffective controls are escalated appropriately and have adequate 
action plans in place.
The Risk Committee, in conjunction with the Audit Committee, 
concluded that the Group’s risk management and internal control 
framework in relation to the Group’s risk profile and strategy was 
effective and adequate, and was recommended to and approved 
by the Board.
Bribery and corruption
In compliance with the Bribery Act 2010, the Group has in place 
risk assessments, policies and guidelines on interacting with 
customers, suppliers and agents, including specific policies for gifts 
and hospitality. Certain Senior Managers are required to assess 
money laundering risks and the adequacy of related internal 
controls within their areas of responsibility on an ongoing basis. 
Formal anti-bribery and corruption training is required for all 
colleagues, the Executive Leadership Team and Directors.
Remuneration

Shareholder relationships
The Board recognises the need for a programme of engagement 
which offers all shareholders opportunities to receive information 
from the Company and enables them to share their views with 
the Board. In addition, the Board regularly receives feedback on 
shareholder sentiment and sell side analyst views of the Group 
and the wider industry.
The Board is committed to ensuring that there are effective 
channels of communication with the Company’s shareholders. 
The Group’s website enables access to documents and 
communications as soon as they are published, including 
recordings of webcasts and other analyst presentations.
Relationships with institutional investors
Engagement with institutional investors (both existing and 
potential investors) took place throughout the year, in order to 
update the market on our progress against the Group’s long-term 
strategy and recent financial performance. Investor roadshows 
were held in key geographic locations reflecting the nature of 
the Company’s institutional ownership and were attended by 
an appropriate mix of Directors and included the Chairman, 
the Deputy Chairman and Senior Independent Non-Executive 
Director and the Chief Executive Officer. 
The Board receives regular feedback on share price performance, 
investor and analyst views and changes to the shareholder register 
via regular monthly reports, a quarterly detailed investor relations 
update and ad hoc intelligence.
Relationships with retail shareholders
The Company Secretary oversees communication with retail 
shareholders and provides feedback to the Board and appropriate 
committees to ensure the views of retail shareholders are received 
and considered.

Small holding sale facility
In May 2017, the Company announced the launch of a sale facility 
for eligible holders (including shareholders and CDI holders) for 
small holdings, defined in the Company’s Articles of Association as 
a holding of shares with an aggregate market value of less than 
A$500 based on the closing price of a CHESS Depository Interest 
(CDI) on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX). This facility 
provided eligible shareholders with an easy and cost-effective way 
to sell all of their shares and enabled the Group to reduce the 
ongoing costs associated with administering the security registers. 
The sale facility closed on 28 June 2017 at which point 5,187,747 
shares were sold pursuant to the facility which had been held by 
139,846 eligible holders representing 0.59% of the total issued 
share capital of the Company at the time.

The annual general meeting
Shareholders are invited to attend the Company’s 2018 annual 
general meeting (AGM), to be held at 10am (GMT) on Wednesday 
31 January 2018 at the offices of Pinsent Masons LLP, 30 Crown 
Place, Earl Street, London, EC2A 4ES, United Kingdom, when they 
will have the opportunity to engage directly with Directors, who 
will be available to answer any shareholder questions. Facilities are 
also available for shareholders to cast their votes electronically, 
or by post. All resolutions at the 2018 AGM will be voted on a poll. 
The procedure for voting on a poll follows best practice and allows 
the Company to count all votes rather than just those of the 
shareholders attending the meeting.
The resolutions to be proposed at the AGM, together with 
explanatory notes, are set out in a separate Notice of AGM which 
accompanies this Annual Report and Accounts and is on the 
Company’s website (www.cybg.com). The Notice of AGM is 
circulated to all shareholders at least 20 working days before 
such meetings and it is the Company’s policy not to combine 
resolutions. As recommended by the Code, all resolutions to be 
proposed at the 2018 AGM will be voted on separately and the 
voting results will include all votes cast for, against and those 
withheld, together with all proxies lodged before the meeting. 
A vote withheld will not be a vote in law and will not be used in 
calculating the votes for or against a resolution. Details of the 
proxy votes cast will be made available on the Company’s website 
as soon as is reasonably practicable after the meeting, by means 
of an announcement on the securities exchanges to which the 
Company is listed and on the Company’s website www.cybg.com. 
In the opinion of the Board, where the situation arises that a 
significant proportion of votes have been cast against a resolution 
at any general meeting, the Company will explain, when 
announcing the results of voting, what action it intends to take 
to understand the reasons behind the result of the vote. CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 74
Dear shareholder,
As Chairman of the Board and Chairman of the Governance and 
Nomination Committee, I am pleased to present the report on the 
Committee’s activity during 2017.
The Committee’s role is to regularly review the structure, size and 
composition of the Board having regard to the balance of skills, 
experience, knowledge, independence and diversity on the Board. 
It is also responsible for developing and maintaining a formal, 
rigorous and transparent procedure for identifying and nominating 
for approval by the Board, candidates to fill Board and committee 
vacancies when they arise. The Committee also: reviews the 
succession plans at Board and Executive level; leads the process 
for the periodic evaluation of the performance and effectiveness 
of the Board, committees and individual Directors; and makes 
recommendations to the Board to ensure that the Group’s 
corporate governance arrangements are consistent with best 
practice and good corporate governance standards.
During 2017, the Committee spent considerable time overseeing 
the annual performance evaluation of the Board and its 
committees which this year was externally facilitated by Advanced 
Boardroom Excellence. I am grateful to Fiona MacLeod who led 
the process on behalf of the Committee and the Board. The 
evaluation approach, process followed, principal areas of 
development and priority actions agreed by the Board are 
described on pages 68 to 70 of the Corporate governance report. 
I am pleased to confirm that the key conclusion of the evaluation 
was that the Board and its committees operate effectively with 
significant progress made since the last external Board evaluation 
which was undertaken in 2015 in advance of the demerger and 
IPO. Since the completion of the review the Governance and 
Nomination Committee has overseen the preparation and 
implementation of a detailed action plan incorporating the priority 
actions agreed by the Board and has kept the Board informed 
of progress.

Strategic report Governance Financial results Risk report Financial statements Additional information
As part of the annual performance evaluation, the Governance 
and Nomination Committee held a facilitated roundtable session 
with Advanced Boardroom Excellence to discuss openly how the 
Committee wanted to evolve its role consistent with best practice 
for listed company governance and nomination committees. 
Following the IPO, the focus of the Committee in 2016 and early 
2017 was principally on succession planning and refreshing 
capability and composition of the Board and its committees. 
Having taken time to both fully reflect and to look ahead, the 
Committee has now agreed its principal areas of activity and 
priorities for 2018 as follows:
 – evaluation of the skills, knowledge and experience on the Board 
particularly with regard to longer-term requirements and to 
inform future Board composition; 
 – succession planning, including the Committee’s role in executive 
and senior management succession planning, which is an area 
of growing shareholder and regulatory interest; 
 – developing the Committee’s and Board’s role in the areas of 
talent management and leadership development;
 – agreeing the Committee’s and Board’s role in supporting 
management with the cultural transformation and diversity 
and inclusion agendas; and 
 – improving Director training and development. 
In the year ahead, the Committee will continue to monitor the 
needs of the Board, its committees and the longer-term leadership 
of the business by ensuring that succession plans align to, and keep 
pace with, the strategic goals of the Group. The Committee will 
continue to oversee the effectiveness of the corporate 
governance arrangements, particularly the impacts of corporate 
governance reforms, and will continue to monitor the 
implementation of the actions agreed by the Board following the 
performance evaluation of the Board and of its committees.

Membership and meetings
The current members of the Committee are: 
Jim Pettigrew, Chair
David Bennett 
Fiona MacLeod
The Committee is chaired by the Chairman of the Board and the 
members of the Committee are Independent Non-Executive 
Directors, in accordance with the provisions of the Code. If a 
matter were to concern the Chairman, then he would leave the 
meeting and the remaining members would elect one of their 
number to take the Chair, unless the Chairman had designated 
a member to do so.
The Chief Executive Officer attends meetings at the invitation 
of the Committee. The Group Human Resources Director also 
attends meetings at the invitation of the Committee, particularly 
when it is considering Executive succession planning matters.
Members of the Committee took no part in any discussions 
concerning their own membership of the Board or appointment 
as a Chair of a committee.
Committee attendance
The core activities of the Committee were carried out in four 
scheduled meetings of the Committee. One additional ad hoc 
meeting was arranged for decisions required outside scheduled 
meetings. The table below shows the Committee members during 
the year to 30 September 2017 and their attendance at scheduled

Committee role and responsibilities
During the year, the Committee revised its Charter which sets out 
the role and responsibilities of the Committee. The Charter of the 
Committee can be found on the Company’s website 
www.cybg.com/about-us/corporate-governance/
Committee performance evaluation
The independent, externally facilitated Board Performance 
Evaluation carried out during the year included an assessment 
of the Committee’s effectiveness. The review identified that 
the Committee Charter reflected best practice and that the 
responsibilities of the Committee set out in the Charter were 
consistent with the Code. A key finding was that the Committee 
needs to reflect on its responsibilities and to set its objectives and 
priorities for the year and agree the processes by which it will fulfil 
its responsibilities. The Committee has now agreed its priorities, as 
set out on page 75, and is developing a work plan to address these 
priorities in addition to its wider Charter responsibilities. The 
Committee’s calendar of meetings has been refreshed to allow for 
better planning and to ensure the Committee’s workload is spread 
across the calendar year. 
Matters considered and actions taken  
by the Committee
The significant matters addressed by the Committee during the 
year ended 30 September 2017 and in evaluating the 2017 Annual 
Report and Accounts are described in the following pages. CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 77

Role of the Committee Key matters considered and actions completed
Board and Board committee 
composition
Membership of the Board and the 
current and future composition  
of its committees
 – Reviewed the structure, size and composition of the Board and Board committees 
including skills, experience, independence, knowledge and diversity and considered the 
longer-term succession of Board and committee members relative to tenure, mix and 
diversity of skills and the Group’s strategy, future challenges and opportunities; reported 
the outcome and recommendations to the Board; 
 – Reviewed the time commitment including external appointments of serving Directors;
 – Undertook the annual review of the Conflicts of Interests Register; and
 – When considering the recruitment of a new Director, the Committee adopts a formal, 
rigorous and transparent procedure with due regard to diversity, including gender. 
Before commencing the recruitment process, the Committee evaluates the balance of 
skills, knowledge, experience, independence and diversity on the Board and, in light of 
this evaluation, prepares a description of the role and capabilities required. In identifying 
suitable candidates, the Committee:
 – uses open advertising or the services of external advisers to facilitate the search;
 – considers candidates from different genders and a wide range of backgrounds;
 – considers candidates on merit and against objective criteria ensuring that appointees 
have sufficient time to devote to the position, in light of other potential significant 
positions; and
 – engages from time to time with the Group’s major shareholders in future skills 
requirements and ideas for potential candidates.
Skills and independence – Assessed the independence of Non-Executive Directors having regard to both the 
Code requirements on independence and factors such as length of tenure and the 
ability of Non-Executive Directors to objectively challenge the Executive, free from 
relationships or circumstances which are likely to affect, or could appear to affect, the 
Director’s judgement. The Committee also took account of any relationships that had 
been disclosed and authorised by the Board. Based on the assessment for 2017 the 
Committee is satisfied that, throughout the year, all Non-Executive Directors remained 
independent as to both character and judgement and that Jim Pettigrew, the Board 
Chairman, was considered independent on appointment. At least half the Board 
comprised independent Non-Executive Directors; and 
 – Recommended to the Board the re-election of all Directors.
Executive succession planning and 
talent management
 – Had an update from and discussion with the Group Human Resources Director on the 
succession plan for the Executive Leadership Team and their direct reports; and
 – Had an update from and discussion with the Group Human Resources Director on the 
Group’s talent management framework and talent pool and the opportunities for Board 
engagement in talent management and leadership development.
Diversity and inclusion – The Board recognises the value of achieving diversity on the Board and throughout the 
Group. Although new appointments are based on merit, careful consideration is given 
to the benefits of improving and complementing the diversity, skills, experience and 
knowledge of the Board. The Board recognises and is committed to creating the 
conditions that foster talent for women to achieve their full potential by building strong 
female representation at Board level, Executive Leadership Team level and throughout 
the Group. During the year the Committee reviewed and recommended to the Board 
an updated Board Inclusion and Diversity Policy Statement to include a target of 33% 
female representation on the Board by 2020, achieved through the natural cycle of 
Board renewal. It is also the Board’s intention to broaden diversity on the Board beyond 
gender diversity alone, to reflect the communities in which the Group operates and 
serves. As at 30 September 2017, there were three female Directors (25%) on the Board. CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 78

Audit Committee report
 The Audit Committee has fulfilled its 
responsibilities to ensure the integrity 
and quality of the Group’s financial 
reporting. 
Dear shareholder,
As Chair of the Audit Committee, I am pleased to present the 
report from the Committee for the year ended 30 September 
2017. I became the Chair of the Committee on 23 November 
2016, having been a member since 12 September 2016. I would 
like to thank David Bennett, my predecessor as Interim Chair, for 
his invaluable guidance and insight to me as incoming Chair.
Highlights in 2017
During the year, the Audit Committee has fulfilled its 
responsibilities and met its key objectives, by overseeing financial 
reporting, including the adequacy of related disclosures as well as 
reviewing internal controls and the effectiveness of both internal 
and external audit. The Committee is comprised of independent 
Non-Executive Directors. 
The Committee continued to exercise its responsibilities for 
ensuring the integrity and quality of the Group’s financial reporting 
and spent considerable time reviewing the Group’s financial results. 
It questioned management robustly on a number of key 
accounting judgements relevant to the financial statements, 
including a focus on impairment losses on loans and advances, 
PPI redress provision and other conduct matters, deferred tax 
assets, retirement benefit obligations and fair value of financial 
instruments (full details are contained on pages 82 to 84 of this 
Report). The Committee has focused closely on the analysis 
underpinning the ongoing Going Concern test, the longer-term 
Viability Assessment, and in particular, the presentation of the 
Annual Report and Accounts in a way that makes them Fair, 
Balanced and Understandable.
The Group continues to enhance its control environment. The 
Committee, utilising its independent perspective, challenged 
constructively the operation of the Group’s Three Lines of 
Defence model in relation to the Group’s internal controls which is 
essential to ensure risks are appropriately managed and mitigated. 
The Committee has worked closely with the Risk Committee in 
this process.
The Committee continued to oversee the performance 
and effectiveness of internal and external audit, the main 
independent assurance mechanisms that serve to protect 
shareholders’ interests. CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 80

Governance
Audit Committee report
The Group Director Internal Audit provided regular updates to 
the Committee on enhancements made during the year to the 
Internal Audit function, following on from Deloitte LLP’s external 
quality assessment of the Internal Audit Function in 2016. These 
included a refresh of the Internal Audit strategy to align to the 
Group’s strategy and clearly link the Internal Audit work to the 
key drivers of success for the Group.
Having considered feedback from stakeholders, peer benchmarking 
analysis, results of quality assessments and the Internal Audit 
reports provided to the Committee, it was concluded that Internal 
Audit activities were effective.
The Committee closely monitored the external audit process and 
the performance of the External Auditor, EY, through an annual 
effectiveness review against four themes in line with the FRC 
guidance: judgement; mindset and culture; skills, character and 
knowledge; and an assessment of quality control. The Committee 
considered the review and concluded in terms of the themes 
assessed that the external audit process was effective.
Committee performance evaluation
The independent, externally facilitated Board Performance 
Evaluation carried out during the year included an assessment 
of the Committee’s effectiveness. Overall, the Committee was 
assessed as effective. Further details are provided in this report.
Looking ahead
The report sets out the areas the Committee focused on in 2017. 
Many of these areas will again be areas of focus for the Committee 
in 2018. In particular the Committee will monitor the application 
of the Three Lines of Defence Model, assess the Internal Audit 
oversight of the IRB project, and continue to provide oversight of 
the implementation of the new financial instruments accounting 
standard IFRS 9, which will be effective for the Group in the 
reporting period beginning 1 October 2018.

David Browne 
Dr Teresa Robson-Capps 
The Committee comprises five Independent Non-Executive 
Directors. Tim Wade, Chair, has recent and relevant accounting 
and audit experience for the purposes of the Code, having held a 
number of senior finance roles. The other Committee members 
have significant current or recent experience in the financial 
services and banking industries (details of which are contained

In addition to the Committee members, the Chairman, Chief 
Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Group Head of Finance, 
Group Chief Risk Officer, Company Secretary, Group General 
Counsel, Group Director Internal Audit and the External Auditor 
are invited to attend Committee meetings. The Chair is also a

Private sessions are held with the External Auditor and Group 
Director Internal Audit at alternate Committee meetings to 
provide additional opportunity for open dialogue and feedback 
without management being present. The Chair of the Committee 
also meets with the Group Director Internal Audit and the Senior 
Statutory Auditor outside the formal Committee process at 
regular intervals throughout the year.
Alignment with Risk Committee
The Committee recognises the common interest in issues relevant 
to both the Risk Committee and Audit Committee and in particular 
the responsibilities of both in relation to the effectiveness of 
internal control. Joint discussions by both committees for the 
financial year ended 30 September 2017 included: progress made 
towards the implementation of IFRS 9; the Company’s fraud and 
money laundering controls; assurance plans from the Three Lines 
of Defence; the Viability Statement; and bonus risk adjustments 
and metrics to be recommended to the Remuneration Committee. 
To support the coordination of information between the 
committees, the Chairs of each of the Audit and Risk Committees 
are members of both committees. The Audit Committee and Risk 
Committee also hold at least one joint meeting per year. 
Committee attendance
The core activities of the Committee were carried out in six 
scheduled meetings of the Committee. Two additional ad hoc 
meetings were arranged for decisions required outside scheduled 
meetings. The table below shows the Committee members during

Committee performance evaluation
The Committee’s performance was reviewed as part of the 
independent, externally facilitated Board Performance Evaluation 
during the year which included an assessment of the Committee’s 
effectiveness. Overall, the Committee was assessed as effective. 
The key area for development related to ensuring that the 
Charters for the Audit and Risk committees were reviewed to 
mitigate duplications and overlaps. This was an action already 
identified by both committees.
As part of a handover to Tim Wade on his appointment as Chair 
of the Committee, the new Chair set out his priorities for the 
Committee and these priorities have been incorporated into the 
Committee’s annual work plan and informed the Committee’s 
agenda throughout the coming year. CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 82

Audit Committee report
Matters considered and actions taken by the Committee
The significant matters addressed by the Committee during the financial year ended 30 September 2017 and in evaluating the 2017 
Annual Report and Accounts are described in the following pages.
Role of the Committee Key matters considered and actions completed
Accounting, tax and financial reporting
To review the appropriateness  
of the Company’s financial statements, 
including the content of the Interim 
Financial Report, Annual Report and 
Accounts, and related Preliminary 
Results Announcements, Interim and 
quarterly results announcements and 
supporting analyst presentations.
 – Understood the process for the production of the reports under the remit of the Chief 
Financial Officer and the level of involvement of cross-functional subject matter experts, 
including monitoring the procedures in place to ensure that all contributors attested to 
the completeness, accuracy and appropriateness of the disclosures provided.
Accounting policies and practices
To review the critical accounting 
policies, disclosure obligations and 
changes in accounting requirements.
 – Reviewed with both management and the External Auditor critical accounting estimates 
and judgements, significant accounting policies and disclosures for the Group’s financial 
statements during the year; and
 – Received regular updates from the Group Accounting Policy team and External Auditor 
on key developments in financial reporting requirements. In particular, deep dives were 
presented on the Group’s readiness to implement IFRS 9 to be adopted by the Group 
from 1 October 2018.
Significant issues and areas of judgement
To consider where necessary, the actions, estimates and judgements of management.
Impairment losses on loans 
and advances
The Group’s loans and advances are 
subject to impairment losses, which 
are measured as the difference 
between the asset’s carrying amount 
and the present value of the 
estimated future cash flows 
discounted at the asset’s original 
effective interest rate.
The process of calculating the 
collective loan loss provision requires 
the use of significant estimates and 
judgements over the following: 
estimating the probability of default 
and estimates of future recoveries in 
Base Models; Model Risk Reserves; 
and the use of overlays.
 – Reviewed regular reports from management in relation to impairment provisioning, with 
the key focus being on collective provisioning for SME lending where the judgemental 
element is most significant;
 – Reviewed and challenged the inputs and resulting output of the base models, with 
a particular focus on probabilities of default and the estimate of future recoveries;
 – Reviewed and challenged the level of overlays included within the collective provision 
and the rationale behind the requirement for overlays to be held that augment the 
collective provisioning modelled output; and
 – Agreed that the judgements were appropriate at 30 September 2017. 
The disclosures relating to impairment provisions are set out in note 3.6 to the financial 
statements and in the Risk report from page 137. CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 83
Strategic report Governance Financial results Risk report Financial statements Additional information
Role of the Committee Key matters considered and actions completed
PPI redress provision and other conduct 
related matters
The level of provisions required for 
both redress and administration in 
relation to past conduct related 
matters requires assumptions to 
be made that are based upon a 
combination of historical data 
and management judgement. 
These judgements are inherently 
complex as they involve making 
estimates based on multiple factors 
that incorporate expectations of 
future customer behaviour, the 
impact of regulatory rule making and 
the application of precedent from the 
Financial Ombudsman Service.
 – Reviewed and challenged the assumptions made by management when determining the 
level of provisions required for PPI and other conduct related matters;
 – Reviewed in detail proposals in relation to PPI and other conduct scenarios (including 
potential redress and administrative costs) presented by management which reflected 
alternative potential outcomes before concluding on the £190m provision increase 
recorded in March 2017 and the £403m increase recorded in September 2017. Under 
the terms of the Conduct Indemnity Deed in place with NAB, the impact of this on the 
Group income statement was £58m;
 – Considered the continued impact of Plevin together with PS17/3 issued in March 2017 
relating to the August 2019 time bar for PPI complaints. Based upon the most recent 
information the Committee concluded that the assumptions used by management  
were supportable and that the PPI provisions recorded at 30 September 2017 were 
appropriate; and
 – Based upon the most recent information the Committee concluded that management 
assumptions were supportable and that the other related conduct provisions recorded 
at 30 September 2017 were appropriate.
The disclosures relating to provisions for conduct matters and the impact of the Conduct 
Indemnity Deed are set out in note 3.14.
Deferred tax assets
The largest elements of the Group’s 
deferred tax asset are historic losses 
and capital allowances. 
In determining that the deferred tax 
asset balance remains on the balance 
sheet, management has exercised 
judgement over the forecast future 
profitability of the Group; and the 
number of years over which to take 
account of future profits, i.e. the 
period over which profits can be 
reliably estimated.
 – Reviewed the recoverability of deferred tax assets throughout the year;
 – Considered the judgements made by management over the forecast future profitability 
of the Group and the time horizon over which the use of tax losses was foreseeable in 
light of the continuing and progressively tightening restrictions on their use; and
 – Agreed that the recognition of a deferred tax asset balance of £154m at  
30 September 2017 was appropriate.
The disclosures relating the Group’s deferred tax asset position as at 30 September 2017 
are set out in note 3.11.
Retirement benefit obligations
The actuarial valuation of the Group’s 
defined benefit scheme liabilities 
involves making several financial and 
demographic assumptions, including: 
discount rate; future inflation rates; 
and future mortality rates.
 – Reviewed the discount and inflation rate assumptions proposed by management at 
30 September 2017 against a benchmark range provided by the external adviser and 
concurred with these key assumptions; and
 – Considered the mortality assumptions which were reflective of the position reported 
at the recent Triennial Review by the Scheme actuary.
The disclosures relating the Group’s retirement benefit obligations at 30 September 2017 
are set out in note 3.16. CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 84
Governance
Audit Committee report
Role of the Committee Key matters considered and actions completed
Fair value of financial instruments
Significant management judgement is 
required for Level 3 measurements, 
as one or more inputs are 
unobservable. The most significant 
Level 3 asset is the Fair Value Loan 
Portfolio, where management 
exercises significant judgement over 
future expectation of credit losses, 
through the application of a Credit 
Risk Adjustment (CRA).
 – Reviewed the judgement made by management and concurred with the level of CRA 
applied at 30 September 2017.
The disclosures relating the Group’s fair value loan portfolio and fair value measurements 
at 30 September 2017 are set out in notes 3.3 and 3.18 respectively.
The Committee considered management’s review of the disclosed critical accounting estimates and judgements. The Committee 
concluded that, with the exception of the consideration of the carrying value of the Company’s investment in Clydesdale Bank PLC 
which was not a critical estimate or judgement as at 30 September 2017 as there was no evidence that the asset was impaired, 
no changes were required to these in the 2017 Annual Report and Accounts.
The Committee considered whether critical estimates and judgements were involved in a number of other areas, including the 
effective interest rate method of accounting (Note 2.2) and the capitalisation and impairment of intangible assets (Note 3.10).  
The Committee concluded that the impact of the sensitivity of judgement in these areas was low and consequently they were  
not critical estimates or judgements.
Going concern – Reviewed and challenged the going concern assessment undertaken by management 
including evidence of the Group’s capital, liquidity and funding position and confirmed to 
the Board that it was appropriate for the Group’s financial statements to be prepared on 
a going concern basis.
Long-term viability – Reviewed and challenged the viability assessment (including the three year time horizon 
selected) undertaken by management in the 2017 Annual Report and Accounts. The 
Committee considered the process to support the viability statement in conjunction 
with an assessment of principal risks and strategy/business model disclosures, taking  
into account the assessment by the Risk Committee of stress testing results and risk 
appetite. The Committee recommended the draft viability statement (as set out on page 
125) to the Board for approval.
Assessment of the fair, balanced and 
understandable reporting
 – Considered, at the request of the Board, the comprehensive review process which 
supports the Board and Committee in reaching its conclusion whether the 2017 Annual 
Report and Accounts was fair, balanced and understandable and whether it provided the 
necessary information for shareholders to assess the Group’s performance, business 
model and strategy. The process which enabled the Committee to reach this conclusion 
included:
 – the production of the 2017 Annual Report and Accounts which was managed by  
the Chief Financial Officer, with overall governance and coordination provided by  
a cross-functional team of senior management led by the Group Head of Finance;
 – cross-functional support to drafting the 2017 Annual Report and Accounts, which 
included input from Finance, Risk, Legal and Governance, Investor Relations, HR and 
the wider business;
 – a robust review process of inputs into the 2017 Annual Report and Accounts by all 
contributors to ensure disclosures were balanced, accurate and verified, and further 
comprehensive reviews were conducted by senior management;
 – a review by the Company Secretary of all Board and Committee minutes to ensure 
all significant matters discussed at meetings were appropriately disclosed in the 2017 
Annual Report and Accounts as required;
 – a formal review by the Committee of the draft 2017 Annual Report and Accounts 
in advance of final sign-off; and
 – a final review by the Board of Directors.
 – After careful review and consideration of all relevant information, including principal 
risks, the Committee was satisfied that, taken as a whole, the 2017 Annual Report and 
Accounts is fair, balanced and understandable and has affirmed that view to the Board.
 – This process was also undertaken in respect of all the Group’s financial reporting during 
the year to ensure that, taken as a whole, based on the information supplied to it and 
challenged by the Committee, they were fair, balanced and understandable, and advised 
the Board to that effect. CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 85

the Employment Rights Act 1996.
Fraud and anti-money laundering – In conjunction with the activities of the Risk Committee, reviewed management’s 
processes for identifying and responding to the risk of fraud and money laundering. 
Specifically, this involved understanding and overseeing the adequacy of Internal Audit 
coverage of fraud and money laundering controls and External Audit coverage of fraud 
risks and controls relating to financial reporting; and
 – Considered any instances in which control weaknesses, fraud or misconduct 
were highlighted and management’s response in conjunction with any associated 
control deficiencies.
As a result, the Committee, in conjunction with the Risk Committee, is satisfied that internal controls for financial reporting and risk 
management systems were appropriate and fit for purpose throughout the year. CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 86

Role of the Committee Key matters considered and actions completed
External Auditor independence and 
objectivity, and remuneration for audit 
and non-audit services
 – Both the Board and the External Auditor have safeguards in place to protect the 
independence and objectivity of the External Auditor. The Committee approved during 
the year revisions to the External Auditor Policy Standard (‘Policy Standard’) to align it to 
the Group’s Policy Management Framework (aligned with the RMF in September 2017) 
and the FRC’s Revised Ethical Standard 2016;
 – The Policy Standard details the nature of the services that the External Auditor may 
not undertake and specifies that non-audit services may not be pre-approved and are 
subject to prior approval from the Committee or a delegate. In certain cases, the 
External Auditor may be selected over another service provider due to their detailed 
knowledge and understanding of the Group’s operations. Any allowable non-audit 
service with a value above £100,000 requires approval from the Chair of the Committee. 
The Policy Standard also specifies that the overall fee for non-audit services be 
continually monitored and should not exceed 70% of the average audit fee over the 
prior three-year period; 
 – The total amount paid to the External Auditor in 2017 was £1,766k (2016: £1,697k). 
Payments by the Group for both audit and non-audit services provided in 2017 and 
2016 are further detailed in note 2.4 to the financial statements; and
 – The Policy Standard also regulates the appointment of former audit colleagues to 
senior finance positions in the Group. This policy is reviewed at least annually and 
was refreshed during 2017.
Following the Committee’s review of the effectiveness of the external audit process and the assessment of the External Auditor’s 
independence and objectivity, it has recommended to the Board the reappointment of EY as the Group’s External Auditor for 
recommendation to and approval by shareholders at the 2018 AGM.
The External Auditor, the Senior 
Statutory Auditor and The Statutory 
Audit Services for Large Companies 
Market Investigation (Mandatory Use of 
Competitive Tender Processes and Audit 
Committee Responsibilities) Order 2014
 – EY has been the External Auditor for Clydesdale Bank PLC and other Group entities 
since January 2005. EY was appointed as the Company’s External Auditor on 
14 January 2016 following an audit tender, shortly before the Company became the 
holding company of the Group and for the initial period post the demerger and IPO in 
February 2016, however, the Committee recommended that this be kept under review; 
 – The Group has no current retendering plans. The Committee undertook a competitive 
tender of the audit of the Group in early 2015. In applying the CMA’s requirements, the 
next mandatory tender would be in respect of the 2026 financial year;
 – During the year, Steven Robb succeeded George Reid as the Senior Statutory Auditor 
and EY will continue to practice the rotation of the Senior Statutory Auditor responsible 
for the Group audit at least every five years, and all other audit partners and audit senior 
management will be required to rotate at least every seven years;
 – The Committee continues to follow developments in the reform of the external audit 
regulations and the UK and European requirements on publicly listed banking groups; 
and
 – The Committee confirms that the Group has complied during the period of financial 
review and to the date of this report with The Statutory Audit Services for Large 
Companies Market Investigation (Mandatory Use of Competitive Tender Processes 
and Audit Committee Responsibilities) Order 2014, which relates to the frequency 
and governance of tenders for the appointment of the External Auditor and the 
setting of a policy on the provision of non-audit services. CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 88
Dear shareholder,
As Chair of the Risk Committee, I am pleased to present the report 
from the Committee for the year ended 30 September 2017. I 
became the Chair of the Committee on 11 January 2017, having 
been a member since 1 July 2016. I would like to thank Richard 
Gregory, my predecessor as Chair, for imparting his knowledge 
and insight to me as incoming Chair.
Highlights in 2017
During the year, there have been a number of key priorities 
upon which the Committee has focused to enhance both its 
effectiveness and role. In particular, the Committee has assessed 
how best it can support a strong and effective risk culture which 
drives customer centricity. 
The Committee has continued to direct the enhancement of 
the Group’s RAS and associated metrics to better align with the 
strategic planning process, with particular focus on defining the 
risk appetite for conduct risk and operational resilience. It 
continued to consider stress and scenario analysis to provide 
comfort on the Group’s ability to mitigate potential risks. 
The Committee developed its view and understanding of top 
and emerging enterprise-wide risks as agreed by the Executive 
Leadership Team and the Board, which represent the most 
significant risks to the achievement of the Group’s current business 
plan and strategy and/or could result in material financial, 
reputational or regulatory impact. The Group continues to operate 
in an environment subject to considerable change and during the 
year the Committee has been proactive in its review, oversight and 
challenge of risks arising from headwinds such as the recent 
political events, specifically the outcomes of the UK general 
election and the commencement of Brexit negotiations following 
the EU referendum and wider geo-political risks which have led to 
increased economic and political uncertainty. In addition, there has 
been focus on a number of high profile cyber security breaches 
during the last few years at other UK corporates such as the 
recent WannaCry incident in May 2017, given the importance 
of digital capability to the Group’s strategic focus and enhancing 
the Group’s enabled omni-channel offering to customers. The 
potential impact to the Group’s business from various mandatory 
regulatory developments such as fulfilling the requirements of the 
General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Payment Services 
Directive 2 (PSD2), MiFiD II; ring fencing and any changes due to 
regulatory capital requirements as a result of the BCBS are also 
topical and subject to ongoing consideration by the Committee.

Governance
Risk Committee report
As part of the RMF, during the year the Committee maintained oversight of the following identified principal risks and associated top and 
emerging risks:
Principal risk Examples of Risk Committee consideration
Credit risk 
The risk of loss of principal or interest 
stemming from a borrower’s failure to 
meet contracted obligations to the 
Group in accordance with the terms 
agreed. Credit risk is evident at both 
a portfolio and transactional level.
 – The Committee reviewed regularly the performance of the credit risk portfolio, 
including segmentations alongside changes in the economic environment to ensure 
that concentration risks were minimised. An area of particular focus and attention is the 
Group’s mortgage portfolio spread and the level of concentration of mortgage lending.
Emerging risk – Macroeconomic environment. The impact of the sustained low interest 
environment places increased pressure on NIM and conversely, a sharp rise in interest rates 
leads to an increased risk of default rates and credit losses.
Emerging risk – Consumer credit. Maintaining awareness of the risk of significant 
unforeseen credit losses occurring within a short time period which has the potential to 
have a detrimental impact on earnings and profitability.
Balance sheet and Prudential 
regulation risks
This covers a number of categories 
of risk which, combined, affect the 
manner in which the Group can 
support its customers in a safe and 
sound manner
 – The Committee monitored closely the Group’s funding position giving due 
consideration to any additional risks arising from increased market uncertainty following 
changes in the macroeconomic environment, including the triggering of Article 50 and 
subsequent Brexit negotiations which continue to create significant economic 
uncertainty for the UK; and
 – At each meeting the Committee considered a report from the Treasurer which provided 
an update on the Group’s exposure to balance sheet and prudential regulation risks.
Regulatory and  
compliance risks 
This consists of regulatory strategy 
and change risk, regulatory 
relationship risk and the risk of failing 
to understand and comply with 
relevant laws, regulations, licence 
conditions, supervisory requirements, 
industry codes of conduct and 
voluntary initiatives.
 – The Committee obtained frequent briefings from management on forthcoming 
regulatory developments and upstream risk, to allow members to consider and oversee 
the implications of these on the Group’s strategic objectives and operations, systems 
and controls;
 – Regular updates were received by the Committee from the Group Chief Risk Officer on 
progress made towards achieving IRB accreditation; and
 – The Committee reviewed regular reports detailing how regulatory changes were being 
integrated into business strategic execution (see emerging risks below).
Emerging risk – Regulatory capital requirements – Changes to regulatory capital 
requirements due to the BCBS consultation on changes to the standardised approaches 
for calculating credit risk and operational risk.
Emerging risk – Banking reform, ring fencing and resolution – Regulatory authorities in 
the UK and Europe have proposed reforms to certain aspects of banking sector regulation 
including ring fencing requirements and MiFID II.
Emerging risk – Use of data – The EU Commissions General Data Protection Regulation 
(GDPR) is to be introduced from 25 May 2018 meaning the Group will be subject to 
increased regulatory burden when processing customer, colleague and other data and may 
be subject to increased sanctions for breach.
Conduct risk
Defined as the risk of treating 
customers unfairly and/or delivering 
inappropriate outcomes resulting 
in regulatory fines, compensation, 
redress costs and/or reputational 
damage.
 – Through the execution of the Group Conduct Strategy, the Committee oversaw the 
pro-active review of the business for potential conduct issues;
 – The Committee monitored progress to remediate key legacy conduct issues throughout 
the year, including PPI and other remediation programmes;
 – The Committee received regular updates on the implementation and effective 
execution of the Group Conduct Strategy including the bi-annual Conduct Framework 
assessment, This included review of product governance outcomes, obtaining assurance 
that product design and execution continued to deliver fair outcomes to customers; and

introduction of additional and enhanced Conduct-related RAS measures and approved 
a new Conduct Risk Policy Statement. CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 93
Strategic report Governance Financial results Risk report Financial statements Additional information
Principal risk Examples of Risk Committee consideration
Operational risk
The risk of loss resulting from 
inadequate or failed internal 
processes and systems or from 
external events.
 – The Committee reviewed the current and target approaches to change management to 
ensure that the Operational risk elements inherent in the Group’s strategic plans were 
being effectively mitigated. This included the oversight of the effectiveness of actions to 
exit remaining TSAs with NAB.
Emerging risk – Geopolitical uncertainty. The outcome of the EU referendum and 
subsequent triggering of Article 50 has created a period of economic uncertainty for  
the UK. 
Financial crime risk
The risk that the Group’s products 
and services will be used to facilitate 
financial crime against the Group, its 
customers or third parties.
 – The Committee maintained oversight of the effectiveness of the Financial Crime 
Framework for monitoring, management and mitigation of financial crime and 
considered reports on the strength of the Group’s cybercrime defence strategy.
 – Emerging risk – Cybercrime. There is a risk that the Group is unable to keep pace with 
the increased threat of cybercrime that digital expansion presents.
Strategic, business and financial 
performance risk
The risk of significant loss, loss of 
earnings and/or damage arising from 
business decisions that impact the 
long-term interests of stakeholders 
or from an inability to adapt to 
external developments.
 – The Committee reviewed a consolidated report outlining the triggers and exposure to 
strategic risk by the Group Chief Risk Officer. 
Emerging risk – Payment Services Directive 2 (PSD2) – A directive of the European 
Parliament, the rules of which will apply from 13 January 2018, which aims to further 
develop a better integrated internal market for electronic payments within the EU, and 
which the Group will be required to comply with.
People risk
The risk of not having sufficiently 
skilled and motivated colleagues who 
are clear on their responsibilities and 
accountabilities and who behave in an 
ethical way.
 – The Committee provided oversight of people risks which included the ability to manage 
change, the availability of management resources against plan, and the culture 
embedded across the Group.

Statement by the Chair of the Remuneration Committee
 
Dear shareholder,
As Chair of the Remuneration Committee, I am pleased to present 
the Group’s Directors’ remuneration report, including details of 
the Directors’ and Non-Executive Directors’ pay, for the 
year ended 30 September 2017. 
Our Directors’ remuneration policy was approved by shareholders 
in 2017 and no changes to the policy are proposed for 2018. 
This statement and the accompanying report demonstrate the 
framework in which decisions have been made, the outcomes 
for the 2017 performance year and how the Committee plans 
to approach the year ahead. 
2017 review
Overall, 2017 has been a very strong year and the Group has 
maintained momentum in delivering against its strategic priorities. 
These priorities and commitments remain unchanged, providing 
sustainable customer growth, efficiency and capital optimisation 
delivered by a strong customer-focused culture, all within a 
framework of prudent risk management and governance. This 
purpose is once again reflected in our remuneration arrangements 
and is supported by the implementation of our remuneration 
policy for 2018 and onwards.
Underlying profit is up 33% year on year and 15% ahead of the 
target. Underlying CIR has improved by 7% from 74% to 67% 
notwithstanding the additional costs associated with our first full 
year since the IPO.
Overall underlying costs for the year of £675m were below our 
target of £690m–£700m. Balance sheet growth continued based 
on a prudent risk appetite with customer loans increasing by 6.0% 
as mortgage balances increased by 7.5% and core SME balances 
grew by 5.9%.
Following the success of the demerger and IPO, we embarked on a 
programme of significant transformation. That activity has been far 
reaching and had a personal impact on many colleagues. 2017 saw 
our colleague engagement fall to 72%, a decrease of 7%. When 
compared with a score of 79% last year, the results show a decline 
across a number of categories. When we compare ourselves to 
other organisations going through similar levels of transformation 
(known as the Transitional Companies norm), our engagement is 
more in line with this norm and significantly ahead on half of the 
survey categories. In fact despite the overall decline, many of our 
scores remain strong.
As detailed in the Annual report on remuneration, the substantial 
majority of both financial and non-financial targets set by the 
Committee for the 2017 bonus were exceeded. However, as 
the customer metric (NPS) and colleague engagement scores 
underperformed the Committee exercised their discretion to 
reduce the element of bonus linked to business performance and  
therefore determined that a bonus of 82% of salary be paid to the 
Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Chief Financial Officer (CFO) and 
Chief Operating Officer (COO). 
 The Committee continues to 
ensure the Group’s remuneration 
arrangements support delivery  
of its strategic priorities for 2018  
and onwards.  CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 95
Strategic report Governance Financial results Risk report Financial statements Additional information
The Group has also devoted significant effort into enhancing its 
credibility and relationships with key external stakeholders across 
the business, regulatory and government spectrum.
Considerations for the year ahead
The Committee will continue to operate within the existing 
approved Directors’ remuneration policy in 2018 and will continue 
to focus on ensuring the remuneration policy remains in line with 
the market and compliant with regulatory requirements. Our 
continuing strategy will align the interests of the Executive 
Directors and shareholders. Given the continuing uncertainty over 
the exit of the UK from the EU, the unexpected outcome of the 
June general election for the UK Government and the relatively 
high inflation figures in comparison with previous years, the 
Committee will also focus on ensuring the Group is able to attract, 
retain and motivate key talent at all levels of the organisation, in a 
challenging market.
Working within the policy framework, the Committee has 
undertaken a review of the Group’s remuneration arrangements 
and in particular the performance measures of our incentive plans 
to ensure they are aligned with the Group’s business strategy and 
reward for the delivery of key strategic objectives. 
Executive Directors salaries
It is the Committee’s intent that Executive Director salary 
increases remain aligned to those applied to colleagues generally 
across the Group. However, as per our remuneration policy, the 
committee reserves the right to provide increases that are greater 
than those applied across the Group where there is a strong 
rationale to do so. 
As last year, the CEO and COO salaries will remain unchanged in 
2018. The CFOs salary will increase by 8.75% to £500,000 from 
1 October 2017. This change reflects the new status of the role as 
a FTSE 250 PLC CFO and the importance of the role in driving 
the performance of the business.
Pay and employment conditions of other colleagues in the Group 
were taken into account when considering these outcomes. 
Building an improved colleague proposition across CYBG has been 
a key area of focus in 2017 and improvements have included 
consolidated pay increases, enhanced defined contribution pension 
provision and the introduction of a flexible benefits account worth 
up to 5% (capped at £2,500) of salary from 1 January 2018 for all 
colleagues below Executive Director.
Variable pay
The Committee will set appropriate and stretching annual variable 
reward targets for the year ahead based on the Group’s key 
financial, risk, customer and culture objectives. The Remuneration 
Committee is committed to providing transparency in decision 
making in respect of the Group’s incentive plans. It will disclose 
targets and measures; together with information relating to 
performance against those targets within the Annual report on 
remuneration for the relevant year, except to the extent that the 
Board deem these to be commercially sensitive, in which case it will 
disclose this information once it is deemed not to be sensitive. 
The new LTIP award for our executives, awarded in respect of 
performance in the financial year ended 30 September 2017, is 
subject to a three-year performance period (1 October 2017 to 
30 September 2020) and a three to seven year deferral period. 
This ensures a significant proportion of Executive Directors’ 
remuneration continues to be deferred. This, together with the 
fact that a large proportion of short-term incentive is deferred  
and delivered in shares, ensures that Executive Directors’ 
remuneration is aligned with the achievement of our long-term 
strategy and the long-term interests of shareholders. Details of 
the performance measures and targets for the LTIP award to be 
granted in respect of 2017 are provided on page 111.
Details of the performance measures for the 2018 annual 
incentive (bonus) are detailed on page 108. However, for reasons 
of commercial sensitivity, the specific targets for each measure will 
not be disclosed until the end of the 2018 performance period, 
when performance against the targets will also be disclosed.
Consideration of shareholders’ views
Shareholders have an essential role to play in guiding responsible 
pay practices. The Committee received feedback from our major 
shareholders ahead of the 2017 AGM, and took account of these 
views when formulating the final development of our policy, which 
was reflected in the high levels of support for resolutions relating 
to remuneration. 
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to recommend this statement 
to shareholders, ahead of the 2018 AGM.

Advisers to the Committee
Following a selection process carried out by the Remuneration Committee prior to the IPO of the Group, the Committee engaged the 
services of PwC as independent remuneration adviser. During the financial year, PwC advised the Committee on all aspects of the 
Directors’ remuneration policy for members of the Executive Leadership Team. PwC also provide professional services in the ordinary 
course of business including assurance, advisory, tax and legal advice. The Committee is notified of other remuneration work that is 
undertaken by PwC. In addition, there are processes in place to ensure no conflict of interest exists in the provisions of these services.
PwC is a member of the Remuneration Consultants Group, whose voluntary code of conduct is designed to ensure objective and 
independent advice is given to remuneration committees. Fees of £139,000 excluding VAT (2016: £93,000 in respect of the eight-
month period from the IPO to the year end) were paid based on time spent on advice provided to the Remuneration Committee in 
respect of Directors’ remuneration for the financial year.
Statement of voting at general meeting
Prior to the IPO, the Group’s sole shareholder was NAB and there is therefore no prior historic voting information prior to this date. The 
proposals in relation to the Group’s remuneration policy and the remuneration offered to the Executive Directors in 2017 were detailed 
within the Directors’ remuneration report for 2016 and were voted on at the AGM on 31 January 2017. The shareholder votes

Policy and principles
The current Directors’ remuneration policy approved by shareholders at the AGM on 31 January 2017 remains in force. The Committee 
will consider the remuneration policy annually to ensure that it remains aligned with business needs and is appropriately positioned 
relative to the market. There is no intention to revise the policy more frequently than every three years, unless amendments to the 
policy are required in the interim, in which case appropriate shareholder approval will be sought.
An abridged version of the policy which includes the remuneration tables for Executive and Non-Executive Directors is included in the 
following pages for reference. This does not replace or override the full approved policy which is available on pages 106–115 of the 
2016 Annual Report and Accounts available at: www.cybg.com/investor-centre/annual-reports/
Details on how the policy will be applied in 2018 are included on pages 108 to 109 of the report. In applying this policy the Group 
remuneration approach remains to: 
 – provide competitive, transparent and fair rewards, benefits and conditions;
 – reward achievement of short- and long-term individual objectives and business strategy;
 – align the interests of colleagues and shareholders through colleague share ownership;
 – deliver outcomes over short- and long-term horizons with appropriate performance and risk adjustments, ensuring performance 
assurance principles are applied;
 – support the RMF with regard for the risk appetite of the Group; and
 – attract, recognise, motivate and retain high performers.
Remuneration arrangements are fully compliant with, and will be operated in line with, all regulatory requirements, including the PRA 
Remuneration Code and are in line with UK listed financial services sector best practice.  CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 100

Directors’ remuneration policy – abridged continued
Our peer group companies
The CYBG comparator peer group was reviewed by the Committee and is defined as other UK-based banks and wider financial services 
firms of a comparable size, divisional heads in larger UK banks and other FTSE companies reflecting our market capitalisation.
Elements of package – fixed remuneration
The policy in relation to each element of Executive Directors’ remuneration is set out in the following tables.
Base salary
Purpose and link to strategy Recruit, reward, retain and recognise leadership position and responsibility for  
delivering strategy.
Operation Base salaries are paid in 12 equal monthly instalments during the year and are reviewed 
annually. Any changes are effective from 1 January. When determining and reviewing base 
salaries, the Committee considers:
 – Group and individual performance;
 – the skills, experience and responsibilities of the Executive Director and their market value;
 – the scope and size of the role;
 – base salary increases for colleagues throughout the Group; and
 – external benchmarks data for peer banks, the divisional heads of larger UK banks and FTSE 
data reflecting our market capitalisation.
Maximum potential The Committee will seek to limit pay increases for Executive Directors, where there is no 
change in role, to those applied to colleagues generally across the Group. However, where 
an Executive Director is relatively new in role the Committee reserves flexibility to provide 
increases that are greater than those applied across the Group to bring the individual’s salary 
into line with the market and reflect the gaining of experience.
Other colleagues The approach takes into account affordability, economic factors, external market data, 
business and personal performance. 
Pension
Purpose and link to strategy Recruit, reward, retain key talent and contribute towards individuals funding for retirement.
Operation Executive Directors are entitled to participate in the Group defined contribution pension 
scheme or may receive a cash allowance in lieu of some, or all, of the employer pension 
contribution. The Group’s defined benefit pension scheme is only available to existing members.
Maximum potential The maximum cash allowance for Executive Directors will be set at 20% of an Executive 
Director’s base salary. Contributions to the Group’s defined benefit pension scheme are 
capped by reference to the Scheme earnings cap. Only one Executive Director was a member 
of the Group’s defined benefit scheme during 2017 and they ceased to accrue benefits from 
31 July 2017 in line with other colleagues.
Other colleagues All new colleagues are automatically enrolled in the Group’s defined contribution pension 
scheme. The defined benefit scheme closed to new entrants in 2004 and closed to the future 
accrual of benefits for the majority of colleagues from 31 July 2017.
Benefits
Purpose and link to strategy To provide benefits consistent with role.
Operation The Group provides a range of benefits which can include private medical insurance, health 
assessments, life assurance and car allowance/car. The Committee retains the discretion to 
provide additional benefits as may be reasonably required. These may include relocation benefits 
such as (but not limited to) accommodation, family relocation support and taxable travel.
The Executive Directors are entitled to a maximum of 30 days holiday in addition to applicable 
bank/public holidays.
Maximum potential The CEO has a cap of £250,000 on his benefits, including pension contributions and any cash 
allowance in lieu of pension contributions. For the other Executive Directors, the maximum 
value of benefits is set by the nature of the benefits and the cost of providing them.
Other colleagues The Group provides a range of benefits based on colleagues’ roles, which include private 
medical insurance, health assessments, life assurance and car allowance/car. Colleagues 
receive between 25 and 30 days’ holiday annually depending on their role. CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 101

Elements of package – variable remuneration
Bonus
Purpose and link to strategy The annual bonus is designed to reward Group and personal performance in line with 
strategic objectives.
Operation Annual bonuses are discretionary and are based on Group and individual performance within 
the year. The measures, their weighting and targets are set annually with awards determined 
by the Committee at the end of the financial year.
The annual bonus may be delivered in cash and shares, which, in combination with the LTIP 
awards and any relevant awards under the all-employee Share Incentive Plan (SIP) will be 
structured in line with the requirements on the deferral of variable pay under the PRA 
Remuneration Code.
The equity-based element of the award will be made as rights to CYBG shares or other 
instruments, which are released at the end of the required holding period. The mechanism for 
making these awards will be the Deferred Equity Plan (DEP). The amount and deferral period 
for bonus will be determined in line with regulatory requirements and to the extent that the 
LTIP award does not fully meet the deferral requirements.
Dividends or dividend equivalents accrued on deferred annual bonus shares are paid on 
vesting, subject to the extent permitted under the relevant remuneration regulations.
Discretion may be exercised by the Committee to ensure that the bonus outcomes are a fair 
and accurate reflection of the business and individual performance and consider any risk-
related issues (but may not exceed the maximum opportunity). The Group can, in specific 
circumstances, apply malus and/or clawback to all or part of any bonus award.
Maximum potential Taken together with the LTIP awards, total variable remuneration is limited by the 2:1 ratio of 
variable pay to fixed pay, subject to the LTIP award being at least half of the total variable pay 
award.
Performance conditions Performance measures are set by the Committee each year and are set out in the Annual 
report on remuneration, normally this would be:
 – 80% of the annual bonus opportunity for Executive Directors is based on performance 
of the Group against key financial and non-financial measures; and
 – 20% is based on personal performance and behaviours.
When determining the outcome of the performance measures, the Remuneration 
Committee will seek the advice of the Risk Committee to ensure all relevant risk factors 
are identified and the bonus pool and/or individual awards adjusted accordingly.
Specific measures, targets and weightings will be set by the Remuneration Committee 
annually and disclosed on a retrospective basis.
Other colleagues All colleagues within the Group are in a single Group-wide scheme with target opportunities 
ranging from 8% to 50% of base salary depending on role.
Awards will be funded from a bonus pool reflecting the same financial and non-financial 
measures that apply to Executive Directors. When determining the outcome of the 
performance measures the Remuneration Committee will seek the advice of the Risk 
Committee to ensure all relevant risk factors are identified and the bonus pool and/or 
individual awards are adjusted accordingly.

Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)
Purpose and link to strategy Delivery of the Group’s strategy and growth in shareholder value.
Operation Awards are based on a three-year performance period reflecting a basket of business and 
shareholder measures aligned with strategic goals. Awards will vest a minimum of three years 
after being awarded, or longer, for example where required by the PRA Remuneration Code. 
Where a period of deferral extends beyond three years, awards will only be subject to service 
requirements for the first three years, thereafter awards will only be subject to forfeiture for 
reasons of gross misconduct or malus. The value of awards for the purposes of determining 
total variable remuneration will be in line with the rules set by the Regulator.
The Committee, in its absolute discretion, will determine the level of the LTIP awards made 
under the LTIP after taking account of the Executive Director’s individual performance and 
business performance. Any LTIP award, when combined with any deferred element of the 
annual bonus, will meet the deferral requirements under the PRA Remuneration Code. Malus 
and clawback also apply to the whole of the LTIP award in line with the requirements of the 
PRA Remuneration Code.
Awards are made as conditional rights to CYBG shares, or other instruments, which will 
be released at the end of the holding period or later where required under the PRA’s 
Remuneration Code. Dividends or dividend equivalents accrue on the LTIP awards and, to 
the extent that the award vests, are paid on vesting, subject to the extent permitted under 
the relevant financial services remuneration regulations.
Maximum potential Taken together with the bonus award, the total variable remuneration is limited by the agreed 
2:1 ratio of variable pay to fixed pay, subject to the LTIP award being at least half of the total 
variable pay award.
Performance conditions Service and performance conditions must be met over a three-year period. 
Measures aligned with strategic goals are proposed for future LTIP awards, including the 2016 
awards to be made following the AGM: 
 – Sustainable Customer Growth; 
 – Efficiency; 
 – Capital Optimisation; and 
 – Prudent Risk Management and Governance. 
The weighting of metrics will be determined before each award and those for the 2017 award 
are set out in the Annual report on remuneration, with 25% of the maximum vesting for each 
measure for threshold performance. The measures reflect a balanced approach between 
financial and non-financial. The Committee has discretion to vary the weighting of 
performance metrics, or to substitute the metrics over the life of this Directors’ remuneration 
policy. Shareholders will be consulted should the metrics themselves be varied.
In determining the outcome, the Remuneration Committee will seek the advice of the Risk 
Committee to ensure all relevant risk factors are identified and the level of vesting adjusted 
accordingly.
Other colleagues Members of the Executive Leadership Team and other senior managers are eligible to 
participate in the LTIP with awards made solely at the discretion of the Committee. CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 103

Shareholding requirement
Purpose and link to strategy To align Executive Directors’ interests with those of shareholders
Operation 
Executive Directors
Executive Directors are expected to build up a specified holding of CYBG shares equivalent 
to a percentage of salary. 60% of the shares vesting (after settling tax and National Insurance 
liabilities) from CYBG share plans must be retained until the shareholding requirements are met.
Executive Director Shareholding requirement (% of salary) 
CEO 200% 
CFO and COO 150%
When assessing an Executive Director’s shareholding against the requirement, vested awards 
which are held as rights rather than shares will be included based on the anticipated net number 
of shares that would be released to the Executive Director at the end of the holding period.
Other colleagues Additionally, members of the Executive Leadership Team are expected to build up a holding of 
CYBG shares equivalent to 100% of salary. 50% of the shares vesting (after settling tax and NIC 
liabilities) from CYBG share plans must be retained until the shareholding requirement is met.
Performance measures
The Committee selected the short- and long-term performance measures to ensure an appropriate balance between short and long 
term strategic goals and aligning the interests of Executive Directors with shareholders. Targets are set each year having regard to the 
strategic plan and consensus forecasts. Measures and targets for both the bonus plan and LTIP are aligned to the strategic plan and have 
been approved by the Board.
The Committee may apply discretion, in exceptional circumstances (for example, if there is a major corporate event), to amend or vary 
targets or the weighting of performance metrics (measures), or to substitute the metrics over the life of this Directors’ remuneration 
policy if these are no longer appropriate to ensure alignment with strategy and any risks within the business. The Committee will consult 
with the Group’s risk management and control functions to ensure changes are appropriate and do not inadvertently encourage 
irresponsible or inappropriate behaviour. The Committee will consult with shareholders in advance of any change to performance metrics.
The Committee retains discretion to adjust outcomes to ensure these are consistent with corporate performance. The Committee 
proposes to use the measures described in the Policy Table for the 2016 LTIP award to be made after the AGM and future awards, 
but will reassess these annually based on the Group’s performance and strategy. In determining the 2016 measures, the Committee 
consulted with major shareholders.
Risk adjustments, malus and clawback
For MRTs, which include the Executive Directors, bonus and LTIP awards may be reduced before they are released (malus) or may be 
subject to clawback where the Committee determines that an adjustment should apply. Clawback may be applied up to seven years 
from the award date, or 10 years for those holding a senior management function where an investigation has commenced.
Malus may be applied where: there is evidence of colleague misbehaviour, misconduct, material error, where a colleague participated in 
conduct which resulted in losses for the Group or they failed to meet appropriate standards; any material failure of risk management at 
a Group, business area, division or business unit level; if the financial results at a Group, division or business unit level are restated; if the 
financial results for a given year do not support the level of variable remuneration awarded; or any other circumstances where the 
Committee consider adjustments should be made. The Committee is supported in this by the Board Risk and Audit Committees and the 
CYBG Risk function.
Clawback may be applicable where there is reasonable evidence of colleague misbehaviour or material error, or there is material failure 
of risk management at a Group, business area, division or business unit level.
Other CYBG share plans
The Executive Directors are invited to participate in all-employee share plans on the same basis as other Group colleagues. These plans 
encourage share ownership, aligning colleagues’ interests with those of shareholders and allowing them to benefit from the long-term 
success of the Group. 
The CYBG Share Incentive Plan (SIP) provides for the purchase of shares, in line with HMRC participation level rules, on a monthly basis 
from gross pay and is also the vehicle used to allow for awards of free or matching shares. 
Each Executive Director received 256 free shares following the demerger and the CFO participates in the monthly purchase of shares 
through the SIP.
If operated in the future, Executive Directors will also be eligible to participate in all employee share plans operated by the Group. CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 104

(1) Reflects the end of the six months post vesting holding period.
(2) Awards that do not vest at the end of the first performance period will be retested after 12 months.
The level of vesting for these awards is determined by the NAB Board, and in 2017 the NAB Board determined that the 2012 NAB LTIP 
should be lapsed in full.
The 2013 and 2014 LTIP awards are due to be released in June 2018 and June 2019 respectively, and are based on NAB’s relative TSR 
performance with half measured against the S&P/ASX Top 50 Index peer group and half against a selection of financial companies in the 
ASX Top 200 peer group. Awards that do not vest at the end of the first performance period will be retested after 12 months.
The final decision on the level of vesting will be taken by the NAB Board, with value at the date of vesting included in the Directors single 
table figure in the year they vest.
Illustration of the application of remuneration policy
The chart below illustrates the potential remuneration of the Executive Directors based on the policy in the following three scenarios:
 – minimum remuneration based on fixed elements of package only (salary, pension, benefits);
 – target outcome assumes the actual bonus award is 50% of the maximum opportunity with 60% of the LTIP vesting; and
 – maximum outcome which assumes the actual bonus award is 100% of the maximum opportunity and 100% vesting of the LTIP.
The amounts do not allow for share price appreciation and do not include dividends or payments in lieu of dividends. Salary figures are 
as at 1 October 2017 and in line with policy the maximum bonus and LTIP awards are 100% of base salary.

The Committee retains the discretion to determine whether an Executive Director is to be treated as a good leaver. Unless determined 
otherwise, an Executive Director will be treated as a good leaver in cases where their employment ends due to death, injury, ill-health, 
disability, redundancy, retirement, or the company being transferred out of the CYBG Group and any other reason (except for dishonesty, 
fraud, misconduct or dismissal). The Committee reserves the right to make additional payments where such payments are made in good 
faith and are required to discharge legal obligations or are due to the breach of such obligations.

Considerations of employment conditions elsewhere in the Group
Pay and employment conditions generally in the Group are considered when setting Executive Directors’ remuneration. The Committee 
are provided with regular updates on overall pay and conditions, including negotiated pay increases for the broader colleague population, 
has oversight of significant changes in the provision of benefits (including pension provisions) and approves the colleague bonus pool.
During the year the Committee considered the following in relation to colleagues below the Executive Directors:
 – remuneration packages of Executive Leadership Team members;
 – design of the annual bonus plan for Executive Leadership Team and all colleagues;
 – measures and targets for the 2017 annual bonus pool;
 – salary increases for all colleagues;
 – policy in relation to pension plans and the closure of the defined benefit pension plan to future accrual;
 – design of the 2017 LTIP and awards to members of the Executive Leadership Team and other Group senior colleagues  
(based on role); and
 – commencement and termination payments made to MRTs.
The Committee does not specifically invite colleagues to comment on the Directors’ remuneration policy but any comments made by 
colleagues are taken into account. Consideration is given to feedback provided by colleagues through the annual engagement survey. CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 107
Strategic report Governance Financial results Risk report Financial statements Additional information
Chairman and Non-Executive Directors’ remuneration policy abridged
The table below sets out the Non-Executive Directors’ remuneration policy which applies to the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors.
Non-Executive Directors are engaged through letters of appointment which are for an initial period of three years, subject to three-
months notice by the Non-Executive Directors or the Group. The Chairman has six months notice. All Non-Executive Directors are 
subject to annual re-election by shareholders at each AGM and are subject to early termination without compensation if he or she is 
not reappointed at a meeting of shareholders.
Non-Executive Directors’ packages
Purpose and link to strategy To ensure the Group is able to engage and retain highly skilled and experienced individuals.
Operation Fees paid to the Chairman are determined by the Remuneration Committee, while the fees 
paid to the Non-Executive Directors are set by the Board annually. The fees reflect a base 
fee with additional fees payable for being members of, or chairing, Board committees and 
a separate fee is payable to the Senior Independent Director and Deputy Chairman.
Non-Executive Directors are appointed for an initial three-year term and will normally serve 
two terms, exceptionally three.
The fees are set at a rate that reflects the value to the Group and expected time commitment 
given the added regulatory complexity within the financial services sector. In exceptional 
circumstances, incremental fees may be paid for additional duties and time commitment, to 
reflect increased workload.
From time to time, new Board committees may be established and/or responsibilities 
distributed between committees, at which point fees for committee membership and 
Chair may be reviewed.
The Chairman and Non-Executive Directors are reimbursed for expenses incurred in 
performing their duties and any tax arising on such reimbursed expenses is paid by the Group. 
For individuals based outside of the UK this will include travel to and from the UK. Non-
Executive Directors and the Chairman do not participate in any variable remuneration or 
benefits arrangements.
Maximum potential The maximum aggregate value of fees payable to the Chairman and the Non-Executive 
Directors is capped at £2.5m under the Articles of Association.
Performance conditions There are no performance conditions attached to the fees payable to the Chairman or 
Non-Executive Directors.

Directors’ remuneration report
Annual report on remuneration
Implementation of the policy in 2018
The following sets out how the Directors’ remuneration policy will be applied in 2018:
The remuneration policy will be operated as set out above. In particular:
 – the targets for the 2018 annual bonus are considered to be commercially sensitive at this time but will be disclosed along with 
measures and weightings on a retrospective basis;
 – details of the LTIP award for 2017 are set out in the Annual report on remuneration including how they are aligned with our strategic 
priorities of delivering sustainable customer growth, improving efficiency and capital optimisation and link to our risk and compliance 
and customer-focused culture objectives; 
 – salary change for the CFO is intended from the 1 October 2017 reflecting his role since the IPO;
 – the annual bonus for Executive Directors for the performance year 2018 will be capped at 100% of base salary;
 – the LTIP for Executive Directors for the performance year 2018 will be capped at 100% of base salary; 
 – Non-Executive Directors fees in 2018 may be reviewed as the Group progresses with its strategic priorities and to reflect any 
changes in the nature of a Non-Executive Director’s role and responsibilities;
 – to comply with remuneration regulation changes effective for 2018 the deferral of awards has been extended to between three 
and seven years; and
 – in addition, dividends will not accrue on bonus and LTIP awards made in relation to FY2018 (in line with regulatory requirements). 
However, the number of deferred bonus shares/LTIP awards granted may be based on a share price discounted by reference to 
the expected dividend yield over the vesting period.

FY2018 annual bonus
Opportunity 100% of base salary. In line with policy 80% of the award is based on the performance of 
the Group against key financial and non-financial measures and 20% is based on personal 
performance and behaviours. The overall design of the 2018 plan remains unchanged from 
last year.
Performance measures and targets The Committee has determined that for 2018 the annual bonus will be based on 
the following:
 – underlying financial measures with a weighting of 77% including: 
 - underlying profit before tax (underpin);
 - customer lending growth;
 - total costs;
 - CIR; and
 - RoTE.
 – non-financial measures with a weighting of 23% including:
 - CYBG Retail net promoter score (CB, YB and B);
 - adoption of our digital channels; and
 - colleague engagement linked to our annual survey.
The Board considers that the targets which apply to these measures are commercially 
sensitive and as such these will be disclosed alongside the level of payout in next year’s 
implementation report. CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 109
Strategic report Governance Financial results Risk report Financial statements Additional information
FY2017 long-term incentives
Opportunity 100% of base salary.
Performance measures and targets The Remuneration Committee has again set performance measures based on delivering the 
company’s strategic objectives and containing measures linked to sustainable customer 
growth, efficiency, capital optimisation, risk and compliance and customer-focused culture. 
These measures, and their respective targets, are consistent with the strategic plan. 
The Remuneration Committee has determined that 60% vesting is justified for target 
performance and 25% is justified for threshold performance.
Vesting terms The performance period will be the three years commencing 1 October 2017. An assessment 
of personal performance in the financial year preceding the date of the grant will be taken into 
account before awards are made. The anticipated date of grant is November 2017.
To the extent that the performance conditions are met, awards will vest equally from the third 
anniversary of the date of grant to the seventh such anniversary. At each vesting date the 
resultant number of shares (post taxation) will be subject to a twelve-month retention period.

Annual bonus (audited)
The following annual bonus awards were made in respect of the 2017 financial year; these were agreed by the Committee having 
reviewed the Group’s results. Details of the targets used to determine annual bonus in respect of the 2017 financial year and the extent 
to which they were satisfied are shown in the table below. 
These figures are included in the single figure table on the previous page.
2017 saw a strong performance from the Group, with significant change as a result of the transformation programme and a focus on 
building a high-performing, customer-centric organisation with strong productivity and efficiency. In our first full year as CYBG we have 
demonstrated good progress in delivering against the key performance measures set by the Committee:
 – underlying profit before tax up by 33% on last year and 15% ahead of target;
 – underlying RoTE increased to 7.5%;
 – underlying CIR improved by 7% from 74% to 67%;
 – underlying costs for the year of £675m were below our target range of £690m to £700m.
 – while our engagement score fell by 7% from last year it benchmarks well when compared to organisations going through similar 
levels of transformation;

(1) The underlying PBT excludes exceptional items which have reduced the statutory PBT by £25m (a reconciliation of underlying profit before tax to statutory profit before 
tax is provided in the Financial results section). The bulk of this reduction is driven by a combination of legacy conduct issues in respect of PPI, other conduct matters, 
separation costs and restructuring expenses. The underlying PBT was not adjusted by the incremental year-on-year change in the prudent valuation adjustment (PVA) 
figure for 2017. The PVA figure reduced by £3m year on year from £7m in 2016 to £4m in 2017. No upward adjustment to underlying PBT has been considered.
(2) To reflect the under performance of NPS and Colleague Engagement the Committee reduced the arithmetic out turn of 64.3% to 62% for calculating Executive 
Directors’ bonus awards. CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 111
Strategic report Governance Financial results Risk report Financial statements Additional information
The Committee determined the personal award for each Executive Director should be at the maximum as set out below. This reflects 
the Committee’s assessment of a strong performance against every category of their personal score card and the demonstration of the 
required behaviours for their role, together with the pivotal role the Executive Directors played in the successful delivery of our strategy 
in our second year as a standalone PLC.

In assessing the Group’s performance, the Committee reviewed a report from the Chair of the Risk Committee on any risk issues within 
the business and determined that no adjustments were required to the bonus pool or to individual bonus awards for Executive Directors.
Deferral of bonus (audited)
In line with regulatory requirements, a portion of the bonus award is subject to deferral to the extent to which the required deferral is 
not fully met by the LTIP award. Half of the upfront and deferred elements are also subject to a six-month retention period. As such the 
Executive Directors awards were made as follows.

Our remuneration policy for all colleagues
The Group has implemented a firm-wide remuneration policy that is designed to attract and retain high-calibre individuals who will 
promote the delivery of our long-term strategy in line with our business, values and risk appetite. While the levels and elements of the 
remuneration may differ from that of the Executive Directors, they are based on the same principles, aligning remuneration, which shall 
not be excessive, and ensuring that variable pay is appropriate, balanced and calibrated for any impact of risk. 
Element Objective Operation
Base salary Recruit, reward, retain and 
recognise scope of role.
Base salaries are reviewed annually and reflect Group and individual 
performance, skills, experience and the scope of the role.
Benefits To provide benefits consistent 
with role.
The Group provides access to a range of benefits which may vary according 
to seniority.
Pension To provide benefits consistent 
with role.
The Group operates a defined contribution pension scheme for all 
colleagues. The defined benefit scheme closed to new entrants in 2014, 
with the Scheme closing to future accrual on 31 July 2017 for the majority 
of colleagues.
Bonus The annual bonus is designed 
to reward Group and personal 
performance in line with 
strategic objectives.
The Group has a single firm-wide short-term incentive plan. This is 
discretionary and is based on Group and individual performance within the 
year. The determination of measures and their weighting are set annually 
and awards are determined by the Remuneration Committee at the end 
of the financial year.
For MRTs, deferral is applied in line with PRA Remuneration Code. Where 
that does not apply, colleagues who have a bonus award of £14,000 or 
more will have part of the award deferred for 12 months.
LTIP Delivery of the Group’s strategy 
and growth in shareholder value.
In line with Executive Directors, the Group’s Executive Leadership Team is 
able to influence the Group’s performance and they are incentivised to do 
so through eligibility to equity-based compensation. 
Awards are based on a three-year performance period reflecting a basket of 
business and shareholder measures aligned with strategic goals. Awards will 
vest a minimum of three years after being awarded, or longer where 
required by the PRA Remuneration Code. Awards may be subject to a 
discount in determining total variable remuneration under the rules set by 
the European Banking Authority.
Other share plans Offers opportunity to acquire 
shares in CYBG PLC
As well as the DEP and LTIP, the Group operates:
 – a SIP under which colleagues may purchase Partnership Shares and the 
Group may offer free shares; and
 – the Group may in the future offer a SAYE plan.
Commencement, 
retention and 
guaranteed awards
Buy-out of unvested equity  
from a previous employer
The amount, timing and performance hurdles are based on those being 
forfeited and satisfactory evidence. Guaranteed incentives or bonus are 
not provided to existing colleagues.
Total reward consists of both fixed and variable components:
 – fixed remuneration provided as cash and benefits (including employer pension); and
 – variable remuneration reflects both individual and business performance. CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 120
Governance
Directors’ remuneration report
Other remuneration disclosures continued
The mix of fixed and variable reward is balanced to ensure that fixed remuneration provides a sufficient level of remuneration so that the 
variable reward components can be fully flexible, including the possibility of paying no variable reward. The remuneration mix at target is 
based on market information and practices. In any year, the actual mix may vary from target, given the overlay of business performance 
and individual performance.
All variable pay awards to MRTs are subject to malus and clawback in line with regulatory requirements.
Control functions
Colleagues engaged in control functions (i.e. Risk, Internal Audit and Compliance colleagues) are critical to effective management of risk 
across the Group. Independence from the business for these colleagues is assured through:
 – setting the reward mix so that variable reward is not significant enough to encourage inappropriate behaviours while remaining 
competitive with the external market; and
 – scorecards which are specific to the function.
The Committee reviews remuneration structures for control function colleagues.
Risk adjustment
In addition to the Committee’s review of risks that impact on the level of the bonus pool and the application of malus and clawback as 
outlined above, individual bonus awards are also subject to meeting all compliance requirements and awards made can be reduced to nil 
where these are not met, or where colleagues are subject to disciplinary sanction.
Deferral arrangements
Variable rewards (bonus, LTIP and retention awards) are subject to deferral and retention for all MRTs in line with UK regulation:
 – at least 60% of total variable reward will be deferred where the total variable reward is £500,000 or more; and
 – at least 40% of total variable reward will be deferred where the MRT does not meet de minimus conditions.
The period of deferral ranges from one to three years to three to seven years depending on role in line with UK legislation.
The tables below set out the deferral arrangements for those roles classed as MRTs under Articles 2, 3 and 4 of the European Banking 
Authority Guidelines. These have been grouped under the three classifications within Strengthening Individual Accountability in Banking:
 – Senior Manager Function (SMF) roles under the Senior Manager Regime. This includes Executive Directors, SMF Non-Executive 
Directors (Chairman, Senior Independent NED and the Chairman of Remuneration, Risk, Audit and Nomination Committees) and 
other SMF leadership team members and senior managers.
 – Risk Manager roles which includes (but not exclusively) leadership team members not classified as SMF, the senior management 
responsible for material business units, for management of specific risk categories such as liquidity, operational or interest rate risk, 
and for control functions who are responsible for the day-to-day management of the business, its risks, or its control functions.
 – Other MRT which are roles considered to have material impact on the risk profile of the Group.

Election and re-election of Directors  
at the forthcoming AGM
Following recommendations from the Governance and 
Nomination Committee, the Board considers all Directors 
continue to be effective, committed to their roles and have 
sufficient time available to discharge their duties.
In accordance with the Code, all Directors will retire and seek 
re-election at the 2018 AGM.
Directors’ indemnities
The Directors have each entered into individual deeds of access, 
insurance and indemnity with the Group which, among other 
things and subject to certain exceptions, indemnify the Directors 
to the maximum extent permitted by law and regulation against 
liabilities to a person other than the Company or an associated 
company that they may incur as an officer of the Company and 
any other subsidiary of the Group. Each such provision constitutes 
a ‘third-party indemnity provision’ and a ‘qualifying indemnity 
provision’ for the purposes of section 234 to 236 of the 
Companies Act 2006. These provisions are in force for the benefit 
of the Directors at the date of this report, and were in force when 
this report was approved and during the financial year to which this 
report relates. Such deeds are available for inspection at the 
Company’s registered office.
The Group has an insurance policy in place for the benefit of all 
trustees, colleagues, Directors, officers, members and partners 
of the Company while acting in the capacity of a trustee or 
administrator of employee benefit or pension plans. This policy 
therefore indemnifies the Directors of Yorkshire and Clydesdale 
Bank Pension Trustee Limited and YCB DC Trustee Limited (each 
a ‘Trustee Company’), the trustees of two occupational pension 
schemes operated by the Group, against liability incurred by them 
in connection with the management and administration of the 
pension schemes. This insurance policy constitutes a ‘pension 
scheme indemnity provision’ and a ‘qualifying indemnity provision’ 
for the purposes of sections 235 to 236 of the Companies Act 
2006. These provisions are in force for the benefit of the 
Directors of Trustee Companies at the date of this report, and 
were in force when this report was approved and during the 
financial year to which this report relates. Such policy is available 
for inspection at the Company’s registered office.
In addition, the Group had appropriate Directors’ and Officers’ 
Liability Insurance cover in place throughout the financial year.
Profits and appropriations
The Group profit before tax for the financial year ended 
30 September 2017 amounted to £268m (2016: profit of £77m). 
The profit attributable to the ordinary shareholders for the 
year ended 30 September 2017 amounted to £146m (2016: loss 
of £206m). As at 30 September 2017, the distributable reserves 
of the Company were £1,002m (2016: £1,003m).

Dividends
The Directors recommend a final dividend of 1p per ordinary share 
in the Company in respect of the year ended 30 September 2017 
(2016: £Nil) which will, subject to approval by shareholders at the 
2018 Annual General Meeting, be payable on 16 February 2018.
Amendment to the Articles of Association
The Company may only amend its Articles of Association if its 
shareholders pass a special resolution to that effect.
Share capital, control and Directors’ powers
Shares in the Company are listed on both the London Stock 
Exchange (LSE) and the ASX (in the form of CHESS Depositary 
Interests (CDIs)) and therefore, the Company is required to comply 
with the disclosure requirements of both listing regimes.
Details of the movements in allotted share capital during the 
year, together with the rights and obligations attaching to the 
Company’s shares, are shown in note 4.1 to the consolidated 
financial statements.
There are no restrictions on voting rights of securities in the 
Company. The Notice of AGM specifies deadlines for determining 
attendance and voting entitlements at the AGM.
Where participants in an employee share incentive plan operated 
by the Company are the beneficial owners of shares but not the 
registered owners, the voting rights are normally exercised at the 
discretion of participants.
With the exception of restrictions on the transfer of ordinary 
shares under the Company’s share incentive plans, while the shares 
are subject to the rules of the plan, there are no restrictions which 
exist on the transfer or holding of securities in the Company under 
its Articles of Association and there are no shares carrying special 
rights with regards to the control of the Company.
Subject to the Articles of Association and provisions of relevant 
statutes, the Board may exercise all powers of the Company.
Acquisition of own shares
At the AGM of the Company held on 31 January 2017 a 
resolution was passed that the Directors were authorised to 
purchase up to a maximum of 88,153,185 ordinary shares 
representing approximately 10% of the issued ordinary share 
capital. A renewal of authority will be sought at the 2018 AGM. 
Further information is set out in the Notice of AGM.
Political donations
The Group did not give any money for political purposes nor did it 
make any political donations to political parties or other political 
organisations, or to any independent election candidates, or incur 
any political expenditure during the year. At the Annual General 
Meeting in 2017, shareholders gave authority under Part 14 of 
the Companies Act to make political donations and incur political 
expenditure up to a maximum aggregate amount of £100,000. 
This authorisation was sought for prudence as it is the Group’s 
policy not to make any political donations to political parties or 
incur political expenditure within the ordinary meaning of those 
words. Given the wide definition of donations and expenditure 
within the Companies Act, activities which form part of the regular 
operations of the Group such as communicating with government 
at local, national and European level and funding events to which 
politicians are invited, may be covered.

equal opportunities in the training, promotion and general career 
development of disabled persons.

Going concern
The Group’s Directors have made an assessment of the Group’s 
ability to continue as a going concern and are satisfied that the 
Group has the resources to continue in business for the 
foreseeable future.
The Group’s use of the going concern basis for preparation of the 
accounts is discussed in note 1.4 of the Group’s consolidated 
financial statements.
Viability statement
Viability 
In accordance with the Code, the Directors have assessed 
the prospects of the Group over a three-year period to 
30 September 2020. 
The Directors have determined that a three-year period is an 
appropriate period over which to perform the assessment. This is 
the period over which forecasts have a greater level of certainty. 
The Board monitors a longer-term strategic and financial plan which 
extends beyond the three-year period. This longer-term strategic 
and financial plan provides less certainty of outcome, but provides a 
robust planning tool against which strategic decisions can be made. 
In making this assessment the Directors have considered a wide 
range of information, including the Directors’ robust review and 
challenge of the outcomes of the latest ICAAP and the ILAAP, 
which assess the Group’s future projections of capital adequacy, 
liquidity and funding. The Board has also considered the results of 
stress testing which is performed.
Furthermore, the Directors have considered the current state of 
the balance sheet, principal and emerging risks which could impact 
the performance of the Group and the Group’s strategic and 
financial plan which includes future projections of profitability 
alongside capital funding and liquidity in a manner aligned to the 
ICAAP and ILAAP. The strategic and financial plan makes certain 
assumptions about the performance of the Group and the 
economic, market and regulatory environments in which it 
operates. To support the planning process, downside scenario 
analysis has been performed to consider how the Group’s 
performance would be affected by changing economic and 
market conditions throughout the planning period. 
Information relevant to this assessment can be found in the 
following sections of the Annual Report and Accounts: 
 – a financial summary, including a review of the latest income 
statement and balance sheet is provided in the Financial results 
section pages 38 to 48; 
 – the Group’s capital position is included in the balance sheet 
and prudential regulation risks section of the Risk report pages 
154 to 160; 
 – the Group’s liquidity position is described in the balance sheet 
and prudential regulation risks section of the Risk report pages 
160 to 167; 
 – the Group’s principal risks and policies and processes for 
managing those risks are described in the Strategic report 
on page 19; 
 – the Group’s business model and strategy are described in the 
Strategic report pages 10 to 13; and 
 – the Group’s approach to stress testing and reverse stress 
testing are described in the Risk report on page 135. 
Based upon this assessment, the Directors have concluded that 
there is a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to 
continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over 
the three years to 30 September 2020.

Directors’ report
Change of control
The Group is not party to any significant agreements that are 
subject to change of control provisions in the event of a takeover 
bid, other than the following:
 – A Conduct Indemnity Deed with NAB under which NAB has 
agreed, subject to certain limitations, to provide CYBG with a 
capped indemnity in respect of certain historic liabilities relating 
to relevant conduct matters (as defined therein). The capped 
indemnity will not automatically cease to apply nor will it 
automatically terminate upon any takeover. However, prior to 
any change of control, the parties must cooperate in good faith 
to facilitate an assessment by the PRA to determine whether 
the capped indemnity should continue at the same amount or 
whether it should be terminated in whole or part. Any such 
assessment will be at the sole discretion of the PRA.
There is a very small number of senior colleagues who are entitled 
to an enhanced redundancy payment if redundancy arises within 
the initial period of employment and is a result of a change of 
control. The Group has share schemes under which change of 
control may apply, albeit this is not considered to be significant.
Statement of Directors’ responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and 
the Group and Company financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial 
statements for each financial year. Under that law, they are 
required to prepare the Group financial statements in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted 
by the EU and applicable law and have elected to prepare the 
parent company financial statements on the same basis. Under 
company law the Directors must not approve the financial 
statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair 
view of the state of affairs of the Group and Company and of the 
profit or loss of the Group and Company for that year. In preparing 
these financial statements the Directors are required to:
 – select suitable accounting policies in accordance with 
International Accounting Standard (IAS) 8: Accounting Policies, 
Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors and then apply 
them consistently;
 – present information, including accounting policies, in a manner 
that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable 
information;
 – provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific 
requirements of IFRSs is insufficient to enable users to 
understand the impact of particular transactions, other events 
and conditions on the financial performance; and
 – state that the Group and Company have complied with IFRSs, 
subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in 
the financial statements.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Group and 
Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy 
at any time the financial position of the Group and Company 
and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply 
with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for 
safeguarding the assets of the Group and Company and hence 
for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection 
of fraud and other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, the Directors are also 
responsible for preparing a Strategic report, Directors’ report, 
Directors’ remuneration report and Corporate governance 
statement that comply with that law and those regulations.
Responsibility statement of the Directors in 
respect of the Annual Report and Accounts
The Directors confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
 – the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the 
applicable set of accounting standards, give a true and fair view 
of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the 
Company and the Group and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole; and
 – the Strategic report includes a fair review of the development 
and performance of the business and the position of the 
Company and the Group, together with a description of the 
principal risks and uncertainties that they face.
The Directors consider the Annual Report and Accounts, taken 
as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the 
information necessary for shareholders to assess the Company’s 
and Group’s position and performance, business model and strategy.
Independent auditor and audit information
In accordance with section 485 of the Companies Act 2006, a 
resolution to reappoint Ernst & Young LLP, and to authorise the 
Audit Committee to agree their remuneration, will be proposed 
at the next AGM.
The Directors who were members of the Board at the time of 
approving the Report of the Directors are listed on page 53. 
Having made enquiries of fellow Directors and of the Group’s 
auditor, each of these Directors confirms that:
 – to the best of each Director’s knowledge and belief, there is no 
information relevant to the preparation of their report of which 
the Group’s auditor is unaware; and
 – each Director has taken all the steps a Director might 
reasonably be expected to have taken to be aware of relevant 
audit information and to establish that the Group’s auditor is 
aware of that information.

RISK REPORT
Risk report 128
Risk classes 137
Strategic report Governance Financial results Risk report Financial statements Additional information CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 128
 Effective management of risk is a key capability 
for a successful financial services provider and is 
fundamental to the Group’s strategy. The Group 
has continued to advance and strengthen its risk 
capabilities, evolving in line with industry 
developments and best practice.   
Risk principles
The Group’s approach to risk management is based on the 
principle that risk management capability must be embedded 
across all areas of the Group to be effective. This overriding 
principle embodies the following concepts:
 – commercial decisions are made on the basis of proactive 
consideration of risk and the potential impact on customers;
 – business managers use the RMF to support decision making 
involving risk and reward trade-offs; and
 – colleagues are responsible for risk management in their day 
to day activities.
Risk culture
Central to the Group’s risk culture is the fair treatment of 
customers and meeting obligations to stakeholders, including 
shareholders, regulators and colleagues. The Board and senior 
management are responsible for setting and clearly 
communicating a strong risk culture through their actions 
and words, and proactively addressing any identified areas 
of weakness or concern.
Culture is shaped by many aspects including tangible components 
such as: the Group’s code of conduct; operating principles; policies; 
standards; the risk management operating model; and an approved 
articulation of risk appetite that aligns to, and supports, the 
strategic objectives of the Group. The Group strives to instil a 
culture that supports compliance with all relevant laws, codes and 
policies and builds constructive regulatory relationships.
Initiatives that support appropriate risk culture include: the 
performance management framework; the formal whistleblowing 
framework that allows colleagues, in confidence and anonymously, 
to raise concerns about matters of conduct; and messaging from 
the CEO and members of the Executive Leadership Team 
emphasising the importance of risk identification, management 
and mitigation.
Underpinning the RMF and at the heart of the Group’s risk culture, 
is the concept of personal accountability for risk management at 
source. This is enabled through a risk management accountability 
model and a formal delegation framework through which 
colleagues are able to make risk based decisions.
Risk strategy
The Group has a clearly defined strategy in order to manage and 
mitigate risk in the daily course of its business. The strategy 
consists of:
 – ensuring all principal and emerging risks are identified 
and assessed;
 – ensuring risk appetite is clearly articulated and influences the 
Group’s strategic plan;
 – a clearly defined risk culture which emphasises risk management 
throughout all areas of the business while maintaining 
independent oversight;
 – ongoing analysis of the environment in which the Group 
operates to proactively address potential risk issues as they 
arise; and
 – supporting commercial decisions and people with appropriate 
risk processes, systems and controls.
Risk appetite statement (RAS)
Risk Appetite is defined as the level and types of risk the Group 
is willing to assume within the boundaries of its risk capacity to 
achieve its strategic objectives. The RAS articulates and supports 
communication of the Group’s appetite to stakeholders. This is 
important as it provides the definitive view of risk taking activity 
the Board is comfortable that the Group undertakes and allows 
decision makers (including those with delegated authority and also 
those providing oversight) to exercise judgement with greater 
confidence and speed.
The RAS aligns to the risks identified and defined in the RMF. The 
design and structure of the RAS has taken into consideration best 
practice articulated by the European Central Bank which is aimed 
at ensuring Boards should be strongly involved in the validation 
process and monitoring of the RAS.
The Group’s RAS is prepared by the Group CRO with 
consideration of the strategic objectives and business model, as 
well as the environment in which the Group operates. Monthly 
reporting to Executive Committees and Board includes details of 
performance against relevant RAS settings, breaches and trends.

Risk policies and procedures
The policy framework is a key component of the Group’s RMF 
providing structure and governance for the consistent, effective 
management of policies. In developing the policy framework the 
Group sets the tone that demonstrates the risk culture expected 
across the organisation. This aligns with the behavioural 
expectations for all colleagues which form a core part of our 
performance management approach. Policy statements and 
supporting policy standards define the minimum control 
requirements which must be observed across the Group 
to manage material sources of risk within risk appetite.
Achievements in 2017 
Progressing the IRB journey:
In April 2017 the Group submitted an application to the PRA for 
permission to adopt the IRB approach for the calculation of Credit 
Risk Weighted Assets (RWAs). The Group is now in active dialogue 
with the PRA in relation to the application. The IRB programme is 
also supporting changes in the Collective Provision calculations 
required by IFRS 9 which will be adopted on 1 October 2018; 
the programme is on track to commence parallel-run activities 
in early FY2018. (For further information on IFRS 9, please 
refer to page 194).
Transitional Service Agreement (TSA) exits:
Significant progress has been made with the build and 
implementation of a new Credit Risk Engine, to support the TSA 
exit strategy and also to support the IRB programme. The new 
Credit Risk Engine is now well into parallel-run, with successful 
delivery on schedule.
Investing in risk capabilities:
Following the appointment of the Group Chief Risk Officer 
(CRO) in September 2016, the Risk Management function has 
restructured to enable a stronger and more granular focus 
on specific categories of Risk. In addition, several external 
appointments have been made which have strengthened the 
Risk team’s capabilities, introduced a broader range of external 
experience and a variety of succession options.
Supporting sustainable growth and operational resilience:
Progressive change continues to be made to support sustainable 
growth. This has included actions to influence safe lending growth; 
enhanced policies and controls around regulatory, prudential and 
operational disciplines, including implementation of improvements 
to the Group’s resilience framework. These enhancements have 
enabled the Group’s digital strategies as well as providing proactive 
support to achieve a number of the efficiencies and enhancements 
to the customer journeys, ensuring the Group provides a 
continuity of service for critical processes.
Embedding the RMF:
The Group rolled out a revised RMF at the start of FY2017. Across 
the year there has been a focus on embedding the RMF with 
actions taken across all three Lines of Defence to align to and 
enhance practices to ensure the RMF has been progressively 
adopted into routine risk processes and practices. Risk reporting, 
for example, to the Executive and Board Risk Committees, has also 
been improved, to ensure that risk owners in the 1st Line of 
Defence are monitoring, remediating and reporting their own risks 
in line with the responsibilities defined within the Senior Managers 
Regime. Risk reporting has also incorporated an increasingly 
forward looking perspective with a greater focus on not only 
principal risks but also on emerging risks through the 
implementation of a ‘Top & Emerging Risks’ dashboard.
Risk appetite setting:
The approach to Risk Appetite setting was assessed during the 
year with a number of improvements now adopted within the 
Board approved RAS for FY2018. This includes: an increase in 
the number of measures; greater coverage of all risk categories, 
particularly covering non-financial risks; and a tiered approach 
to the monitoring of RAS limits to provide earlier warning of 
any potential breaches.
Priorities for 2018
IRB journey
The Group will continue to work towards achieving approval 
to adopt the IRB approach, alongside delivering IFRS 9 
implementation. 
Digitisation and raising cyber awareness
As the industry and environment in which the Group operates 
evolves, the Group’s digital operations continue to be developed 
through new systems, enhanced monitoring including threat 
monitoring for potential cyber attacks or increase in fraud related 
activity. The Group continues to streamline processes, whilst 
raising awareness of potential threats to the Group through 
training and education, stress testing and ongoing assurance 
reviews of key controls, including the management of third party 
suppliers.
Transitional Service Agreement (TSA) exits:
Priorities for early FY2018 include actions to fully implement 
the new Credit Risk Engine, cease the reliance on NAB in relation 
to the calculation of RWAs and the delivery of the Treasury 
Management System. 
Regulatory change
The Group continues to embrace the changing regulatory 
environment and will remain fully compliant with all applicable 
current and future regulations. This includes specific requirements 
such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the 
Group has, for example, recently taken steps to enhance 
capabilities in this area by appointing a Group Data Protection 
Officer (DPO) as a direct report of the Group CRO.
PSD2 changes start to come into effect in January 2018.  In 
addition to enhanced protection for consumers, PSD2 opens up 
the competitive landscape and in doing so introduces risk for 
traditional financial services firms.  A specific material risk for the 
Group is disintermediation by third parties.  PSD2 also introduces 
more stringent regulatory requirements for complaint handling 
and customer authentication increasing the risk of failure to meet 
regulatory expectations.  The Group is well placed to meet the 
new requirements and is actively adapting its strategy in light of 
the increased competition and disintermediation risk. CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 130
Risk report
Risk report
Through 2018 the Group will be taking steps to ensure 
compliance with ‘ring fencing’ legislation that will take effect 
from 1 January 2019. The Group will achieve compliance with 
the legislation with no material changes to its business operations 
or corporate structure, and with very little impact on the Group’s 
customers. The Group is aware of material changes that other firms 
will need to make and will support our customers to understand the 
impact that changes made by other firms may have on them.
Balance sheet risks
The Group remains focussed on maintaining balance sheet 
strength with particular attention being paid to regulatory 
developments including the Countercyclical Capital Buffer (CCyB) 
and MREL. Underpinning this will be a focus on capital, including 
capital management and any efficiencies that can be applied. The 
Group will continue to manage its liquidity requirements and 
funding profile in a prudent manner.
Risk Management Framework (RMF)
While considerable progress has been made during FY2017, work 
will continue in this regard through FY2018. There will be a 
continual review, with external support to incorporate industry 
benchmarking, with any required revisions to be made quickly, 
reflecting the ongoing and fast pace of change as new risks 
emerge and evolve.
Cyber and resilience
In addition to the ongoing assessment of the RMF, specific 
consideration will be given to the oversight and monitoring of the 
risks relative to both cyber security and cybercrime and, in turn, 
the resilience of the Group’s systems and processes.
Growth and efficiency
The Group continues to drive growth in the lending portfolios. 
Appetite settings will be monitored to ensure controlled growth, 
and regulatory guidance relative to areas such as consumer lending 
will be considered and addressed. Equally, initiatives to deliver 
efficiencies and simplification across the Group will be subject to 
continued risk assessment.
Principal risk categories
See page 19 in the Strategic Report for details on the Group’s 
principal risk categories.
Emerging risks
The Group monitors the environment in which it operates to 
identify emerging risks that may have an impact on its operations 
and strategy. The Group currently considers its top emerging risks 
to be: 
Macroeconomic environment
With a customer base that remains predominantly UK based, 
the Group is exposed to inherent risks arising from increased 
geopolitical uncertainty, which has the potential to impact the UK 
macroeconomic outlook. The banking sector may be placed under 
increasing pressure as it is exposed to risks relative to credit 
conditions which may impact the financial performance of the 
Group. The Group’s credit portfolios will continue to be monitored 
closely with appetite adjusted where appropriate and risk sensitivity 
analysis conducted on an ongoing basis. Regular assessments 
of strategic plans are undertaken to minimise and negate 
potential impacts. 
The UK vote to leave the EU (Brexit)
The Group continues to monitor developments regarding the 
UK’s withdrawal from the European Union and the potential 
consequences for our customers, products and operating model. 
As the period of economic uncertainty and market volatility 
persists, the Group will continue to monitor and assess the external 
implications and re-evaluate our mitigating actions as appropriate. 
Consumer credit
The Group maintains an awareness of the risk of significant 
unforeseen credit losses occurring within a short time period 
which has the potential to have a detrimental impact on earnings 
and profitability, Credit risk strategies, appetite and tolerance levels 
are reviewed and approved by the Board and regular monitoring of 
the credit portfolio, including risk sensitivity analysis and reviews of 
asset quality metrics, is undertaken to ensure early identification 
and mitigation of potential risk areas. Early identification and 
mitigation of risks is an area of considerable regulatory focus and 
one where the Group is particularly alert to the potential 
regulatory, economic and customer impacts. 
Cyber security and IT
The Group, in line with the industry, is subject to increasing levels of 
attempted cyber-attack, with criminal groups employing increasingly 
sophisticated knowledge of financial markets and internal activities/
processes, leading to potential reputational and financial detriment. 
The Group continues to invest in and enhance its information 
security capabilities, monitoring the external/internal threat 
landscape and the changing risk profile of the business. 
Financial crime (including cybercrime)
The Group is exposed to the risk of its products and services being 
used to facilitate crime against its customers, third parties or the 
Group itself. The management of Financial Crime remains a key 
area of regulatory focus and the Group continues to enhance 
its framework for monitoring, management and mitigation of 
financial crime. 
Regulatory change
The Group, in common with the financial services industry as a 
whole, continues to face a significant agenda of regulatory and 
legislative change, including those pertaining to taxes. Compliance 
with the developing regulation remains a key focus. The Group 
continues to monitor the emerging requirements and ensure  
it is well placed to respond with effective regulatory change 
management. Specific forthcoming changes, such as Open 
Banking and PSD2, bring both risk and opportunity to the 
competitive environment in which the Group operates. Senior 
management is considering the strategic impacts of these  
changes for the Group (for further detail on key regulatory 
changes impacting the Group please see page 17). CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 131

Risk governance and oversight
The Group’s risk governance structure strengthens risk 
evaluation and management, while also positioning the Group 
to manage the changing regulatory environment in an efficient 
and effective manner. 
The Group’s risk management is governed via a series of 
committees, as represented within the diagram which follows.
During the year the Group commenced a review of the executive 
governance committee layer in the risk governance structure to 
ensure it balances regulatory, legal and compliance obligations 
while making timely, customer focused decisions that drive the 
business forward with any changes expected to be made during 
2018 to ensure the framework is both optimal and efficient.

Risk report
Risk report
Three Lines of Defence
Effective operation of a Three Lines of Defence model is integral 
to the Group’s approach to risk management and is based on the 
overriding principle that risk capability must be embedded within 
the first line of defence teams to be effective. This principle 
embodies the following concepts:
 – commercial decisions are made on the basis of proactive 
consideration of risk and the impact on customers;
 – risk management activities are focused on enhancing 
sustainable business performance;
 – management must use the RMF to support decision making 
involving risk and reward trade-offs;
 – regular assessments are undertaken to confirm the 
effectiveness of the risk and control frameworks in relation 
to both the current and emerging risk profile; and
 – risk management responsibilities are clearly understood by all 
colleagues when carrying out their day to day activities.
Control is exercised through a clearly defined delegation 
of authority, with communication and escalation channels 
throughout the Group.
Internal Audit
Internal Audit’s role is to provide 
independent assurance over the 
governance, risk management and 
control framework.
Risk Management
The risk management team under the 
Group CRO independently monitors 
and systematically assesses the Group’s 
risk profile against established risk 
appetite parameters. Risk management 
also develops and defines the Group’s 
RMF. They also assist the first line 
business units in the design and 
implementation of appropriate risk 
management policies and strategies and 
work with the business units to promote 
awareness of the need to manage risk.
Business and enterprise assurance
Responsibility for risk management 
resides with the business unit director in 
each area. They are each responsible for 
ensuring that they have adequate risk 
coverage and processes in place to 
ensure they are managing the risks they 
own within risk appetite and within the 
guidelines of the RMF. A monthly report 
of key risks, issues and horizon risks is 
provided to the Executive Risk 
Committee. The enterprise assurance 
function focuses on end-to-end 
assurance of key processes as well as 
ensuring risks and controls are being 
managed appropriately. Reporting is 
provided to each business unit director 
as appropriate and to the Executive Risk 
Committee.

Strategic report Governance Financial results Risk report Financial statements Additional information
Stress testing 
Stress testing is an important and recognised risk management 
tool, used to assess the vulnerability of financial institutions 
through the modelling of adverse scenarios. The Group 
undertakes stress testing, following the Basel Committee 
principles, and utilising, where appropriate, scenarios provided 
by the PRA, aimed at understanding potential impacts arising 
from adverse conditions relevant to its business and to aid the 
development and understanding of potential management 
actions and contingency plans. 
Stress testing forms an integral part of the overall governance and 
risk management culture. Involvement from the Board and senior 
management in the stress-testing programme is essential for its 
effective operation. 
Methodology
Stress testing within the Group complies with regulatory 
requirements and is subject to a rigorous review and challenge 
process. The Group’s approach ensures that a clear link exists 
between the economic scenarios and stress-testing outputs, 
supported by a structured review and sign off process.
While the stress testing process is underpinned by models, it is also 
reliant on judgements made by senior management and key 
personnel across the Group who:
 – manage the macroeconomic scenario process and prepare and 
review stressed business plans;
 – prepare and review credit stress outputs including impairment 
charges, RWAs and write offs;
 – provide funding and liquidity impacts and construct capital plans 
based on the outcomes of stress testing; and
 – guide on potential management actions in response to stress 
scenario mitigation.
Reverse stress testing
Reverse stress testing requires a different approach. It starts from 
an outcome of business failure and identifies instances where this 
might occur. Severe but plausible scenarios with an unacceptably 
high risk are used to inform business planning to prevent or 
mitigate specific business risks. Reverse stress tests are also utilised 
as the start point for recovery and resolution planning scenarios. 
The Group also monitors a range of early warning indicators to 
give management early visibility of potential risks that could give 
rise to the need to invoke actions in recovery plans.
Stress testing within the Group’s risk governance  
and capital framework
Stress testing outputs are used to inform the strategic planning 
process and the RAS. The plan is subjected to sensitivity analysis, 
forming a key element of the planning process from an overall risk 
assessment perspective, and provides the Board with further detail 
when looking to approve the plan. 
Stress testing informs the assessment and quantification of risk 
exposures in the course of calculating capital requirements  
as part of the ICAAP. The Group runs a number of adverse 
macroeconomic stresses in order to determine the impacts on 
the Group’s financial and capital position, considering changes to 
impairments, margins, volumes and costs relative to the base case 
plan and considers the actions which the Group may choose to 
deploy in response to such events materialising. 
Stress testing is also a key feature of the ILAAP where stress-
testing scenarios are modelled regularly to provide insight into 
potential vulnerabilities in the Group’s funding and liquidity 
strategies. Stress-testing results of liquidity are also reported 
to ALCO on a monthly basis. 
The Executive Leadership Team and Board engages at critical 
points of the stress-testing cycle to provide a robust challenge 
in relation to the selection and development of scenarios and, 
thereafter, considers how the results are integrated into future 
strategic decision making, contingency planning, capital and 
business planning and risk appetite. 
In advance of Board submission, ALCO reviews the scenarios, 
assumptions and results of liquidity and capital stress testing 
and provides an initial review and challenge of outputs.
Risk management and internal controls 
Assessment of principal risks
The Board is responsible for determining the nature and extent of 
the principal risks it is willing to take in order to achieve its strategic 
objectives. 
In line with the UK Corporate Governance Code (the Code) 
requirements, the Directors have performed a robust assessment 
of the principal risks facing the Group, including those that would 
threaten its business model and future performance, solvency 
or liquidity. 
The principal risks the Group actively monitors and manages are 
described on page 19 of the Strategic report.
Risk management and internal controls
The Board actively monitors the Group’s risk management and 
internal control systems. A review of the effectiveness of those 
systems has been performed incorporating all material controls, 
including financial, operational and compliance controls. CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 136 Strategic report Governance Financial results Risk report Financial statements Additional information

Risk report
Credit risk
Strongly performing credit 
portfolios, well positioned  
for growth
Close monitoring, robust policies and a  
well-controlled framework support the 
credit operations of the Group.
Credit risk is the risk that a borrower or counterparty fails to pay 
the interest or capital due on a loan or other financial instrument.
Credit risk manifests itself in the financial instruments and/or 
products that the Group offers, and those in which the Group 
invests (including, among others, loans, guarantees, credit-related 
commitments, letters of credit, acceptances, inter-bank 
transactions, foreign exchange transactions, swaps and bonds). 
Credit risk can be found both on- and off-balance sheet.
Risk appetite
The Group controls the levels of credit risk it takes by placing limits 
on the amount of risk accepted in relation to one borrower, or 
group of borrowers, and to geographical, product and industry 
segments. The management of credit risk within the Group is 
achieved through both approval and monitoring of individual 
transactions, regular asset quality analysis of the performance of 
the various credit risk portfolios, and the independent oversight 
of credit portfolios across the Group.
Credit strategies and policies
Credit risks associated with lending are managed through the 
application of detailed lending policies and standards which outline 
the approach to lending, underwriting criteria, credit mandates, 
concentration limits and product terms. The Group maintains 
a dynamic approach to credit management and aims to take 
necessary steps if individual issues are identified or if credit 
performance deteriorates, or is expected to deteriorate, due 
to borrower, economic or sector-specific weaknesses.
Roles and responsibilities for the management, monitoring and 
mitigation of credit risk within the Group are clearly defined in 
line with the Group’s RMF.
Significant credit risk strategies and policies are approved, and 
reviewed annually, by the Credit Risk Committee. For complex 
credit products and services, the Head of Business Risk, Head of 
Retail Risk and Credit Risk Committee provide a policy framework 
which identifies and quantifies risks and establishes the means of 
mitigating such risks. These policies and frameworks are delegated 
to, and disseminated under the guidance and control of, executive 
management, with appropriate oversight through governance 
committees.
Exposures
Credit risk exposures are categorised as Retail (secured and 
unsecured) and SME.
In terms of loans and advances, credit risk arises both from 
amounts loaned and commitments to extend credit to customers. 
To ensure appropriate credit limits exist, especially for SME lending, 
a single large exposure policy is in place within the Group and 
forms part of the risk appetite measures that are monitored and 
reported on a monthly basis. The overall composition and quality 
of credit portfolio exposures are monitored and periodically 
reported to the Board and, where required, to the relevant 
supervisory authorities.
Exposures are also managed in accordance with the large 
exposure reporting requirements of the CRR.
Unless otherwise noted, the amount that best represents the 
maximum credit exposure at the reporting date is the carrying 
value of the financial asset.
Measurement
The Group uses statistical models to measure credit risk 
exposures. Models are supported by both internal and 
external data.
The probability of default (PD) (that borrowers will not meet their 
contractual obligations), current exposures, and the likely loss ratio 
on defaulted obligations are calculated to measure and mitigate 
credit risk.
Portfolios are assessed using segmentation for measurement, 
reporting and monitoring purposes.
Subject to regulatory approval, the Group is progressing toward 
attaining permission to use IRB models to measure the credit risk 
of loans and advances to customers.
Meantime, all exposures are measured under the standardised 
approach for regulatory capital.

the impairment of financial assets and the calculation

Risk report
Credit risk
The Group’s appetite for lending is strictly defined and adhered to 
and the strength of the loan book is underpinned by the continued 
focus on, and maintenance of, high underwriting standards plus 
early and proactive identification of customers experiencing 
financial difficulty. The strong lending growth in the year has been 
delivered in the context of a benign economic environment, which 
together have contributed to a reduction in the level of impaired 
loans from £233m to £179m and resulted in the 90+ DPD plus 
impaired asset ratio falling from 1.27% to 1.06%. While a level of 
sensitivity to economic shocks remains, no material effects have 
yet been observed, however, it is accepted a more challenging 
credit environment is likely to lead to increased impairment from 
the current low levels. 
The increase in impairment charge, from £39m to £48m, reflects a 
modest increase in charges taken on our unsecured Retail portfolios 
together with impairment of a small number of historically originated 
SME exposures. Excluding the individually significant provisions, the 
underlying level of impairment within the portfolio has remained 
stable with no sign of material deterioration.  The cost of risk has 
consequently increased by 5bps, but remains low relative to the 
size of the portfolio.
Within the Retail portfolio, the level of impaired mortgage lending 
remains modest against a growing book. This reflects the strong 
credit quality of the portfolio, supported by the low interest 
rate environment and stable house price indices. The level of  
90+ DPD has seen a marginal increase for both secured 
and unsecured portfolios. 
SME asset quality measures continued to improve reflective of the 
focus on responsible credit decisions and controlled risk appetite 
which leads to a well-balanced and diverse portfolio. This portfolio 
will be most susceptible to any material economic downturns 
following Brexit, in particular any industry specific shocks, 
e.g. agriculture. 
The ratio of total provisions to customer loans reduced by 10bps 
to 0.69% in the year, driven by the reduced level of specific 
provisions held for amortised cost and lower collective provision 
for assets held at fair value. The continued growth in the portfolio 
has also influenced the decrease in ratio.

The table below shows the maximum exposure to credit risk, 
including derivatives. The maximum exposure is shown gross,

Mitigation
The management and mitigation of credit risk within the Group 
is achieved through both approval and monitoring of individual 
transactions and asset quality, analysis of the performance of 
the various credit risk portfolios, and the independent oversight 
of credit portfolios across the Group. Portfolio monitoring 
techniques cover such areas as product, industry or geographic 
concentrations and delinquency trends.
There is regular analysis of the borrower’s ability to meet their 
interest and capital repayment obligations with early support and 
mitigation steps taken where required. Credit risk mitigation is also 
supported, in part, by obtaining collateral, and corporate and 
personal guarantees where appropriate. CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 141
Strategic report Governance Financial results Risk report Financial statements Additional information
Other mitigating measures are described below:
Specialist expertise
Credit quality is managed and monitored by skilled teams including, 
where required, specialists who provide dedicated support for 
customers experiencing financial difficulty.
Credit decisions utilise credit scoring techniques and manual 
underwriting, as appropriate. These tasks are performed by skilled 
and competent specialists acting within agreed delegated authority 
levels set in accordance with their experience and capabilities.
Credit policy and adherence to policy standards
Specialist teams oversee credit portfolio performance as well as 
adherence to credit risk policies and standards. Activities include 
targeted risk-based reviews, providing an assessment of the 
effectiveness of internal controls and risk management practices. 
Bespoke assignments are also undertaken in response to 
emerging risks and regulatory requirements. Independent 
assurance reviews are also regularly undertaken by Internal Audit.
Portfolio oversight
Portfolios of credit and related risk exposures and the key 
benchmarks, behaviours and characteristics by which those 
portfolios are managed in terms of credit risk exposures, are 
regularly reviewed. This entails the production and analysis of regular 
portfolio monitoring reports for review by senior management.
Controls over rating systems
The Group has an Independent Model Validation Unit that sets 
common minimum standards. The standards are designed to 
ensure risk models and associated rating systems are developed 
consistently, and are of sufficient quality to support business 
decisions and meet regulatory requirements.
Stress testing
Stress test scenarios are regularly prepared with the outcomes 
reviewed and relevant actions taken. Outputs will typically include 
impairment charges, RWA, and write-offs. Management will 
consider how each stress scenario may impact on different 
components of the credit portfolio. The primary method applied 
uses migration matrices, modelling the impact of PD rating 
migrations and changes in portfolio default rates to changes in 
macroeconomic factors, to obtain a stressed position for the credit 
portfolios. Loss given default (LGD) is stressed based on property 
price movements.
The Group also utilises other instruments and techniques across 
its wider balance sheet. These are summarised below:
Derivatives
The Group maintains control limits on net open derivative 
positions. At any one time, the amount subject to credit risk is 
limited to the current fair value of instruments that are favourable 
to the Group (i.e. assets where their fair value is positive), which, 
in relation to derivatives, may only be a small fraction of the 
contract, or notional values used to express the volume of 
instruments outstanding. This credit risk is managed as part 
of the customers overall exposure together with potential 
exposures from market movements.
Master netting agreements
The Group further restricts its exposure to credit losses by 
entering into master netting arrangements with counterparties 
with whom it undertakes a significant volume of transactions. 
Master netting arrangements do not generally result in an offset 
of balance sheet assets and liabilities, as transactions are usually 
settled on a gross basis. However, credit risk associated with the 
favourable contracts is reduced by a master netting arrangement 
to the extent that, if any counterparty failed to meet its obligations 
in accordance with the agreed terms, all amounts with the 
counterparty are terminated and settled on a net basis. Derivative 
financial instrument contracts are typically subject to the 
International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) master 
netting agreements, as well as Credit Support Annexes (CSA), 
where relevant, around collateral arrangements attached to those 
ISDA agreements. Derivative exchange or clearing counterparty 
agreements exist where contracts are settled via an exchange or 
clearing house.
Credit assessment and mitigation  
for Retail and SME customers
The Group uses a variety of lending criteria when assessing 
applications for Retail customers. The approval process uses credit 
scorecards, as well as manual underwriting, and involves a review 
of an applicant’s previous credit history using information held by 
credit reference agencies.
The Group also assesses the affordability of the borrower under 
stressed scenarios including increased interest rates. In addition, 
the Group has in place quantitative thresholds, such as maximum 
limits on the level of borrowing to income and the ratio of 
borrowing to collateral. Some of these limits relate to internal 
approval levels and others are hard limits above which the Group 
will reject the application.
For residential mortgages, the Group’s policy is to accept only 
standard applications with a LTV less than 95%. The Group has 
maximum percentage LTV limits which depend upon the loan size. 
Product types such as BTL and residential interest-only mortgages 
are controlled by transactional limits covering both LTV and value.
For SME customers, credit risk is managed in accordance with 
lending policies, the Group’s risk appetite and the RMF. Lending 
policies and performance against risk appetite are reviewed 
regularly. Credit risk is further mitigated by focusing on business 
sectors where the Group has specific expertise and through 
limiting exposures on higher value loans and to certain sectors. 
When making credit decisions for SME customers the Group will 
routinely assess the primary source of repayment, most typically 
the cash generated by the customer through its normal trading 
cycle. Secondary sources of repayment are also considered and 
while not the focus of the lending decision, collateral will be taken 
when appropriate. The Group seeks to obtain security cover, and 
where relevant, personal guarantees from borrowers. CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 142

Monitoring
Credit policies and procedures, which are subject to ongoing review, are documented and disseminated in a form that supports the credit 
operations of the Group.
 – Credit Risk Committee (CRC) The CRC ensures that the credit RMF and associated policies remain effective. The Committee has 
oversight of the quality, composition and concentrations of the credit risk portfolio and considers strategies to adjust the portfolio 
to react to changes in market conditions.
 – RAS measures Measures are monitored monthly and reviewed bi-annually, at a minimum, to ensure that the measures accurately 
reflect the Group’s risk appetite, strategy and concerns relative to the wider macro environment. All measures are subject to extensive 
engagement with the Executive Leadership Team and the Board, and are subject to endorsement from executive governance 
committees prior to Board approval. Regulatory engagement is also scheduled as appropriate.
 – Risk concentration Concentration of risk is managed by client/counterparty, product, geographical region and industry sector. In 
addition, single name exposure limits exist to control exposures to a single entity/counterparty. Concentrations are also considered 
through the RAS process focusing particularly on comparing the portfolio against market benchmarks.
 – Single large exposure excesses All excesses are reported to the Transactional Credit Committee (TCC) and relevant Head of Risk. Any 
exposure which continues or is expected to continue beyond 30 days will also be submitted to the TCC with proposals to correct the 
exposure within an agreed period, not to exceed 12 months.

Mitigation and management of credit risk
Credit quality of loans and advances
For SME lending, the Group has an internally developed credit rating system, as defined under the Group’s credit risk management policy, 
which uses data drawn from a number of sources to assess the potential risk in lending to the Group’s customers. This system assigns an 
indication of the PD for each customer and can be broadly mapped to external agencies rating scales. Impaired assets consist of SME 
lending and secured Retail lending where current circumstances indicate that losses of loan principal and/or interest may be incurred.

(1) eCRS – electronic Customer Rating System.
The credit quality of the portfolio of loans and advances that were neither past due nor impaired can be assessed by reference to the 
Group’s standard credit rating system. The credit rating system is supported by a variety of financial analytics, combined with processed 
market information to provide the main inputs for the measurement of counterparty risk. All internal risk ratings are tailored to the 
various categories and are derived in accordance with the Group’s ratings policy.

For Retail lending, the Group has developed specific credit rating systems for both origination of new lending and for ongoing customer 
and account management purposes. These systems assign risk estimates to all Retail lending and enable active management of customer 
exposures and portfolios. CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 145

Collateral
Collateral held as security and other credit enhancements
The Group evaluates each customer’s creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary 
by the Group upon extension of credit, is based on management’s credit evaluation of the counterparty. Collateral held can vary, but 
may include:
 – specific charges over defined assets of the counterparty;
 – a floating charge over all assets and undertakings of an entity, including uncalled capital and called but unpaid capital;
 – specific or interlocking guarantees; and
 – loan agreements which include affirmative and negative covenants and in some instances guarantees of counterparty obligations.
Generally, the Group does not take possession of collateral it holds as security or call on other credit enhancements that would result 
in recognition of an asset on its balance sheet.
It is the Group’s policy to dispose of repossessed properties with the proceeds used to reduce or repay the outstanding balance. 
In general, the Group does not occupy repossessed properties for its own business use.
The LTV ratio of Retail mortgage lending, coupled with the relationship of the debt to customers’ income, is key to the credit quality 
of these loans. The table below sets out the indexed LTV analysis of the Group’s Retail mortgage stock.

Residential mortgages
Residential property is the Group’s main source of collateral and means of mitigating loss in the event of the default credit risk inherent 
in its residential mortgage portfolios. All lending activities are supported by an appropriate form of valuation using either professional or 
indexed (subject to policy rules and confidence levels) valuations.
Commercial property
Commercial property is the Group’s main source of collateral on SME lending and means of mitigating loss in the event of default. 
Collateral for the majority of commercial loans comprises first legal charges over freehold or long leasehold property (including formal 
Companies House registration where appropriate). CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 146
Risk report
Credit risk
Non-property related collateral
In addition to residential and commercial property based security, the Group also takes other forms of collateral when lending. This can 
involve obtaining security against the underlying loan through the use of cash collateral and/or netting agreements, both of which 
reduce the original exposure by the amount of collateral held, subject to volatility and maturity adjustments where applicable.
The Group also operates a policy of obtaining security against the underlying loan via the use of guarantees, which can be either limited 
or unlimited, making the guarantor liable for only a portion or all of the debt.
The following table shows the total non-property collateral held by sector at 30 September in terms of cash, guarantees (these 
guarantors are predominantly other financial institutions who are considered to be of a high credit quality) and netting. The exposure 
amount shown below is the total gross exposure (before any credit risk mitigation and credit conversion factors have been applied where 
applicable) for arrangements which have some form of associated collateral held against it and is not the total exposure for each asset 
class, as disclosed elsewhere in this section.

The increase in cash collateral held and corresponding exposure is due to increased repurchase (repo) and similar transactions  
outstanding at 30 September 2017 (including TFS drawings), reflected within Central Governments or Central Banks. The increase 
in cash collateral held and corresponding exposure in financial institutions is due to an increase in the reimbursement receivable from 
NAB in relation to the conduct indemnity deed (described further in note 3.14).
Corporates is the largest sector utilising other risk mitigation techniques, with all three methods utilised dependent on credit quality. 
The extent to which these will be used is dependent on the specific circumstances of the customer. CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 147
Strategic report Governance Financial results Risk report Financial statements Additional information
Forbearance
Forbearance is considered to take place when the Group grants concessions to assist customers who are experiencing, or who are about 
to experience, difficulties in meeting their financial commitments to the Group. The Group’s forbearance policies and definitions comply 
with the guidance established by the European Banking Authority for financial reporting. Forbearance concessions include the granting 
of more favourable terms and conditions than those provided either at drawdown of the facility or which would not ordinarily be available 
to other customers with a similar risk profile. Forbearance parameters are regularly reviewed and refined as necessary to ensure they are 
consistent with the latest industry guidance and prevailing practice, as well as ensuring that they adequately capture and reflect the most 
recent customer behaviours and market conditions. The Group makes every effort to treat customers fairly and aligns its forbearance 
practices to that principle.
While forbearance alone is not necessarily an indicator of impaired status, it is a trigger for the review of the customer’s credit profile and 
forbearance is only granted when there is a realistic prospect of the customer repaying all facilities in full. If there is any concern over 
future cash flows and the Group incurring a loss, then forborne loans will also be classified as impaired in accordance with the Group’s 
impairment policy.
Exposures classified as forborne and performing at the date forbearance measures are granted, continue to be reported as subject to 
forbearance for a minimum period of two years from that date (the probation period). Exposures classified as forborne and which are 
non-performing when customers were granted forbearance cannot exit non-performing status for a minimum of 12 months from the 
date forbearance was granted, and cannot exit forbearance status for a further two years from the date of returning to performing 
status (three years in total).
The Group has identified a number of situations that in isolation are not considered to be forbearance:
 – facilities that have been temporarily extended pending review and where no concession has been granted for reasons relating to the 
actual or apparent financial stress of a customer;
 – a reduction in asset quality to a level where actual, or apparent, financial stress is not evident;
 – where changes are made to the terms of a borrower’s interest structure or repayment arrangement on a commercial basis; and
 – late provision of financial information, in the absence of other indicators of financial difficulty, is not in all cases considered a non-
commercial breach of non-financial covenants.
For both Retail and SME, where the Group has made a demand for repayment, the customer’s facilities have been withdrawn or where 
a debt repayment process has been initiated, the exposure is classified as forborne if the debt is subject to any of the mentioned 
forbearance concessions.
Retail forbearance
The Group utilises various forbearance measures for retail customers, specific to the individual customer and their circumstances. 
Customers may potentially be subject to more than one forbearance strategy at any one time where this is considered to be the 
most appropriate course of action.
Debt management for mortgage customers in financial difficulty
To support customers who are encountering financial difficulties, cases are managed on an individual basis, with the circumstances of 
each customer considered separately and the action taken judged as being affordable and sustainable for the customer. Operationally, 
the provision and review of such assistance is controlled by various methods. These include the application of an appropriate policy 
framework, controls around the execution of policy, regular review of the different treatments to confirm that they remain appropriate, 
monitoring of customers’ performance including the level of payments received, and management visibility of the nature and extent of 
assistance provided and the associated risk.
Help is provided through the Financial Care Team where tailored repayment programmes can be agreed. Customers are actively 
supported and referred to free money advice agencies when they have multiple credit facilities, including those at other lenders, 
that require restructuring.
One component of the Group’s approach is to contact customers showing signs of financial difficulty to discuss their circumstances 
and offer solutions to prevent their accounts falling into arrears. CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 148

The Group also has a number of customers with interest-only mortgages past maturity, not subject to forbearance. The Group has 
formal processes embedded to proactively track and facilitate prematurity customer engagement to bring the cases to a formal 
conclusion, which is generally aimed to be achieved within six months after the loan has reached maturity. Complex cases can take longer 
than this to reach conclusion. At 30 September 2017, the Group had 97 (2016: 102) customers with interest-only mortgages not subject 
to forbearance and which were post six-month maturity with a total value of £14m (2016: £12m).
A further forbearance reserve of £4m (2016: £4m) is presently held within the overall collective provision. The effect of this on the 
above tables would be to increase the impairment allowance noted above to £12.1m (2016: £13.5m) and to increase overall coverage 
to 3.05% (2016: 3.52%). When all other avenues of resolution including forbearance have been explored, the Group will take steps to 
repossess and sell underlying collateral. In the year to 30 September 2017, there were 50 repossessions of which 13 were voluntary 
(2016: 78 including 27 voluntary).
Retail forbearance – unsecured consumer credit
The Group currently exercises limited forbearance strategies in relation to other types of consumer credit, including current accounts, 
unsecured loans and credit cards. The Group has assessed the total loan balances subject to forbearance on other types of consumer 
credit to be £11m at 30 September 2017 (2016: £14m), representing 1.02% of the unsecured Retail portfolio (2016: 1.33%). 
Impairment provisions on forborne balances totalled £3.1m at 30 September 2017 (2016: £4.2m), providing overall coverage  
of 27.18% (2016: 29.02%). CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 149
Strategic report Governance Financial results Risk report Financial statements Additional information
SME forbearance
Forbearance is considered to exist for SME customers where one or more concessions are granted on a non-commercial basis. The 
Group reports SME forbearance at a customer level and at a value which incorporates all facilities and the related impairment allowance, 
irrespective of whether each individual facility is subject to forbearance. Authority to grant forbearance measures for SME customers is 
held by the Group’s Strategic Business Services unit and is exercised, where appropriate, on the basis of detailed consideration of the 
customer’s financial position and prospects.
Where a customer is part of a larger group, forbearance is exercised and reported across the Group at the individual entity level. Where 
modification of the terms and conditions of an exposure meeting the criteria for classification as forbearance results in derecognition of 
loans and advances from the balance sheet and the recognition of a new exposure, the new exposure shall be treated as forborne.

Impaired Loans which have been individually assessed for impairment as there is objective evidence 
of impairment, including changes in customer circumstances. 
Loans and advances which were past due but not impaired
Loans and advances that are past due but not impaired are classified as such for secured lending, where the net current market value of 
supporting security is sufficient to cover all principal, interest and other amounts (including legal, enforcement, realisation costs etc.) due

Offsetting of financial assets and liabilities
The Group does not have any financial assets or financial liabilities that are offset with the net amount presented on the balance sheet. 
This is because IAS 32 ‘Financial Instruments – Presentation’ states that there should be both an enforceable right to set off and the 
intention either to settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. Neither of these conditions are met 
by the Group. The table below illustrates the amounts for financial instruments that are covered by enforceable netting arrangements 
(i.e. offsetting agreements and any related financial collateral). The table excludes financial instruments not subject to offset and that are 
only subject to collateral arrangements (e.g. loans and advances). CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 153

The net amounts presented in the table are not intended to represent the Group’s exposure to credit risk, as the Group will use a wide 
range of strategies to mitigate credit risk in addition to netting and collateral.

Risk report
Balance sheet and prudential regulation risks
Strong foundations supporting 
resilience and growth
A robust balance sheet position underpinned by 
the alignment of risk appetite to strategy and a 
proactive approach to addressing the impact of 
changing regulatory obligations.
Balance sheet risks in the financial services industry are highly 
regulated with ongoing changes in the regulatory environment 
expected to influence the risks and their management. The key 
risks include capital, liquidity and funding risks, market risk which 
in the case of the Group is non-traded market risk (incorporating 
interest rate and foreign exchange risks), pension risk and non-
traded equity risk.
Risk appetite
The primary objective for the management of balance sheet risks 
is to maintain the risk profile within approved risk limits, to maintain 
the confidence of the Group’s customers and other stakeholders. 
Balance sheet risks are also managed to protect current and future 
earnings from the impact of market volatility. The Group applies a 
prudent approach to balance sheet risks in order to safeguard the 
ongoing strength and resilience of the balance sheet.
Risk appetite is approved for balance sheet risks by the Board, with 
authority delegated to ALCO for subsequent implementation and 
monitoring. The Board has established a range of measures of risk 
appetite for capital including CET1, leverage and minimum holdings 
of capital. Measures for funding and liquidity risks consider the 
structure of the balance sheet and include, among others, 
measures relating to the proportion of customer funding, the 
Group’s overall funding profile and an overall liquidity adequacy 
rule (OLAR). The OLAR covers the Board’s appetite in relation to 
regulatory liquidity requirements and also covers the need to 
maintain access to liquidity resources sufficient to accommodate 
outflows of funds in a range of stress scenarios over a three-
month period.
The Group’s participation in wholesale markets, along with its 
use of financial instruments, is to fund its banking activities and 
to manage the liquidity and interest rate risks arising from these 
activities. The Group establishes an appetite for these risks based 
on an overriding principle that the Group will not engage in 
proprietary risk taking.
Capital
Capital is held by the Group to protect its depositors, to cover 
inherent risks in a normal and stressed operating environment and 
to support the Group’s strategy of sustainable growth. Capital risk 
is the risk that the Group has insufficient quantity or quality of 
capital to support its operations.
Mitigation measures
The Group’s Capital Risk Policy Standard provides the framework 
for the manner in which capital is managed within the Group. The 
objectives of the policy standard are to manage efficiently the 
capital base to optimise shareholder returns while maintaining 
robust capital adequacy, meeting regulators’ requirements, 
managing the ratings agencies’ assessment of the Group and 
ensuring that excessive leverage is not taken. A shortfall in capital 
resources would occur when the Group exceeds its risk appetite 
and is at risk of not having sufficient capital to support future 
growth objectives.
  CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 155
Strategic report Governance Financial results Risk report Financial statements Additional information
Measurement
The Group manages capital in accordance with prudential rules 
issued by the PRA and FCA, which implemented CRD IV legislation 
with effect from 1 January 2014. The Group’s approach to Pillar 1 
is to use the standardised approaches to calculating RWAs. The 
standardised approaches are inherently conservative and the 
Group is developing the capability to utilise IRB methods for the 
calculation of credit risk capital. A waiver to utilise IRB models was 
submitted to the PRA during 2017.
A rigorous approach is taken to assess risks that are not adequately 
covered by Pillar 1, including interest rate risk and pension risk. The 
Group also undertakes a range of stress scenarios in order to test 
the impact on capital arising from severe yet plausible scenarios. 
These approaches to capital are thoroughly documented in the 
Group’s ICAAP and this is subject to review, challenge and approval 
by the Board.
Capital buffers
The regulatory capital buffer framework is intended to ensure 
firms maintain a sufficient amount of capital above their regulatory 
minimum in order to withstand periods of stress. The UK is 
implementing the provisions on capital buffers outlined in the CRD 
to create combined capital buffers including a Capital Conservation 
Buffer (CCB); a Countercyclical Capital Buffer (CCyB); a Global 
Systemically Important Institution Buffer; and a Systemic Risk 
Buffer (SRB). In the UK, the CCB has been introduced with 
transitional provisions from 2016 (0.625%) to 2019 (2.5%).
The CCyB has been effective from 1 May 2014 and is  
dependent upon the BoE view of credit conditions in the economy. 
On 27 June 2017, the BoE Financial Policy Committee (FPC) 
increased the UK CCyB rate to 0.5%, from 0%, to take effect from 
27 June 2018. Absent a change in the outlook, and consistent 
with its stated policy for a standard risk environment and of 
moving gradually, the FPC expects to increase the rate to 1% at its 
November 2017 meeting which will take effect in November 2018.
The Group’s capital planning considers the impact of all relevant 
capital buffers.
The PRA’s final rules on the approach to identifying other 
systemically important institutions (O-SII) were published in 
February 2016. In line with expectations, the Group’s principal 
subsidiary, Clydesdale Bank PLC was not designated an O-SII. 
Similarly the FPC issued its final framework for setting the SRB in 
May 2016. This confirmed that banks with total assets of less than 
£175bn (which includes the Group) will be subject to a 0% SRB.
Minimum requirement for own funds  
and eligible liabilities (MREL)
In November 2016, the BoE provided additional information 
on how MREL will be applied to firms that are subject to the use 
of resolution tools that the BoE would employ in the event of 
a firm entering resolution. From 1 January 2022, those firms, 
which include the Group, will be required to hold both their 
going-concern requirements together with additional MREL of an 
amount equal to those going concern requirements. The timetable 
for meeting MREL has been extended to 2022 and the BoE will 
review calibration and transition by the end of 2020, before 
setting end-state MREL. Interim MREL has been established for 
the transitional period. 
Monitoring
The capital plan is approved by the Board on an annual basis. 
The Group’s ALCO monitors the capital plan and forecast positions 
on a monthly basis. This ensures that performance trends are 
appropriately reviewed and that there is transparency on the 
impact on capital ratios, risk appetite and the future outlook.
Recent developments
Information on banking reform, ring-fencing and resolution, all of 
which may impact the Group’s capital and funding structures, are

from AAA rated issuance programmes.
(2) The definition of default was enhanced to capture a broader interpretation of the regulatory requirements as part of the Group’s programme of activity to prepare for 
IRB accreditation, which led to an increase in RWAs.  This change does not reflect any movement in the underlying risk profile of the portfolio and is only a reporting and

While RWAs increased by £649m, driven by growth in mortgages, underlying capital generation post AT1 distribution of 13bps (before 
the net impact of pension movements, and below-the-line charges such as the Group’s proportion of conduct provision charges and 
exceptional restructuring charges) ensured the CET1 ratio remained robust at 12.4%.
As announced in the Strategic report the Board has recommended a 1p per share dividend. The dividend would equate to approximately 
£9m of CET1 (equivalent to 4bps of CET1 based on RWAs as at 30 September 2017).

monitors it on a monthly basis. CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 160
Risk report
Balance sheet and prudential regulation risks
The leverage ratio is the ratio of Tier 1 capital to total exposure, defined as:
 – capital: Tier 1 capital defined according to CRD IV on an end point basis (assuming the full impact of CRD IV requirements on Tier 1 
capital were in force with no transitional provisions); and
 – exposures: total on- and off-balance sheet exposures (subject to credit conversion factors) as defined in the delegated act amending 
CRR article 429 (Calculation of the Leverage Ratio), which includes deductions applied to Tier 1 capital.
Other regulatory adjustments consist of adjustments that are required under CRD IV to be deducted from Tier 1 capital. The removal 
of these from the exposure measure ensures consistency is maintained between the capital and exposure components of the ratio. 
The Group’s leverage ratio is 6.3% which exceeds the Basel Committee’s proposed minimum of 3%, applicable from 2018.
The UK leverage ratio framework, which came in to force on 1 January 2016, is relevant to PRA regulated banks and building societies 
with consolidated retail deposits equal to or greater than £50bn. The Group is currently excluded from these requirements. On 
3 October 2017, the PRA published a policy statement – ‘UK Leverage Ratio treatment of claims on central banks’. 
The PRA Rulebook has been amended to:
 – align with its July 2016 modification by consent to exclude central bank claims matched by deposits in the same currency and of 
identical or longer maturity from the definition of the total leverage exposure measure in the UK leverage ratio framework;
 – increase the minimum leverage ratio requirement from 3% to 3.25% of total exposures; and
 – align the UK leverage ratio reporting and disclosure requirements to the proposed definition of the total exposure measure and 
3.25% minimum leverage ratio requirement.
If these modifications are applied to the Group, this results in an increase in the leverage ratio from 6.3% under CRD IV to 7.4% on the 
PRA modified basis as a result of the Group’s significant exposures to central banks within its liquid asset portfolio and Note cover.
Funding and liquidity risk
Funding risk relates to the impact on the Group’s strategy of being unable to raise funds from customers and the wholesale markets 
of sufficient quantity and of appropriate mix and tenor. An inability to raise sufficient funds may lead to a reduction in lending growth or 
a requirement to raise the price paid for deposits, both outcomes having an adverse effect on shareholder value. Where funding risk 
manifests itself in an adverse effect on mix and tenor, for example, a high proportion of short-term wholesale deposits, there is an 
increased liquidity risk to the Group.
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group is unable to meet its current and future financial obligations as they fall due at acceptable cost. 
These obligations include the repayment of deposits on demand or at their contractual maturity dates, the repayment of borrowings and 
loan capital as they mature, the payment of operating expenses and tax, the payment of dividends and the ability to fund new and existing 
loan commitments.
Risk assessment
The framework for the Group’s approach to funding risk leads to the development of a Group funding plan that is subject to approval 
by the Board and is consistent with risk appetite and the Group’s strategic objectives. The development of the Group’s funding plan is 
informed by the requirements of the Group’s Balance Sheet Risk Policy Standards.
Liquidity risk exposures are subject to assessment under both regulatory and internal requirements. Exposures relate to the outflow of 
funds under a series of stress scenarios less the impact of inflows from assets, liquidation of high-quality liquid assets or through other 
actions instigated by the Group. Liquidity within the Group is managed in accordance with the ILAAP that is approved by the Board. The 
ILAAP documents the manner in which the Group meets its OLAR which covers all regulatory and internal liquidity requirements. In 
addition, the Group has a policy standard which details, among other items, the control standards and risk measurement requirements 
for liquidity, authorities and responsibilities.
Oversight of liquidity risk is undertaken by ALCO. To meet the requirements of regulatory authorities the liquidity of the Group is 
managed on a daily basis using a combination of cumulative cash flow mismatch, scenario analysis and stress tests to ensure that normal 
daily cash requirements are met and to ensure adequate sources of liquidity are available to support unforeseen cash outflows. ALCO 
delegates daily management responsibilities to the Treasury function within agreed tolerances. All balance sheet risks are subject to 
independent oversight from the second line balance sheet and liquidity risk oversight function. CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 161
Strategic report Governance Financial results Risk report Financial statements Additional information
Stress testing of the Group’s liquidity risk is undertaken on a frequent basis and results are provided to ALCO and the Board. The ILAAP 
is used to establish key risk drivers and assumptions for liquidity risk and these provide the framework for ongoing stress testing. Stress 
testing considers the impact of severe yet plausible scenarios to consider the potential impact on the Group’s funding and liquidity profile. 
The Group holds a portfolio of high-quality assets that acts as a buffer against the impact of liquidity risk. Funding plans take a long-term 
view and these consider the impact of prolonged periods of market disruption in order to identify potential vulnerabilities in the profile of 
the Group’s funding.
A Contingency Funding Plan has been established for management of an escalated liquidity requirement if the Group experiences 
either restricted access to wholesale funding or a large increase in the withdrawal of funds. The plan identifies triggers for escalation, 
details the action required, allocates the key tasks to individuals, provides a time frame and defines a management committee to 
manage the action plan.
The Group has a number of different sources of funding which are considered to be well diversified in terms of the type of instrument 
and product, counterparty, term structure and market.
The Group can source funding through a range of channels including the following:
 – customer deposits;
 – access to short-term money market funding;
 – term structured funding through Lanark residential mortgage securitisation programme (owner occupied);
 – Lannraig BTL mortgage securitisation programme;
 – regulated covered bond (RCB) programme;
 – senior unsecured funding; and
 – access to facilities within the BoE Sterling Monetary Framework and the TFS (the TFS closes to new drawings in February 2018).
The Group’s securitisation and covered bond programmes offer investors the opportunity to purchase mortgage-backed debt. These 
sources are focused on a range of different investors and depositors with a range of maturities. Funding is typically raised in GBP, USD 
and EUR and is swapped back to GBP to fund the predominantly GBP balance sheet.
Monitoring
The Treasury function is responsible for the development and execution of strategy subject to oversight from the risk management 
function. In relation to funding and liquidity risk, the primary management committee is ALCO. ALCO meets monthly and reports to 
the Executive Risk Committee. 
The Group continues to have a strong funding and liquidity position and seeks to achieve an appropriate balance between profitability 
and liquidity risk. Funding is predominantly provided by Retail and SME customers and this is supported by medium-term secured 
funding issuance from the Group’s Lanark and Lannraig securitisation programmes, and its RCB platform and TFS. These funding 
programmes are a source of strength for the Group and leverage the Group’s high-quality mortgage book as a source of collateral 
for secured funding. 
The Group monitors liquidity and funding with reference to a number of measures including LCR, LDR and NSFR (see financial 
results section). CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 162

Total funding 39,722 36,111
The Group’s funding objectives are to prudently manage the sources and tenor of funds in order to provide a sound base from which to 
support sustainable customer growth. At 30 September 2017, the Group had a funding requirement of £39,722m (2016: £36,111m) with 
the primary funding requirement being to support loans and advances to customers.
Due to customers
The majority of the Group’s funding requirement was met by customer deposits of £27,718m (2016: £27,090m). Customer deposits 
are comprised of non-interest bearing demand deposits, interest bearing deposits and term deposits from a range of sources including 
Retail, SME and other corporate customers. The increase of £628m in 2017 was predominantly due to growth in non-interest bearing 
deposits (£388m) and term deposits (£503m) offset by a managed reduction in higher rate interest bearing deposits (£198m).
Due to other banks and debt securities in issue (wholesale funding)
Due to other banks of £3,817m (2016: £1,309m) was primarily comprised of: £1,864m of securities sold under agreement to repurchase; 
and £1,901m of drawings under the TFS.
Debt securities in issue of £4,785m (2016: £4,501m) was primarily comprised of: £2,834m of residential mortgage-backed securities 
issued through the Group’s Lanark programme; £327m of securities issued through the Group’s BTL securitisation programme 
(Lannraig); £700m of regulated covered bonds; £300m of senior debt; and £475m of subordinated debt.
Equity
Equity of £3,402m (2016: £3,211m) was also used to meet the Group’s funding requirement. Equity is comprised of ordinary share 
capital, retained earnings, other equity investments and a number of other reserves. For full details on equity refer to section 4 of the 
Notes to the consolidated financial statements.
External credit ratings
The Group’s credit ratings have remained unchanged over the past year. S&P assigns a long-term credit rating of ‘BBB-’ to the Group, 
two notches below that of Clydesdale Bank PLC, reflecting their non-operating holding company methodology. Fitch assigns an issuer 
default rating of ‘BBB+’, in line with that of Clydesdale Bank PLC, again reflecting their holding company methodology. 
Fitch announced the outcome of their annual review of Clydesdale Bank PLC and CYBG PLC ratings on 7 September 2017. All current 
ratings were affirmed, with a stable outlook. On 15 September 2017, Moody’s placed the long-term ratings of Clydesdale Bank PLC 
on review for upgrade. The review will focus on progress in the execution of the Group’s strategic plan as well as the extent to which 
enhancements in management, risk and control frameworks and processes have been embedded. On 15 November 2017, S&P moved 
the outlook on Clydesdale Bank PLC and CYBG PLC back to stable from negative as a result of an update to an industry-wide exercise 
following the EU referendum. CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 163

Additional collateral to be provided in the event of a notch downgrade
The Group monitors the movements in its credit ratings and the related requirement to post collateral for payment systems and clearing 
houses. These figures are not considered material compared to the volume of unencumbered liquid assets.
Liquid assets
The quantity and quality of the Group’s liquid assets are calibrated to the Board’s view of liquidity risk appetite and remain at a prudent 
level above regulatory requirements. The Group was compliant with all internal and regulatory liquidity metrics at 30 September 2017.
The liquid asset portfolio provides a buffer against sudden and potentially sharp outflows of funds and liquid assets must therefore be of 
a high quality so they can be realised for cash and cannot be encumbered for any other purpose (e.g. to provide collateral for payments 
systems). Details on encumbered assets are provided in the following section.
The liquid asset portfolio is primarily comprised of cash at the BoE, UK Government Securities (Gilts) and listed securities (e.g. bonds 
issued by supra-nationals and AAA rated covered bonds).

The liquid asset portfolio has seen some diversification over 2017 with an increase in Other Debt securities. Before investing in any 
security an assessment is completed for both the credit quality and the treatment for liquidity purposes. ALCO oversees the composition 
of the liquid asset portfolio.
Further information can be found in sections 3.1 and 3.2 of the Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Section 3.1 Cash and 
balances with central banks of £6,937m include £2,570m of assets that are encumbered to support issuance of Scottish bank notes and 
to support payments systems and £44m of mandatory central bank deposits; section 3.2 Listed securities of £2,066m comprises 
£1,221m of UK Government Treasury Bills and Gilts, of which £92m is encumbered to support payments systems and £845m of Other 
debt securities (listed securities), of which £16m is encumbered to support payment systems). CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 164

Encumbered assets by asset category
Examples of reasons for asset encumbrance include, among others, supporting the Group’s secured funding programmes to provide 
stable term funding to the Group, use of assets as collateral for payments systems in order to support customer’s transactional activity, 
and providing security for the Group’s issuance of Scottish bank notes. The Group monitors the level of asset encumbrance to ensure an 
appropriate balance is maintained.

Assets and liabilities by maturity
The following tables represent a breakdown of the Group’s balance sheet, according to the assets and liabilities contractual maturity. 
Many of the longer-term monetary assets are variable rate products, with behavioural maturities shorter than the contractual terms. 
Accordingly, this information is not relied upon by the Group in its management of interest rate risk. The Group has disclosed certain 
term facilities within loans and advances to customers with a revolving element at the maturity of the facility as this best reflects their 
contractual maturity.

Market risk
Market risk is the risk associated with adverse changes in the fair value, or accrual income and expense, of assets and liabilities held by the 
Group as a result of movements in market factors such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, volatility and credit spreads. The Group’s 
balance sheet is predominantly UK based and is denominated in GBP, therefore foreign exchange risk is not a major part of the Group’s 
risk profile.
Structural interest rate risk comprises the sensitivity of the Group’s current and future net interest income and economic value to 
movements in market interest rates. The major contributors to interest rate risk are:
 – the investment of non-interest bearing deposits and equity into interest-bearing assets;
 – the mismatch between repricing dates of interest-bearing assets and liabilities;
 – basis risk, for example, the inability of the pricing ‘basis’ for customer asset and liability products to be replicated in the financial 
markets or the risk arising from changing relationships between different interest rate yield curves; and
 – customer optionality, e.g. the right to repay borrowing in advance of contract maturity dates. CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 168
Risk report
Balance sheet and prudential regulation risks
Exposures
The focus of the Group’s activity is to provide high-quality banking services to its customers. These services include the provision of 
foreign exchange products and derivative products to enable customers to manage risks within their businesses. As a result of these 
activities, the Group may be exposed to forms of market risk that would arise from movements in price on these products. Controls 
include the hedging of these products as and when they arise.
Measurement
Interest rate risk in the banking book (IRRBB) is measured, monitored, and managed from both an internal management and regulatory 
perspective. The RMF incorporates both market valuation and earnings-based approaches. In accordance with the Group IRRBB Policy 
Standard. risk measurement techniques include: basis point sensitivity; value at risk (VaR), earnings at risk (EaR), interest rate risk stress 
testing, repricing analysis, cash flow analysis, and scenario analysis.
The key features of the internal interest rate risk management model are:
 – the use of basis point sensitivity analysis;
 – VaR and EaR are measured on a statistical basis: 99% confidence level with appropriate holding periods depending on varying 
risk types:
 – historical simulation approach utilising instantaneous interest rate shocks including parallel rate movements and twists in the yield 
curve to explore risks around exposures to movements in short- or long-term interest rates;
 – static balance sheet (i.e. any new business is assumed to be matched, hedged or subject to immediate repricing);
 – investment term for capital is modelled with a benchmark term agreed by ALCO;
 – investment term for core non-interest bearing assets and liabilities is modelled on a behavioural basis with a benchmark term agreed 
by ALCO; and
 – assumptions covering the behavioural life of products and customer behaviour for optionality are reviewed and approved by ALCO.
Foreign exchange risk is assessed based on the absolute exposure in each currency.
Mitigation measures
Market risks are overseen by ALCO with delegation for day-to-day management given to Treasury. Treasury use a number of techniques 
and products to manage market risks including interest rate swaps, cash flow netting and foreign exchange. Basis risk is managed through 
a combination of wholesale market basis risk management products, pricing strategies and product innovation. As part of an objective to 
secure stable and optimal net interest income over both a 12-month period and over the long term, mismatch risk can be minimised with 
the investment of equity and non-interest bearing deposits targeting the stability of net interest income. The use of derivatives gives rise 
to the need to apportion transactions into hedge relationships.
Fair value hedges
The Group hedges part of its existing interest rate risk, resulting from potential movements in the fair value of fixed rate assets and 
liabilities. The fair value of these swaps is disclosed in note 3.18. There were no transactions for which fair value hedge accounting had 
to be discontinued in the year.
Cash flow hedges
The Group hedges a portion of the variability in future cash flows attributable to interest rate and foreign currency risk. The interest and 
foreign currency risk arise from variable interest rate assets and liabilities which are hedged using cross currency and interest rate swaps, 
and material non-GBP denominated assets which are hedged using foreign exchange forward contracts. There were no transactions for 
which cash flow hedge accounting had to be discontinued in the period as a result of the highly probable cash flows no longer being 
expected to occur. The fair value of derivatives is disclosed in note 3.18. CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 169
Strategic report Governance Financial results Risk report Financial statements Additional information
Monitoring
Model parameters and assumptions are reviewed and updated on at least an annual basis. Material changes require the approval of ALCO. 
Oversight of market risk is conducted by the Group’s balance sheet and liquidity risk oversight team that is independent of the Treasury 
function. The Board and Executive Risk Committee, through ALCO’s oversight, monitors risk to ensure it remains within approved policy 
limits and Board requirements.

Repricing periods of assets and liabilities by asset/liability category
The following table shows the repricing periods of the Group’s assets and liabilities as assessed by the Group. This repricing takes account 
of behavioural assumptions where material and the Group’s policy to hedge capital in accordance with a benchmark term agreed by

Pension risk
The Group operates a defined benefit (DB) pension scheme, the Yorkshire and Clydesdale Bank Pension Scheme (the Scheme). 
Clydesdale Bank PLC is the Scheme’s principal employer and there are no other participating employers. Following a consultation process 
the Scheme was closed to future accrual on 1 August 2017 for the majority of members. A small number of members elected to keep 
DB accruals subject to making an increased contribution to the Scheme and to also forego other remuneration benefits.
DB pension schemes provide a promise to pay members a pre-determined level of income at retirement which is independent of the 
contributions and investment returns (assets) used to fund these benefit promises (collectively the liabilities). As such, there are significant 
risks associated with managing a DB scheme. These risks will continue until the Scheme is formally wound up, either in the event that all 
the liabilities are transferred to a third party (for example an insurer) or once all individual member benefits are paid.
The Scheme’s assets are held under a separate trust and the Scheme is managed by a corporate Trustee Board independently of the 
Group, per the Scheme Trust Deed and Rules. Therefore, the Group’s ability to directly manage the Scheme is limited to certain powers 
within the governing documentation. Aside from the Group’s role to sponsor the Scheme to ensure there are sufficient assets to meet 
benefit payments as they fall due, the Group’s focus is directed on mitigating the impact on capital and earnings through working with the 
trustee to implement risk reduction initiatives. Several activities have been implemented since 2003 with the specific aim of reducing risk 
in the Scheme, including a de-risking journey plan, benefit reforms and the outcome of the 2017 consultation on future accruals. 
The principal cause of risk within the Scheme is the difference between the assets and the liabilities. The assets are exposed to market 
valuation movements, within and between asset classes, while the liabilities are more sensitive to interest rate and inflation rate changes, 
and changes in other actuarial assumptions which may not be borne out in experience, for example life expectancy. There are various 
bases, with differing assumptions, for measuring the Scheme liabilities whereas Scheme assets are consistently valued at current market 
values. The two key bases used to value DB scheme liabilities are IAS 19, a standardised accounting measure which is the basis for income 
statement, balance sheet and capital reporting, and the Trustee’s Technical Provisions basis which determines the cash funding 
contributions to the Scheme to repair any deficit agreed as part of a triennial valuation.
The IAS 19 valuation is disclosed in note 3.16. The rate used to discount the liabilities on the IAS 19 basis is a key driver of volatility and, as 
prescribed by IAS 19, is based on yields on high-quality corporate bonds. Therefore, the IAS 19 valuation can move adversely because of 
low rates and narrowing credit spreads. Inflation is another key source of volatility. This is because member benefits have an element of 
index linking and therefore the liabilities increase with rises in long-term inflation assumptions, although in practice, over the long term, 
the relationship between interest and inflation rates tends to be negatively correlated resulting in a degree of risk offset.
The triennial valuation (the valuation) uses the Trustee’s actuarial assumptions and a liability discount rate based on gilt yields. The 
last formal valuation indicated a deficit of £290m as at 30 September 2016 (after allowing for changes to future accrual from 
1 August 2017), a reduction from the 30 September 2013 reported deficit of £450m. There has been no change to the deficit 
reduction schedule agreed with the Trustees in June 2014, with a further payment of £50m in May 2017, to be followed by  
payments of £50m in each year ending 31 March 2019, 31 March 2020, 31 March 2021 and 31 March 2022. A payment of  
£55m is due in the year ending 31 March 2023.

Risk report
Regulatory, compliance and conduct risk
Effectively addressing legacy 
issues and building a platform  
for growth
The Group continues to focus to address and 
eliminate legacy conduct issues while seeking to 
ensure that regulators’ expectations are met and 
our current and future proposition is compliant 
and fair to customers.
Regulatory and compliance risk
Regulatory and compliance risk is the risk of: failing to understand 
and comply with relevant laws, regulations, licence conditions, 
supervisory requirements, self-regulatory industry codes of 
conduct and voluntary initiatives; failing to identify, monitor and 
respond to changes in the regulatory environment; damaging the 
Group’s relationship with its regulators through non-compliance 
with requirements, not keeping regulators informed of relevant 
issues that affect (or which may affect) the Group, not responding 
effectively to the information requests and review findings of the 
regulators, by providing incorrect or inadequate information, not 
meeting regulatory deadlines or obstructing the regulator from 
fulfilling its role. 
Risk appetite
The Group has no appetite for actions resulting in breaches of 
regulation or for inaction to address systemic process and control 
failures leading to material non-compliance.
Mitigation measures
 – The Group has a regulatory engagement policy designed to 
ensure an open and cooperative relationship is maintained with 
regulators at all times, ensuring that all key interactions with 
regulators are managed, recorded and escalated as appropriate.
 – All colleagues are required to achieve mandated standards 
to meet their ‘compliance gateway’ obligations.
 – Material changes to regulatory policies and protocols 
are approved by either the Executive Leadership Team  
or the Board.
 – The Group CRO and Risk Leadership Team consider compliance 
risk topics when setting risk appetite and through ongoing risk 
assessment, profiling and reporting.
Monitoring
A risk management oversight and compliance monitoring plan is 
approved by Board’s Risk Committee on an annual basis which 
independently assesses the control framework underpinning 
compliance with laws and regulations.
Conduct risk
Conduct risk is the risk of undertaking business in a way which is 
contrary to the interests of our customers resulting in the delivery 
of inappropriate customer outcomes, customer detriment, 
regulatory censure, redress costs and/or reputational damage.
Risk appetite
The Group is committed to acting in the interests of its customers, 
and has no appetite for conduct risk.
Mitigation measures
The Group has a conduct framework which recognises the key 
conduct risks inherent in the Group’s strategy through which it 
seeks to apply the highest standards in the design and sale of 
products, and the treatment of its customers. The framework 
ensures fair customer outcomes supported by a good customer 
experience. This is achieved in a number of ways including 
continuous monitoring and responding to customer feedback 
and complaints. In addition, if things do go wrong, action is taken 
to ensure we put things right for our customers.
Products are designed and sold to meet customer needs and 
expectations with governance processes embedded to ensure 
those objectives are met.
Consideration of customer outcomes is embedded within the 
Group’s operating processes, and metrics are regularly monitored 
to help ensure outcomes are appropriate.
Exposures
As part of the demerger from NAB in 2016, NAB and the Group 
have entered into a Conduct Indemnity Deed where NAB has 
agreed to provide the Group with an indemnity in respect of 
certain historic liabilities relating to conduct in the period prior to 
the demerger date. Details of the Conduct Indemnity Deed are 
included in note 3.14 – Provisions.
There continues to be a great deal of uncertainty and significant 
judgement is required in determining the quantum of conduct 
risk-related liabilities with note 3.14 reflecting the Group’s current 
position in relation to redress provisions for PPI, interest rate 
hedging products (IRHPs) and other smaller historic conduct 
matters. The final amount required to settle the Group’s potential 
liabilities for these matters is materially uncertain. The Group 
will continue to reassess the adequacy of provisions for these 
matters and the assumptions underlying the calculations at each 
reporting date based upon experience and other relevant factors 
at that time.
Monitoring
This is a principal focus of the Board, senior management and 
regulators, and the Group seeks to ensure customers are treated 
fairly and products are designed and sold to meet their needs. The 
Group also works to ensure that customer expectations are met 
and complaints are dealt with effectively and fairly. All Three Lines 
of Defence consider conduct risk as part of their oversight and 
assurance activities. CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 173

Operational risk (including people risks)
Proactive operational risk 
management with enhanced  
risk frameworks
The Group continues to strengthen the controls 
that provide a continuity of service, while 
identifying areas of operational efficiency, and 
ensuring the level of operational risk capital 
reflects our risk profile.
Operational risk (including people risks) is the risk of loss resulting 
from inadequate or failed internal processes, people strategies 
and systems or from external events including, for example, the 
prospect of a cyber attack. It is a core component of the RMF and 
is embedded in day-to-day business activities. Responsibilities are 
set out in a structured operational risk framework that seeks to 
identify, assess, mitigate, monitor, and report the operational risks 
and events that could impact the achievement of business 
objectives or impact core business processes.
Business units are responsible for the day-to-day management 
of operational risk, with oversight from the risk management 
function, and independent assurance activities undertaken by 
internal audit.
The requirements of the operational RMF are defined in an 
overarching operational risk policy and related minimum standards, 
and reflect the Group’s operational risk appetite.
Risk appetite
The Group is prepared to tolerate a level of operational risk 
exposure within agreed thresholds and limits. Operational risks 
arise from day-to-day business activities, which may result in direct 
or indirect losses and could adversely impact the Group’s financial 
performance, levels of customer care and reputation.
Approach to monitoring and mitigating exposures
Losses may result from both internal and external events, and are 
categorised using risk categories aligned to Basel II. The Basel II 
categories are used to ensure that data can be reported externally 
and compared with other industry data.
The Group has identified, assessed and is currently monitoring all 
key operational risks across the above noted categories, including 
undertaking an assessment of control effectiveness, monitoring 
trends in key risk indicators and escalating events, in accordance 
with policy requirements.
Stress testing
The Group undertakes scenario analysis to gain insights into the 
stresses the business could be subject to in the event of this type 
of operational risk materialising. The Group maintains a suite of 
operational risk scenarios covering top operational risks relevant to 
its business. As part of the scenario analysis approach, the suite of 
operational risk scenarios are reviewed and updated on a regular 
basis for existing potential impacts and identification of potential 
new risk events. Management then document a proposed 
response to identify how the scenarios would be managed and 
monitored if they occurred.
Risk category
Operational resilience risk The risks associated with the ability of the Group to quickly adapt to disruptions while 
maintaining continuous business operations and safeguarding people, assets and overall brand 
equity, even in the face of adverse events, shocks and chronic or incremental changes.
Information technology risk The risks associated with inadequate and failed information technology processes and 
components (including hardware, software and networking components).
Change risk The risks associated with a failure to execute and deliver change that could result in an inability 
to meet our strategic objectives, including failing to meet our customer, regulator, colleague, 
or shareholders’ expectations, at a Group level and local management level.
Third-party risk The risks associated with ensuring the Group’s outsourced and offshoring arrangements are 
controlled effectively, including the risk of failure to service existing and new customers, and 
the potential cessation of specific activities, or the risk of personally identifiable information 
or Group sensitive data being exposed or exploited, or the risk of financial, reputational and 
regulatory censure if the third party enters into any illegal or unethical activities.
Data risk The risks associated with the accuracy, management and use of data that underpins decision-
making at every level across the organisation. CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 174
Risk report
Financial crime risk
A strengthened and robust 
financial crime framework
The Group continues to invest in its systems and 
controls to prevent, detect, screen and report 
financial crime, demonstrating a tangible uplift 
in effectiveness.
Financial crime risk is the risk that the Group’s products and 
services will be used to facilitate financial crime against the Group, 
its customers or third parties. It encompasses the risk of failing 
to understand and comply with relevant laws, regulations and 
supervisory requirements relating to money laundering, terrorism 
financing, bribery and corruption and sanctions and embargoes. 
It also includes risks associated with external or internal acts 
intended to defraud, misappropriate, and circumvent policy, funds, 
information, regulations and property. The Group maintains an 
overarching financial crime policy and four policy standards aligned 
to each material financial crime risk. These are:
Sanctions – The Group has no appetite for non-compliance with 
the legal and regulatory obligations relating to sanctions and 
embargoes. To reflect the Group’s risk appetite and to protect the 
Group from financial and reputational damage, including regulatory 
censure, fines and enforcement action, the Sanctions and 
Embargoes Policy articulates a set of minimum standards and 
requirements which must be complied with.
Anti-money laundering – The Group applies a prescribed high-risk 
customer model which sets out the types of customer it has no 
risk appetite to onboard, as well as customers with whom the 
Group is prohibited from entering into or maintaining a customer 
relationship. All other customers who are not prescribed shall be 
subject to controls commensurate with their risk.
Anti-bribery and corruption – The Group does not tolerate the 
direct or indirect offer, payment, solicitation or acceptance of 
bribes in any form. The Group has in place risk assessments, 
policies and guidelines on interacting with customers, suppliers 
and agents, including specific policies for gifts and hospitality. 
Senior managers across the business are required to complete 
an evaluation of risk areas as part of the risk assessment process.
Fraud – The Group accepts that, in order to conduct business in 
a commercially viable manner, it is willing to sustain fraud losses 
within an agreed set of parameters. The application of fraud risk 
management considers customer impacts, industry trends and 
financial impacts of fraud which, on occasion, provide conflicting 
priorities. Emerging risks are identified and assessed with action 
taken to mitigate them. An agreed loss plan is set and performance 
against this is overseen by the policy owner and reported through 
the appropriate governance committees. With regard to internal 
fraud, the Group recognises the risk of internal fraud but has no 
appetite for it. Consequently there is a control framework in place 
to mitigate that risk.
Exposures
There are currently no significant exposures to report. The Group 
continues to review the external environment for any change in 
regulatory or legislative direction, taking action as appropriate.
Mitigation measures
Risk assessments against the four financial crime policy standards 
take place on an annual basis. Over and above these assessments, 
regular oversight of higher-risk activities takes place as part  
of the formal oversight plan and embedded activity takes place 
throughout the year. Key performance metrics relative to critical 
financial crime systems are kept under review to ensure ongoing 
effectiveness. Third party tools are used to test system 
effectiveness where available and appropriate. Training 
completion and compliance is subject to annual oversight. 
All standards are reflected in the Group policy and standards and 
financial crime prevention manual, the content of which is provided 
by financial crime risk and updated as appropriate.
Monitoring
The financial crime team is responsible for strategy, governance, 
standard setting, oversight, training and reporting to the 
competent authorities and governance committees/Board.
The control framework is owned by financial crime risk but 
management and execution of customer identity and verification, 
customer due diligence, enhanced due diligence, identifying 
high-risk customers, including correspondent banking relationships 
and record keeping is the responsibility of first line business units.
Account opening pass rates are overseen as part of a regular 
process undertaken by financial crime risk and reported monthly.
Higher-risk customers are referred to financial crime risk and 
senior management within Customer Banking for agreement and 
sign off that business is within appetite and then continue to be 
monitored on an ongoing basis.
Screening customers for sanctions or politically exposed persons 
and transaction monitoring is carried out by financial crime risk. 
Sanctions screening for payments is carried out by the Payments 
team in the first line. Critical financial crime systems oversight is 
independently tested by Internal Audit. CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 175
Strategic report Governance Financial results Risk report Financial statements Additional information
 
Strategic, business and financial performance risk
Robust strategy development 
and monitoring
Strategy is delivered within a well-defined risk 
appetite and RMF with continual monitoring 
in place.
Strategic, business and financial performance risk is the risk of 
significant loss, loss of earnings or damage arising from business 
decisions that impact the long-term interests of the Group’s 
stakeholders or from an inability to adapt to external 
developments.
Risk appetite 
The Group intends to grow and increase share in target markets, 
and has clear strategies for its business model and for target 
customers and products, but it has no appetite to achieve its 
targets in an unsustainable fashion, or one which may result 
in damaging outcomes for the Group, its customers or other 
stakeholders.
Exposures
The Group operates amid intense, increasing competition. Peer 
and challenger banks, some with innovative business models and 
low cost bases, such as fast-growing peer-to-peer lenders and 
crowd funders, allied with rapid technological change, notably in 
payments and mobile banking, present a fast-evolving, challenging 
environment. These trends and new regulations also necessitate 
a large change agenda, which diverts management attention, 
imposes costs and which may not deliver expected benefits.
At the same time, the low interest rate environment constrains 
income, reduces margins and, by inhibiting capital generation, 
reduces strategic room for manoeuvre. As such, income growth 
and margin expectations over the Group’s planning horizon are 
balanced, highlighting that this environment contributes to 
significant business risk, the risk that Group net income fails 
to grow as targeted, or falls.
Mitigation measures
CYBG was divested from NAB and listed in February 2016, but 
strategic changes necessary for success when independent were 
assessed over a prolonged prior period. Moreover, CYBG has 
a long history as a full service UK bank and benefits from an 
experienced Board and Executive Leadership Team, such that the 
overall strategy has evolved through a mature and robust process. 
The Group’s risk appetite represents a ‘risk envelope’ against which 
chosen strategies and financial plans are assessed and within which 
chosen strategies must operate. The RAS, and associated risk 
appetite framework, is therefore a key means of controlling 
strategic risk. The risk appetite framework comprises an extensive 
system of measures, thresholds and other controls, which together 
ensure that the Group operates within the Board’s approved 
appetite for strategic risk.
Monitoring
A range of financial and non-financial metrics, including RoTE, 
lending growth, customer acquisition, NIM and others, are key 
performance indicators used to monitor performance relative to 
strategic objectives. They are monitored against the Financial Plan 
by the Group’s Board and Executive Leadership Team, who react 
to deviations from targets and modify strategy accordingly.

Conclusions relating to principal risks, going concern and viability statement
We have nothing to report in respect of the following information in the annual report, in relation to which the ISAs (UK) require us to 
report to you whether we have anything material to add or draw attention to:
 – the disclosures in the annual report set out on page 19 that describe the principal risks and explain how they are being managed 
or mitigated;
 – the Directors’ confirmation set out on page 71 in the annual report that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal 
risks facing the entity, including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity;
 – the Directors’ statement set out on page 191 in the financial statements about whether they considered it appropriate to adopt the 
going concern basis of accounting in preparing them, and their identification of any material uncertainties to the entity’s ability to 
continue to do so over a period of at least 12 months from the date of approval of the financial statements;
 – whether the Directors’ statement in relation to going concern required under the Listing Rules in accordance with Listing Rule 
9.8.6R(3) is materially inconsistent with our knowledge obtained in the audit; or 
 – the Directors’ explanation set out on page 125 in the annual report as to how they have assessed the prospects of the entity, over 
what period they have done so and why they consider that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have a 
reasonable expectation that the entity will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of 
their assessment, including any related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.

Independent auditor’s report to the members of CYBG PLC
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements 
of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) that we 
identified. These matters included those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the allocation of resources in the 
audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial 
statements as a whole, and in our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
Key audit matters Our response to the risk
Key observations communicated 
to the Board’s Audit Committee
Payment Protection Insurance (“PPI”) 
and other conduct related provisioning
Please refer to pages 79 to 87 (Audit 
Committee report), pages 219 to 222 
(Provisions for liabilities and charges note), 
pages 237 to 238 (Contingent liabilities 
and commitments note).
The Group has material provisions relating 
to its conduct towards its past and present 
customers relating to past PPI sales and 
other conduct related matters.
The Group benefits from a conduct 
indemnity deed granted by its former 
parent, under which 90.3% of remediation 
costs for past conduct issues can be 
reimbursed up to a capped total amount. 
The Group contributes 9.7% of such costs. 
While this limits the impact on the 
Group’s results and equity, unutilised 
amounts remaining under the indemnity 
are an important factor in the assessment 
of the Group’s overall financial position.
In March 2017, the FCA published Policy 
Statement 17/3 containing its final rules 
and guidance on PPI complaints. The 
Policy Statement confirmed a new rule 
that sets a deadline of 29 August 2019 
for consumers to complain about the way 
they were sold PPI. During the year, the 
Group has also made progress with its 
past business review for other conduct 
related matters.
Significant judgements and assumptions 
are required to be made by the Directors 
in relation to the timing, volume and 
quantum of future redress payments 
and associated administration costs that 
will be required. The most significant 
assumption is total anticipated future PPI 
complaint volumes. The effects of these 
judgements are material, so this was 
considered to be a significant audit risk.
We considered the results of the testing 
of key controls operating within the PPI 
and other conduct case handling and 
recording processes which supported the 
data used in the determination of key 
provision assumptions. We found that we 
could place reliance on these controls.
We examined the models used by the 
Directors to determine a best estimate 
of the provisions for mis-sold payment 
protection insurance (“PPI”) and other 
products.
We assessed the appropriateness of PPI 
provision model assumptions, including 
case volumes, redress per claim, uphold 
rates and case processing costs, which 
were informed by the Group’s historic 
experience.
We tested the clerical accuracy of the 
Directors’ provision calculations and 
sensitivity analysis.
In evaluating the Directors’ 
provision assumptions, we examined 
correspondence during the year between 
the Group and the FCA, and regulatory 
pronouncements, such as PS 17/3. We 
compared the Directors’ assumptions 
to our own expectations based on the 
Group’s historical experience, current 
trends and our industry knowledge.
We communicated to the Audit 
Committee that provisions for PPI 
redress and other conduct related 
matters held by the Group were 
reasonably estimated. We noted that 
the Bank’s disclosures describe the 
uncertainties and risks associated with 
determining the provisions, and the 
sensitivity of the provisions to changes 
in key assumptions. As disclosed on page 
222 in Note 3.14, we also noted that 
£148m of the Capped Indemnity remains 
undrawn, and that this provides a level of 
protection to the Group should future 
costs relating to PPI claims exceed the 
Directors’ estimate.
The estimations of provisions for PPI 
claims and other conduct related matters 
are inherently uncertain and required 
significant judgements to be made by the 
Directors. The Directors’ best estimate 
for future PPI claims and associated 
costs involved probability weighting a 
number of possible outcomes. The most 
significant assumption is the volume of 
future, new PPI complaints, details of 
which are reported on page 220 in 
Note 3.14.
We determined an independent range of 
reasonable future PPI cost outcomes 
using the Group’s historical experience of 
PPI claims, and we compared this range 
to the Directors’ estimate. We found no 
material differences in this comparison.
We communicated to the Audit 
Committee that provisions for other 
conduct related matters, had been 
determined based on appropriate 
evidence and were fairly stated at 
30 September 2017. CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 181

Key audit matters Our response to the risk
Key observations communicated 
to the Board’s Audit Committee
SME lending impairment provisions
Please refer to pages 79 to 87 (Audit 
Committee report), and pages 210 to 212 
(Impairment provisions on credit 
exposures note).
The majority of the Group’s non-retail 
lending portfolio relates to small and 
medium sized enterprises (‘SMEs’) which 
can be vulnerable to both domestic and 
foreign market volatility.
Estimating the Group’s collective and 
specific provisioning is subjective, requires 
the Directors to exercise significant 
judgement, and incorporates the use 
of various assumptions.
Due to the materiality of the provisions 
and level of judgment involved, this was 
considered to be a significant audit risk.
We tested controls over impairment 
calculations and the generation of 
portfolio data for use in these 
calculations. These controls included 
those covering the identification and 
assessment of potentially impaired 
loans, the transfer of data from source 
systems to impairment models, and 
the calculation of specific impairment 
provisions. We determined that we 
could rely on these controls for the 
purposes of our audit.
We performed loan file testing on a 
sample of impaired loans to determine 
whether the specific provisions held by 
the Group were, in our judgement, 
sufficient and appropriate. Our approach 
included the use of our own valuation 
specialists to independently test key 
assumptions underpinning a sample 
of collateral values used in provision 
calculations.
We evaluated the completeness of SME 
loans assessed for impairment by the 
Directors and examined key loans where 
no impairment provisions were held.
We tested the collective impairment 
provision model by examining the logic 
of the model calculations, the accuracy 
of data inputs, and the appropriateness 
of key assumptions and loan ratings used 
within the model.
We tested the Directors’ judgements in 
determining overlays to the collective 
impairment models for appropriateness 
of methodology and accuracy of 
calculation.
We communicated to the Audit 
Committee that the impairment models, 
calculations and assumptions employed 
by the Group were reasonable as at 
30 September 2017 and that these 
resulted in impairment provisions that 
were appropriately estimated. We also 
concluded that the disclosures presented 
were in compliance with IFRSs.
We independently determined a range 
of appropriate outcomes for the level of 
incurred but not reported losses existing 
in the Group’s loan portfolio. The 
Directors’ post model adjustments 
resided within our range of acceptable 
outcomes.
We assessed and challenged the 
calculations and related judgements for a 
sample of specific impairment provisions 
and did not identify any material 
differences to the provisions determined 
by the Directors. CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 182

Key audit matters Our response to the risk
Key observations communicated 
to the Board’s Audit Committee
Revenue recognition –  
Effective Interest method
Please refer to page 198 (net interest 
income accounting policy).
For certain product fees, the Group 
operates a model to recognise fee income 
(included within interest income) under 
the effective interest method. The 
effective interest method spreads the 
recognition of product fee income over 
the life of a financial instrument, as these 
are in substance an integral part of the 
overall yield.
Effective interest models are sensitive 
to judgements about the expected lives 
of the product portfolios to which they 
relate. Due to the complexity of 
calculations, the degree of judgement 
exercised by the Directors in respect 
of the expected lives of the product 
portfolios and the different products 
for which fees are recognised, this is 
considered a significant audit risk.
We gained an understanding of key 
controls and assessed the appropriateness 
of key assumptions used within the 
Group’s effective interest model, primarily 
the average loan life assumption, which 
we corroborated against underlying loan 
data, our knowledge of market conditions 
and observed practice in the UK 
mortgage sector.
We performed data integrity testing on 
the key sources of information feeding 
the effective interest calculation. This 
involved sample testing data from 
business systems to the loan data used in 
the model and vice-versa. 
We examined the journals recording the 
deferral and amortisation of fee income 
to verify that the revenue deferred and 
amortised over the life of the underlying 
loans was appropriate and aligned with 
the effective interest model output.
As set out on page 209 in Note 3.5, 
the Group has recorded £32m of net 
deferred income in relation to fee 
income and expenses deferred under 
the Group’s effective interest method 
of accounting. We communicated to 
the Audit Committee that the effective 
interest adjustments recognised 
in interest income had been 
appropriately derived.
We also communicated that the 
assumptions made by the Directors were 
reasonable in the context of the Group’s 
lending portfolios and current observable 
customer behaviours.
In the prior year, our auditor’s report included a key audit matter in relation to recoverability of the deferred tax asset. There was a 
significant reduction in the valuation of the Group’s deferred tax asset in the prior financial year and consequently this was not considered 
a key audit matter in the current year.
Our application of materiality
We apply the concept of materiality in planning and performing the audit, in evaluating the effect of identified misstatements on the audit 
and in forming our audit opinion. 
Audit materiality
Audit materiality is the magnitude of an omission or misstatement that, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to influence 
the economic decisions of the users of the financial statements. Audit materiality provides a basis for determining the nature and extent of our 
audit procedures. 
We determined audit materiality for the Group to be £17m (2016: £17m) which approximates 0.5% of the total equity attributable to 
owners of the Parent company (‘Group equity’). The reason for selecting this measure as the basis for our audit materiality consideration 
is that the Group was loss making in recent financial periods. Given the importance of equity to the Group’s solvency and regulatory 
capital resources, we judged equity to be the most relevant basis for setting audit materiality.
Performance materiality
Performance materiality is the application of materiality at the individual account or balance level. It is set at an amount to reduce to an 
appropriately low level the probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceeds materiality.
On the basis of our risk assessments, together with our assessment of the Group’s overall control environment, our judgement was 
that performance materiality should be set at 75% (2016: 50%) of our audit materiality, namely £12.75m (2016: £8.5m). We have set 
performance materiality at this percentage due to our previous experience as auditors of the Group, from which we concluded that 
there is a lower expectation of material financial statement inaccuracies due to the effective control environment and only minor audit 
differences resulting from our prior and current year work. We set performance materiality at a more conservative percentage of 50% 
in the prior year as 2016 was CYBG PLC’s first year reporting as a publicly listed company. CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 183

Reporting threshold
This is the amount below which identified misstatements are considered as being clearly trivial.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them all uncorrected audit differences in excess of £0.85m 
(2016: £0.85m), which is set at 5% of our audit materiality, as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted 
reporting on qualitative grounds.
We evaluate any uncorrected misstatements against both the quantitative measures of materiality discussed above and in light of other 
relevant qualitative considerations in forming our opinion.
Other information 
The other information comprises the information included in the annual report set out on pages 1 to 175, including the Strategic Report 
set out on pages 1 to 37, the Financial Results set out on pages 38 to 48, Governance set out on pages 49 to 126, the Risk Report set 
out on pages 127 to 175, and Additional Information set out on pages 249 to 263 other than the financial statements and our auditor’s 
report thereon. The Directors are responsible for the other information.
Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in 
this report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. 
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider 
whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or 
otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are 
required to determine whether there is a material misstatement in the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other 
information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of the other information, 
we are required to report that fact.
We have nothing to report in this regard.
In this context, we also have nothing to report in regard to our responsibility to specifically address the following items in the other 
information and to report as uncorrected material misstatements of the other information where we conclude that those items meet 
the following conditions:
 – Fair, balanced and understandable set out on page 126 – the statement given by the Directors that they consider the annual 
report and financial statements taken as a whole is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the group’s performance, business model and strategy, is materially inconsistent with our knowledge 
obtained in the audit; or 
 – Audit committee reporting set out on pages 79 to 87 – the section describing the work of the audit committee does not 
appropriately address matters communicated by us to the audit committee is materially inconsistent with our knowledge obtained 
in the audit; or
 – Directors’ statement of compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code set out on page 62 – the parts of the Directors’ 
statement required under the Listing Rules relating to the company’s compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code 
containing provisions specified for review by the auditor in accordance with Listing Rule 9.8.10R(2) do not properly disclose a 
departure from a relevant provision of the UK Corporate Governance Code. CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 184

Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion, the part of the Directors’ remuneration report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006.
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:
 – the information given in the strategic report and the Directors’ report for the financial year for which the financial statements are 
prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and 
 – the strategic report and the Directors’ report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and the Parent company and its environment obtained in the course of 
the audit, we have not identified material misstatements in the strategic report or the Directors’ report.
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you 
if, in our opinion:
 – adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received 
from branches not visited by us; or
 – the Parent company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement 
with the accounting records and returns; or
 – certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
 – we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit
Responsibilities of Directors
As explained more fully in the Directors’ responsibilities statement set out on page 126, the Directors are responsible for the preparation 
of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the Directors 
determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud 
or error.
In preparing the financial statements, is the Directors are responsible for assessing the Group and Parent company’s ability to continue as 
a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the 
Directors either intend to liquidate the Group or the Parent company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements 
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high 
level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement 
when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could 
reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. 
Explanation as to what extent the audit was considered capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud 
The objectives of our audit, in respect of fraud, are: to identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements 
due to fraud; to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the assessed risks of material misstatement due to fraud, through 
designing and implementing appropriate responses; and to respond appropriately to fraud or suspected fraud identified during the audit. 
However, the primary responsibility for the prevention and detection of fraud rests with both those charged with governance of the 
entity and management. Our audit approach in respect of irregularities, including fraud, was as follows:
 – We obtained an understanding of the legal and regulatory frameworks that are applicable to the Group and determined that the most 
significant were the regulations, licence conditions and supervisory requirements of the Prudential Regulation Authority (‘PRA’) and the 
Financial Conduct Authority (‘FCA’).
 – We understood how the Group complies with these legal and regulatory frameworks by making enquiries of management, internal audit, 
and those responsible for legal and compliance matters. We also: reviewed correspondence between the Group and UK regulatory 
bodies; reviewed minutes of the Board and Executive Risk Committee; and gained an understanding of the Group’s approach to 
governance, demonstrated by the Board’s approval of the Group’s governance framework and the Board’s review of the Group’s risk 
management framework (‘RMF’) and internal control processes. CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 185
Strategic report Governance Financial results Risk report Financial statements Additional information
 – We assessed the susceptibility of the Group’s financial statements to material misstatement, including how fraud might occur, by 
considering the controls that the Group has established to address risks identified by the entity, or that otherwise seek to prevent, deter 
or detect fraud. We also considered performance and incentive plan targets and their potential to influence management to manage 
earnings or influence the perceptions of investors.
 – Based on this understanding we designed our audit procedures to identify non-compliance with such laws and regulations identified in 
the paragraphs above. Our procedures involved inquiries of legal counsel, executive management, internal audit, and focused testing, as 
referred to in the Key Audit Matters section above.
 – The Group operates in the banking industry which is a highly regulated environment. As such the Senior Statutory Auditor considered 
the experience and expertise of the engagement team to ensure that the team had the appropriate competence and capabilities, which 
included the use of specialists where appropriate.
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting Council’s 
website at www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor’s report.
Other matters we are required to address:
 – We were appointed as CYBG PLC’s External Auditor and signed an engagement letter on 14 January 2016, prior to CYBG PLC 
becoming the holding company of the Group on its demerger from NAB and IPO in February 2016.
 – The non-audit services prohibited by the FRC’s Ethical Standard were not provided to the Group or the Company and we remain 
independent of the Group and the Company in conducting the audit.
 – The audit opinion is consistent with the additional report to the audit committee.

Section 1: Basis of preparation
Overview
This section sets out the Group’s accounting policies that relate to the consolidated financial statements as a whole. Where an 
accounting policy is specific to one note, the policy is described in the note to which it relates. This section also shows new accounting 
standards, amendments and interpretations, relevant to the Group, and whether they are effective in 2017 or later years. We explain 
how these changes are expected to impact the financial position and performance of the Group.
1.1 General information
The Company is a public company limited by shares, incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act and registered in 
England and Wales.
The consolidated financial statements comprise those of the Company and its controlled entities, together the ‘Group’. 
1.2 Basis of accounting
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU and in accordance with the 
provisions of the Companies Act 2006. 
The financial information has been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of land and buildings, 
investment properties, financial assets available for sale and certain other financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss. 
Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between 
market participants at the measurement date.
1.3 Presentation of risk offsetting and maturity disclosures
Certain disclosures required under IFRS 7 ‘Financial instruments: disclosures’ and IAS 1 ‘Presentation of financial statements’ have been 
included within the audited sections of the Risk report. Where information is marked as audited, it is incorporated into these financial 
statements by this cross reference and it is covered by the Independent auditor’s report.
1.4 Going concern
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position, are set out in 
the Strategic report. In addition, the Risk report includes the Group’s risk management objectives and the Group’s objectives, policies and 
processes for managing its capital.
In assessing the Group’s going concern position as at 30 September 2017, the Directors have considered a number of factors, including 
the current balance sheet position, the principal and emerging risks which could impact the performance of the Group and the Group’s 
strategic and financial plan which includes future projections of profitability, capital adequacy, liquidity and funding. The assessment 
concluded that, for the foreseeable future, the Group has sufficient capital to support its operations; has a funding and liquidity base 
which is strong, robust and well managed with future capacity; and has expectations that performance will continue to improve as the 
Group’s strategy is executed. 
As a result of the assessment, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate resources 
to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future and therefore believe that the Group is well placed to manage its risks 
successfully in line with its business model and strategic aims. Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing 
the consolidated financial statements.
1.5 Basis of consolidation
Controlled entities are all entities (including structured entities) to which the Company is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from 
its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. An assessment of control is 
performed on an ongoing basis.
Controlled entities are consolidated from the date on which control is established by the Group until the date that control ceases. The 
acquisition method of accounting is used to account for business combinations other than those under common control. A non-
controlling interest is recognised by the Group in respect of any portion of the total assets less total liabilities of an acquired entity or 
entities that is not owned by the Group. Post-acquisition, income received and expenses incurred by the entity or entities acquired are 
included in the consolidated income statement on a line by line basis in accordance with the accounting policies set out herein. Balances 
and transactions between entities within the Group and any unrealised gains and losses arising from those transactions are eliminated in 
full upon consolidation.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared using uniform accounting policies.

Section 1: Basis of preparation continued
1.6 Foreign currency
Functional and presentation currency
Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic 
environment in which the entity operates (the ‘functional currency’). The consolidated financial statements are presented in pounds sterling 
(GBP), which is also the Group’s presentation currency, rounded to the nearest million pounds sterling (£m) unless otherwise stated. 
Transactions and balances
The Group records an asset, liability, expense or revenue arising from a transaction using the closing exchange rate between the 
functional and foreign currency on the transaction date. At each subsequent reporting date, the Group translates foreign currency 
monetary items at the closing rate. Foreign exchange differences arising on translation or settlement of monetary items are recognised 
in the income statement during the year in which the gains or losses arise. 
Foreign currency non-monetary items measured at historical cost are translated at the date of the transaction, with those measured 
at fair value translated at the date when the fair value is determined. Foreign exchange differences are recognised directly in equity for 
non-monetary items where any component of associated gains or losses is recognised directly in equity. Foreign exchange differences 
arising from non-monetary items, whereby the associated gains or losses are recognised in the income statement, are also recognised 
in the income statement.
1.7 Financial assets and liabilities
Recognition and derecognition 
A financial asset or a financial liability is recognised on the balance sheet when the Group becomes party to the contractual provisions 
of the instrument. Purchases and sales of financial assets classified within fair value through profit or loss are recognised on trade date. 
The Group derecognises a financial asset when the contractual cash flows from the asset expire or it transfers the right to receive 
contractual cash flows on the financial asset in a transaction in which substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred. 
Financial liabilities are derecognised when the Group has discharged its obligation to the contract, or the contract is cancelled or expires.
Offsetting 
This can only occur, and the net amount be presented on the balance sheet, when the Group currently has a legally enforceable right to 
set off the recognised amounts and intends either to settle on a net basis, or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
1.8 Critical accounting estimates and judgements
The preparation of financial statements requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates and judgements that affect the reported 
amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosed amount of contingent liabilities. Assumptions made at each balance 
sheet date are based on best estimates at that date. Although the Group has internal control systems in place to ensure that estimates 
can be reliably measured, actual amounts may differ from those estimates. The Group considers the most significant use of accounting 
estimates and judgements relate to the following areas:
 – financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss (note 3.3);
 – impairment provisions on credit exposures (note 3.6);
 – deferred tax (note 3.11);
 – PPI redress provision and other conduct related matters (note 3.14); and
 – retirement benefit obligations (note 3.16). CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 193

1.9 New accounting standards and interpretations
The Group has adopted the following International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) pronouncements in the current financial year. 
Except where otherwise stated, these did not have a material impact on the Group’s consolidated financial statements:
 – amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 38: ‘Clarification of Acceptable Methods of Depreciation and Amortisation’, issued May 2014 and 
effective for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2016. IAS 16 and IAS 38 both establish the principle for the basis of 
depreciation and amortisation being the expected pattern of consumption of the future economic benefits of an asset. This 
amendment provides clarification that the use of certain revenue based methods to calculate depreciation is not appropriate.
 – ‘Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2012-2014 Cycle’, issued September 2014 and effective for financial years beginning on 
or after 1 January 2016. The IASB has made amendments to the following standards that are relevant to the Group: IFRS 5: ‘Non-
current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations’; IFRS 7: ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’; IAS 19: ‘Employee Benefits’; 
and IAS 34: ‘Interim Financial Reporting’.
 – amendments to IAS 1: ‘Disclosure Initiative’, issued December 2014 and effective for financial years beginning on or after  
1 January 2016. This includes a narrow scope amendment providing clarification to existing IAS 1: ‘Presentation of Financial 
Statements’ requirements.
New accounting standards and interpretations not yet adopted
IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’ (issued July 2014) and IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’ (issued September 2015) are 
both effective for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2018 and have been endorsed by the EU. IFRS 16 ‘Leases’ was issued 
in January 2016 and is effective for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2019 and has been endorsed by the EU. Separate 
updates on the Group’s implementation of these new standards can be found at the end of this section.
There are a number of other standards and amendments that are either not available for adoption in the EU or are otherwise 
not mandatory at 30 September 2017 and have not been applied by the Group in preparing these financial statements. The 
pronouncements, while relevant to the Group, are not anticipated to have a material impact and include:
 – amendments to IAS 12: ‘Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for Unrealised Losses’
(1)
, issued in January 2016 and effective for financial 
years beginning on or after 1 January 2017. The amendments clarify the requirements on the recognition of deferred tax assets for 
unrealised losses;
 – amendments to IAS 7: ‘Disclosure initiative’
(1)
, issued in January 2016 and effective for financial years beginning on or after  
1 January 2017. The amendments to IAS 7: ‘Statement of Cash Flows’ require disclosures that enable users of the financial  
statements to evaluate changes in liabilities arising from an entity’s financing activities;
 – amendments to IFRS 2: ‘Classification and Measurement of Share-based Payment Transactions’
(2)
, issued in June 2016 and effective 
for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2017. The amendments provide guidance on the effects of vesting and non-vesting 
conditions on the measurement of cash-settled share-based payments; classification of share-based payments with a net settlement 
feature for withholding tax obligations; and accounting for modifications to a share-based payment that change the classification from 
cash-settled to equity-settled;
 – amendments to IFRS 9: ‘Prepayment Features with Negative Compensation’
(2)
, issued in October 2017 and effective for financial years 
beginning on or after 1 January 2019. The amendments allow companies to measure particular prepayable financial assets with 
so-called negative compensation at amortised cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income if a specified condition is 
met, instead of at fair value through profit or loss;
 – ‘Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2014-2016 Cycle’
(2)
, issued December 2016 and effective for financial years beginning on 
or after 1 January 2017 or 1 January 2018. The IASB has made amendments to the following standards: IFRS 12: ‘Disclosure of 
Interests in Other Entities’ (clarification of the scope of the standard – effective 1 January 2017), and IAS 28: ‘Investments in 
Associates and Joint Ventures’ (measuring an associate or joint venture at fair value – effective 1 January 2018);
 – IFRIC interpretation 22: ‘Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance Consideration’
(2)
, issued December 2016 and effective for 
financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2018. The new interpretation provides requirements on which exchange rate to use 
in reporting foreign currency transactions (such as revenue transactions) when payment is made or received in advance; and
 – IFRIC interpretation 23: ‘Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments’
(2)
, issued June 2017 and effective for financial years beginning on 
or after 1 January 2019. The new interpretation applies to any situation in which there is uncertainty as to whether an income tax 
treatment is acceptable under tax law and is not limited to actual ongoing disputes.

1.9 New accounting standards and interpretations continued
Updates on the implementation of IFRS 9: ‘Financial Instruments’, IFRS 15: ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’  
and IFRS 16: ‘Leases’
The Group continues to assess the requirements of these Standards as it seeks to ensure that the methodology and approach to the key 
impacts and challenges of the Standards result in a high quality implementation, while continuing to recognise emerging and evolving 
industry practice. 
IFRS 9
CYBG implementation strategy and approach
IFRS 9 was endorsed for adoption in the EU in November 2016 and will be adopted by the Group with effect from 1 October 2018.
Classification and measurement
IFRS 9 changes the classification of financial assets by reducing the number of categories to just three (amortised cost, fair value through 
other comprehensive income (FVOCI) and fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL)). The final classification is based on a combination of 
the Group’s business model and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the instruments. The option to designate a financial asset at 
FVTPL in IAS 39 is largely retained in IFRS 9, with IFRS 9 also affording a further option to designate certain equity instruments at 
FVOCI instead of accounting for these as FVTPL. The Group has undertaken an assessment to determine the potential impact of these 
changes. These are unlikely to result in significant changes to existing measurement bases; however, the final impact will be dependent on 
the circumstances prevailing on 1 October 2018.
Impairment overview
The Group’s IFRS 9 implementation programme is progressing as planned with models built and an end-to-end parallel run exercise to 
commence during the year beginning 1 October 2017. As expected, there will be a period of refinement required where the series of 
complex decisions, judgements and assumptions made, particularly in relation to the Group’s model methodology, that will be reviewed, 
sufficiently tested and benchmarked. It is only after a period where the testing environment has stabilised, that the results of the parallel 
run will provide an indication of the likely impact. 
The Group’s approach to the new expected credit loss (ECL) methodology in IFRS 9 will leverage, as far as possible, off the model 
development work that has been undertaken to support the Group’s IRB accreditation application. A lifetime ECL calculation will be 
required for scenarios where the credit quality of a financial asset has been identified through the Group’s staging criteria as having 
significantly deteriorated since original recognition.
The Group’s 12 month and lifetime ECL calculation will be based around a ‘PD x EAD x LGD’ formula: 
Term Defined as To be IFRS 9 compliant
PD Probability of default (PD) is an estimate of the 
probability that a customer will default
Forward-looking 12 month and lifetime PD, 
which needs to be capable of reflecting changes 
in the economic environment
EAD Exposure at default (EAD) is an estimate of the 
amount the customer will owe at the time of default
Forward-looking and based on contractual limits 
with certain exceptions for revolving products 
(such as credit cards) that may contain both a 
drawn and undrawn element
LGD Loss given default (LGD) is an estimate of the loss 
that the Group will suffer if the customer defaults 
(incorporating any collateral held)
Forward looking with no prescribed floors CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 195
Strategic report Governance Financial results Risk report Financial statements Additional information
There are a number of specific key elements to the IFRS 9 ECL calculation which require the Group to define and articulate the direction 
it will take in meeting these – that is ensuring that the ECL calculation is forward-looking and encompasses a probability weighted multiple 
scenario approach.
The Group currently adopts economic scenario methodology for capital planning and credit stress testing purposes and views the 
introduction of the IFRS 9 requirements as an extension to these established processes. The Group will align the specific requirements 
of IFRS 9 to these to ensure a consistent approach is adopted.
The exact nature and number of the economic scenarios (including the necessary economic inputs required for the scenarios), along with 
their relevant probability weightings, were finalised following experienced credit judgement, discussion and agreement with stakeholders. 
This will be subject to refinement as the parallel run period progresses.
The adoption of IFRS 9 may result in an increase in the Group’s balance sheet provisions for credit losses and may therefore have a 
negative impact on the Group’s regulatory capital position.
Hedge accounting
Macro hedge accounting is being considered in a separate IASB project. There is an option available to retain the existing IAS 39 hedge 
accounting requirements until the completion of the macro hedge accounting project. The Group proposes to continue applying the 
hedge accounting requirements of IAS 39 in accordance with this option.
Regulatory capital
The Group notes the pronouncements regarding transitional relief for the likely regulatory capital impact of adopting IFRS 9 from 
the Basel Committee and also the European Parliament and Commission and will continue to monitor the regulatory landscape over 
the year ahead in the lead up to the Group’s adoption of IFRS 9 for final details on the regulatory capital treatment of the change 
to an ECL methodology.
The Group will consider the option of spreading the effect of the change to an ECL methodology for regulatory capital purposes should 
this feature in the finalised version of the rules.
IFRS 15
IFRS 15 was issued in May 2014 and endorsed for use in the EU in September 2016. It is effective for financial years beginning on or 
after 1 January 2018, and it will be adopted by the Group with effect from 1 October 2018.
The Standard is unlikely to have a significant impact as the majority of the Group’s income is generated from financial instruments and is 
therefore not in scope of the Standard. For those revenues that are in scope (typically fees and other commissions), the Group continues 
to assess the related performance obligations to identify any fees or other commissions that may require a change in recognition. The 
Group continues to assess the new disclosure requirements of the Standard.
IFRS 16
IFRS 16 was issued in January 2016 and endorsed for use in the EU. It is effective for financial years beginning on or after  
1 January 2019, and will be adopted by the Group with effect from 1 October 2019.
The Group continues to work on and assess the new estimates and judgements required by the Standard and their implications. 
Operating leases will be brought onto the Group balance sheet with an asset recognised for the contractual ‘right of use’ and a liability 
recognised for the contractual payments. The Group expects this work to progress throughout the 2018 reporting period. CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 196

Section 2: Results for the year
2.1 Segment information
The Group’s operating segments are operating units engaged in providing different products or services and whose operating results 
and overall performance are regularly reviewed by the Group’s Chief Operating Decision Maker, the Executive Leadership Team.
The Group’s business is organised into two principal operating segments: SME banking and Retail banking. In addition, Central Functions 
consist of the Group’s back office support functions.
SME banking
The Group’s established regional SME franchise offers a full range of banking products and services to meet business customers’ banking 
needs across its small business, commercial, corporate and specialist and acquisition finance segments.
The Group’s SME franchise comprises small businesses (which the Group defines as businesses with lending of up to £0.5m but less than 
£2.0m in turnover) and commercial businesses (which the Group defines as businesses with lending of more than £0.5m and greater than 
£2.0m in turnover). 
Through its SME franchise, the Group offers a full range of lending products and services across a portfolio consisting of term lending, 
overdrafts and working capital solutions:
 – term lending: the Group offers a wide variety of term loans, both secured and unsecured, and offers customers a range of repayment 
and interest rate options. The majority of the Group’s business term lending is LIBOR based;
 – overdrafts: business overdrafts are the primary type of revolving variable rate credit facility offered by the Group to business customers;
 – invoice finance: the Group advances funds against the customer’s trade receivables;
 – asset finance: these products provide a method of financing capital equipment purchases;

Section 2: Results for the year continued
2.2 Net interest income
Accounting policy
Interest income is reflected in the income statement using the effective interest method which discounts the estimated future cash 
payments or receipts over the expected life of the financial instrument, to the net carrying amount of the financial asset or liability.
When calculating the effective interest rate, cash flows are estimated considering all contractual terms of the financial instrument (e.g. 
prepayment, call and similar options) excluding future credit losses. The calculation includes all fees and points paid or received that are 
an integral part of the effective interest rate such as transaction costs and all other premiums or discounts. Where it is not possible to 
reliably estimate the cash flows or the expected life of a financial instrument (or group of financial instruments), the contractual cash 
flows over the full contractual term of the financial instrument (or group of financial instruments) are used.
Loan origination and commitment fees are recognised within the effective interest rate calculation. Non-utilisation of a commitment 
fee is recognised as revenue upon expiry of the agreed commitment period. Loan related administration and service fees are 
recognised as revenue over the period of service. 
Interest income and interest expense on hedged assets and liabilities and financial assets and liabilities designated as fair value through 
profit or loss are also recognised as part of net interest income. 
Where a trading derivative is economically hedging an interest-bearing financial asset or liability designated at fair value through profit 
or loss, the interest income and expense attributable to the derivative is recognised within net interest income and not as part of the 
fair value movement of the trading derivative.

2.3 Non-interest income
Accounting policy
Gains less losses on financial instruments at fair value
This includes fair value gains and losses from three distinct activities:
 – derivatives classified as held for trading – the full change in fair value of trading derivatives is recognised inclusive of interest 
income and expense arising on those derivatives except when economically hedging other assets and liabilities at fair value outlined 
in note 2.2;
 – other financial assets and liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss – these relate to the Group’s fixed interest rate loan 
portfolio and related term deposits (note 3.3), which were designated at inception as fair value through profit or loss. The fair value 
of these loans is derived from the future loan cash flows using appropriate discount rates and includes adjustments for credit risk 
and credit losses. The valuation technique used is reflective of current market practice; and
 – hedged assets, liabilities and derivatives designated in hedge relationships – fair value movements are recognised on both the 
hedged item and hedging derivative in a fair value hedge relationship (the net of which represents hedge ineffectiveness), and hedge 
ineffectiveness on cash flow hedge relationships (note 3.4).
Fees and commissions
Where not integral to the effective interest rate, these are recognised on an accruals basis as the services are provided or on 
completion of the underlying transaction.

loss, respectively). 
On 28 April 2017, MasterCard completed its acquisition of 94.2% of VocaLink. By virtue of its 3.24% shareholding in VocaLink, the Group 
received cash consideration of £25m. The resulting gain of £20m, which was recognised in the available for sale reserve following the 
acquisition announcement in 2016, was recycled to the income statement and is included within ‘Gains on disposal of available for sale 
financial assets’ in the current year. CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 200

2.4 Operating and administrative expenses
Accounting policy
Personnel expenses primarily consist of wages and salaries, accrued bonus and social security costs arising from services rendered 
by employees during the financial year.
The Group recognises bonus costs where it has a present obligation that can be reliably measured. Bonus costs are recognised over 
the relevant service period required to entitle the employee to the reward.
The Group’s accounting policies on pension expenses and equity based compensation are included in notes 3.16 and 4.2 respectively.

The Group recognised gains in relation to its defined benefit pension scheme in the year. A past service credit of £88m is included in 
personnel expenses as a result of the closure of the Scheme to future accrual for the majority of members. In addition, a curtailment gain 
of £13m was recognised in respect of redundancies which did not attract an enhancement entitlement and offsets against the related 
restructuring costs.

2.5 Taxation
Accounting policy
Income tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax is recognised in the income statement 
except to the extent that it is related to items recognised directly in equity, in which case the tax is also recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable profit or loss for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively 
enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are 
recognised on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial 
statements. Deferred tax is determined using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet 
date and are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled.

Section 2: Results for the year continued
2.5 Taxation continued
The total amount of tax, current and deferred, recognised directly in equity during the year was a credit of £1m (2016: £21m). 
Disallowable expenses represent, in the main, the Group’s share of incremental conduct charges that are not deductible in computing 
taxable profits.
The Conduct indemnity adjustment represents the receipt from/payment to the Group’s former parent less refunds attributable in 
accordance with the indemnity agreement (note 3.14).
The rate at which deferred tax is recognised in respect of the defined benefit pension scheme has changed due to the closure of the 
Scheme. The surplus is accounted for as a potential refund to the employer, not a reduction in future contributions. In accordance with 
tax legislation this ‘authorised surplus payment’ is recognised as a deferred tax liability at 35%. There is an overall rate change in respect 
of the pension of £37m with £30m taken to the income statement and £7m to the statement of other comprehensive income.
2.6 Earnings per share (EPS)
Accounting policy
Basic earnings per share
Basic earnings per share is calculated by taking the profit attributable to ordinary shareholders of the parent company and dividing this 
by the weighted-average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period.
Diluted earnings per share
This requires the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue to be adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential 
ordinary shares. These arise from awards made under equity based compensation schemes. Share awards with performance conditions 
attaching to them are not considered to be dilutive unless these conditions have been met at the reporting date.
The Group presents basic and diluted earnings/(loss) per share data in relation to the ordinary shares of CYBG PLC.

3.2 Financial assets available for sale
Accounting policy
Available for sale financial assets are recognised on trade date and comprise listed and unlisted non-derivative financial assets not 
classified into any other financial asset category. They are initially recognised at fair value including direct and incremental transaction 
costs, and subsequently measured at fair value. Gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are included as a separate 
component of equity until sale or impairment, at which point the cumulative gain or loss is transferred to the income statement.
All available for sale financial assets are continually monitored for evidence of any impairment, which would typically be deemed to have 
arisen where there is evidence of a significant or prolonged reduction in the fair value of the security below its cost. Where such 
evidence of impairment exists, the cumulative net loss previously recognised directly in equity is transferred to the income statement.
In situations where evidence suggests a subsequent increase in value, reversals of impairment of previously impaired equity instruments 
are recognised directly in equity; reversals of impairment of debt instruments are recognised in the income statement.
Interest income, determined using the effective interest method, is recognised in the income statement. Impairment losses and 
translation differences on monetary items are recognised in the income statement within the year in which they arise.

Section 3: Assets and liabilities continued
3.3 Financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss
Accounting policy
Financial assets and liabilities are designated at fair value through profit or loss, with gains and losses recognised in the income 
statement as they arise (note 2.3), when this reduces an accounting mismatch or where the performance is evaluated on a fair value 
basis. In such cases, transaction costs are recognised immediately in the income statement upon initial recognition of the financial asset 
and liability.
The derivatives related to the assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss do not meet the requirements for hedge 
accounting and are accounted for as held for trading derivative financial instruments (note 3.4).
Critical accounting estimates and judgements
Where the fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded on the balance sheet cannot be derived from active markets, 
they are determined using a variety of valuation techniques that include the use of mathematical models. The inputs to these models 
are derived from observable market data where possible, but where such data is not available, judgement is required to establish fair 
values. The judgements include considerations of liquidity and model inputs. 
The most significant judgement is in relation to the Group’s fair value loan portfolio. The most significant input impacting the carrying 
value of the loans other than interest rates is the future expectation of credit losses. Sensitivity analysis indicating the impact of 
reasonably possible changes in this input on the fair value is provided in note 3.18.

Loans and advances 
Included in financial assets at fair value through profit or loss is a historical portfolio of loans (sales ceased in 2012). Interest rate risk 
associated with these loans is managed using interest rate derivative contracts and the loans are recorded at fair value to avoid an 
accounting mismatch. The maximum credit exposure of the loans is £477m (2016: £750m) including accrued interest receivable of £2m 
(2016: £4m). The cumulative loss in the fair value of the loans attributable to changes in credit risk amounts to £11m (2016: £24m) and 
the change for the current year is a decrease of £13m (2016: decrease of £14m), of which £6m (2016: £11m) has been recognised in the 
income statement.
The loans are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy (note 3.18).
Due to customers – term deposits
Included in other financial liabilities at fair value are fixed rate deposits, the interest rate risk on which is hedged using interest rate 
derivative contracts. The deposits are recorded at fair value to avoid an accounting mismatch.
The change in fair value attributable to changes in the Group’s credit risk is £Nil (2016: £Nil). The Group is contractually obligated to pay 
£1m (2016: £3m) less than the carrying amount at maturity to the deposit holder.
The term deposits are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy (note 3.18). CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 205
Strategic report Governance Financial results Risk report Financial statements Additional information
3.4 Derivative financial instruments
Accounting policy
All derivative instruments manage exposures to interest rates and foreign currency and are recognised on the balance sheet at fair 
value on trade date. The carrying value of a derivative is measured at fair value throughout the life of the contract. Derivatives are 
carried as assets when the fair value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative. The notional amount of a derivative 
contract is not recorded on the balance sheet but disclosed as part of this note.
The method of recognising the resulting fair value gain or loss on a derivative depends on whether it is designated as a hedging 
instrument and, if so, the nature of the item being hedged. Certain derivatives are designated as either hedges of highly probable future 
cash flows attributable to a recognised asset or liability, or a highly probable forecast transaction (a cash flow hedge); or hedges of the 
fair value of recognised assets or liabilities or firm commitments (a fair value hedge). 
Cash flow hedge
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognised in 
equity. Specifically, the separate component of equity (note 4.1) is adjusted to the lesser of the cumulative gain or loss on the hedging 
instrument, and the cumulative change in fair value of the expected future cash flows on the hedged item from the inception of the 
hedge. Any remaining gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised in the income statement. The carrying value of the hedged 
item is not adjusted. Amounts accumulated in equity are transferred to the income statement in the period in which the hedged item 
affects profit or loss.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain 
or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the 
income statement. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity 
is immediately transferred to the income statement.
Fair value hedge
The carrying value of the hedged item on initial designation is adjusted for the fair value attributable to the hedged risk. Subsequently, 
changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in the income statement, 
together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk. The movement in the 
fair value of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk is made as an adjustment to the carrying value of the hedged asset or 
liability. Where the hedged item is derecognised from the balance sheet, the adjustment to the carrying amount of the asset or liability 
is immediately transferred to the income statement.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, the adjustment to 
the carrying amount of a hedged item is amortised to the income statement on an effective interest basis over the remaining life of the 
asset or liability.
Hedge effectiveness 
The Group documents, at the inception of a transaction, the relationship between hedging instruments and the hedged items, and 
the Group’s risk management objective and strategy for undertaking these hedge transactions. The documentation covers how 
effectiveness will be measured throughout the life of the hedge relationship and its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an 
ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values 
or cash flows of hedged items. A hedge is expected to be highly effective if the changes in fair value or cash flows attributable to the 
hedged risk during the period for which the hedge is designated are expected to offset in a range of 80% to 125%. 
Derivatives held for trading 
The Group uses derivatives for risk management purposes and does not have a trading book. However, derivatives that do not meet 
the hedging criteria within IAS 39, or for which hedge accounting is not applied, are classified as held for trading. Changes in value of 
held for trading derivatives are immediately recognised in the income statement (note 2.3). CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 206

Derivatives traded to manage the Group’s interest rate exposure on a net portfolio basis are accounted for as cash flow hedges. 
Derivatives traded to manage interest rate risk on certain fixed rate assets, such as UK Government Gilts, are accounted for as  
fair value hedges. The Group also cash flow hedges its foreign currency exposure on material, highly probable non-GBP 
denominated transactions. 
The Group hedging positions also include those designated as foreign currency and interest rate hedges of debt issued from the Group’s 
securitisation and covered bond programmes respectively. As such, certain derivative financial assets and liabilities have been booked in 
structured entities and consolidated within these financial statements.
Cash flow hedged derivatives include vanilla interest rate swaps within macro hedges and cross currency swaps within a structured entity.

3.5 Loans and advances to customers
Accounting policy
Loans and advances to customers arise when the Group provides money directly to a customer and include overdrafts, credit card 
lending, lease finance, mortgages, invoice financing and term lending. 
Loans and advances to customers are initially recognised at fair value including direct and incremental transaction costs. They are 
subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest method, adjusted for impairment losses. They are derecognised 
when the rights to receive cash flows have expired or the Group has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership. 
Leases entered into by the Group as lessor, where the Group transfers substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the 
lessee, are classified as finance leases. The leased asset is not held on the Group balance sheet; instead, a finance lease is recognised 
representing the minimum lease payments receivable under the terms of the lease, discounted at the rate of interest implicit in the 
lease. Interest income is recognised in interest receivable, allocated to accounting periods to reflect a constant periodic rate of return.

The Group has transferred a proportion of mortgages to the securitisation and covered bond programmes (note 3.7).
The Group also has a portfolio of fair valued business loans of £477m (2016: £750m) which are held separately as Other financial  
assets at fair value on the balance sheet (note 3.3). Combined with the above this is equivalent to total loans and advances of  
£31,770m (2016: £29,952m).
Lease finance
The Group leases a variety of assets to third parties under finance lease arrangements, including vehicles and general plant and 
machinery. The cost of assets acquired by the Group during the year for the purpose of letting under finance leases and hire purchase 
contracts amounted to £13m (2016: £5m) and £408m (2016: £381m) respectively. The total receivables from finance leases and hire 
purchase contracts were £17m (2016: £8m) and £550m (2016: £482m) respectively.

3.6 Impairment provisions on credit exposures
Accounting policy
Assets carried at amortised cost
At each reporting date the Group assesses if there is objective evidence of impairment on a financial asset or group of financial assets 
due to one or more loss events that occurred after initial recognition but prior to the balance sheet date. Examples of loss events are 
(i) where there has been an actual breach of contract by the borrower such as a default or delinquency in payment of interest or 
principal; or (ii) the granting of a concession to the borrower that the Group would not otherwise consider.
The Group first assesses whether objective evidence of impairment exists either individually for assets that are separately significant; 
or collectively for assets that are not separately significant. If it is determined that no objective evidence of impairment exists for an 
individually assessed financial asset, whether significant or not, the asset is included in a group of financial assets with similar credit risk 
characteristics and collectively assessed for impairment (‘collective provisions’).
Collective provisions
Collective provisions are generally established for homogenous portfolios such as the Retail portfolios and the small business portfolio 
within the SME franchise. 
Within the Group’s Retail environment, past loss experience is a key factor in determining an appropriate collective provision level and 
takes into account a number of different elements including:
 – the number of days past due; 
 – the realisable value of any security held; and 
 – the timing of any such security sale. 
These and other factors will influence the probability that the customer defaults on the loan (the PD). In the event of a default 
occurrence, the Retail collective provision calculator provides the amount the Group expects to be irrecoverable from that customer 
(the LGD). The level and impact of LGD varies significantly between the Group’s secured and unsecured lending portfolios.
Collective provisioning for the Group’s SME portfolio is also based on the use of PD and LGD. The assets are included in a group of 
financial assets with similar risk characteristics and collectively assessed for impairment. The modelled collective assessment considers 
factors such as:
 – credit quality;
 – levels of arrears;
 – credit utilisation; 
 – loan to collateral ratios; and 
 – other factors including the Group’s internal customer rating system (eCRS).
These characteristics are relevant to the estimation of future cash flows for groups of such assets as they are indicative of the 
borrower’s ability to pay all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the assets being evaluated.
Reliance is placed on the eCRS rating when assessing PD as these are directly mapped within the model. Manual interventions to the 
eCRS rating, such as the placement on a watch list, will directly lead to an increase in PD and consequently the level of collective 
provision required. LGD assumptions are driven by the level of security assigned to the customer within the collective provisioning 
model. These are regularly monitored to ensure comparability with recent actual loss experience.
In addition, for both the Group’s Retail and SME portfolios, experienced judgement is used to estimate the amount of an impairment 
loss. This reflects a limited number of refinements that have been assessed as necessary to reflect specific and evolving circumstances 
that, by their nature, cannot be adequately captured in the models. The use of judgements and supportable estimates is considered by 
management to be an essential part of the credit impairment process. The methodology and assumptions used for estimating future 
cash flows are reviewed regularly to identify and reduce any significant differences between loss estimates and actual loss experience.
Specific provision
If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss has been incurred on a loan, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference 
between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of the estimated future cash flows (including the estimated realisable value 
of any security) discounted at the asset’s original effective interest rate (a ‘specific provision’). 
Specific provision allowances are primarily established against the Group’s commercial business within the SME franchise. Assets are 
reviewed on a regular basis and those showing potential or actual vulnerability are placed onto a watch list where enhanced monitoring 
is undertaken.  CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 211
Strategic report Governance Financial results Risk report Financial statements Additional information
Impairment
When first recognised, the impairment allowance, which is a combination of both the collective and specific provision, is recognised in 
the income statement.
Following impairment, interest income is recognised using the original effective rate of interest which was used to discount the future 
cash flows for the purpose of measuring the impairment loss. If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases 
and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised 
impairment loss is reversed. The amount of the reversal is recognised in the income statement.
When a loan is uncollectible, and all necessary internal procedures have been completed, it is written off against the related impairment 
loss. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off reduce the expense in the income statement.
The Group’s impairment policy for available for sale financial assets is included in note 3.2
Critical accounting estimates and judgements
In determining the required level of collective impairment provisions, the Group uses the output from various statistical models, with 
management judgement required to assess the modelled outputs and, where necessary, make appropriate adjustments. 
The key assumptions within the Group’s collective provisioning models which give rise to significant estimation uncertainty are the PD 
and the LGD. Both measures are predicated on expectations of customer behaviour and performance, which requires management to 
form a judgement based on a wide range of historic and current evidence. The actual amount of the future cash flows and their timing 
may differ significantly from the assumptions made for the purposes of determining the impairment allowances and consequently these 
allowances can be subject to variation as time progresses and the circumstances of the customer become clearer.
From an SME perspective, changes made to eCRS will have a direct impact as these are mapped to PDs. Assumption changes on retail 
customer behaviour will also have an impact on the PDs used. 
Within the Retail portfolio, the Group’s collective provision is reflective of the fact that the majority of lending is concentrated on 
customer mortgages, where the available security is generally sufficient to cover the exposure. This differs from the SME portfolio 
where the availability and strength of the security will have less of an impact on overall recoveries, leading to a potentially higher 
collective provision charge relative to the overall exposure.
Sensitivities within the collective provision
There are interactions between the various assumptions within the provisioning models which mean that no single factor is likely to 
move independent of others; however, the sensitivities disclosed below assume all other assumptions remain unchanged.
If the PDs were to move by +/- 5% from those presently used within the Group’s provisioning models, the impairment provision would 
increase/decrease accordingly by £5m.
An important element to the PD is the loss emergence period (LEP) which represents the Group’s assessment of the period 
from when a loss event occurs to eventual default. The impact of the LEP differs between the Group’s Retail and SME portfolios. 
A two-month increase in the LEP would result in a further £2m impairment provision within the SME portfolio; and a further £1m 
being added to the Retail impairment provision.
To the extent that recovery rates improve from those presently used within each of the Group’s provisioning models by 5%, the 
impairment provision on loans and advances would decrease by £14m. Alternatively, if recovery rates deteriorate by 5%, the impairment 
provision on loans and advances would increase by £24m. 
Provision in the SME portfolio is sensitive not only to default rates and severity of losses, but also to the assessment of risk and security. 
If 10% of the SME portfolio were to fall by one notch, the impairment provision would increase by £2m.
In addition to modelled outputs, the impairment provision is further impacted by management judgements. These include judgements 
that reflect elements which are not sufficiently sensitive to the current economic conditions, model risk reserves that are held to cover 
against a range of potential model limitations, and judgements made in respect of potential recoveries for specific provisions which also 
involve customer and economic specific conditions. These management judgements do not allow for any meaningful sensitivity 
comparison. CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 212

3.7 Securitisation and covered bond programmes
Accounting policy
The Group sponsors the formation of structured entities, primarily for the purpose of facilitation of asset securitisation and covered 
bond transactions to accomplish certain narrow and well-defined objectives. Although the Group has no shareholding in these entities, 
where it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the entities and it has the ability to affect those returns 
through its power over the entity, they are regarded as controlled entities as described in note 1.5 and are consolidated in the Group’s 
financial statements.
Securitisation 
The Group has securitised a proportion of its retail mortgage loan portfolio under the Group’s master trust securitisation programmes. 
The securitised mortgage loans have been assigned at principal value to bankruptcy remote structured entities. These structured 
entities have been funded through the issue of residential mortgage backed debt to third-party institutional debt investors. The Group 
is entitled to any residual income from the vehicles after the debt obligations and senior expenses of the programmes have been met. 
The securitised debt holders have no recourse to the Group other than the principal and interest (including fees) generated from the 
securitised mortgage loan portfolio. The Group continues servicing these mortgage loans in return for an administration fee.
The mortgage loans do not qualify for derecognition because the Group remains exposed to the majority of the risks and rewards 
of the mortgage loan portfolio, principally the associated credit risk. The securitisation structured entities are consolidated and the 
securitised mortgage loans retained on the Group’s balance sheet. A liability is recognised for the proceeds of the funding transaction. 
The externally held securitised notes in issue are included within debt securities in issue (note 3.15). There are a number of notes held 
internally by the Group, not recognised on the balance sheet, which are used as collateral for repurchases and similar transactions or 
for credit enhancement purposes.
Covered bond
A subset of the Group’s retail mortgage loan portfolio has been ring fenced and assigned to a bankruptcy remote limited liability 
partnership, Clydesdale Covered Bond 2 LLP, associated with the covered bond programme, to provide a guarantee for the obligations 
payable on the covered bonds issued by the Group. Similar to the securitisation programmes, the Group is entitled to any residual 
income after all payment obligations due under the terms of the covered bonds and senior programme expenses have been met. 
The Group continues servicing these mortgage loans in return for an administration fee.
The mortgage loans do not qualify for derecognition because the Group retains all of the risks and rewards of the mortgage loan 
portfolio. The covered bond partnership is consolidated with the mortgage loans retained on the consolidated balance sheet and the 
covered bonds issued included within debt securities in issue. The covered bond holders have dual recourse: firstly, to Clydesdale Bank 
PLC on an unsecured basis; and secondly, to the LLP under the Covered Bond Guarantee secured against the mortgage loans. 
Significant restrictions
Where the Group uses its financial assets to raise finance through securitisations and the sale of securities subject to repurchase 
agreements, this leads to the assets becoming encumbered. Once encumbered, the assets are not available for transfer around 
the Group. CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 213

There were no events during the year that resulted in any Group transferred financial assets being derecognised.
The Group has contractual and non-contractual arrangements which may require it to provide financial support as follows:
Securitisation programmes
The Group provides credit support to the structured entities via reserve funds, which are partly funded through subordinated debt 
arrangements and by holding junior notes. Exposures totalled £47m in subordinated debt (2016: £20m) and £856m in junior notes held 
(2016: £610m). The Group has a beneficial interest in the securitised mortgage portfolio held by the structured entities of £711m 
(2016: £977m). 
Furthermore, the Group has an obligation to repurchase mortgage exposures if certain mortgage loans no longer meet the  
programme criteria. 
Looking forward through future reporting periods there are a number of date based options on the notes issued by the structured 
entities which could be actioned by them as issuer. These could require the Group, as sponsor, to provide additional liquidity support.
Covered bond programme
The nominal level of over-collateralisation was £681m (2016: £599m) of the outstanding covered bonds. From time to time the 
obligations of the Group to provide over-collateralisation may increase due to the formal requirements of the programme.
Furthermore, the Group has an obligation to repurchase mortgage exposures if certain mortgage loans no longer meet the  
programme criteria.  CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 214

3.8 Property, plant and equipment
Accounting policy
The Group’s freehold and long-term leasehold land and buildings are carried at their fair value as determined by the Directors, taking 
account of advice received from independent valuers. Fair values are determined in accordance with guidance published by the Royal 
Institution of Chartered Surveyors, including adjustments to observable market inputs reflecting any specific characteristics of the land 
and buildings. Directors’ valuations are performed annually in July, with the independent valuations carried out on a three-year cycle on 
an open market basis. The valuations are classified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy as defined in note 3.18.
All other items of property, plant and equipment are carried at cost, less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Cost includes 
expenditure that is directly attributable to acquisition of the asset. Impairment is assessed whenever events or changes in 
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. 
With the exception of freehold land, all items of property, plant and equipment are depreciated or amortised using the straight line 
method, at rates appropriate to their estimated useful life to the Group. The annual rates of depreciation or amortisation are:
 Buildings    50 years
 Leases (leasehold improvements)  the lower of the expected lease term or the asset’s remaining useful life
 Fixtures and equipment   3–10 years
Residual values and useful lives of assets are reviewed at each reporting date. Depreciation is recognised within depreciation expense in 
the income statement.

3.10 Intangible assets
Accounting policy
Capitalised software costs are stated at cost, less amortisation and any provision for impairment.
Identifiable and directly associated external and internal costs of acquiring and developing software are capitalised where the software 
is controlled by the Group, and where it is probable that future economic benefits that exceed its cost will flow from its use over more 
than one year. Costs associated with maintaining software are recognised as an expense as incurred. Capitalised computer software 
costs are amortised on a straight line basis over their expected useful lives, usually between three and 10 years. Impairment losses are 
recognised in the income statement as incurred.
Assets that are subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the 
carrying amount may not be recoverable, which typically arises when the benefits associated with the software were substantially 
reduced from what had originally been anticipated or the asset has been superseded by a subsequent investment. In such situations, 
an impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount. 
The recoverable amount of an asset is the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal or its value in use.
Intangible assets which are fully amortised are reviewed annually to consider whether the assets remain in use.

3.11 Deferred tax
Accounting policy
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and 
their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements. A deferred tax asset is recognised for unused tax losses and unused tax 
credits only if it is probable that future taxable amounts will arise against which those temporary differences and losses may be utilised.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements
The Group has deferred tax assets of £154m (2016: £183m); the reduction from the previous balance sheet date is due to the 
movement in the defined benefit pension scheme to a surplus and the utilisation of the capital allowance deferred tax asset. The  
Group has assessed the recoverability of these deferred tax assets at 30 September 2017 and considers it probable that sufficient 
future taxable profits will be available against which the underlying deductible temporary differences can be utilised over the  
corporate planning horizon. 
At 30 September 2017, the Group had an unrecognised deferred tax asset of £180m (2016: £202m) representing trading losses with a 
gross value of £1,058m (2016: £1,186m). Although there is no prescribed period after which losses expire, a deferred tax asset has not 
been recognised in respect of these losses as the Directors have insufficient certainty over their recoverability in the foreseeable future.

The statutory rate of UK corporation tax is 19% from 1 April 2017 and as enacted in Finance Act 2016 will fall to 17% from 1 April 2020. 
In accordance with IAS 12, these rates are taken into account in assessing the value at which assets are expected to be realised and 
liabilities settled. 
Finance Bill (No. 2) 2017 contains draft legislation in respect of the Corporate Tax Loss Restriction and the Corporate Interest 
Restriction which was due to apply from 1 April 2017. As the legislation was not substantively enacted at the balance sheet date it has not 
been applied in the calculation of the tax position at 30 September 2017. Management expects that given the Group’s particular asset 
profile in respect of losses, application of the new rules would have resulted in an immaterial increase in the deferred tax asset recognised 
on the balance sheet. This is expected given that the new rules are designed to accelerate the payment of corporation tax.
The rate at which deferred tax is recognised in respect of the defined benefit pension scheme has changed due to the closure of the 
Scheme to the majority of members (note 3.16). The surplus is accounted for as a potential refund to the employer, rather than a 
reduction in future contributions. In accordance with tax legislation this ‘authorised surplus payment’ is recognised as a deferred tax 
liability at 35%. There is an overall rate change in respect of the pension of £37m with £30m charged in the income statement and £7m 
charged directly to equity. CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 218

3.14 Provision for liabilities and charges
Accounting policy
Provisions for liabilities and charges are recognised when a legal or constructive obligation exists as a result of past events, it is probable 
that an outflow of economic benefits will be necessary to settle the obligation, and the obligation can be reliably estimated. Provisions 
for liabilities and charges are not discounted to the present value of their expected net future cash flows except where the time value 
of money is considered material.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements
PPI redress provision and other conduct related matters
Management has exercised significant judgement around the key assumptions that underpin the estimates and used estimation 
techniques to quantify them. Ongoing regulatory review and input, as well as rulings from the Financial Ombudsman Service over time, 
and the Group’s internal reviews and assessments of customer complaints, will continue to impact upon the nature and extent of 
conduct related customer redress and associated costs for which the Group may ultimately become liable in future periods.
Significant judgement is required in determining the key assumptions used to estimate the quantum of the provision, including the level 
of future complaint volumes, uphold rates (how many claims are, or may be, upheld in the customer’s favour), and redress costs (the 
average payment made to customers). Also factored into the estimate is the effect of the judgements required around the outcome 
of the remediation activity. The provision is therefore subject to inherent uncertainties as a result of the subjective nature of the 
assumptions used in quantifying the overall estimated position at 30 September 2017, consequently, the provision calculated may be 
subject to change in future years if outcomes differ to those currently assumed. Sensitivity analysis indicating the impact of reasonably 
possible changes in key assumptions on the PPI provision is presented within this note.
There are similar uncertainties and judgements for other conduct risk related matters, however the level of liability is materially lower.

3.14 Provision for liabilities and charges continued
PPI redress
In common with the wider UK retail banking sector, the Group continues to deal with complaints and redress issues arising out of historic 
sales of PPI. During the year, the Group reassessed the level of provision that was considered appropriate to meet current and future 
expectations in relation to the mis-selling of PPI policies and concluded that a further charge of £494m was required incorporating the 
Group’s estimate of the impact of PS17/3 issued on 2 March 2017 relating to a proposed time bar for complaints in August 2019. It also 
incorporated a reassessment of the costs of processing cases and the impact of experience adjustments. Only 9.7% of the charge 
impacts the Group’s income statement (£48m) as a result of the Capped Indemnity. The total provision raised to date in respect of PPI 
is £2,140m (2016: £1,646m), with £422m of this remaining (2016: £725m) comprising £201m for customer initiated complaints and 
proactive customer contact (2016: £299m); £80m for the remediation of complaints closed prior to August 2014 (2016: £257m); and 
£142m for costs of administering the redress programme (2016: £169m).
To 30 September 2017, the Group has received 361,000 complaints (2016: 282,000) and has allowed for 73,000 further walk in 
complaints. This reflects an expectation that the volume of walk in complaints will reduce compared to most recent experience as the 
time bar approaches. Future complaint volumes could differ from the Group’s assumption, which could result in a further provision 
being required.
The Group implemented a comprehensive new PPI complaint handling process from August 2014 which involved making a number of 
significant changes to the PPI operations which resulted in an increase in operational and administrative costs. As reported previously, 
the Group is in the process of re-opening approximately 180,000 complaints and reviewing the original decision reached in light of the 
new PPI complaint handling processes. As at 30 September 2017, this exercise is approximately 83% complete. 
In addition to the remediation activity described above, the Group has completed a past business review (PBR) of certain PPI sales, to 
determine if there was actual or potential customer detriment in the sales process leading to a risk of mis-sale and the potential for 
proactive redress. The review indicated a more favourable outcome than allowed for in the assumptions underpinning the provision  
as at 30 September 2016.
The increase in provision has taken into account all of the above factors as well as a revision in the Group’s expectation of new  
customer initiated complaints in light of current experience with the overall provision based on a number of assumptions derived from 
a combination of past experience, estimated future experience, industry comparison and the exercise of judgement in the key areas 
identified. There remain risks and uncertainties in relation to these assumptions and consequently in relation to the ultimate costs of 
redress and related costs, including: (i) the number of PPI claims (and the extent to which this is influenced by the activity of claims 
management companies, the application of a time bar, Plevin, and FCA advertising); (ii) the number of those claims that ultimately will 
be upheld; (iii) the amount that will be paid in respect of those claims; (iv) any additional amounts that may need to be paid in respect 
to previously handled claims; (v) the response rates to the proactive customer contact; and (vi) the costs of administering the 
remediation programme. 
As such, the factors discussed above mean there is a risk that existing provisions for PPI customer redress may not cover all potential 
costs. In light of this, the eventual costs of PPI redress and complaint handling may therefore differ materially from that estimated and 
further provision could be required.
The table below sets out the key assumptions and the effect on the provision at 30 September 2017 of future, potential, changes  
in key assumptions:
Assumptions
Change in
assumption Sensitivity
 (1)
Number of expected future customer initiated complaints (73,000 cases) +/-10% £22m
Uphold rates:
Future complaints +/-1% £3m
Pre August 2014 complaints review +/-1% £1m
Average redress costs
(2)
+/-1% £2m
(1) There are inter-dependencies between several of the key assumptions which add to the complexity of the judgements the Group has to make. This means that no single

not incorporate the impact, if any, on the administrative cost element of the provision.

Strategic report Governance Financial results Risk report Financial statements Additional information
The number of complaints received is monitored against past experience and future expectations and the Group will continue to 
reassess the adequacy of the provision for this matter and the assumptions underlying the provision calculation based upon experience 
and other relevant factors as matters develop.
Customer redress and other provisions
In addition to PPI redress set out above, provision for customer redress is held in those instances where the Group expects to make 
payments to customers whether on an ex-gratia or compensatory basis. Provisions can arise as a result of legal or regulatory action 
and can incorporate the costs of skilled persons, independent reviewers, and where appropriate other elements of administration. 
The Group has reassessed the level of provision considered necessary in light of the current and future expected claims for all of these 
matters and concluded that no additional provisions are required to cover the expected tail of new complaints received at this stage. 
Other provisions also include amounts in respect of a number of other non-PPI conduct related matters, legal proceedings, and claims 
arising in the ordinary course of the Group’s business. Over the course of the year, the Group has raised further provisions of £98m 
for these matters, but only 9.7% of the charge impacts the Group’s income statement (£10m) as a result of the Capped Indemnity. 
The ultimate cost to the Group of other customer redress matters is driven by a number of factors relating to offers of redress, 
compensation, offers of alternative products, consequential loss claims and administrative costs. The matters are at varying stages of 
their life cycle and in certain circumstances, usually early in the life of a potential issue, elements of the potential exposure are contingent. 
These factors could result in the total cost of review and redress varying materially from the Group’s estimate. The final amount required 
to settle the Group’s potential liabilities in these matters is therefore uncertain and further provision could be required. During the year 
£Nil (30 September 2016: £1m) was also recognised for provisions not related to customer redress/conduct risk. 
Conduct Indemnity Deed
The Group’s economic exposure to the impact of historic conduct related liabilities is mitigated by a Capped Indemnity from NAB. The 
Company and NAB have an agreement under which NAB has provided the Company with a Capped Indemnity to meet the costs of 
dealing with conduct matters related to products sold in the period prior to the date of the Group’s demerger from NAB (the Conduct 
Indemnity Deed). The legacy conduct matters covered by the Capped Indemnity are referred to as Relevant Conduct Matters. The 
Capped Indemnity provides the Group with economic protection against certain costs and liabilities (including financial penalties imposed 
by a regulator) resulting from conduct issues relating to:
a) PPI, standalone interest rate hedging products, voluntary scope tailored business loans and fixed rate tailored business loans; and
b)  other conduct matters, subject to certain limitations and minimum financial thresholds.
Amounts payable under the Capped Indemnity include, subject to certain limitations, payments to customers to satisfy, settle or 
discharge a Relevant Conduct Matter and the direct costs and expenses of satisfying, settling, discharging or administering such Relevant 
Conduct Matter. 
It has been agreed that NAB will meet 90.3% of Qualifying Conduct Costs claimed by the Company, up to the amount of the Capped 
Indemnity.
Claims under the Capped Indemnity are recognised in the consolidated income statement simultaneously with the charge for Relevant 
Conduct Matters. The conduct expense and associated reimbursement income are presented net within Other operating and 
administrative expenses. A reimbursement receivable is recognised on the consolidated balance sheet within Due from other banks; 
this receivable is periodically settled by NAB. The reimbursement receivable is not offset against the provision amount on the Group’s 
consolidated balance sheet. The provision expense and reimbursement income are disclosed above. 
No reimbursement income or receivable is recognised on the consolidated balance sheet in relation to contingent liabilities for Relevant 
Conduct Matters. Any possible future reimbursement income linked to contingent liabilities in respect of Relevant Conduct Matters is 
not disclosed as a contingent asset as the amounts cannot be reliably estimated and are not virtually certain to be received.
To the extent that it is no longer probable that provisions for a Relevant Conduct Matter previously raised will be required to settle 
conduct obligations and a provision for a Relevant Conduct Matter is released as unutilised, the related Capped Indemnity amounts 
received will become repayable to NAB. 
Should the Qualifying Conduct costs exceed the Capped Indemnity, any excess cost will be borne by the Group.
To the extent that tax relief is expected in relation to provisions for which reimbursement income is applicable, amounts may become 
repayable to NAB. In the consolidated financial statements, deferred tax assets are only recognised in respect of the loss share 
proportion (9.7%) of unused tax losses on Relevant Conduct Matters, on the basis that the Group does not obtain the economic benefit 
of the future tax relief which is repayable to NAB. CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 222

Duration and termination
The indemnity protection provided by NAB to the Company in respect of Relevant Conduct Matters under the Capped Indemnity 
is perpetual in nature, except in the following circumstances:
(a)  it is fully utilised by the Group; or
(b)  in the event that, at any time:
 (i) the PRA determines that NAB’s remaining exposure under the Capped Indemnity; or
 (ii) the Unutilised Indemnity Amount, 
 is £100m or less, NAB will have the right (with the approval of the PRA (at its sole discretion)) to terminate the Capped Indemnity by 
subscribing for shares (at a price equivalent to the prevailing five-day average market price for the shares) in an amount equal to the 
Unutilised Indemnity Amount, provided that the maximum value of the shares to be subscribed for does not exceed a value equal to 
9.9% of the issued share capital of the Group (on an undiluted basis) at such time (a ‘£100m Termination’).
(c)  NAB and the Group may also agree arrangements to terminate or replace the Capped Indemnity with the consent of the PRA. In 
particular, NAB and the Group have agreed that they will, on the fifth anniversary of the demerger (and, if relevant, each subsequent 
anniversary of the demerger), seek to agree arrangements to terminate the Capped Indemnity. If any such arrangements are agreed 
between NAB and the Group, they will be required to obtain the approval of the PRA (at its sole discretion) before commencing the 
implementation of such arrangements. In relation to proposals made by NAB to the Group in connection with such termination of the 
Capped Indemnity, the Group cannot unreasonably withhold its agreement to the Capped Indemnity being replaced by a payment equal 
to the Unutilised Indemnity Amount to be applied (in  whole or in part) in subscribing for shares (at a price equivalent to the prevailing 
five-day average market price for the shares), provided that the maximum value of the shares to be subscribed for pursuant to such 
proposal would not exceed £200m or if lower, a value equal to 9.9% of the issued share capital of the Group (on an undiluted basis) 
at such time (a ‘Post-5 Year Equity Subscription Termination’).
If £100m Termination or Post-5 Year Equity Subscription Termination occurs, the Group will not be entitled to make any further claims 
under the Capped Indemnity, but will be entitled to retain in a designated account for a period of three years following such termination, 
any Unutilised Covered Amount and any amount to be withdrawn from a designated account in respect of conduct costs that fall within 
the scope of the Capped Indemnity which have been incurred and paid by the Group prior to such termination. The Company will be 
required to return to NAB any other amounts in a designated account and to release to NAB all amounts remaining in the collateral 
account. Following the expiry of such three-year period, the Group will be required to repay all remaining amounts in a designated 
account net of any amount to be withdrawn from a designated account in respect of conduct costs that fall within the scope of the 
Capped Indemnity which have been incurred and paid by Group prior to such anniversary.
Restructuring provision
Restructuring of the business is currently ongoing and a provision is held to cover redundancy payments, property vacation costs and 
associated enablement costs. During the year £67m (2016: £45m) was charged to the income statement, of which £9m (2016: £6m) was 
charged directly to the income statement and £58m (2016: £39m) was provided for in accordance with the requirements of IAS 37. 
£61m (2016: £31m) of the total provision was utilised in the year. CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 223
Strategic report Governance Financial results Risk report Financial statements Additional information
Included within the restructuring provision is an amount for committed rental expense on surplus lease space consistent with the 
expected exposure on individual leases where the property is unoccupied. This element of the provision will be utilised over the 
remaining life of the leases or until the leases are assigned, and is measured at present values by discounting anticipated future cash flows.
3.15 Debt securities in issue
Accounting policy
Debt securities comprise short- and long-term debt issued by the Group including commercial paper, medium-term notes, term loans, 
covered bonds and residential mortgage backed securities (RMBS). 
Debt securities are initially recognised at fair value, being the issue proceeds, net of transaction costs incurred. These instruments are 
subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method resulting in premiums, discounts and associated issue 
costs being recognised in the income statement over the life of the instrument.

3.16 Retirement benefit obligations
Accounting policy
The Group makes contributions to both defined benefit and defined contribution pension schemes which entitle employees to benefits 
on retirement or disability. 
Defined contribution pension scheme
The Group recognises the obligation for contributions to the scheme as an expense in the income statement as incurred. Prepaid 
contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in the future payment is available.
Defined benefit pension scheme
A liability or asset in respect of the defined benefit scheme is recognised on the balance sheet and is measured as the present value of 
the defined benefit obligation less the fair value of the defined benefit scheme assets at the reporting date. The present value of the 
defined benefit obligation for the scheme is discounted by high quality corporate bond rates that have maturity dates approximating to 
the terms of the Group’s defined benefit obligation. Surpluses are only recognised to the extent that they are recoverable through 
reduced contributions in the future or through refunds from the scheme. In assessing whether a surplus is recoverable, the Group 
considers its current right to obtain a refund or a reduction in future contributions and does not anticipate any future acts by other 
parties that could change the amount of the surplus that may be ultimately recovered.
Pension expense attributable to the Group’s defined benefit scheme comprises current service cost, net interest on the net defined 
benefit obligation/asset, past service cost resulting from a scheme amendment or curtailment, gains or losses on settlement and 
administrative costs incurred. Where actuarial remeasurements arise, the Group recognises such amounts directly in equity through 
the statement of comprehensive income in the period in which they occur. Actuarial remeasurements arise from experience 
adjustments (the effects of differences between previous actuarial assumptions and what has actually occurred) and changes in 
actuarial assumptions. CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 225
Strategic report Governance Financial results Risk report Financial statements Additional information
The Group operates both defined benefit and defined contribution arrangements. The Group’s principal trading subsidiary, Clydesdale 
Bank PLC, is the sponsoring employer in one funded defined benefit pension scheme, the Yorkshire and Clydesdale Bank Pension 
Scheme (‘the Scheme’). The Scheme was established under trust on 30 September 2009 as a result of the merger of the Clydesdale 
Bank Pension Scheme and the Yorkshire Bank Pension Fund. The assets of the Scheme are held in a trustee administered fund, with the 
Trustee responsible for the operation and governance of the Scheme, including making decisions regarding the Scheme’s funding and 
investment strategy. 
The Scheme is subject to the funding legislation outlined in the Pensions Act 2004 which came into force on 30 December 2005.  
This, together with documents issued by the Pensions Regulator, sets out the framework for funding defined benefit occupational 
pension plans in the UK. 
The Group also provides post-retirement health care under a defined benefit scheme for pensioners and their dependant relatives for 
which provision has been made on a basis consistent with the methodology applied to the defined benefit pension scheme. This is a 
closed scheme and the provision will be utilised over the life of the remaining scheme members.

(1) Active members include current employees who became deferred members on 1 August 2017 as part of the Scheme closure exercise. 
The Group has implemented a number of reforms to the Scheme to manage the liability. It closed the Scheme to new members in 2004 
and since April 2006 has determined benefits accruing on a career average revalued earnings basis. On 1 August 2017, the Scheme was 
closed to future benefit accrual for the majority of current employees, with affected employees’ future pension benefits being provided 
through the existing defined contribution scheme, ‘Total Pension’. The Total Pension income statement charge for the year is shown in 
note 2.4. The closure of the Scheme for the majority of current employees has resulted in a reduction in the defined benefit obligation, 
recognised as a past service credit in the year.
During the year, Clydesdale Bank PLC reached agreement with the Trustee on the Scheme funding valuation at 30 September 2016, 
with a calculated deficit of £290m. In the recovery plan dated 31 July 2017 the Group agreed to contribute £50m per annum until 
31 March 2022 and £55m in the year to 31 March 2023 to eliminate this deficit.

increased or decreased exposures to the physical asset categories disclosed above.
The Scheme is not invested in any of the Group’s own financial instruments. 
Through its defined benefit pension plan and post-employment medical plan, the Group is exposed to a number of risks. The main risk 
to the Group is that additional contributions are required if the Scheme’s assets are not sufficient to pay for the benefits (which will be 
influenced mainly by inflation and the longevity of members). The level of asset returns will be a key factor in the overall investment 
return. The investment portfolio is subject also to a range of risks typical of the assets held, in particular equity risk, credit risk on bonds 
and exposure to the property market. CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 227
Strategic report Governance Financial results Risk report Financial statements Additional information
The Trustee has implemented an investment structure (including physical assets and derivatives) that seeks to reduce the Scheme’s 
exposure to inflation and interest rate risks. The current hedge ratio is around 60% of liabilities when measured on a self-sufficiency basis. 
This strategy reflects the Scheme’s liability profile and the Trustee’s and the Group’s attitude to risk. The Trustee monitors the investment 
objectives and asset allocation policy on a regular basis.

Critical accounting estimates and judgements
The value of the Group’s defined benefit pension scheme requires management to make several assumptions. The key areas of 
estimation uncertainty are:
 – The discount rate applied. The discount rate is required to be set with reference to market yields at the end of the reporting period on 
high quality corporate bonds in the currency and with a term consistent with the Scheme’s obligations. The average duration of the 
Scheme’s obligations is approximately 20 years. The market for bonds with a similar duration is illiquid and, as a result, significant 
management judgement is required to determine an appropriate yield curve on which to base the discount rate. 
 – Inflation assumptions. Inflation is set with reference to market expectations of the RPI measure of inflation for a term consistent with 
the Scheme’s obligations, based on data published by the BoE. Other measures of inflation (such as CPI, or inflation measures 
subject to an annual cap) are derived from this assumption.
 – Mortality assumptions. The cost of the benefits payable by the Scheme will also depend upon the life expectancy of the members. 
The assumptions for mortality rates are based on standard mortality tables which allow for future improvements in life expectancies.
The table below sets out the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation and pension cost to realistic changes in the key actuarial 
assumptions: 
Assumption change

-0.25% (135) 4
Life expectancy
+1 year 136 4
-1 year (139) (4)
The above sensitivity analyses are based on a change in an assumption while holding all other assumptions constant. In practice, 
changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated.
The discounted mean term of the defined benefit obligation at 30 September 2017 is 20 years (2016: 22 years). The expected 
contributions for the year ending 30 September 2018 are £33m (2017: £Nil) and expected benefit payments for the year ending 
30 September 2018 are £100m (2017: £85m).
During the current year, the Group and Trustee entered into a contingent security arrangement (the ‘Security Arrangement’) (note 5.3).

3.18 Fair value of financial instruments
Accounting policy
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset, or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market 
participants at the valuation date.
When available, the Group measures the fair value of an instrument using quoted prices in an active market for that instrument. Where 
no such active market exists for the particular asset or liability, the Group uses a valuation technique to arrive at the fair value, including 
the use of transaction prices obtained in recent arm’s length transactions where possible, discounted cash flow analysis, option pricing 
models and other valuation techniques commonly used by market participants. In doing so, fair value is estimated using a valuation 
technique that makes maximum possible use of market inputs and that places minimal possible reliance upon entity-specific inputs.
The best evidence of the fair value of a financial instrument at initial recognition is the transaction price, which represents the fair value 
of the consideration given or received, unless the fair value of that instrument is evidenced by comparison with other observable 
current market transactions in the same instrument (i.e. without modification or repackaging) or based on a valuation technique whose 
variables include only data from observable markets. When such evidence exists, the Group recognises profits or losses on the 
transaction date.
In certain limited circumstances the Group applies the fair value measurement option to financial assets including loans and advances 
where the inherent market risks (principally interest rate and option risk) are individually hedged using appropriate interest rate 
derivatives. The loan is designated as being carried at fair value through profit or loss to offset the movements in the fair value of the 
derivative within the income statement and therefore avoid accounting mismatch. When a loan is held at fair value, a statistical based 
calculation is used to estimate expected losses attributable to adverse movements in credit risk on the assets held. This adjustment 
to the credit quality of the asset is then applied to the carrying amount of the loan to arrive at fair value and recognised in the 
income statement.
Analysis of the fair value disclosures uses a hierarchy that reflects the significance of inputs used in measuring fair value. The level in the 
fair value hierarchy within which a fair value measurement is categorised is determined on the basis of the lowest level input that is 
significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The fair value hierarchy is as follows:
 – Level 1 fair value measurements – quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for an identical financial asset or liability;
 – Level 2 fair value measurements – inputs other than quoted prices within Level 1 that are observable for the financial asset or liability, 
either directly (as prices) or indirectly (derived from prices); and
 – Level 3 fair value measurements – inputs for the financial asset or liability that are not based on observable market data  
(unobservable inputs).
For the purpose of reporting movements between levels of the fair value hierarchy, transfers are recognised at the beginning of the 
reporting period in which they occur.
(a) Fair value of financial instruments recognised on the balance sheet at amortised cost
The tables overleaf show a comparison of the carrying amounts of financial assets and liabilities measured at amortised cost, as reported 
on the balance sheet, and their fair values where these are not approximately equal.
There are various limitations inherent in this fair value disclosure particularly where prices are derived from unobservable inputs due to 
some financial instruments not being traded in an active market. The methodologies and assumptions used in the fair value estimates are 
therefore described in the notes to the tables. The difference between carrying value and fair value is relevant in a trading environment, 
but is not relevant to assets such as loans and advances. CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 230

The Group’s fair values disclosed for financial instruments at amortised cost are based on the following methodologies and assumptions:
(a)  Loans and advances to customers – The fair values of loans and advances are determined by firstly segregating them into portfolios of 
similar characteristics. Contractual cash flows are then adjusted for expected credit losses and expectations of customer behaviour 
based on observed historic data. The cash flows are then discounted using current market rates for instruments of similar terms and 
maturity to arrive at an estimate of their fair value. Certain variable rate loan portfolios are discounted using market rates on similar 
loans offered by the Group at the valuation date.
(b)  Due to customers – The fair value of deposits is determined from a discounted cash flow model using current market rates for 
instruments of similar terms and maturity.
(c)  Debt securities in issue – The fair value is taken directly from quoted market prices where available or determined from a discounted 
cash flow model using current market rates for instruments of similar terms and maturity. 
(b) Fair value of financial instruments recognised on the balance sheet at fair value
The following tables provide an analysis of financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, using the

There were no transfers between Level 1 and 2 in the year.
The Group’s fair values for financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value are based on the 
following methodologies and assumptions:
(a)   Derivative financial assets and liabilities – The fair values of derivatives, including foreign exchange contracts, interest rate swaps,  
interest rate and currency option contracts, and currency swaps, are obtained from discounted cash flow models or option pricing 
models as appropriate. CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 231
Strategic report Governance Financial results Risk report Financial statements Additional information
(b)   Available for sale investments 
 – Listed (Level 1) – The fair values of listed investments are based on quoted closing market prices. 
 – Unlisted (Level 3) – Includes £2m of Visa Inc. preferred stock received as partial consideration for the sale of the Group’s share in 
Visa Europe (note 2.3). The preferred stock is convertible into Visa Inc. common stock or its equivalent at a future date, subject to 
potential reduction for certain litigation losses that may be incurred by Visa Europe. The fair value of the preference shares has 
been calculated by taking the period end New York Stock Exchange share price for Visa Inc. and discounting for illiquidity and 
clawback related to contingent litigation. For other unlisted equity and debt investments, the Group’s share of the net asset value 
or the transaction price respectively are considered the best representation of the exit price and are the Group’s best estimates 
of fair value.
 – Available for sale – other (Level 3) – The other available for sale financial asset represents deferred consideration receivable and 
consists of the rights to future commission. The valuation is determined from a discounted cash flow model incorporating 
estimated attrition rates and investment growth rates appropriate to the underlying funds under management.
(c)  Financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss – fair values are derived from data or valuation techniques based upon 
observable market data and non-observable inputs as appropriate to the nature and type of the underlying instrument.
Assets and liabilities measured at fair value based on valuation techniques for which any significant input is not based on observable

The Group has £26m (2016: £48m) of financial liabilities at fair value classed as Level 3 which represent a portfolio of term deposits that 
are directly linked to the customer loans, which are also held at fair value and classed as Level 3. Their relationship to the fair value assets 
is such that should the liability be settled, the amount payable would be net of the fair value asset. 
Sensitivity of Level 3 fair value measurements to reasonably possible alternative assumptions 
Where valuation techniques use non-observable inputs that are significant to a fair value measurement in its entirety, changing these 
inputs will change the resultant fair value measurement.
The most significant exposure to Level 3 fair value measurements is in respect of the Group’s fair value loan portfolio with the most 
significant input (other than interest rates) being the future expectations of credit losses. If lifetime expected losses were 20% greater 
than predicted, the carrying value of the loans would decrease by £2m and vice versa. 
The most significant input impacting the fair value of the available for sale – other asset is the funds under management attrition rate. 
The Group currently assumes a 15% attrition rate. If this rate was 20% the fair value would reduce by £1m, if it was 10% the fair value 
would increase by £2m. 
The most significant input impacting the fair value of the available for sale – investments is contingent litigation risk. If this risk crystallised, 
the fair value would reduce by £2m. In the event the litigation risk did not transpire the fair value would increase by £3m.  Other than 
these significant Level 3 measurements, the Group has a limited remaining exposure to Level 3 fair value measurements, and changing 
one or more of the inputs for fair value measurements in Level 3 to reasonable alternative assumptions would not change the fair value 
significantly with respect to profit or loss, total assets, total liabilities or equity on these remaining Level 3 measurements. CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 233

Section 4: Capital
4.1 Equity
Accounting policy
Equity
The financial instruments issued by the Company are treated as equity (i.e. forming part of shareholders’ funds) only to the extent that 
they meet the following two conditions:
(a) they include no contractual obligations upon the Company to deliver cash or other financial assets or to exchange financial assets or 
financial liabilities with another party under conditions that are potentially unfavourable to the Group; and
(b) where the instrument will or may be settled in the Company’s own equity instruments, it is either a non-derivative that includes no 
obligation to deliver a variable number of the Company’s own equity instruments or is a derivative that will be settled by the Company 
exchanging a fixed amount of cash or other financial assets for a fixed number of its own equity instruments. 
To the extent that this definition is not met, the proceeds of issue are classified as a financial liability.
Dividends
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options or to the acquisition of a business are shown in equity as 
a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
Final dividends on ordinary shares are recognised as a liability and deducted from equity when they are approved by the Company’s 
shareholders. Interim dividends are deducted from equity when they are no longer at the discretion of the Company.
Proposed final dividends for the year are disclosed as an event after the balance sheet date.

During the year 2,074,214 (2016: 2,216,596) ordinary shares were issued under employee share schemes with a nominal value of £0.2m 
(2016: £0.2m).
The share for share exchange in the year to 30 September 2016 arose on the Group’s demerger from NAB and listing on the London 
Stock Exchange. 
The holders of ordinary shares are entitled to dividends as declared from time to time and are entitled to one vote per share at meetings 
of the shareholders of the Company. All shares in issue at 30 September 2017 rank equally with regard to the Company’s residual assets.
The Directors have recommended a final dividend in respect of the year ended 30 September 2017 of 1p per ordinary share in the 
Company (2016: Nil) to be paid on 16 February 2018. The payment of the final dividend is subject to approval of the shareholders at the 
2018 Annual General Meeting. These financial statements do not reflect the recommended dividend. 
With regards to utilisation of the Conduct Indemnity, note 3.14 sets out a number of circumstances where share capital in the Company 
could be subscribed for by NAB.
A description of the other equity categories included within the Consolidated statement of changes in equity, and significant movements 
during the year, is provided below.
4.1.2 Other equity instruments
Other equity instruments consists of Perpetual Contingent Convertible Notes (fixed 8%) which were issued on 8 February 2016 with a 
principal amount of £450m and an optional redemption on 8 December 2022.

4.1.3 Capital reorganisation reserve
The capital reorganisation reserve of £839m was recognised on the issuance of CYBG PLC ordinary shares in February 2016 in 
exchange for the acquisition of the entire share capital of the Group’s previous parent company, CYBI Limited. The reserve reflects the 
difference between the consideration for the issuance of CYBG PLC shares and CYBI Limited’s share capital and share premium.
4.1.4 Merger reserve
A merger reserve of £633m was recognised on the issuance of CYBG PLC ordinary shares in February 2016 in exchange for the 
acquisition of the entire share capital of CYBI Limited. The merger reserve reflects the difference between the consideration for the 
issuance of CYBG PLC shares and the nominal value of the shares issued.
4.1.5 Other reserves
4.1.5.1 Asset revaluation reserve
The asset revaluation reserve includes the gross revaluation increments and decrements arising from the revaluation of land and buildings.
4.1.5.2 Available for sale reserve
The available for sale reserve records the gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of available for sale financial assets. The 
principal movement in the reserve reflects the sale of VocaLink during the year as detailed in note 2.3.
4.1.5.3 Cash flow hedge reserve
The cash flow hedge reserve represents the cumulative post-tax gains and losses on derivatives designated as cash flow hedging 
instruments that will be recycled to the income statement when the hedged items affect profit or loss.
As at 30 September 2017, the cash flow hedge reserve reflected a cumulative loss of £1m (2016: £66m cumulative gain). The fair value 
of derivatives in cash flow hedges decreased by £84m in the year (2016: £105m increase), and a £4m gain (2016: £2m gain) was recycled 
to interest income in line with hedged items affecting profit or loss. A £0.3m loss (2016: £1m loss) was transferred to non-interest 
income due to ineffectiveness arising from cash flow hedges. These movements were offset by a deferred tax credit of £21m  
(2016: charge of £25m). 
4.1.5.4 Equity-based compensation reserve
The Group’s equity based compensation reserve records the value of equity settled share based payment benefits provided to the 
Group’s employees as part of their remuneration that has been charged through the income statement and adjusted for deferred tax.
4.2 Equity based compensation
Accounting policy
The Group operates a number of equity settled share based compensation plans in respect of services received from certain of its 
employees. The fair value of the services received is recognised as an expense. The total amount to be expensed is measured by reference 
to the fair value of the Company’s shares, performance options or performance rights granted, including, where relevant, any market 
performance conditions and any non-vesting conditions. The impacts of any service and non-market performance vesting conditions are 
not included in the fair value and instead are included in estimating the number of awards or options that are expected to vest.
The total expense is recognised over the vesting period, which is the period over which all of the specified vesting conditions are  
to be satisfied. A corresponding credit is recognised in the equity based compensation reserve, adjusted for deferred tax. In some 
circumstances employees may provide services in advance of the grant date and therefore the grant date fair value is estimated  
for the purposes of recognising the expense during the period between the start of the service period and the grant date.
At the end of each reporting period, the Group revises its estimates of the number of shares, performance options and performance 
rights that are expected to vest based on the non-market and service vesting conditions. The impact of the revision to original 
estimates, if any, is recognised in the income statement, with a corresponding adjustment to the equity based compensation reserve.
The equity settled share based payment charge for the year is £6m (2016: £5m).
In the prior year, the figures include awards under the Group’s and NAB share plans. The charges under the NAB share plans were classified 
as equity settled share based payments up to the demerger date of 8 February 2016 and are included in the total above. Following the 
demerger these plans no longer meet the definition of share based payments under IFRS 2 ‘Share based payments’; accordingly, the total 
above excludes NAB share plan costs after 8 February 2016. Details of these plans are included within the Directors’ remuneration report. CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 235

Further detail on each plan is provided below:
Deferred Equity Plan (DEP)
Under the plan employees were awarded conditional rights to CYBG PLC shares. The shares are subject to forfeiture conditions 
including forfeiture as a result of resignation, termination by the Group or failure to meet compliance requirements. Awards include:
 – The upfront and deferred elements of bonus awards where required to comply with the PRA Remuneration Code or the Group’s 
deferral policy.
 – Buyout of equity from previous employment for senior new hires. 
 – Demerger awards which are also subject to the achievement of performance conditions over a three-year period. Details of the 
performance conditions are set out in the Directors’ remuneration report.
Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)
Under the plan employees were awarded conditional rights to CYBG PLC shares. The shares are subject to forfeiture conditions 
including forfeiture as a result of resignation, termination by the Group or failure to meet compliance requirements.
The performance conditions of the plan must be met over a three-year period. The measures reflect a balanced approach between 
financial and non-financial performance and are aligned to the organisation’s strategic goals. Measures, relative weightings and the 
quantum for assessing performance are outlined in the Directors’ remuneration report section. 
Share Incentive Plan (SIP)
Eligible employees at the date of the award, were awarded Group shares, which are held in the Share Incentive Plan Trust (SIP Trust). 
Awards are not subject to performance conditions and participants are the beneficial owners of the shares granted to them, but not the 
registered owners. Voting rights over the shares are normally exercised by the registered owner at the direction of the participants. For 
the 2015 Demerger award, leavers (with the exception of gross misconduct) retain their awards but they must withdraw their shares 
from the SIP Trust. CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 236

Determination of grant date fair values
Participants of the DEP and LTIP plans are not entitled to dividends until the awards vest, but the number of shares which vest may be 
increased to reflect the value of dividends that would have been paid up to the end of the holding period for the awards, subject to the 
extent permitted under the relevant remuneration regulation. Accordingly, the grant date fair value of the awards with only service 
conditions and/or non-market performance conditions has been taken as the market value of the Company’s ordinary shares at the 
grant date. Where awards are subject to non-market performance conditions, an estimate is made of the number of awards expected 
to vest in order to determine the overall share-based payment charge to be recognised over the vesting period. 
The Group has not issued awards under any CYBG plan with market performance conditions. CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 237

Section 5: Other notes
5.1 Contingent liabilities and commitments
Accounting policy
Financial guarantees
The Group provides guarantees in the normal course of business on behalf of its customers. Guarantees written are conditional 
commitments issued by the Group to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party and are primarily issued to support 
direct financial obligations such as commercial bills or other debt instruments issued by a counterparty. The rating of the Group as a 
guarantee provider enhances the marketability of the paper issued by the counterparty in these circumstances. Financial guarantee 
contracts are initially recorded at fair value which is equal to the premium received, unless there is evidence to the contrary. 
Operating lease commitments
The leases entered into by the Group are primarily operating leases; with operating lease rentals charged to the income statement  
on a straight line basis over the period of the lease. The Group discloses its obligations for future minimum payments under  
non-cancellable leases.
Contingent liabilities
Contingent liabilities are possible obligations whose existence will be confirmed only by uncertain future events or present obligations 
where the transfer of economic benefit is uncertain or cannot be reliably measured. Contingent liabilities are not recognised on the 
balance sheet but are disclosed unless they are remote.
The table below sets out the amounts of financial guarantees and commitments which are not recorded on the balance sheet. Financial 
guarantees and commitments are credit-related instruments which include acceptances, letters of credit, guarantees and commitments 
to extend credit. The amounts do not represent the amounts at risk at the balance sheet date but the amounts that would be at risk 
should the contracts be fully drawn upon and the customer default. Since a significant portion of guarantees and commitments is 
expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total of the contract amounts is not representative of future liquidity requirements.

Other contingent liabilities
Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS)
The FSCS provides compensation to depositors in the event that a financial institution is unable to repay amounts due. Following the 
failure of a number of financial institutions, claims were triggered against the FSCS, initially to pay interest on borrowings which the FSCS 
has raised from the UK Government to support the protected deposits. During 2015, the FSCS levy was also invoiced to institutions for 
the third of three annual levies to cover capital repayments to the UK Government. The principal of these borrowings, which remains 
after the three annual levies have been paid, is anticipated to be repaid from the realisation of the assets of the defaulted institutions. 
The FSCS has however confirmed that the size of the future levies will be kept under review in light of developments from the 
insolvent estates.
The FSCS has estimated levies due to 31 March 2018 for the interest on borrowings and an accrual of £2m (30 September 2016: £8m) 
is held for the Group’s calculated liability to that date. The ultimate FSCS levy as a result of the failures is uncertain.
Conduct risk related matters
There continues to be significant uncertainty and thus judgement is required in determining the quantum of conduct risk related 
liabilities, with note 3.14 reflecting the Group’s current position in relation to redress provisions including those for PPI. The final amount 
required to settle the Group’s potential liabilities for these, and other conduct related matters, is materially uncertain. Contingent 
liabilities include those matters where redress is likely to be paid and costs incurred but the amounts cannot currently be estimated. 
The financial exposure to the Group related to legacy conduct risks is mitigated by the Capped Indemnity provided by NAB (note 3.14). 
The Group will continue to reassess the adequacy of provisions for these matters and the assumptions underlying the calculations 
at each reporting date based upon experience and other relevant factors at that time.
Legal claims
The Group is named in and is defending a number of legal claims arising in the ordinary course of business. No material adverse impact 
on the financial position of the Group is expected to arise from the ultimate resolution of these legal actions. CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 239

additional support to the Scheme by underpinning recovery plan contributions and some additional investment risk. The security is in the 
form of a pre-agreed maximum level of assets that are set aside for the benefit of the Pension Scheme in certain trigger events. These 
assets are held by Red Grey Square Funding LLP, an insolvency remote consolidated structured entity. 
The Group incurred costs in relation to pension scheme administration. These costs, which amounted to £0.3m in the year ended 
30 September 2017 (2016: £0.5m), were charged to the Group sponsored scheme. The Group has deposits of £20.3m (2016: £31.7m) 
at the year end placed by the Scheme at market rates.
Pension contributions of £69m (2016: £84m) were made during the year to the Yorkshire and Clydesdale Bank Pension Scheme

Section 6: Notes to the Company financial statements
6.1 Company basis of preparation
The Company is incorporated in the UK and registered in England and Wales.
The Company financial statements of CYBG PLC, the Parent Company (the Company), which should be read in conjunction with 
the Group Directors’ Report, have been prepared on a going concern basis in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the EU and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. 
No individual income statement or statement of comprehensive income is presented for the Company, as permitted by Section 408 
of the Companies Act 2006.
Basis of measurement
The financial information has been prepared under the historical cost convention. The preparation of the financial statements in 
conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting 
policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period 
in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected.
The accounting policies of the Company are the same as those of the Group which are set out in the notes to the consolidated financial 
statements except that the Company has no policy in respect of consolidation. These accounting policies have been applied consistently 
to all periods presented in these financial statements.
6.2 Company investments in controlled entities
Accounting policy
The Company’s investments in controlled entities are valued at cost or valuation less any provision for impairment. Such investments 
are reviewed annually for potential evidence of impairment, or more frequently when there are indications that impairment may have 
occurred. Losses relating to impairment in the value of shares in controlled entities are recognised in the income statement.

 2016

At 30 September 2,249  2,193
As disclosed in note 3.14 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has entered into a Conduct Indemnity Deed with NAB. 
Claims under the Conduct Indemnity Deed are made by the Company, while the provisions in respect of the qualifying conduct costs are 
raised and incurred by its principal trading subsidiary, Clydesdale Bank PLC. As a consequence, the recognition and measurement basis of 
the Capped Indemnity in the Company differs from that of the Group. For the Company, the substance of the indemnity agreement is 
that of variable consideration in relation to its investment in controlled entities.
When a claim is raised under the Capped Indemnity, the Company recognises a receivable from NAB (presented within amounts due 
from other banks) with a corresponding decrease in the cost of the Company’s investments in controlled entities. The Company does 
not recognise any income or expense in relation to claims under the Capped Indemnity. It is intended that upon collection of the claim 
proceeds from NAB the capital impact of providing for Relevant Conduct Matters in Clydesdale Bank PLC is mitigated by the Company 
using the proceeds to subscribe for share capital. During the year ended 30 September 2017 the Company’s investments in controlled 
entities was reduced by £536m (2016: £433m) in relation to Conduct Indemnity adjustments and the Company subscribed for £179m 
(2016: £426m) of additional share capital in its controlled entities. 
Where provisions for Relevant Conduct Matters are increased in respect of a reporting period, but proceeds from that claim are not 
received from NAB prior to the reporting date, the Company has put in place an agreement with Clydesdale Bank PLC in order to 
mitigate the effect of capital losses at the end of the reporting period. Upon raising a provision for a Relevant Conduct Matter, the 
Company indemnifies Clydesdale Bank PLC for the Qualifying Conduct Costs (excluding the Group’s loss share) until it subscribes for an 
equivalent amount of capital in Clydesdale Bank PLC. The Company recognises a capital contribution within investments in controlled 
entities and a liability in amounts due to other entities in respect of these amounts. This totalled £364m at 30 September 2017  
(2016: £7m).

6.4 Company fair value of financial instruments
Analysis of the fair value disclosures uses a hierarchy that reflects the significance of inputs used in measuring the fair value. The level in 
the fair value hierarchy within which a fair value measurement is categorised is determined on the basis of the lowest level input that is 
significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The fair value hierarchy is as follows:
 – Level 1 fair value measurements – quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical financial assets or liabilities.
 – Level 2 fair value measurements – inputs other than quoted prices within Level 1 that are observable for the financial asset or liability, 
either directly (as prices) or indirectly (derived from prices).
 – Level 3 fair value measurements – inputs for the financial asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable 
inputs).
Fair value of financial instruments carried at amortised cost
The tables below show a comparison of the carrying amounts of financial assets and liabilities measured at amortised cost as reported on 
the balance sheet and their fair values where these are not approximately equal. 
There are various limitations inherent in this fair value disclosure particularly where prices may not represent the underlying value due to 
dislocation in the market. Not all of the Company’s financial instruments can be exchanged in an active trading market.

Notes
The Company’s fair values disclosed for financial instruments at amortised cost are based on the following methodologies and assumptions:
Amounts due from related entities – The fair value of subordinated debt due from related entities is derived from quoted market prices of 
the debt security in issue after accounting for differences in credit spread. All other amounts due from related entities are redeemable at 
call and therefore carrying value approximates fair value.
Debt securities in issue – The fair value of subordinated debt is taken directly from quoted market prices. 
6.5 Company reserves
6.5.1 Cash flow hedge reserve
As at 30 September 2017, the cash flow hedge reserve comprised crystallised fair value losses arising from a matured cash flow hedge 
of £2.5m (2016: £3.3m). This hedge relationship was entered into to mitigate the interest rate risk exposure prior to the issuance of the 
subordinated debt. The hedge matured at the date of issue. The balance on the cash flow hedge reserve within the statement of changes 
in equity is net of tax.
The crystallised fair value losses will be amortised from the cash flow hedge reserve to the income statement over the life of the 
subordinated debt. In respect of this, a £0.8m loss (2016: £0.5m loss) was recycled into the income statement during the year. 
6.5.2 Other equity instruments and reserves
Information on other equity instruments and other reserves is provided in note 4.1 to the Group’s consolidated financial statements. 
Included within retained earnings is the profit for the year ended 30 September 2017 of £24m (2016: loss of £3m).
6.5.3 Available distributable items
Distributable reserves are determined as required by the Companies Act 2006 by reference to a company’s individual financial 
statements. At 30 September 2017, the Company had accumulated distributable reserves of £1,002m (2016: £1,003m). CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 248

Measuring financial performance – glossary
Financial performance measures
As highlighted in the Strategic report, the Financial results section and the Risk report, the Group utilises a range of performance 
measures
(1)  
to assess the Group’s performance. These can be grouped under the following headings:
 – Profitability;
 – Asset quality; and 
 – Capital optimisation.
The performance measures used are a combination of statutory, regulatory and alternative performance measures; with the type of 
performance measure used dependent on the component elements and source of what is being measured.
Statutory performance measures (S)
These are used when the basis of the calculation is derived from a measure that is required under generally accepted accounting 
principles (GAAP). An example of this would be references to earnings per share.
Regulatory performance measures (R)
These are used when the basis of the calculation is required and specified by the Group’s regulators. Examples of this would be the 
leverage ratio and the Tier 1 ratio.
Alternative performance measures (A)
These are used when the basis of the calculation is derived from a non-GAAP measure – also referred to as APMs. Examples of this 
would be the cost to income ratio and the return on tangible equity.
Where a performance measure refers to an ‘underlying’ metric, the detail on how this measure is arrived at, along with management’s 
reasoning for excluding the item from the Group’s current underlying performance rationale, can be found on page 252, directly 
following this section. These adjustments to the Group’s statutory results made by management are necessary to provide a more 
meaningful underlying basis.
Descriptions of the performance measures used, including the basis of calculation where appropriate, are set out below:
Profitability:
Term Type Definition
Net interest margin (NIM) A Net interest income as a percentage of average interest earning assets for a given period. Net 
interest income of £844m (2016: £806m) is divided by average interest earning assets for a 
given period of £37,697m (2016: £36,257m) (which is then adjusted to exclude short-term 
repos used for liquidity management purposes, amounts received under the Conduct 
Indemnity and not yet utilised, and any associated income). As a result of the exclusions noted 
above, average interest earning assets used as the denominator have reduced by £491m 
(2016: £698m) and the net interest income numerator has reduced by £1.1m (2016: £2.6m).
Underlying return on 
tangible equity (RoTE)
A Underlying profit after tax less preference share and other distributions as a percentage of 
average tangible equity (total equity less intangible assets and AT1) for a given period.
Underlying cost to income 
ratio (CIR)
A Underlying total operating expenses as a percentage of underlying total operating income for 
a given period.
Underlying basic earnings 
per share (EPS)
A Underlying profit/(loss) attributable to ordinary equity shareholders including tax relief on any

Capital optimisation:
Term Type Definition
Common Equity Tier 1 
(CET1) ratio
R CET1 capital divided by RWAs at a given date.
Tier 1 ratio R Tier 1 capital as a percentage of risk-weighted assets.
Total capital ratio R Total capital resources divided by risk-weighted assets at a given date.
Leverage ratio R This is a regulatory standard ratio proposed by the Basel III as a supplementary measure to the 
risk based capital requirements. It is intended to constrain the build-up of excess leverage in the 
banking sector and is calculated by dividing Tier 1 capital resources by a defined measure of on 
and off-balance sheet items plus derivatives.
Modified leverage ratio R The Group’s leverage ratio on a modified basis, excluding qualifying central bank claims  
from the exposure measure in accordance with the policy statement issued by the PRA 
in October 2017.

Loan to deposit ratio (LDR) R Customer loans as a percentage of customer deposits at a given date.
Liquidity coverage ratio 
(LCR)
R Measures the surplus (or deficit) of the bank’s high quality liquid assets relative to weighted net 
stressed cash outflows over a 30 day period. It assesses whether the bank has sufficient liquid 
assets to withstand a short-term liquidity stress based on cash outflow assumptions provided 
by regulators.
Net stable funding ratio
(NSFR) 
R The total amount of available stable funding divided by the total amount of required stable 
funding, expressed as a percentage. The Group monitors the NSFR based on its own 
interpretations of current guidance available for CRD IV NSFR reporting. Therefore, the 
reported NSFR may change over time with regulatory developments. Due to possible 
differences in interpretation of the rules, the Group’s ratio may not be directly comparable 
with those of other financial institutions.
The Group no longer reports Return on Assets (statutory and underlying basis) as a financial performance measure. Other measures 
presented, such as RoTE, are considered more relevant and useful for assessing profitability. CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 252

Country by country reporting
The Capital Requirements (Country-by-Country Reporting) 
Regulations 2013 came into effect on 1 January 2014 and place 
certain reporting obligations on financial institutions that are 
within the scope of the European Union’s Capital Requirements 
Directive (CRD IV). The purpose of the Regulations is to provide 
clarity on the source of the Group’s income and the locations of 
its operations.
The vast majority of entities that are consolidated within the 
Group’s financial statements are UK registered entities. The 
activities of the Group are described in the Strategic report.
The total operating income and the average number of FTE 
employees during the year to 30 September 2017 were:
2017

Average FTE employees (number) 6,040
Total operating income (£m) 1,036
Profit before tax (£m) 268
Corporation tax paid (£m) –
Public subsidies received (£m) –
The only other non-UK registered entity of the Group is a Trustee 
company that is part of the Group’s securitisation vehicles (Lanark 
and Lannraig). Lannraig Trustees Limited is registered in Jersey. 
This entity plays a part in the overall securitisation process by 
having the beneficial interest in certain mortgage assets assigned 
to it. This entity has no assets or liabilities recognised in its financial 
statements with the securitisation activity taking place in other 
UK registered entities of the structures. This entity does not 
undertake any external economic activity and has no employees. 
The results of this entity as well as those of the entire Lanark and 
Lannraig securitisation structures are consolidated in the financial 
statements of the Group. CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 261

Duplicate shareholder accounts
If you receive more than one copy of Company mailings this may 
indicate that more than one account is held in your name on the 
register. This happens when the registration details of separate 
transactions differ slightly. If you believe more than one account 
exists in your name you may contact the Company’s Registrar, 
Computershare, to request that the accounts are combined. 
There is no charge for this service.

Unsolicited telephone calls and communication
Shareholders are advised to be wary of any unsolicited advice, 
offers to buy shares at a discount, or offers of free reports about 
the Company. These are typically from overseas based ‘brokers’ 
who target shareholders, offering to sell them what often turns 
out to be worthless or high risk shares. These operations are 
commonly known as ‘boiler rooms’ and the ‘brokers’ can be very 
persistent and extremely persuasive.
Shareholders are advised to deal with only financial services firms 
that are authorised by the FCA. You can check a firm is properly 
authorised by the FCA before getting involved by visiting  
www.fca.org.uk/register. If you do deal with an unauthorised firm, 
you will not be eligible to receive payment under the Financial 
Services Compensation Scheme if anything goes wrong. For more 
detailed information on how you can protect yourself from an 
investment scam, or to report a scam, go to www.fca.org.uk/
