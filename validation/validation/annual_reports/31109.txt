STRATEGIC REPORT 
OUR BUSINESS
01 26011   18/05/2018   Proof 4
CHAIRMAN’S  
STATEMENT
2017 was a transformational year for Animalcare 
Group plc. Whilst characterised by continued 
organic growth, the most dominant factor during 
the year was the reverse acquisition of Ecuphar 
NV (“Ecuphar”). The transaction completed 
on 13
th
 July 2017 and our statutory results for 
the year ended December 2017 reflect a full 
12 months contribution from Ecuphar and five 
and a half months of Animalcare Group plc 
(“Animalcare”), as previously constituted. 2016 
comparatives are only for the Ecuphar business. 
Financial Trading
Group revenue increased by 22.4% to £83.7m 
(2016: £68.4m) with 11.3% organic growth 
within the Ecuphar business which contributed 
£76.1m to overall Group revenues and 
£7.6m from the original Animalcare business. 
Underlying EBITDA (which excludes fair value 
adjustments on acquired inventory, amortisation 
of acquired intangibles and acquisition and 
integration costs) increased by 11.9% to £10.0m 
(2016: £8.9m) with £1.6m contributed by the 
Animalcare business. This performance primarily 
reflects the impact of lower gross margins, 
investments to support future growth and the 
disposal of Nutriscience which Ecuphar sold in 
October 2016. Including non-underlying items, 
the Group’s profit before tax decreased to £0.5m 
(2016: £5.1m). The Group generated £2.6m 
(2016: £9.3m) net cash from operations which 
included a cash outflow from non-underlying 
items totalling £3.8m. 
Further details on business performance 
can be found in the CEO Review and CFO 
Review respectively.
Board
Following the acquisition, the executive Directors 
comprised Chris Cardon, who took on the role of 
Chief Executive Officer for the enlarged group, 
supported by Iain Menneer as Chief Operating 
Officer and Walter Beyers as Chief Financial 
Officer. In September 2017 Chris Brewster, who 
at the time of the acquisition stood down as a 
Board Director but remained within the business, 
was reappointed to the Board as Chief Financial 
Officer, replacing Walter Beyers who resigned  
to pursue other interests. More recently Iain 
Menneer stood down as Chief Operating Officer. 
I would like to take the opportunity to recognise 
both Iain’s and Walter’s contributions and we 
wish them well for the future. 
Dividend
The Board is proposing a final dividend of 2.0 
pence per share, which when added to the 
second interim dividend of 4.7 pence per shares 
gives a total dividend of 6.7 pence per share 
since the reverse acquisition. This final dividend 
is subject to shareholder approval at the  
Annual General Meeting on 27th June 2018  
and will be paid on 6th July 2018 to shareholders 
on the register at the close of business on  
8th June 2018.
Product Development
A key strategy for growth remains the continued 
cultivation of a strong new product development 
pipeline. In 2017 we launched Acecare, a 
sedative, from Animalcare’s original UK pipeline 
and sales have performed in line with internal 
forecasts. We have deliberately focused the 
development team on 17 active projects and we 
have a steady flow of products that are going 
through registration and are expected to launch 
in 2018 and 2019. 
Summary and Outlook
Having brought together two highly 
complementary businesses, in particular with 
regard to our respective geographic markets, 
product portfolios and product development 
pipelines, we are growing a successful pan-
European animal health business. We have the 
opportunity to continue this growth through 
further strategic acquisitions, but also through 
organic growth focused on existing products 
and our product development pipeline, as well 
as the synergies and benefits of cross-selling 
which we expect to see impacting our Q4 2018 
performance and more meaningfully in 2019. 
We believe we have created a platform for strong 
future growth and I look forward to updating on 
our progress.

Bringing together two highly complementary businesses, with regard to their 
geographic markets, product portfolios and new product development pipelines, the 
reverse acquisition provides enhanced scale and capabilities for long-term growth.
Animalcare benefits  
from its transformational 
acquisition
Unaudited pro forma aggregated financials for the year ended 31 December 2017  
show combined revenues of £91.1m and underlying EBITDA of £11.8m with double 
digit profit growth expected against these results.
Animalcare is a  
sustainable growing business  
in a growing market
and in a strong financial position to invest in future growth.
Animalcare is  
cash generative
and given its strong balance sheet expects to maintain its current  
dividend policy whilst continuing to invest in new product development.

OUR NEW GROUP
Our business is divided into two divisions: pharmaceuticals and wholesale.
Overview
Products are supplied to animal health professionals both 
directly or through national distribution networks and fall 
into two categories: regulated pharmaceuticals and over 
the counter products. Products are either owned by the 
Group or on distribution from third parties. The Group 
invests significantly in its in-house development pipeline. 
The portfolio is very broad with over 300 products including 
pharmaceuticals, vaccines, biocides and nutraceuticals. 
The Group focuses on certain niche therapy areas including 
odontology, dermatology, otology and surgery/anaesthesia.
Overview
Medini is the wholesaling division based close to Bruges, 
supplying medical, veterinary and paramedical products to 
veterinary professionals throughout Belgium. The business 
has been trading for 25 years and is well established in this 
stable market. The extensive range of over 5,000 products 
includes own label and branded items ranging from small 
disposable items to larger capital equipment and diagnostic 
instruments. The company is a specialist in the supply of 
surgical instruments.

STRATEGIC REPORT 
OUR BUSINESS
05 26011   18/05/2018   Proof 4
OUR MARKETPLACE
One in three homes in Europe is estimated to keep a pet 
prompting total care spending of €38bn. Pet numbers increased 
by 10% between 2012 and 2015 to 623 million in contrast to a 
decline in farm animal numbers by 9% to 296 million.
Of the European medicines sector, valued at approximately 
€6bn in 2017, sales of vaccines and parasiticides represent 30% 
each, €1.8bn, with antimicrobials falling to 13% market share. 
The market as a whole grew by 9% in that period.
Animal health markets in both Europe and the US are now 
dominated by their respective companion animal sectors. The 
latter valued at approximately $5.9bn (www.ahi.org).
Our Primary Market
The enlarged Group now generates 57% of its revenues from 
its sales in the Companion Animal and Equine sector and is 
therefore well placed to benefit from the rise in European pet 
ownership and spend. The Group still generates strong sales 
from the Production Animal sector in niche, profitable  
product areas. 
The Group comprises direct sales and marketing operations in 
7 European territories (see graphic on page 4). Distribution to 
European and Rest of World geographic territories is managed 
by our export team. The pharmaceutical licensing is managed 
through our in-house regulatory team or local consultants where 
necessary. Our revenue from export sales has increased steadily 
in recent years and offers great potential for future growth.
The Group will continue to serve the Small and Large Animal 
markets and bring new products to each segment where there 
is a commercial and strategic fit.
Over the last five years sales 
of medicines for companion 
animals have overtaken sales 
of farm animal products, 
rising from 47% to 53% of the 
European market, with sales in 
2017 of approximately €3.17bn 
(www.animalhealtheurope.eu).
OUR MARKETS BY GEOGRAPHY
The export business continued its strong growth in 2017 with 
sales improving 24% versus prior year. Animalcare Group now 
exports to 38 countries in Europe, Asia, Australasia, Africa and 
South America through 86 different distribution partners. The 
addition of the Animalcare Ltd small animal products has created 
a well-balanced export portfolio of Farm Animal, Equine, Small 
Animal and OTC brands. To facilitate the increased complexity of 
the export business and to help drive further growth, a dedicated 
export division has been formed with Martin Gore, Group Head of 
Export. The export division has associates from all three exporting 
centres in the business (Animalcare Ltd (UK), Ecuphar Veterinaria 
(ES) and Ecuphar NV (BE)) with over 40 years’ combined 
experience in the Animal Health market between them. We 
believe with the formation of this team and the increased focus 
and resources on exports, the export business will continue to 
contribute strongly to the Group’s sales and profits.
During the year there was significant growth in the key 
core export markets of the UK, France, the Nordics and 
Ireland supported by growth in newer markets including 
New Zealand and Taiwan. The growth of recently launched 
products (Aqupharm and Isocare) were ahead of management 
expectations, while sales of core established brands Danilon, 
Otoclean and Caniquantel all showed double digit growth. 
Dinalgen sales were behind prior year but this was largely down 
to phasing of purchasing patterns in major markets.
Looking forward, there will be some natural slippage in the 
short term for the export business as sales through distribution 
partners in countries where we have a direct sales force are 
moved in-house. While this decreases export sales it will be 
profit enhancing for the Group. This has not affected the export 
division in 2017 and will have minimal effect in 2018, but notice 
has now been served on distribution partners in Germany, Spain, 
Portugal, Italy and Belgium with the full benefits being gained 
from 2019 onwards.
The focus for 2018 is on ‘quick wins’, especially expanding the 
OTC business and rationalising distributors. Contracts have been 
signed for OTC products in new markets in the Middle East and 
China with sales expected to come on line mid 2018 (assuming 
no regulatory issues). Longer term we see good opportunities 
for growth in our pharmaceutical exports, especially in the fast 
growing Asian market.
There are continued concerns surrounding the use of antibiotics 
in Western and Northern Europe countries that may affect future 
sales of our antibiotics range. 
In summary, the export business is now a significant contributor 
to the Group and by creating a dedicated export division we see 
potential for long-term growth.

extension of current vaccine development programme
 { Decrease in use of anti-infectives across Western Europe – is 
both a risk in some areas but an opportunity in others, such as 
increased use of vaccines

via our network of partnerships, 
we aim to achieve organic growth 
in excess of our blended market 
growth rate, broadly matching 
revenue and profit growth in the 
medium term.
Acquired businesses have to be a 
good fit with our operating culture 
and strategy in addition to being 
value-enhancing financially.
Basic Underlying 
Earnings per 
share (“EPS”)
The measure of how successful 
we are in growing our business 
organically and by acquisition 
coupled with strong financial 
disciplines, including those related 
to tax and capital allocation, is 
captured in the Group’s underlying 
earnings per share.

The decrease reflects the significant 
increase in the adjusted weighted 
average number of shares following 
the reverse acquisition.
Underlying EPS is a key measure of 
our overall performance and the 
return we generate for shareholders 
before exceptional items. 
We aim to grow the business 
from 2018 to deliver year-on-year 
earnings enhancement.
Cash generated 
from operations
Cash generation is a measure of 
the quality of earnings and having 
strong operating cash flow enables 
the business to generate the funds 
we need to invest in our business 
to enhance future growth, maintain 
its strong balance sheet and deliver 
dividend flow.

Group with freedom to pursue its 
strategic goals of organic growth, 
acquisitions and continue dividends 
without becoming highly leveraged.

Introduction and Summary  
of the Group
The key aim for our business is to create a 
cash-generative, growing pan-European animal 
health company and in July 2017 Animalcare 
Group plc completed the acquisition of Ecuphar 
NV (“Ecuphar”), an acquisition that constituted 
a reverse takeover. This brought together two 
businesses to create an enlarged group focused 
on the development and marketing of innovative 
products providing significant benefits to  
animal health. 
The business now has a considerably enlarged 
footprint and sales network with direct sales 
teams in 7 European countries and an export 
network that covers over 38 countries across 
Europe, Asia, Australasia, Africa and South 
America through 86 different distribution 
partners. Within our product portfolio we have 50 
licensed drugs, eight vaccines and over 100 care 
and nutraceutical products employing around 100 
sales representatives and 28 agents marketing 
these products to our global customer base.
Shareholders in Animalcare are now invested in 
a substantially increased pan-European animal 
health platform with the following characteristics 
and strategic objectives:
 { Delivering double digit profit growth: 
We expect to deliver further incremental 
organic growth across revenues, EBITDA and 
underlying net earnings with the potential to 
achieve double-digit profit growth.
 { Cash generative: Continuing focus on cash 
generation allows us to maintain dividend 
payments as well as invest in our business to 
drive future growth.
 { Strong organic growth potential: We now 
have an increased geographic footprint for 
cross-selling; we expect to extract further 
synergies taking effect in 2018 but with a 
more meaningful impact in 2019, and we 
expect to deliver further growth through our 
new product development pipeline. 
 { Acquisitive growth potential: Our strong 
balance sheet and scale also opens 
opportunities for value-accretive acquisitions 
which would allow us to target direct sales in 
other geographical territories.
Business Review
The Group is focused on the development and 
sale of veterinary products in the companion 
animal, production animal and equine 
markets and is divided into two segments: 
Pharmaceuticals and Wholesale.
Pharmaceuticals
The Pharmaceuticals segment develops and 
markets veterinary pharmaceutical products 
which are supplied to animal health professionals 
both directly and through our international 
distribution network. Our products fall into 
two categories: regulated pharmaceuticals and 
over the counter products. Products are either 
owned by the Group or licensed on long-term 
distribution agreements with third parties. We 
have a very broad portfolio of over 300 products 
including pharmaceuticals, vaccines, biocides 
and nutraceuticals and the Group focuses on 
certain niche therapy areas including odontology, 
dermatology, otology and surgery/anaesthesia. 
As a Group we invest significantly in our in-house 
development pipeline which I discuss later on in 
my report.
“ T h e key 
aim for our 
business is to 
create a cash- 
generative, 
growing pan-
European 
animal health 
company”

STRATEGIC REPORT 
OUR PERFORMANCE 26011   18/05/2018   Proof 4
CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S REVIEW
Following the acquisition this segment now includes the products 
that were previously categorised as Licensed Veterinary Medicines, 
Animal Welfare and Companion Animal Identification.
Based on the statutory results for the year ended 31
st
 December 
2017, sales in this division (net of intercompany sales) increased by 
28.4% to £59.7m (2016: £46.5m), which now accounts for 71.4% 
of total revenues. The £13.2m year-on-year increase is attributable 
to an additional £7.6m of sales derived from acquisition growth, 
with the balance generated through organic growth within the 
Ecuphar business.
Organic growth was driven by a number of factors including a 
very strong performance from sales into the Production Animals 
market, as well as strong growth from Companion Animals. 
In the division our top 20 pharmaceutical products, which account 
for 51% of this division’s total sales, grew by 15.1% in 2017. 
Looking at our direct sales markets, Orozyme, the first product 
of the Company that was developed, continues to hold a strong 
position in the Oro-dental area. Direct sales for this product grew 
by 11% and we expect to see further growth in this area through 
the launch of new innovative products in 2018. 
Leisguard, our treatment against leishmaniosis in dogs, showed 
strong sales across our Mediterranean footprint and we expect to 
see future growth for this product in 2018 in Scandinavia. Prazitel 
and Caniquantel, which both play an important role in the area of 
anti-parasitic treatment, also grew well in 2017.
We were pleased with the performance across our export 
network. Our key core export markets of France, the Nordics and 
UK and Ireland showed significant growth and we expect to benefit 
from ongoing direct sales in the UK now following the acquisition. 
During the period we signed new distribution agreements to cover 
New Zealand and Taiwan and both regions granted regulatory 
approval to sell Aqupharm (intravenous fluid range) and Isocare 
(anaesthesia), our recently launched products for use in surgery. 
This contributed to the growth of Aqupharm and Isocare sales, 
which were ahead of management expectations, and sales of core 
established brands such as Danilon (anti-inflammatory), Otoclean 
(dermatology) and Caniquantel (anti-parasitics) all showed double 
digit growth. Dinalgen (anti-inflammatory) sales were behind prior 
year but this was largely down to phasing of purchasing patterns in 
major markets. 
The positive impact of the cross-selling opportunity was minimal 
during the year. We expect to see this contribute to our organic 
growth during Q4 2018, later than originally anticipated, with a 
more meaningful contribution in 2019.
The underlying EBITDA performance of our Pharmaceuticals division 
increased by 15.1% to £9.7m (97.1% of the Group’s underlying 
EBITDA) with reported EBITDA reducing to £7.5m (2016: £10.2m). 
Whilst this underlying growth was driven by the contribution of the 
acquisition, the organic performance in this division was impacted 
by lower gross margins, mainly due to a changing sales mix following 
higher growth from lower margin Production Animal products and 
export sales, as well as pricing pressures in a competitive market 
and the disposal of Nutriscience in 2016 which generated £1.3m of 
sales at margins in excess of 50%.
Whilst the impact of a changing sales mix and competitive pricing 
pressures are likely to persist over the rest of 2018 we expect to 
deliver at least double digit growth in underlying EBITDA in this 
division and to see further strong sales growth driven by a growing 
portfolio of products and a wider geographical sales reach for 
these products.
Wholesale
Our Wholesale division focuses on the sale of third-party 
veterinary pharmaceuticals, supplies and instruments in Belgium. 
Based close to Bruges, in the North West of Belgium, this business 
supplies veterinary professionals across the country and has been 
trading for 25 years and is well established in a stable market.
The extensive range of over 5,000 products includes own label 
and branded items ranging from small disposable items to larger 
capital equipment and diagnostic instruments. The division also 
specialises in the supply of surgical instruments.
Revenues increased by 9.7%, entirely through organic growth, to 
£23.9m (2016: £21.8m) with this division representing 28.6% of 
total Group sales. This division delivered underlying and reported 
EBITDA of £0.3m (2016: £0.5m) reflecting the investment made 
in sales staff to drive future growth. Growth was driven by the 
addition of new customers, as well as expanding the range of 
products sold to existing customers.
Product Development Pipeline
The focus on building value within our product development 
pipeline continues. As an enlarged business our development 
team is located across a number of sites providing extensive 
skills and capabilities across Belgium, Germany, Spain and UK. 
Karolyn Tapper, previously Director of Business Development for 
Animalcare Ltd, has been appointed to the new role of Group 
Head of Technical and Commercial Development to structure and 
integrate the teams to ensure that we continue to grow through 
investing in and attracting new product opportunities.
14 26011   18/05/2018   Proof 4
A project rationalisation and prioritisation process for all projects 
across the Group has been undertaken. Within the context of 
the enlarged Group, technical feasibility, development costs 
and commercial forecasts have been reviewed thoroughly to 
determine which projects would be continued. The Company is 
currently focused on 17 active new product development pipeline 
projects within Spain and UK.
In 2017 we launched Acecare, a sedative, from the original UK 
pipeline. Sales have been in line with the original project forecast. 
One centralised registration was submitted in 2017 and launch 
of this product is planned in late 2018. Progress of the pipeline 
continues and in 2018 three new products have already been 
registered across Europe with additional submissions planned 
throughout the year.
Alongside the new product development pipeline, a number of 
product improvement and product maintenance projects are 
ongoing. Several registrations to expand the global presence of our 
products were made in 2017 and launch within new territories is 
planned at the end of 2018 and during 2019.
New Products through Strategic Alliances  
and Partnerships
In addition to broadening our product portfolio through our own 
development pipeline, we are aware that our wide geographical 
footprint is attractive to similar companies in the US and Asia who 
are seeking routes to market for their products across Europe. 
During the period we have seen the first result of this strategy 
with an agreement with US-based Nutramax, to provide Europe-
wide distribution of their nutritional supplement Cosequin, which 
promotes canine joint health.
People
We currently have 100 sales representatives and 28 agents across 
Europe, having invested in an additional 6 sales representatives 
and support roles during the year. 
As a result of changes in senior and executive management in 
the Company it was necessary to find and appoint new Country 
Managers in Spain and the UK, the two key territories in the 
Group. This has been completed with the new recruits now in post 
in the weeks following the year end.
Internal appointments have also been made in the important 
areas of Technical and Product Development and Export. These 
new roles will progress the integration of the Group and help us to 
realise commercial opportunities more quickly.
It is clear that an appointment in supply chain management will be 
required in the near future to ensure the operational efficiencies 
of the Group within this area are achieved.
In addition, we announced at the end of April that Iain Menneer 
has stood down from his role as Chief Operating Officer. We are 
very grateful for all of Iain’s work on the integration of Animalcare 
and Ecuphar and we wish him well for the future. Iain’s role as 
COO will not be replaced and has been redistributed within the 
senior management team that he was accountable for, who will 
take on further responsibilities and report directly to myself.
The key component to ensuring we continue to deliver on our 
long-term growth strategy is to continue to attract and retain the 
highest calibre people to drive forward our development. I would 
like to extend my thanks to all of our staff for their hard work.
Brexit
The details of how the UK pharmaceutical regulations will be 
extracted from the current harmonised European structure are not 
yet clear. The Veterinary Medicines Directorate (UK Government 
agency) is looking for close cooperation to enable a smooth 
transition to ensure animal welfare and food safety. The recent 
acquisition has enabled the new Group to start restructuring its 
pharmaceutical licence ownership with legal entities in the UK and 
Europe post-Brexit to allow uninterrupted commercial supply of 
product. We will continue to monitor the situation and take the 
necessary action to ensure business continuity.

STRATEGIC REPORT 
OUR PERFORMANCE 26011   18/05/2018   Proof 4
Post-period end – Le Vet purchase by Dechra 
On 13
th
 February, Dechra plc acquired Le Vet Beheer B.V.  
(“Le Vet”), a business which has developed a portfolio of products, 
and established a network of marketing partners across Europe. 
Le Vet has been a long-term partner of Animalcare and Ecuphar 
with distribution agreements in four territories. Whilst certain 
distribution arrangements will not change, it is clear that this will 
not be the case across all of them. We are taking action now to 
mitigate against any material change which could adversely impact 
trading part way through 2019. 
Strategy and Outlook
The strategy of the business remains focused on building long-
term shareholder value by creating a growing, profitable and 
highly cash generative pan-European animal health platform, 
capable of investing in a steady flow of new products and 
rewarding shareholders with dividend payments. 
Further growth is expected through the execution of a clear 
strategy for growth via both organic sales growth and through 
targeted acquisitions. Our strategy for growth includes:
 { Cross-selling opportunities across customers and 
distribution channels
 { More synergies delivered through further integration of the 
businesses
 { Enhancing geographic footprint and sales, marketing and 
distribution network
 { Developing network of partnerships / strategic alliances to 
increase exposure to new opportunities
 { Identifying selective value-accretive acquisitions
 { Diversifying the portfolio of products into additional 
therapeutic areas within companion animal as well as 
production animal and equine markets
 { Broadening the product development pipeline to 
include novel therapies
We expect growth in revenues to be driven by the launch 
of new products from our development pipeline, additional 
regulatory approvals for our existing products in new territories 
and the distribution of new products for US or Asia based third 
parties across our European footprint. We also expect margin 
improvement to be seen as the opportunity to cross-sell products 
fully impacts as existing distribution agreements held by our UK 
business for Germany, Spain, Portugal, Italy and Belgium are exited 
and replaced by our own direct sales network.
We believe we are on track to deliver double digit profit growth 
during 2018 and enhancement to profit margins will be driven 
by further synergies and cross-selling opportunities, which will 
start to take effect late in 2018 as integration progresses, but will 
deliver a more meaningful impact on profit margins during 2019 
as the full effect of these changes are felt.
We believe the business is well positioned for future growth  
and the Directors remain confident of delivering long-term 
shareholder value.

CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER’S REVIEW
Presentation of Results
On 13
th 
July 2017, Animalcare Group plc 
completed the acquisition of Ecuphar 
NV, a European Animal Health Company 
headquartered in Belgium. The acquisition 
constituted a reverse takeover for the purposes 
of Rule 14 of the AIM Rules for Companies.
This business combination has been treated as 
a reverse acquisition in accordance with IFRS 3. 
Under the provisions of IFRS 3 the results for the 
year ended 31
st
 December 2017 are reported as 
a continuation of Ecuphar NV with the results of 
Animalcare Group plc consolidated from the date 
of acquisition.
Accordingly, the statutory results for the year  
end 31
st
 December 2017 reflect 12 months of 
Ecuphar NV and approximately five and  
a half months of Animalcare Group plc as 
previously constituted.
To help shareholders to assess the Group, an 
unaudited Pro forma Consolidated Income 
Statement has been provided, which reflects 
12 months of trading from both entities. The 
Board believes that these statements provide the 
most appropriate basis for future comparison of 
operating performance.
Underlying and Statutory Results
To provide comparability across reporting 
periods, the Group presents its results on both 
an underlying and statutory (IFRS) basis.
The Directors believe that presenting our 
financial results on an underlying basis, which 
exclude non – underlying items, provides a 
clearer understanding of business performance. 
IFRS results include these items to provide the 
statutory results.
All figures are reported at actual exchange  
rates (AER) unless otherwise stated. Commentary 
will include references to constant exchange 
rates (CER) to identify the impact of foreign 
exchange movements
A reconciliation between underlying and 
statutory results is provided at the end of 
this financial review prior to the pro- forma 
information as described above.

The Group delivered total revenue of £83.7m, an increase of 22.4% versus the prior year. This included £76.1m from the continuing 
Ecuphar business, an increase of 11.3% (3.8% at CER) and £7.6m contribution from the acquired Animalcare operations.
Underlying EBITDA increased by 11.9% to £10.0m (2016: £8.9m) including a £1.6m contribution from acquisition business. Ecuphar’s 
continuing business underlying EBITDA decreased by 5.6% to £8.4m primarily reflecting the lower gross margins, investments 
in our infrastructure and people to support future growth and the disposal of NutriScience which Ecuphar sold in October 2016 
which contributed profits of approximately £0.2m. More details regarding operational performance are provided within the Trading 
Performance section. 
Basic underlying EPS decreased by 24.6% to 12.6 pence (2016: 16.7 pence). The 33.3% increase in profit after tax was offset by the 
significant increase in the weighted average number of shares from 23.8 million (which has been adjusted for the merger ratio of 63:37 
as described in note 9) to 42.0 million.

Pharma segment
Revenue in our pharma segment grew by 28.4%, 12.1% of which 
was delivered by the continuing Ecuphar business. This growth 
was primarily driven by very strong growth in Production Animals 
revenue which as an overall category increased by 25.2% versus 
prior year to £28.4m together with a strong contribution from 
the Companion Animals category. Further detail on revenue by 
product category is given below.
Underlying EBITDA improved by 15.1% to £9.7m however declined 
by 3.6% from continuing business to £8.1m (2016: £8.4m), 
representing an EBITDA margin of 15.6% (2016: 18.1%). This 
decline was driven by a combination of lower gross margins which 
fell by 2.3% to 53.6% and a £2.3m increase in operating costs.
Gross margins in our continuing business have fallen for three 
main reasons:
 { Lower margin sales mix primarily reflecting higher growth in 
our Production Animal product category and export markets.
 { Maintaining market share in a competitive environment, at 
some expense to margins.
 { Disposal of NutriScience in October 2016 which generated 
£1.3m sales at margins in excess of 50%.
Operating costs have increased by £2.3m to £19.9m (2016: 
£17.6m) representing 38.2% (2016: 37.8%) of sales. Approximately 
£1.5m of this increase relates to investment in our infrastructure 
(in particular IT and R&D), people and marketing to position the 
business for future growth. The balance of £0.8m reflects higher 
distribution costs as a result of significantly increased vaccine sales 
together with higher inventory write offs.
Reported EBITDA, which includes £2.2m non-underlying items as 
analysed in note 5, reduced to £7.5m (2016: £10.2m).
Wholesale segment 
Our wholesale segment, which comprises the purchase and re-sale 
of veterinary pharmaceuticals, supplies and instruments in Belgium, 
delivered revenue of £23.9m, representing an increase of 9.7% 
on the prior year . Whilst gross margins at 10.1% remained broadly 
comparable with prior year (2016: 10.4%), underlying and reported 
EBITDA reduced from £0.5m to £0.3m mainly due to increased 
employee costs to drive product sales and services growth.

Other products and 
services 7,777 9,327 (16.6%)
Total 83,676 68,361 11.3%
Companion Animals revenue increased by 38.9% to £42.8m and, 
following the reverse acquisition of Animalcare Group plc, now 
represents 51.1% of total business, up from 45.1% in the prior 
year. Animalcare revenues generated 24.5% of the growth with the 
balance of 14.4% delivered by existing business, primarily driven 
by increased export sales, increased wholesale sales and market 
penetration of core pharmaceuticals.
Production Animals revenue grew by 25.2% on prior year despite 
ongoing pressure on antibiotic usage. This growth largely came 
from full year sales of new products launched in 2016, in particular 
rabbit vaccines, and continued growth of core products in both 
our established markets as well as newer geographies such as Italy. 
Equine revenues reduced to £4.7m due to the prior year one-off 
benefit of horse vaccine sales in Germany as a result of competitor 
supply issues. 
Reported Financial Results
Given the significant changes to the Group following the reverse 
acquisition, the financial results contain a number of non-
underlying items comprising the fair value uplift of inventory 
acquired, amortisation and impairment of acquired intangibles 
and acquisition and integration costs.

Including non-underlying items, the Group’s profit after tax fell to 
£0.2m (2016: £3.5m). Non-underlying items incurred in the year 
are summarised below (all figures are pre-tax):
 { Fair value adjustment of acquired inventory of £0.4m – this is a 
non-cash uplift to the value of acquisition inventory as a result 
of the fair value exercise carried out in accordance with IFRS 3 
‘Business Combinations’. 
 { Amortisation and impairment of acquired intangibles totalling 
£4.3m – this comprises £1.7m charge arising on the acquired 
intangibles relating to the Animalcare reverse acquisition and 
£2.6m in relation to previous acquisitions made by Ecuphar NV, 
principally Esteve SA which was acquired on 30
th 
April 2015.
 { Acquisition and integration costs of £1.8m – this principally 
includes the transaction costs borne by Ecuphar NV in 
relation to the reverse acquisition of Animalcare Group plc 
and post-acquisition integration costs including the internal 
transfer of Animalcare Ltd to Ecuphar NV and the set-up of a 
new long-term incentive plan which the Board is seeking to 
implement during 2018.
Earnings per Share and Dividend
Basic underlying EPS decreased by 24.6% to 12.6pence (2016: 
16.7 pence). The 33.3% increase in profit after tax was offset by 
the significant increase in the weighted average number of shares 
from 23.8 million (which has been adjusted for the merger ratio of 
63:37 as described in note 8) to 42.0 million.
The reported basic EPS, which incorporates non-underlying items, 
decreased to 0.4 pence (2016: 14.8 pence)
The Board is proposing a final dividend of 2.0 pence per share, 
added to the second interim dividend of 4.7 pence per share 
paid in November 2017, giving a total dividend of 6.7 pence per 
share since the reverse acquisition. This final dividend is subject to 
shareholder approval at the Annual General Meeting on 27th June 
2017. The Board will continue to maintain the current dividend 
policy and timing of payments whilst continuing to invest for 
future growth.

The Group generated £2.4m net cash from operations (2016: 
£9.3m) which includes a cash outflow from non-underlying items 
totalling £3.8m. Working capital increased by £5.6m principally 
reflecting the payment of £2.5m non-underlying items which  
were recognised (accrued) at the time of the reverse acquisition,  
£2.0m increase in trade receivables due to strong growth in the 
final quarter and £1.4m investment in stock. This stock increase 
was mainly within our wholesale operation due to anticipated 
further antibiotic restrictions with the balance largely in our  
high-growth territories. 
Net capital expenditure of £2.5m largely comprises investment 
in our product development pipeline from which a significant 
number of new products launches are expected in 2019 and 2020. 
The £33.1m cash consideration for the acquisition of Ecuphar NV 
was funded using £4.0m of cash held by Animalcare Group plc and 
£29.1m of equity raised through a placing net of £0.9m expenses. 
As part of the reverse acquisition, the Group agreed to maintain 
the existing Ecuphar NV borrowing facilities (the Facilities) through 
four banks which comprised (i) €41.5m revolving credit facility 
(RCF), (ii) €10m term facility to finance permitted acquisitions 
(Term Loan A) and (iii) €4.08m quarterly amortising term facility 
(Term Loan B). 
There are three covenants governing the facilities:
(i)  a minimum adjusted solvency ratio of 30% measured as 
consolidated adjusted equity to consolidated adjusted 
total assets;
(ii)  a maximum leverage ratio of 3.5 times measured as 
consolidated net debt to consolidated EBITDA;
(iii)  a minimum interest coverage ratio of 4 times measured as 
consolidated EBITDA to consolidated interest expenses.
Based on the 12 months unaudited pro-forma underlying EBITDA 
of £11.8m (see below), the Group’s net debt: underlying EBITDA 
leverage ratio was 2.2 times. At 31
st
 December 2017, total facilities 
were £48.4m, of which £33.5m, net of cash balances, was being 
utilised leaving headroom of £14.9m. These bank facilities, 
together with the Group’s operational cash flow, indicate that the 
Group has sufficient facilities available to fund its operations and 
allow for future expansion. 
Summary
The transformational reverse acquisition of Ecuphar has created 
critical scale for the Group within the European animal health 
market, providing a strengthened position to capitalise on growth 
in the market to deliver long-term shareholder value.
To support this value creation, and to maximise the commercial, 
operational and financial synergies, the Group must deliver a wide-
ranging and comprehensive integration. The historical growth of 
Ecuphar was complemented by a series of acquisitions including the 
largest and most significant acquisition of Esteve in 2015. Prior to 
the reverse, limited integration of these operations was undertaken. 
This has presented additional challenges resulting in the current 
process to integrate the businesses taking longer than expected. 
From a financial performance perspective, we have delivered 
strong revenue growth; however, this has not translated through 
to our operating profit as we have experienced competitive market 
pressures and changing sales mix, leading to margin decline in the 
second half of 2017.
Against this backdrop, our priorities for the current year are: 
 { Increasing sales of new products from our distribution network 
and expanding our geographic footprint
 { Focusing on gross margin and EBITDA development in order to 
deliver anticipated profit growth
 { Improving operating cash generation, important in providing 
the business with the funds to continue the momentum in our 
product development pipeline together with dividend flow
 { Delivering integration to unlock scale benefits and  
support EBITDA 
We remain firm in our belief that the reverse acquisition will 
provide a number of opportunities for growth. Delivering the 
comprehensive integration to realise the synergies and benefits 
available is key. Ultimately, to create value the combination of our 
businesses must become more than the sum of the parts. 
We expect to see some benefits of the integration in the current 
year but a more meaningful impact on profit in 2019. 
Once fully integrated, we believe this will provide a strong platform 
for long-term value creation for our shareholders.

Compared to the statutory results, the unaudited proforma 
consolidated income statement includes an additional 28 weeks 
of Animalcare Group plc’s results prior to the reverse acquisition 
which has the impact of increasing revenue and underlying EBITDA 
by £8.3m and £1.8m respectively. This is shown in further detail in 
the reconciliation section below. 
On the proforma basis, revenue increased by 9.6% (3.4% at CER) 
to £91.9m however underlying EBITDA decreased by 8.5% (12.9% 
decrease at CER) to £11.8m. 
The principal drivers for the financial performance of the existing 
Ecuphar business are described earlier in the Trading  
Performance section. 
For the acquired Animalcare business, revenues increased 1.7% 
to £15.8m, driven by £0.6m growth within export offset by a 
£0.4m reduction in sales from our microchipping business, the 
latter primarily as a result of the £0.3m incremental sales benefit 
observed in 2016 following the introduction of compulsory 
microchipping in the UK. Gross profit was flat at £8.7m largely 
reflecting the changing sales mix towards lower margin export 
business. Operating expenses excluding non-underlying items 
increased by £0.4m of which approximately half relates to higher 
central costs, including the enlarged Board. The balance primarily 
relates to investment in our UK trading business staff base. As a 
result, underlying EBITDA fell by £0.6m to £3.3m. 
The proforma results are yet to reflect the benefits from leveraging 
the Group’s enlarged platform which include commercial 
synergies, operating efficiencies and optimisation of the R&D 
function. We will continue to deliver the integration throughout 
2018 to deliver more significant value creation  
from 2019.

OUR PRINCIPAL RISKS
Risk Management Framework
The Board is responsible for maintaining and reviewing the effectiveness of our risk management activities, intended to monitor and 
mitigate, rather than eliminate, the significant risks that the Group is exposed to. 
In accordance with our governance practices, the Audit Committee supports the Board of Directors in monitoring the Group’s risks and is 
responsible for reviewing the effectiveness of the risk management and internal control systems.
Our Risks
A summary of the principal risks together with an explanation of how the Group mitigates each risk their trend and linkage to our 
strategy are set out in the table below.
RISK
ALIGNMENT 
TO STRATEGY
POTENTIAL IMPACT MITIGATION TREND
Competitor risk
Launch of competitor products, 
for example other generic or 
more superior product profile. 
Our product portfolio is broad 
however contains products with 
strong market share which is 
attractive to competitors.

Revenues and gross margins 
may be adversely affected 
should competitors launch 
competing generic or 
superior (novel) products. 
Operating costs may 
increase to protect 
market share.
We monitor new product registrations 
and competitor launches and  
develop commercial and marketing 
responses accordingly. 
Diversification of our product portfolio 
and geographies will lessen the impact 
on our business.
Market risk
In certain geographies the 
veterinary market continues to 
see the emergence and growth 
of buying groups and corporate 
customers who are looking for 
value from the products and 
services we provide.

3
 
4
 
5
 
6
The emergence and growth 
of corporate customers and 
buying groups represents an 
opportunity for sales volume 
growth but may result in 
lower margins.
We continue to develop and  
strengthen our sales and marketing 
teams in respect of key account  
support and achieve our goal to better 
serve our changing customer base,  
both on a national and in future a 
European basis.
Integration risk
The integration of Ecuphar  
and Animalcare is wide-
ranging and may fail to deliver 
expected returns due to 
integration challenges.
1
 
2
 
Failure to deliver the 
integration to the expected 
timetable together with 
anticipated commercial and 
operational synergies will 
inhibit growth and lead to 
higher costs and lower than 
expected profits.
An integration plan has been prepared 
and is being implemented across key 
work streams including supply chain, 
technical & product development, 
finance, HR, export and IT.
Product development risk
Pharmaceutical development 
is complex, involving technical, 
regulatory and financial risk. 
Failure to successfully deliver 
new product development 
projects could have a material 
impact on the Group’s results and 
damage our market position and 
relationship with our customers.
5
 
6
Complete failure of 
a project or failure 
to meet commercial 
expectations due to for 
example competitor 
launches (generic or 
novel) would result in 
impairment of capitalised 
development costs.
Following careful selection of 
development strategy, each new 
product development project 
undergoes rigorous review by the 
cross-discipline senior management 
team with final sign-off by the Board. 
The pipeline is reviewed regularly, with 
corresponding updates provided to 
the Board, to ensure each project is 
progressing according to plan.

ALIGNMENT 
TO STRATEGY

Reliance on  
third parties risk
The supply of products to our 
customers in a timely manner is 
vital to the success of the Group.
The Group does not manufacture 
any of its own products and is 
solely reliant on an increasing 
third party supplier and contract 
manufacturer base across the UK 
and Europe.

Any disruption to the 
relationship with our key 
supply partners, whether 
commercial or via change 
of control, or interruption 
to the supply chain could 
result in significant loss 
of revenue and damage 
the Group’s reputation 
with its customers.
Given the increasing complexity and 
diversity in our supply chain, we have 
identified the need for increased 
specialist resource in this area which 
will form part of the integration. 
We monitor supplier performance 
and maintain adequate inventories, 
including safety stock held by our 
suppliers, based on risk assessments. 
Regulatory risk
Continuing pressure to reduce 
antibiotic usage and resistance. 
In certain countries this has 
led to increasing government 
intervention to limit the 
use of antibiotics in food 
producing animals. 
3

6
Decline in sales of our 
antibiotic product range.
Regular dialogue is maintained with 
relevant authorities in each country 
to ensure we maintain a thorough 
understanding of regulatory changes.
We aim to sell products that minimise 
antimicrobial resistance concerns. 
People risk
The Group has a small Executive 
and senior management team 
whose skills, knowledge, 
experience and performance 
make a large contribution to the 
success of the Group.

Failure to retain and  
attract high calibre 
individuals in key roles 
could impact the successful 
implementation of our 
strategy and adversely

The Nomination Committee leads the 
process for all potential appointments 
to the Board. 
Remuneration packages are reviewed 
annually to help ensure that the Group 
has the right mix of base salary, and 
short-term and long-term incentives to 
attract, retain and reward key employees 
to execute our growth strategy.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT
An Introduction from our Chairman
I have pleasure in introducing the Corporate Governance Statement. This report 
summarises our approach to governance and provides information about how the 
Board and its committees operate. 
As a Board, we recognise that applying sound governance principles is essential to the 
successful running of the Group, and supports its long-term success and strategy for 
growth. It is our goal therefore to continue to improve and develop our governance 
structures. As a company listed on AIM, we are not required to comply with the UK 
Corporate Governance Code 2016 (“the UK Code”). We consider that the Quoted 
Companies Alliance’s Corporate Governance Code for small and mid-size quoted 
companies (“the QCA Code”) is more relevant for AIM companies such as Animalcare 
and we apply wherever possible, and as appropriate to the size, nature and resources of 
the Group, the QCA code. 
The policies and procedures we have put in place following the acquisition of Ecuphar 
NV in July 2017 give us a firm foundation for our governance structures and we will 
continue to build on these.

The Role of the Board
The Board is responsible to the shareholders and sets the Group’s 
strategy for achieving long-term success. It is also ultimately 
responsible for the management, governance, controls, risk 
management, direction and performance of the Group.
The Composition of the Board
The composition of the Board has been structured to ensure that 
no one individual can dominate its decision-making processes. 
Following completion of the acquisition of Ecuphar NV on 
13
th
 July 2017, the Board was restructured to take account of 
the activities of the enlarged Group. Before that date, the Board 
comprised the Non-Executive Chairman, James Lambert, two Non-
Executive Directors, Nick Downshire and Ray Harding, and two 
Executive Directors, the Chief Executive Officer Iain Menneer and 
the Chief Financial Officer Chris Brewster. On 13
th
 July 2017, the 
Board was restructured as follows:
 { James Lambert stepped down from his role as Non- 
Executive Chairman but remained on the Board as Non-
Executive Director.
 { Jan Boone was appointed as Non-Executive Chairman.
 { Iain Menneer stepped down from his role as Chief Executive 
Officer but remained on the Board as Chief Operation Officer.
 { Chris Cardon was appointed as Chief Executive Officer. 
 { Chris Brewster stepped down as Chief Financial Officer.
 { Walter Beyers was appointed as Chief Financial Officer.
 { Ray Harding resigned as a Non-Executive Director.
 { Marc Coucke and Edwin Torr were appointed as Non- 
Executive Directors.
On 25
th
 September 2017, Walter Beyers resigned as Chief  
Financial Officer and Chris Brewster was reappointed as Chief 
Financial Officer. 
On 26
th
 April 2017, Iain Menneer resigned as Chief 
Operating Officer. 
The Board currently comprises two Executive Directors and five 
Non-Executive Directors.
The Non-Executive Chairman Jan Boone and Senior Independent 
Director Edwin Torr are considered to be independent and 
therefore the Board is compliant with the QCA Code, having at 
least two independent Non-Executive Directors. Nick Downshire 
and James Lambert have been directors of the Company for more 
than ten years and were significant shareholders of the Group, 
holding over 3% of issued share capital, prior to the acquisition of 
Ecuphar NV in July 2017. Following the increase in issued share 
capital following the Placing in July 2017, their shareholdings 
have been diluted and they are no longer classed as significant 
shareholders. Notwithstanding their length of tenure and their 
interests in the share capital of the Company, the Board also 
considers Nick Downshire and James Lambert to be independent 
in character and judgement. 
On completion of the acquisition of Ecuphar NV, 23.1% of the 
issued share capital of the Company is held by Ecuphar Invest NV, 
an entity controlled by Chris Cardon, and a further 23.1% of the 
issued share capital is held by Alychlo NV, an entity wholly owned 
by Marc Coucke. The Board is aware of its duty to hear the voices 
of, and protect the interests of, minority shareholders and has put 
in place contractual arrangements with Ecuphar Invest NV and 
Alychlo NV, in the form of a relationship agreement in order to 
protect minority shareholder interests. A copy of the relationship 
agreement is available on the Company’s website  
(www.animalcaregroup.co.uk).
Appointments to the Board and re-election
The Board has delegated to the Nomination and Remuneration 
Committee the tasks of reviewing Board composition, searching 
for appropriate candidates and making recommendations to the 
Board on candidates to be appointed as Directors. Further details 
on the role of the Nomination and Remuneration Committee may 
be found in its report on page 34.
The Directors have the power to appoint Directors during the year 
but any person so appointed must stand for election at the next 
Annual General Meeting as required by the Company’s Articles of 
Association (“Articles”). Under the Articles, any Director who was 
not elected or re-elected at either of the two preceding Annual 
General Meetings must retire by rotation at the next Annual 
General Meeting, and at each Annual General Meeting, at least one 
third of the Directors must retire and be eligible for re-election. In 
accordance with the Articles, Jan Boone, Chris Cardon, Marc Coucke, 
Edwin Torr, Chris Brewster and Nick Downshire will retire and offer 
themselves for re-election at the next Annual General Meeting. The 
Board considers that each of these Directors offering themselves for 
re-election continues to make a valuable contribution to the Board 
and continues to demonstrate commitment.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT
Development, information and support
The Company Secretary ensures that all Directors are kept 
abreast of changes in relevant legislation and regulations, with 
the assistance of the Company’s advisers where appropriate. 
Executive Directors are subject to the Company’s performance 
development review process through which their performance 
against predetermined objectives is reviewed and their personal 
and professional development needs considered. Non-Executive 
Directors are encouraged to raise any personal development or 
training needs with the Chairman or Company Secretary.
Performance Evaluation
An informal Board evaluation process was conducted using a 
questionnaire and self-assessment in August 2016. Given the 
changes on the Board in 2017, it was not felt appropriate to 
conduct an evaluation. However, the Board intends to evaluate its 
performance and that of its committees on an annual basis.
Independent Professional Advice
Directors have access to independent professional advice at the 
Company’s expense. In addition, they have access to the advice 
and services of the Company Secretary who is responsible for 
advice on corporate governance matters to the Board.
Directors’ and Officers’ Liability Insurance
The Company has purchased Directors’ and officers’ liability 
insurance during the year as allowed by the Company’s articles.
How the Board operates
The Board is responsible for the Group’s strategy and for its overall 
management. The operation of the Board is documented in a 
formal schedule of matters reserved for its approval, which sets 
out the Board’s responsibilities. 
These include matters relating to:
 { the Group’s strategic aims and objectives
 { the structure and capital of the Group
 { financial reporting, financial controls and dividend policy
 { internal control, risk and the Group’s risk appetite
 { the approval of significant contracts and expenditure
 { effective communication with shareholders
 { any changes to Board membership or structure
The Board meets at regular intervals and Non-Executive Directors 
communicate directly with Executive Directors and senior 
management between formal Board meetings. The Board held 
a focused meeting on strategy in December 2017 and intends to 
continue to schedule similar meetings annually. 
An agenda and accompanying detailed papers, including reports 
from the Executive Directors and other members of senior 
management, are circulated to the Board in advance of each 
Board meeting.
Directors are expected to attend all meetings of the Board and the 
Committees on which they sit, and to devote sufficient time to the 
Group’s affairs to enable them to fulfil their duties as Directors. 
This requirement is also included in their letters of appointment. 
In the event that Directors are unable to attend a meeting, their 
comments on papers to be considered at the meeting will be 
discussed in advance with the Chairman so that their contribution 
can be included in the wider Board discussion.
Directors are encouraged to question and voice any concerns they 
may have on any topic put to the Board for debate. 
The Board is supported in its work by Board Committees, which 
are responsible for a variety of tasks delegated by the Board. There 
is also an Executive Committee composed of the Chief Financial 
Officer and representatives from senior management whose 
responsibilities are to implement the decisions of the Board and 
review the key business objectives and status of projects.
Board decisions and activity during the year
There are a number of standing and routine items included for 
review on each Board agenda. These include the CEO’s report and 
operations reports, financial reports, consideration of reports from 
the Board Committees and investor relations updates. In addition, 
key areas put to the Board for consideration and review included:
 { Strategy presentations
 { Presentations from various parts of the business
 { Consideration of financing structures
 { Approval of annual report and financial statements
 { Review of Budget
 { Going concern and cash flow
 { Briefing and review of conflicts of interest
 { Review of AGM business

The Board Committees
There are two Board Committees, the Audit Committee and the 
Nomination and Remuneration Committee, both consisting of at 
least two independent Non-Executive Directors. 
Each Board Committee has approved Terms of Reference setting 
out their responsibilities. The Terms of Reference were approved 
and reviewed by the Board during the year and are available on 
the Company’s website (www.animalcaregroup.co.uk).
Details of the operation of the Board Committees are set out in 
their respective reports below. All of the Board Committees are 
authorised to obtain, at the Company’s expense, professional 
advice on any matter within their Terms of Reference and to have 
access to sufficient resources in order to carry out their duties.
Accountability
The Company has in place a system of internal financial controls 
commensurate with its current size and activities, which is 
designed to ensure that the possibility of misstatement or loss is 
kept to a minimum. These procedures include the preparation of 
management accounts, forecast variance analysis and other  
ad hoc reports. There are clearly defined authority limits 
throughout the Group, including those matters that are reserved 
specifically for the Board.
Risks throughout the Group are considered and reviewed on a 
regular basis. Risks are identified and mitigating actions put into 
place as appropriate. Principal risks identified are set out in the 
Strategic report on pages 24 and 25. Internal control and risk 
management procedures can only provide reasonable and not 
absolute assurance against material misstatement. The internal 
control procedures were in place throughout the financial year 
and up to the date of approval of this report.
Relations with shareholders
The Group maintains communication with institutional 
shareholders through individual meetings with Executive Directors, 
particularly following publication of the Group’s interim and 
full year results. Private shareholders are encouraged to attend 
the Annual General Meeting at which the Group’s activities are 
considered and questions answered.
General information about the Group is also available on the 
Group’s website (www.animalcaregroup.co.uk). This includes 
an overview of activities of the Group and details of all recent 
Group announcements. The Non-Executive Directors are available 
to discuss any matter stakeholders might wish to raise, and the 
Chairman and independent Non-Executive Directors will attend 
meetings with investors and analysts as required. A review of the 
share register is a standing item on the Board’s agenda.
Annual General Meeting
The Company’s Annual General meeting will be held at  
11.30 a.m. on Wednesday 27
th
 June 2018 at the offices of Panmure 
Gordon & Co, 1 New Change, London, EC4M 9AF. The Notice of 
Annual General meeting including the resolutions to be proposed

AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT 
Members of the Committee
Prior to the acquisition of Ecuphar in July 2017, the Audit 
Committee comprised two Non-Executive Directors, Nick 
Downshire and James Lambert. Following the Board restructure in 
July 2017, the Audit Committee (‘the Committee’) now comprises 
three Non-Executive Directors:
Nick Downshire (Chairman)
Jan Boone
Edwin Torr
The Board is satisfied that Nick Downshire, as Chairman of the 
Committee, has recent and relevant financial experience, being 
a qualified chartered accountant who has worked in corporate 
finance and venture capital.
The Committee oversees the Group’s and its subsidiaries’ internal 
financial controls and risk management systems, recommends the 
half and full year financial results to the Board and monitors the 
integrity of all formal reports and announcements relating to the 
Group’s financial performance. 
The Committee challenges both the external auditors and 
the management of the Group and reports the findings and 
recommendations of the external auditors to the Board. The 
Committee will meet to review the proposed audit work, review 
the results of the audit work and consider any recommendations 
arising from the audit. 
The Committee will meet at least three times a year and at such 
other times during the year as is necessary to discharge its duties. 
Although only members of the Committee have the right to attend 
meetings, the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer  
and external advisers, may be invited to attend for all or a part of  
the meeting.
Duties
The main duties of the Committee are set out in its Terms of 
Reference which are available on the Company’s website (www.
animalcaregroup.co.uk) and include the following:
 { To monitor the integrity of the financial statements of the 
Company and any formal announcements relating to the 
Company’s financial performance, reviewing significant

the effectiveness of the Group’s internal audit function;

regulatory requirements;

32 26011   18/05/2018   Proof 4
Principal Activities during the Year
The main activities of the Committee during the year included:
 { review of the financial statements and Annual Report
 { consideration of the external audit report and management 
representation letter
 { going concern review
 { a retendering exercise for the appointment of the  
external auditors
 { review of the 2017 audit plan and audit engagement letter
 { review of the risk management and internal control systems
 { review and approval of the interim results
 { assessment of the need for an internal audit function; and 
 { meeting with the external auditors without  
management present
Tender Process for the Appointment of the  
external auditors
Following the acquisition of Ecuphar NV in July 2071, the 
Committee considered it appropriate to retender for the provision 
of external audit services to the enlarged Group. A competitive 
tender process was conducted in late 2017, resulting in the 
appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as the Company’s 
external auditor with effect from 15
th
 January 2018.
Role of the external auditors
The Committee monitors the relationship with the external auditors 
to ensure that auditor independence and objectivity are maintained. 
As part of its review the Committee monitors the provision of 
non-audit services by the external auditors. The breakdown of fees 
between audit and non-audit services is provided in note 22 to the 
Group’s Consolidated Financial Statements. 
The Committee also assesses the auditors’ independence and 
performance. Having reviewed the auditors’ independence 
and performance, the Committee recommends that 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP be reappointed as the Group’s 
auditors at the next Annual General Meeting.
Internal Audit
At present the Group does not have an internal audit function 
and the Committee believes that management is able to derive 
assurance as to the adequacy and effectiveness of internal controls 
and risk management procedures without one. 
Audit Process
The external auditors prepares an audit plan for its review of the 
full year financial statements. The audit plan sets out the scope 
of the audit, areas to be targeted and audit timetable. This plan 
is reviewed and agreed in advance by the Audit Committee. 
Following its review, the external auditors presented their 
findings to the Audit Committee for discussion. No major areas 
of concern were highlighted by the external auditors during the 
year; however, areas of significant risk and other matters of audit 
relevance are regularly communicated.
Risk Management and Internal Controls
The Group has established a framework of risk management 
and internal control systems, policies and procedures. The Audit 
Committee is responsible for reviewing the risk management 
and internal control framework and ensuring that it operates 
effectively. During the year, the Committee has reviewed the 
framework and the Committee is satisfied that the internal control 
systems in place are currently operating effectively.
Whistleblowing
The Company has a whistleblowing procedure under which staff 
may report any suspicion of fraud, financial irregularity or other 
malpractice to any Executive Director.

was introduced in June 2014 (“LTIP 2014”) and was implemented 
via a subscription for growth shares in the capital of Animalcare Ltd, 
a subsidiary of the Company. This is closed to new members and no 
further options will be granted under the LTIP 2014. In 2014, Iain 
Menneer and Chris Brewster were granted the following options 
 { Iain Menneer – 31,955 A Ordinary Shares of £1.00 each (“A 
Shares”) for a total cash subscription of £31,955, representing 
5.2% of Animalcare Ltd’s issued share capital; and
 { Chris Brewster – 19,173 A Shares, representing 3% of 
Animalcare Ltd’s issued share capital and 11,800 B Ordinary 
Shares of £1.00 each (“B Shares”), representing a further 
2% of Animalcare Ltd’s issued share capital, for a total cash 
subscription of £30,973.
The total cash subscriptions were, based on independent 
valuation, considered to be equal to fair value at the time of 
acquisition. Both Directors had the right to sell their A Shares to 
the Company at any time after 27
th
 June 2017 in exchange for 
Ordinary Shares of 20 pence each in the Company (“Ordinary 
Shares”). Their rights to sell the A Shares are subject to, amongst 
other provisions, the Company having a market capitalisation 
in excess of £39.0m (“the Hurdle”) at the time of sale. The 
Hurdle was determined by the Remuneration Committee and 
broadly represented a 20% premium to the Company’s market 
capitalisation on 27
th
 June 2014. Each holder of A Shares would, on 
a sale of his entire holding to the Company, be entitled to receive 
Ordinary Shares representing a percentage of the increase in the 
Company’s market capitalisation above the Hurdle; being 5% for 
Iain Menneer and 3% for Chris Brewster. Holders of the A Shares 
did not have a right to receive a dividend, except for any amounts 
distributed on the winding up of the Company or on an asset sale. 
Holders of the B Shares were not entitled to participate in any 
increase in the value of the Company above the Hurdle but can be 
exchanged for Ordinary Shares of an equal value at any time after 
27
th
 June 2017. Holders of the B Shares had a right to an annual 
dividend (on a non-fixed coupon basis), calculated by applying a 
rate of LIBOR + 2% to the nominal value of the B Shares.
In June 2017, it was agreed between the Company, Iain Menneer 
and Chris Brewster that the options under the LTIP 2014 did not 
become exercisable as a result of the acquisition of Ecuphar NV. 
The Company however determined that it was appropriate to 
offer the right to exchange their shares in Animalcare Limited for 
Ordinary Shares shortly before completion of the acquisition, and 
each took up that right. As a consequence, 918,896 new Ordinary 
Shares were issued to Iain Menneer and Chris Brewster on  
12
th
 July 2017. The number of new Ordinary Shares issued 
pursuant to the exercise of these rights was determined using the 
lower of the closing middle market price for an Ordinary Share on 
22
nd
 June 2017, being the dealing day before the date the offer to 
exchange was made and the average of the closing middle market 
prices for an Ordinary Share over the dealing days in the 30 day 
period before that date, being 392.5 pence. 
A new Long Term Incentive Plan, the Animalcare Group plc Long 
Term Incentive Plan 2017 (“the New LTIP”) was approved by the 
Board in June 2017. A summary of the New LTIP was set out in the 
circular sent to shareholders on 24
th
 June 2017 which is available 
on the Company’s website (www.animalcaregroup.co.uk). No 
options have been granted under the New LTIP as at the date of 
this report. The Nomination and Remuneration Committee will 
consider the grant of options to Executive Directors under the New 
LTIP during the current financial year.

Relationship Agreement
On 23
rd
 June 2017, the Company entered into the Relationship 
Agreement with Panmure Gordon,the Company’s nominated 
adviser and broker and Alychlo NV and Ecuphar Invest NV (“the 
Substantial Shareholders”). The Substantial Shareholders together 
own more than 40% of the Group’s total issued share capital. 
The Relationship Agreement is intended to ensure that the 
Company will at all times be capable of carrying on the business 
independently of each of the Substantial Shareholders and 
their respective Shareholder Groups (being the Associate of the 
Substantial Shareholders) and all transactions and arrangements 
between i) the Company and ii) each of the Substantial 
Shareholders and the members of their respective Shareholder 
Groups will be at arm’s length and on normal commercial terms. 
The Board confirms that, at all times since it was entered into:
 { the Company has complied with its obligations under the 
Relationship Agreement; and
 { so far as the Company is aware, the Substantial Shareholders 
and their respective Shareholder Groups have complied with 
the provisions of the Relationship Agreement. 
Going Concern
The principal risks and uncertainties facing the Group are set out 
on pages 24 to 25.
For the purposes of their assessment of the appropriateness 
of the preparation of the Group’s accounts on a going concern 
basis, the Directors have considered the current cash position 
and forecasts of future trading including working capital and 
investment requirements.
During the year the Group met its day-to-day general corporate 
and working capital requirements through existing cash resources. 
At 31
st
 December 2017 the Group had cash on hand of £7.1m  
(30
th
 June 2015: £5.8m).
Overall, the Directors believe the Group is well placed to manage 
its business risks successfully and continue to be profitable and 
cash generative. The Group’s forecasts and projections, taking 
account of reasonable possible changes in trading performance, 
show that the Group should have sufficient cash resources to meet 
its requirements for at least the next 12 months. Accordingly, the 
adoption of the going concern basis in preparing the financial 
statements remains appropriate.
Auditors
Each of the persons who is a Director at the date of this Annual 
Report confirms that:
 { So far as the Director is aware, there is no relevant audit 
information of which the Company’s auditor is unaware; and
 { The Director has taken all the steps that he ought to have taken 
as a Director in order to make himself aware of any relevant 
audit information and to establish that the Group’s auditor is 
aware of that information.
This confirmation is given and should be interpreted in accordance 
with the provisions of s418 of the Companies Act 2006.
A resolution to reappoint PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as auditors 
and to authorise the Directors to determine their remuneration will 
be put to the members at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
Annual General Meeting
The Company’s Annual General meeting will be held at 11.30 a.m. 
on Wednesday 27
th
 June 2018 at the offices of Panmure Gordon, 
1 New Change, London, EC4M 9AF. The Notice of Annual General 
meeting including the resolutions to be proposed is set out in a 
separate Notice of Meeting which accompanies this report and is 
available on the Company’s website www.animalcaregroup.co.uk

STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report  
and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law 
and regulation.
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial 
statements for each financial period. Under that law the directors 
have prepared the group financial statements in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted 
by the European Union and company financial statements in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union. Under company law 
the directors must not approve the financial statements unless 
they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state 
of affairs of the group and company and of the profit or loss of 
the group and company for that period. In preparing the financial 
statements, the directors are required to:
 { select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently;
 { state whether applicable IFRSs as adopted by the European 
Union have been followed for the group financial statements 
and IFRSs as adopted by the European Union have been 
followed for the company financial statements, subject to any 
material departures disclosed and explained in the financial 
statements;
 { make judgements and accounting estimates that are 
reasonable and prudent; and
 { prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the group and 
company will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the group and 
company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy 
at any time the financial position of the group and company and 
enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply 
with the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the group financial 
statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
The directors are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of 
the group and company and hence for taking reasonable steps for 
the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity 
of the company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom 
governing the preparation and dissemination of financial 
statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
The directors consider that the annual report and accounts, taken 
as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the 
information necessary for shareholders to assess the group and 
company’s performance, business model and strategy.
Each of the directors, whose names and functions are listed  
in the Board of Directors section confirm that, to the best of  
their knowledge:
 { the company financial statements, which have been prepared 
in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, 
give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial 
position and profit of the company;
 { the group financial statements, which have been prepared in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, give 
a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position 
and profit of the group; and
 { the Directors’ Report includes a fair review of the development 
and performance of the business and the position of the group 
and company, together with a description of the principal risks 
and uncertainties that it faces.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT TO THE MEMBERS 
OF ANIMALCARE GROUP PLC
Report on the audit of the financial statements
Opinion
In our opinion, Animalcare Group plc’s Group financial statements and Company financial statements (the “financial statements”):
 { give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the Company’s affairs as at 31
st
 December 2017 and of the Group’s profit 
and the Group’s and the Company’s cash flows for the period then ended;
 { have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and, as regards the Company’s financial 
statements, as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and
 { have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
We have audited the financial statements, included within the Annual Report, which comprise: the Group and parent Company 
statements of financial position as at 31
st
 December 2017; the Group income statement and statement of comprehensive income, the 
Group and parent Company statements of cash flows, and the Group and parent Company statements of changes in equity for the period 
then ended; and the notes to the financial statements, which include a description of the significant accounting policies.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (“ISAs (UK)”) and applicable law. Our 
responsibilities under ISAs (UK) are further described in the Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of 
our report. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Independence
We remained independent of the Group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial 
statements in the UK, which includes the FRC’s Ethical Standard, as applicable to listed entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical 
responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.

 { The components based overseas - being Ecuphar NV, Medini NV, Othopaedics and Ecuphar

The scope of our audit
As part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements. In 
particular, we looked at where the Directors made subjective judgements, for example in respect of significant accounting estimates that 
involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain. 
As in all of our audits we also addressed the risk of management override of internal controls, including evaluating whether there was 
evidence of bias by the Directors that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT TO THE MEMBERS 
OF ANIMALCARE GROUP PLC
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in the auditors’ professional judgement, were of most significance in the audit of the financial 
statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) 
identified by the auditors, including those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the allocation of resources in the 
audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters, and any comments we make on the results of our procedures 
thereon, were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we 
do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. This is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit. 
Key audit matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter
Accounting for the reverse acquisition of Ecuphar N.V.
On 13
th
 July 2017 the Group acquired 100% of the share capital 
of Ecuphar NV via a share-for-share exchange. In line with the 
requirements of IFRS 3, this is being accounted for as a reverse 
acquisition given the relative size of Ecuphar NV in comparison 
to Animalcare Group plc.
We focused on this area because the accounting for acquisitions 
involves judgement and estimates that have a material impact 
on the amounts recognised in the Group Financial Statements, 
including:
 { determining the fair value of intangible assets acquired, 
which largely consists of Animalcare Group plc’s proprietary 
product portfolio and pipeline of new products, and the 
useful economic lives of these identified intangibles;
 { determining the fair value of other assets and liabilities 
acquired; and
 { determining the appropriate disclosures and accounting 
treatment in relation to the reverse acquisition.
We obtained and read the relevant terms of the purchase 
agreements to inform our further audit procedures to test the 
accounting for the acquisition.
We tested the recognition in the Consolidated Financial 
Statements of the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired 
(and residual goodwill). In doing so, we:
 { tested the valuation of the acquired intangibles by testing 
if the assumptions used in the calculations were consistent 
with our understanding of the acquisition and through 
agreement to supporting evidence. In addition, we utilised our 
internal valuation experts to assess the reasonableness of the 
valuation methodology and other key assumptions driving the 
valuation, specifically the discount rate applied. We found no 
inconsistencies in the assumptions used in the valuation; and
 { considered whether any other intangible assets should have 
been identified, based on our understanding of the transaction, 
our knowledge of the business, the purchase agreements and 
discussions with the Directors; we did not identify any.
We have also reviewed the financial statement disclosures to 
ensure that the reverse acquisition is appropriately disclosed in 
line with IFRS; we did not identify any issues.
Accounting for complex customer arrangements
The Group provide rebate discounts and equipment deals 
to buying groups, corporate owned veterinary practices and 
independent veterinary practices. These are contractual and 
vary by customer and product type.
We focused on this area because the amount of customer 
rebates payable in respect of the year is determined by the 
contract terms for each customer, which are negotiated 
separately and, as a result, differ from one another. This means 
that the calculation of the rebates recognised in the Income 
Statement, and as a payable at the year end, relies on a manual 
process, which is inherently more prone to error than systems-
based processes. We also focused on the completeness of the 
Income Statement charge and year end provision due to the risk 
of potential omission given the manual nature of the process.
To test customer rebates, we:
 { recalculated, for a sample of customers, the customer rebate 
expense recognised within the Income Statement in the year, 
and provided for at the Balance Sheet date, finding them to be 
broadly consistent;
 { tested whether any rebate arrangements had been omitted 
from the amounts charged in the year, and liabilities held at the 
Balance Sheet date, by checking the contractual arrangements 
with the Group’s most significant customers to make sure that 
all rebate arrangements had been identified by the Directors 
and did not identify any that had been omitted; and
 { agreed amounts settled with customers post period end to 
source documentation (credit notes and cash payment) to 
check they had been accounted for in the right accounting 
period, and found no instances of amounts recorded in the 
wrong period.
42 26011   18/05/2018   Proof 4
Key audit matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter
Carrying value of intangibles in relation to  
New Product Development
New Product Development expenditure is capitalised and 
amortised over the estimated economic life of the product 
when the relevant criteria of IAS 38 “Intangible assets” are 
met. Judgement is required when assessing the technical and 
commercial feasibility of New Product Development projects, 
including whether regulatory approval will be achieved. Given 
the level of judgement involved we have focused on this area.
The risk we focused on is that the carrying value of these 
intangibles may be overstated and that an impairment charge 
may be required.
To assess the carrying value of intangibles in relation to New 
Product Development we have:
 { tested a sample of costs capitalised during the year to assess 
whether these have been appropriately treated in line with 
the Group’s accounting policy and accounting standards, most 
notably IAS 38 “Intangible assets”, and noted no issues;
 { met with management responsible for the particular costs 
to obtain an understanding of the associated project and to 
independently assess whether project costs meet the criteria 
for capitalisation as set out in accounting standards; we agreed 
with management’s judgements;
 { reviewed management’s feasibility analysis for ongoing new 
product development projects, which considers the payback 
period, being the point in time when the New Product 
Development will turn a profit based on its expected future 
earnings potential. This has been reviewed to assess the 
carrying value of the related intangible assets with no issues 
noted; and
 { determined that the disclosure detailed within note 10 is 
consistent with the requirements of IAS 38 “Intangible assets”.
How we tailored the audit scope
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements 
as a whole, taking into account the structure of the Group and the Company, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in 
which they operate.
The Group operates through 13 components in a number of different countries. The procedures performed over the components (either 
by the Group team or PwC component audit teams) accounted for 77% of the Group’s external revenues and 88% of the Group’s EBITDA. 
We, as the Group engagement team, tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an 
opinion on the financial statements as a whole, taking into account the geographic structure of the Group, the accounting processes and 
controls, and the industry in which the Group operates.
We, as the Group engagement team, performed an audit of the complete financial information for the two UK components – Animalcare 
Group plc and Animalcare Limited. For the remaining components of the Group, being Ecuphar NV, Medini NV, Othopaedics and Ecuphar 
Spain, PwC component auditors, under our instructions, performed an audit of their complete financial information.
Where the work was performed by PwC component auditors we determined the level of involvement we needed to have in the 
audit work at those components to be able to conclude whether sufficient appropriate audit evidence had been obtained as a basis 
for our opinion on the Group financial statements as a whole. We were involved at all stages of their audits by virtue of numerous 
communications throughout the process, including the issuance of detailed audit instructions, review and discussion of audit findings, in 
particular over our areas of focus. We, as the Group engagement team, were also responsible for other head office activities such as the 
Purchase Price Allocation in relation to the reverse acquisition of Ecuphar and the financial statement disclosures.
The procedures performed over the components (either by the Group team or PwC component audit teams) accounted for 77% of the 
Group’s external revenues and 88% of the Group’s EBITDA.
Materiality
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality. These, 
together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our 
audit procedures on the individual financial statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating the effect of misstatements, both 
individually and in aggregate on the financial statements as a whole.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT TO THE MEMBERS 
OF ANIMALCARE GROUP PLC
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:
 Group financial statements Company financial statements
Overall materiality £255,000 £100,000
How we determined it 2.5% of Adjusted EBITDA. Based on the lower of component and statutory 
materiality (statutory materiality based on 0.5% of 
net assets).
Rationale for benchmark 
applied
Based on the benchmarks used in the Annual 
Report, EBITDA is the primary measure used by 
the shareholders in assessing the performance of 
the Group, and is a generally accepted auditing 
benchmark.
We believe that net assets is considered to be 
appropriate as it is not a profit-oriented company. 
The Company holds the investments in subsidiaries 
and therefore net assets is deemed a generally 
accepted auditing benchmark.
For each component in the scope of our Group audit, we allocated a materiality that is less than our overall Group materiality. The range 
of materiality allocated across components was between £100,000 and £240,000.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above £13,000 (Group audit) 
and £13,000 (Company audit) as well as misstatements below those amounts that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.
Conclusions relating to going concern
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which ISAs (UK) require us to report to you when: 
 { the Directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is not appropriate; or 
 { the Directors have not disclosed in the financial statements any identified material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt about 
the Group’s and Company’s ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting for a period of at least twelve months 
from the date when the financial statements are authorised for issue.
However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this statement is not a guarantee as to the Group’s and 
Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
Reporting on other information 
The other information comprises all of the information in the Annual Report other than the financial statements and our auditors’ report 
thereon. The Directors are responsible for the other information. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other 
information and, accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion or, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in this report, any 
form of assurance thereon. 
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider 
whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or 
otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify an apparent material inconsistency or material misstatement, we are 
required to perform procedures to conclude whether there is a material misstatement of the financial statements or a material 
misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of 
this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report based on these responsibilities.
With respect to the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report, we also considered whether the disclosures required by the UK Companies 
Act 2006 have been included. 
Based on the responsibilities described above and our work undertaken in the course of the audit, ISAs (UK) require us also to report 
certain opinions and matters as described below.
44 26011   18/05/2018   Proof 4
Strategic Report and Directors’ Report
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit, the information given in the Strategic Report and Directors’ 
Report for the year ended 31 December 2017 is consistent with the financial statements and has been prepared in accordance with 
applicable legal requirements. 
In light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and Company and their environment obtained in the course of the audit, we 
did not identify any material misstatements in the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report. 
Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit
Responsibilities of the Directors for the financial statements
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial 
statements in accordance with the applicable framework and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. The Directors are also 
responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the Directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s and the Company’s ability to continue as 
a going concern, disclosing as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the 
Directors either intend to liquidate the Group or the Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a 
high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material 
misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, 
they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. 
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the FRC’s website at:  
www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditors’ report.
Use of this report
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the Company’s members as a body in accordance with Chapter 3 
of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for 
any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed 
by our prior consent in writing.
Other required reporting
Companies Act 2006 exception reporting
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
 { we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or
 { adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from 
branches not visited by us; or
 { certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
 { the Company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns. 
We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED 
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
YEAR ENDED 31
S T
 DECEMBER 2017
1 Financial Information 
Animalcare Group plc (“the Company”) is a public company 
incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies 
Act 2006 and is domiciled in the United Kingdom. The Group 
comprises Animalcare Group plc and its subsidiaries. The nature 
of the Group’s operations and its principal activities are set out in 
note 6 and within the Directors’ Report.
Details of the subsidiaries can be found in note 27.
2 Basis of Preparation 
The Group financial statements have been prepared and approved 
by the Directors under the historical cost convention, except for 
the revaluation of certain financial instruments, in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as 
adopted by the European Union (“adopted IFRSs”), the Companies 
Act 2006 as applicable to companies reporting under IFRS and the 
IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) interpretation. They have 
also been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the 
AIM Rules.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in thousands 
of pound sterling (£K or thousands of £) and all “currency” 
values are rounded to the nearest thousand (£000), except when 
otherwise indicated.
The preparation of financial statements in compliance with 
adopted IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting 
estimates. It also requires Group management to exercise 
judgement in applying the Group’s accounting policies. The areas 
where significant judgement and estimates have been made in 
preparing the financial statements and their effect are disclosed in 
Note 3. The accounting policies have been applied consistently.
On 13
th
 July 2017 the Company acquired the entire issued ordinary 
share capital of Ecuphar NV and became the legal parent of 
Ecuphar NV. 
The accounting policy adopted by the Directors applies the 
principles of IFRS 3 (Revised) “Business Combinations” in 
identifying the accounting parent as Ecuphar NV and the 
presentation of the Group consolidated statements of the 
Company (the legal parent) as a continuation of financial 
statements of the accounting parent or legal subsidiary  
(Ecuphar NV). 
This policy reflects the commercial substance of this transaction  
as follows:
 { The original shareholders of the legal subsidiary undertaking 
were the most significant shareholders following admission to 
AIM, owning 46.9% of the issued share capital; 
 { The assets and liabilities of the legal subsidiary Ecuphar NV are 
recognised and measured in the Group financial statements at 
the pre-combination carrying amounts without restatement to 
fair value;
 { The retained earnings and other equity balances recognised 
in the Group financial statements reflect the retained earnings 
and other equity balances of Ecuphar NV immediately before 
the business combination
 { The results of the period from 1
st
 January 2017 to the date of 
the business combination are those of Ecuphar NV;
 { The equity structure appearing in the Group financial 
statements reflects the equity structure of the legal parent, 
including the equity instruments issued under the share-
for-share exchange to effect the business combination and 
adjusted in accordance with IFRS 3. This results in the creation 
of a “reverse acquisition reserve” as at 1
st
 January 2017, being 
the difference between the Company equity structure and that 
of Ecuphar NV. 
The consolidated financial statements cover the year ended 
31
st
 December 2017. The financial statements for the comparative 
year ended 31
st
 December 2016 represent the substance of the 
reverse acquisition and are those of Ecuphar NV.
3 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Going concern
An analysis of the factors likely to impact on the Group’s future 
business activities, performance and strategy are set out in the 
Chief Executive’s Review and Chief Financial Officer’s Review. The 
principal risks and uncertainties facing the Group are set out in the 
Strategic Report on pages 01 to 25.
For the purposes of their assessment of the appropriateness 
of the preparation of the Group’s accounts on a going concern 
basis, the Directors have considered the current cash position 
and forecasts of future trading including working capital and 
investment requirements.
During the year, the Group met its day-to-day general corporate 
and working capital requirements through existing cash resources. 
At 31
st
 December 2017 the Group had cash on hand of £7,579k 
(2016: £951k).
Overall, the Directors believe the Group is well placed to 
manage its business risks successfully. The Group’s forecasts and 
projections, taking account of reasonable possible changes in 
trading performance, show that the Group should have sufficient 
cash resources to meet its requirements for at least the next 12 
months. Accordingly, the adoption of the going concern basis in 
preparing the financial statements remains appropriate. 
Basis for consolidation
The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial 
statements of the Group and its subsidiaries.
52 26011   18/05/2018   Proof 4
Entities are fully consolidated from the date of acquisition, which 
is the date when the Group obtains control, and continue to be 
consolidated until the date when such control ceases. The financial 
statements of the entities are prepared for the same reporting 
period as the parent Company, using consistent accounting 
policies. All intra-Group balances, transactions, unrealised gains 
and losses resulting from intra-Group transactions and dividends 
are fully eliminated.
The Group attributes profit or loss and each component of other 
comprehensive income to the owners of the parent Company 
and to the non-controlling interest based on present ownership 
interests, even if the results in the non-controlling interest have a 
negative balance.
A change in the ownership interest of a subsidiary, without a loss 
of control, is accounted for as an equity transaction. If the Group 
loses control over the subsidiary, it will derecognise the assets 
(including goodwill) and liabilities of the subsidiary, any non-
controlling interest and the other components that are equity-
related to the subsidiary. Any surplus or deficit arising from the 
loss of control is recognised in profit or loss. If the Group retains an 
interest in the previous subsidiary, then such interest is measured 
at fair value at the date the control is lost.
The proportion allocated to the parent and non-controlling 
interests in preparing the consolidated financial statements is 
determined based solely on present ownership interests.
Non-underlying items
Non-underlying items are material items of income or expense 
which, because of their nature and the expected frequency of the 
events giving rise to them, merit separate disclosure.
Other items relates to the amortisation of acquired intangible 
assets and fair value movements on foreign exchange hedging 
instruments.
The separate presentation of exceptional and other items enables 
the users of the accounts to better understand the elements of 
trading performance during the year and hence to better assess 
trends in that performance.
Non-controlling interests
The Group has the choice, on a transaction by transaction 
basis, to initially recognise any non-controlling interest in the 
acquiree which is a present ownership interest and entitles its 
holders to a proportionate share of the entity’s net assets in the 
event of liquidation at either acquisition date fair value or, at 
the present ownership instruments’ proportionate share in the 
recognised amounts of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. 
Other components of non-controlling interest such as outstanding 
share options are generally measured at fair value. The Group 
has not elected to take the option to use fair value in acquisitions 
completed to date and currently only has minor non-controlling 
interest resulting from business combinations.
Segment reporting
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with 
the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision-
maker. The chief operating decision-maker, who is responsible for 
allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating 
segments, has been identified as the Executive Committee. 
Operating segments are aggregated when they have similar 
economic characteristics which is the case when there is similarity 
in terms of: (a) the nature of the products and services; (b) 
the nature of the production processes; (c) the type or class of 
customer for their products and services; (d) the methods used 
to distribute their products or provide their services; and (e) if 
applicable, the nature of the regulatory environment. The Group 
has two operating segments: Pharmaceutical and Wholesale.
Foreign currency translation
Functional and presentation currency
The Group’s consolidated financial statements are presented 
in Pounds Sterling (GBP) which is the Group’s presentational 
currency.
For each entity, the Group determines the functional currency, 
and items included in the financial statements of each entity are 
measured using the functional currency. The functional currency 
of most subsidiaries of the Group is Euros.
The statement of financial position is translated into GBP at the 
closing rate on the reporting date and their income statement is 
translated at the average exchange rate at year-end. Differences 
resulting from the translation of the financial statements of the 
parent and the subsidiaries are recognised in other comprehensive 
income as “cumulative translation differences”. 
Foreign currency transactions
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into 
Euros at the exchange rate at the end of the previous month-
end. Monetary items in the statement of financial position are 
translated at the closing rate at each reporting date and the 
relevant translation adjustments are recognised in financial or 
operating result depending on its nature.
Business combinations
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition 
method at the acquisition date, which is the date at which the 
Group obtains control over the entity. 
The cost of an acquisition is measured as the amount of the 
consideration transferred to the seller, measured at the acquisition 
date fair value, and the amount of any non-controlling interest in 
the acquiree.

3 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)
Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities 
assumed in a business combination are, with limited exceptions, 
measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date. The 
Group recognises any non-controlling interest in the acquired 
entity on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis either at fair value 
or at the non-controlling interest’s proportionate share of the 
acquired entity’s net identifiable assets.
The Group measures goodwill initially at cost at the acquisition 
date, being:
 { the fair value of the consideration transferred to the seller, plus
 { the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree, plus
 { if the business combination is achieved in stages, the fair value 
of the existing equity interest in the acquiree remeasured at 
the acquisition date, less
 { the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired and 
assumed liabilities.
Goodwill is recognised as an intangible asset with any impairment 
in carrying value being charged to the consolidated income 
statement. Where the fair value of identifiable assets, liabilities 
and contingent liabilities exceed the fair value of consideration 
paid, the excess is credited in full to the consolidated income 
statement on acquisition date.
Acquisition costs incurred are expensed and included in general 
and administrative expenses.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost, net of accumulated 
depreciation and/or accumulated impairment losses, if any. Such 
cost includes borrowing costs directly attributable to construction 
projects if the asset necessarily takes a substantial period of time to 
get ready for its intended use, it is probable that they will result in 
future economic benefits to the Group and the cost can be measured 
reliably. When significant parts of property, plant and equipment 
are required to be replaced at intervals, the Group recognises such 
parts as individual assets with specific useful lives and depreciates 
them accordingly. Likewise, when a major inspection is performed, its 
cost is recognised in the carrying amount of the property, plant and 
equipment as a replacement if the recognition criteria are satisfied. 
All other repair and maintenance costs are recognised in the income 
statement as incurred.
Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the 
estimated useful lives of the assets as follows:
 { Equipment 5 years
 { Office furniture and office equipment 3–5 years or  
 lease term if  
 shorter
 { Leased equipment 4–5 years
 { Leasehold improvements 5 years or lease  
 term if shorter
Land is not depreciated. 
A leased asset is depreciated over the useful life of the asset. 
However, if there is no reasonable certainty that the Group 
will obtain ownership by the end of the lease term, the asset is 
depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the 
asset or the lease term.
An item of property, plant and equipment and any significant part 
initially recognised is derecognised upon disposal or when no 
future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal. 
Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset (calculated as 
the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying 
amount of the asset) is included in the income statement when 
the asset is derecognised.
The assets’ residual values, useful lives and methods of 
depreciation are reviewed at each financial year-end and adjusted 
prospectively, if appropriate.
Leases
The determination of whether an arrangement is, or contains, 
a lease is based on the substance of the arrangement at 
the inception date, whether fulfilment of the arrangement 
is dependent on the use of a specific asset or assets or the 
arrangement conveys a right to use the asset, even if that right is 
not explicitly specified in an arrangement.
Finance leases which transfer to the Group substantially all the 
risks and benefits incidental to ownership of the leased item, are 
capitalised at the commencement of the lease at the fair value of 
the leased item or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum 
lease payments. Lease payments are apportioned between finance 
charges and reduction of the lease liability so as to achieve a 
constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Finance charges are recognised as financial expenses in the 
consolidated income statement.
Where substantially all of the risks and rewards incidental to 
ownership are not transferred to the Group (an “operating lease”), 
the total rentals payable under the lease are charged to the 
consolidated income statement on a straight-line basis over the 
lease term. The aggregate benefit of lease incentives is recognised 
as a reduction of the rental expense over the lease term on a 
straight-line basis.
Intangible assets
Intangible assets comprise the acquired product portfolios,  
in-process research and development, licensing and distribution 
rights and customer acquired in connection with business 
combinations, product portfolios and product development costs 
and capitalised software.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
YEAR ENDED 31

 DECEMBER 2017

The useful life of the intangible assets is as follows:
 { Capitalised software: 5 years;
 { Patents, distribution rights and licenses: 7–12 years;
 { Product portfolios and product development: 10 years;
 { In-process research and development: Not amortised;
 { Goodwill: Not amortised.
Intangible assets acquired separately
Intangible assets with finite useful lives which are acquired 
separately are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation 
and accumulated impairment losses. Intangible assets with 
finite lives are amortised over their useful economic lives and 
assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication that 
the intangible asset may be impaired. The amortisation period 
and the amortisation method for an intangible asset with a finite 
useful life are reviewed at least at the end of each reporting 
period. The amortisation expense on intangible assets with finite 
lives is recognised in the consolidated income statement based 
on its function which may be “cost of sales”, “sales and marketing 
expenses”, “research and development expenses” and “general 
and administrative expenses”.
Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives that are acquired 
separately are carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. 
Goodwill
Goodwill is not amortised but it is tested for impairment annually, 
or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate 
that it might be impaired, and is carried at cost less accumulated 
impairment losses. Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity 
include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold.
Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units for the purpose 
of impairment testing. The allocation is made to those cash-
generating units or groups of cash-generating units that are 
expected to benefit from the business combination in which 
the goodwill arose. The units or groups of units are identified 
at the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal 
management purposes, being the operating segments.
Internally generated intangible assets - research and 
development expenditures
Research and development includes the costs incurred by 
activities related to the development of software solutions 
(new products, updates and enhancements), guides and other 
products. Expenditures in research and development activities are 
recognized as an expense in the period in which they are incurred. 
Development activities involve the application of research 
findings or other knowledge to a plan or a design of new or 
substantially improved (software) products before the start of the 
commercial use.
Internal development expenditures on an individual project 
are recognised as an intangible asset when the Group can 
demonstrate:
 { the technical feasibility of completing the intangible asset so 
that the asset will be available for use or sale;
 { its intention to complete and its ability to use or sell the asset;
 { how the asset will generate future economic benefits;
 { the availability of resources to complete the asset;
 { the ability to measure reliably the expenditure during 
development.
Internal development expenditures not satisfying the above 
criteria and expenditures on the research phase are recognised in 
the consolidated income statement as incurred.
Subsequent to initial recognition, internally generated intangible 
assets are reported at cost less accumulated amortisation and 
accumulated impairment losses, on the same basis as intangible 
assets which are acquired separately.
Intangible assets acquired in a business combination
Intangible assets acquired in a business combination and 
recognised separately from goodwill are initially recognised at 
their fair value at the acquisition date (which is regarded as their 
cost). Subsequent to initial recognition, intangible assets acquired 
in a business combination are measured at cost less accumulated 
amortisation and accumulated impairment losses, on the same 
basis as intangible assets which are acquired separately.
Impairment of non-financial assets
Impairment tests on goodwill and other intangible assets with 
indefinite useful economic lives are undertaken annually at the 
financial year end. Other non-financial assets are subject to 
impairment tests whenever events or changes in circumstances 
indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. 
Where the carrying value of an asset exceeds its recoverable 
amount (i.e. the higher of value in use and fair value less costs to 
sell), the asset is written down accordingly.
Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an 
individual asset, the impairment test is carried out on the smallest 
group of assets to which it belongs for which there are separately 
identifiable cash flows; its cash-generating units (“CGUs”). 
Goodwill is allocated on initial recognition to each of the Group’s 
CGUs that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the 
combination giving rise to the goodwill.

3 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)
The Group bases its impairment calculation on detailed budgets 
and forecast calculations, which are prepared separately for each 
of the Group’s CGUs to which the individual assets are allocated. 
These budgets and forecast calculations generally cover a period 
of five years. For longer periods, a long-term growth rate is 
calculated and applied to future cash flows projected after the 
fifth year.
Impairment charges are included in profit or loss, except, where 
applicable, to the extent they reverse gains previously recognised 
in other comprehensive income. An impairment loss recognised 
for goodwill is not reversed.
Where goodwill forms part of a cash-generating unit and part of the 
operation within that unit is disposed of, the goodwill associated 
with the operation disposed of is included in the carrying amount of 
the operation when determining the gain or loss on disposal of the 
operation. Goodwill disposed of in this circumstance is measured 
based on the relative values of the operation disposed of and the 
portion of the cash-generating unit retained.
Inventories
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Costs incurred in bringing each product to its present location and 
condition are accounted for as follows:
 { Raw materials: purchase cost on a first in, first out basis; 
 { Goods purchased for resale: purchase cost on a first in, 
first out basis.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary 
course of business, less estimated costs of completion and the 
estimated costs necessary to make the sale.
Financial assets
Financial assets include loans, deposits, receivables measured 
at amortised cost and available-for-sale financial investments 
measured at fair value.
Financial assets measured at amortised cost
The Group has loans and receivables that are measured at 
amortised cost.
The Group’s loans and receivables comprise trade and other 
receivables, other financial assets and cash and cash equivalents in 
the consolidated statement of financial position.
Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held at 
call with banks, other short-term highly liquid investments with 
original maturities of three months or less, and – for the purpose 
of the statement of cash flows – bank overdrafts. Bank overdrafts 
are shown within loans and borrowings in current liabilities on the 
consolidated statement of financial position.
Financial assets that are classified as loans and receivables 
are initially measured at fair value plus transaction costs and 
subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest rate 
method (EIR). Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account 
any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are 
an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortisation is included under 
financial income in the consolidated income statement. The losses 
arising from impairment are recognised in the consolidated income 
statement under other operating expenses or financial expenses.
Available-for-sale financial assets measured at fair value
Available-for-sale financial assets relate to investments that 
are not initially acquired in view of a short-term sale (shares 
and securities) and that are not fully consolidated nor equity 
consolidated. Assets in this category are measured at fair value 
with the resulting gains and losses being directly recognised in 
other comprehensive income (equity).
Assets in this category are measured at cost when there is no price 
input available in an active market and the fair value cannot be 
measured reliably by applying alternative valuation methods.
Impairment of financial assets
The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is any 
objective evidence that a financial asset or a group of financial 
assets is impaired. A financial asset or a group of financial assets 
is to be impaired if there is objective evidence of impairment as 
a result of one or more events that has occurred after the initial 
recognition of the asset (an incurred “loss event”) and that loss 
event has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of  
the financial asset or the group of financial assets that can be 
reliably estimated.
In cases of available-for-sale financial assets, objective evidence 
would include a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of 
the investment below its cost.
If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss has been 
incurred, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference 
between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of 
estimated future cash flows (excluding future expected credit 
losses that have not yet been incurred) or its current fair value, in 
cases of available-for-sale financial assets. The present value of the 
estimated future cash flows is discounted at the financial asset’s 
original effective interest rate. If a loan has a variable interest rate, 
the discount rate for measuring any impairment loss is the current 
effective interest rate. 
The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of 
an allowance account and the amount of loss is recognised in 
the income statement. In the event of an impairment loss for 
available-for-sale financial assets, the accumulated impairment 
loss is removed from other comprehensive income and recognised 
in the consolidated statement of profit or loss. Impairment losses 
on available-for-sale financial assets are not reversed.

Financial liabilities
The Group has financial liabilities measured at amortised cost 
which include loans and borrowings, trade payables and other 
payables and financial liabilities resulting from an interest rate 
swap (classified as held for trading).
Financial liabilities at amortised cost
Those financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value 
plus directly attributable transaction costs and are measured at 
amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. Gains and 
losses are recognised in the income statement when the liabilities 
are derecognised as well as through the effective interest rate 
method amortisation process.
Derivative financial liabilities
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge the 
exposure to changes in interest rates, however the use of 
derivatives is limited and does not represent significant amounts. 
Derivative financial instruments are initially measured at fair value. 
After initial recognition, the financial instruments are measured at 
fair value on the balance sheet date.
Such hedging transactions do not qualify for hedge accounting 
criteria, although they offer economic hedging according to the 
Group’s risk policy. Changes in the fair value of such instruments are 
recognised directly in the consolidated statement of profit or loss.
Derecognition
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the 
liability is discharged or cancelled or expires.
Offsetting of financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net 
amount is reported in the consolidated statement of financial 
position if there is a currently enforceable legal right to offset 
the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle 
on a net basis, or to realise the assets and settle the liabilities 
simultaneously.
Share capital
Financial instruments issued by the Group are classified as equity 
only to the extent that they do not meet the definition of a 
financial liability or financial asset. The Group’s ordinary shares are 
classified as equity instruments.
Dividends
Dividends paid are recognised within the statement of changes in 
equity only when an obligation to pay the dividends arises prior to 
the year end.
Share-based payments
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain 
employees. Equity-settled share-based payments are measured 
at fair value (excluding the effect of non-market-based vesting 
conditions) at the date of grant. The fair value determined at 
the grant date of such equity-settled share-based payments is 
expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based 
on the Group’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest and 
adjusted for the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions 
(with a corresponding movement in equity).
Fair value is measured by use of the Black–Scholes model. The 
expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on 
management’s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, 
exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations. 
The fair value of the shares issued under the new Long Term 
Incentive Plan were valued on a discounted cash flow basis in 
conjunction with a third party valuation specialist. 
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation 
(legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable 
that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will 
be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be 
made of the amount of the obligation.
Employee benefits
Short-term employee benefits
The Group has short-term employee benefits which are recognised 
when the service is performed as a liability and expense. The 
short-term employee benefit is the undiscounted amount 
expected to be paid.
Management incentive plans
The Group has implemented an incentive plan for some of its 
employees. The liability recognised is the undiscounted amount 
expected to be paid. 
Post-employment benefits
The Group has a defined contribution obligation where the Group 
pays contributions based on salaries to an insurance company, in 
accordance with the laws and agreements in each country.
The Belgian defined contribution pension plans are by law subject 
to minimum guaranteed rates of return, currently 3.25% on 
employer contributions and 3.75% on employee contributions. 
These rates have been modified by the law of 18
th
 December 2015 
and effective for contributions paid as from 2016 to a new variable 
minimum return based on the Belgian government bonds, with a 
minimum of 1.75% and a maximum of 3.75%.

3 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)
These plans qualify as a defined benefit plan as from 1
st
 January 
2016 considering the modified law. Previously, the Group has 
adopted a retrospective approach whereby the net liability 
recognised in the statement of financial position is based on the 
sum of the positive differences, determined by individual plan 
participant, between the minimum guaranteed reserves and the 
benefits accrued at the closing date based on the actual rates  
of return.
The impact of the defined contribution plans accounted for as a 
defined benefit plan is not material.
Contributions are recognized as expenses for the period in  
which employees perform the corresponding services. 
Outstanding payments at the end of the period are shown as other 
current liabilities.
Employee benefits – pensions
The Group operates a stakeholder pension scheme available to all 
eligible employees. Payments to this scheme are charged as an 
expense as they fall due.
Revenue recognition
Sales of goods
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration 
received or receivable, and represents amounts receivable for 
goods supplied, stated net of discounts, returns and value added 
taxes.
Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when all of the 
following five conditions are met:
 { The Group transfers to the buyer the significant risks and 
rewards of ownership of the goods;
 { The Group retains neither continuing managerial involvement 
to the degree usually associated with ownership nor effective 
control over the goods sold;
 { The Group can measure reliably the amount of revenue;
 { It is probable that the economic benefits associated with the 
transaction will flow to the Group; and
 { The Group can measure reliably the costs incurred or to be 
incurred in respect of the transaction.
Trade goods include goods produced for the purpose of sale and 
goods purchased for resale.
The Group bases its estimate of returns on historical results, taking 
into consideration the type of customer, the type of transaction 
and the specifics of each arrangement.
Sales of services
When the outcome of a transaction involving the rendering 
of services is estimated reliably, revenue associated with the 
transaction is recognised when the services are rendered. The 
outcome of a transaction is estimated reliably when all of the 
following four conditions are satisfied:
 { The amount of revenue is measured reliably;
 { It is probable that the economic benefits associated with the 
transaction will flow to the Group;
 { The stage of completion of the transaction at the balance sheet 
date can be measured reliably; and
 { The costs incurred for the transaction and the costs to 
complete the transaction are measured reliably.
In general, these services are invoiced as they are performed and 
the amounts directly recognised in the income statement and do 
not require the measurement of the stage of completion. 
Upfront income received in relation to long-term service contracts 
is deferred and subsequently recognised over the life of the 
relevant contracts.
Interest income
For all financial instruments measured at amortised cost, interest 
income is recorded using the effective interest rate, which is the 
rate that exactly discounts the estimated future cash payments 
or receipts over the expected life of the financial instrument or a 
shorter period, where appropriate, to the net carrying amount of 
the financial asset or liability. Interest income is included under 
financial income in the income statement.
Financing costs
Financing costs relate to interests and other costs incurred by the 
Group related to the borrowing of funds. Such costs mostly relate 
to interest charges on short- and long-term borrowings as well as 
the amortisation of additional costs incurred on the issuance of 
the related debt. Financing costs are recognised in profit and loss 
for the period or capitalised in case they are related to a qualifying 
asset.
Other financial income and expenses
Other financial income and expenses include mainly foreign 
currency gains or losses on financial transactions and bank-related 
expenses.
Taxes
Current income tax
Income tax assets and liabilities for the current period are 
measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid 
to the taxation authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used to 
compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantively 
enacted, at the reporting date.
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED 
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
YEAR ENDED 31
S T
 DECEMBER 2017
58 26011   18/05/2018   Proof 4
Current income tax relating to items that are recognised directly 
in equity is recognised in equity and not in the income statement. 
Management periodically evaluates positions taken in the 
tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax 
regulations are subject to interpretation and establishes provisions 
where appropriate.
Deferred tax
Deferred tax is calculated using the liability method on temporary 
differences at the reporting date between the tax bases of assets 
and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting 
purposes.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary 
differences. Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible 
temporary differences, carry forward of unused tax credits and 
unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable 
profit will be available against which the deductible temporary 
differences, and the carry forward of unused tax credits and 
unused tax losses can be utilised.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each 
reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer 
probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow 
all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilised. Unrecognised 
deferred tax assets are reassessed at each reporting date and are 
recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future 
taxable profits will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates 
that are expected to apply in the year when the asset is realised or 
the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have 
been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.
Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset, if a legally 
enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets against current 
income tax liabilities and the deferred taxes relate to the same 
taxable entity and the same taxation authority.
Fair value measurements
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset 
or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between 
market participants at the measurement date. The fair value 
measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction 
to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either in the 
principal market for the asset or liability or in the absence of a 
principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset 
or liability. The principal or the most advantageous market must 
be accessible by the Group. The fair value of an asset or a liability 
is measured using the assumptions that market participants would 
use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market 
participants act in their economic best interest. 
All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or 
disclosed in the financial statements are categorised within the 
fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level 
input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole: 
 { Level 1 — Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets 
for identical assets or liabilities
 { Level 2 — Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input 
that is significant to the fair value measurement is directly or 
indirectly observable 
 { Level 3 — Valuation techniques for which the lowest level 
input that is significant to the fair value measurement is 
unobservable
Events after balance sheet date
Events after the balance sheet date which provide additional 
information about the Company’s position as at the balance sheet 
date (adjusting events) are reflected in the financial statements. 
Events after the balance sheet date which are not adjusting events 
are disclosed in the notes if material.
New and revised standards not yet adopted
Standards and interpretations applicable for the annual period 
beginning on 1
st
 January 2017: 
 { Amendments to IAS 7 Statement of Cash Flows – Disclosure 
Initiative , effective 1

 January 2017
 { Amendments to IAS 12 Income Taxes – Recognition of Deferred 
Tax Assets for Unrealised Losses, effective 1
st
 January 2017
 { Annual Improvements Cycle  - 2014-2016 – Amendments to IAS 
12, effective 1
st

The application of those IFRS standards had no material effect on 
the 2017 consolidated financial statements of the Group.
The standards and interpretations that are issued, but not yet 
effective, up to the closing date of the Group’s financial statements 
are disclosed below.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments and subsequent amendments 
The final version of IFRS 9 replaces IAS 39 Financial Instruments: 
Recognition and Measurement. IFRS 9 brings together all three 
aspects of the accounting for financial instruments project: 
classification and measurement, impairment, and hedge 
accounting. IFRS 9 is effective for annual periods beginning 
on or after 1
st
 January 2018. Early application is permitted by 
applying all of the requirements in this standard at the same 
time. Alternatively, entities may elect to early apply only the 
requirements for the presentation of gains and losses on financial 
liabilities designated as FVTPL without applying the other 
requirements in the standard. Except for hedge accounting, 
retrospective application is required but providing comparative 
information is not compulsory. For hedge accounting, the 
requirements are generally applied prospectively, with some 
limited exceptions.

The Group plans to adopt the new standard on the required 
effective date. The Group has performed an impact assessment 
of all three aspects of IFRS 9. Overall, the Group expects no 
significant impact on its balance sheet and equity of applying the 
impairment requirements of IFRS 9.
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers
IFRS 15 specifies how and when a company will recognise revenue 
as well as requiring such entities to provide users of financial 
statements with more informative, relevant disclosures. The 
standard provides a single, principles-based five-step model to be 
applied to all contracts with customers as follows:
 { Identify the contract(s) with a customer;
 { Identify the performance obligations in the contract;
 { Determine the transaction price;
 { Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in 
the contract; and
 { Recognise revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a 
performance obligation.
Under IFRS 15, revenue is recognised at an amount that reflects 
the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in 
exchange for transferring goods or services to a customer. The new 
revenue standard will supersede all current revenue recognition 
requirements under IFRS. Either a full retrospective application or 
a modified retrospective application is required for annual periods 
beginning on or after 1
st
 January 2018. Early adoption is permitted.
The Group plans to adopt the new standard on the required 
effective date using the full retrospective method. During 2017, 
the Group performed an assessment of IFRS 15. This analysis 
showed that there is no material impact on the results of  
the Group.
IFRS 16, Leases 
IFRS 16 sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, 
presentation and disclosure of leases and requires lessees to 
account for all leases under a single on-balance sheet model 
similar to the accounting for finance leases under IAS 17 Leases. 
The standard includes two recognition exemptions for lessees – 
leases of “low-value” assets (e.g. personal computers) and short-
term leases (i.e. leases with a lease term of 12 months or less). 
At the commencement date of a lease, a lessee will recognise a 
liability to make lease payments (i.e. the lease liability) and an 
asset representing the right to use the underlying asset during the 
lease term (i.e. the right-of-use asset). Lessees will be required to 
separately recognise the interest expense on the lease liability and 
the depreciation expense on the right-of-use asset. Lessees will be 
also required to remeasure the lease liability upon the occurrence 
of certain events (e.g. a change in the lease term, a change in 
future lease payments resulting from a change in an index or rate 
used to determine those payments). The lessee will generally 
recognise the amount of the remeasurement of the lease liability 
as an adjustment to the right-of-use asset.
Lessor accounting under IFRS 16 is substantially unchanged from 
today’s lessor accounting under IAS 17. Lessors will continue to 
classify all leases using the same classification principle as in IAS 
17 and distinguish between two types of leases: operating and 
finance leases.
IFRS 16 also requires lessees and lessors to make more extensive 
disclosures than under IAS 17.
The new standard is effective for annual periods beginning on 
or after 1
st
 January 2019. Early application is permitted, but not 
before an entity applies IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with 
Customers. A lessee can choose to apply the standard using either 
a full retrospective or a modified retrospective approach. The 
standard’s transition provisions permit certain reliefs. 
As at the reporting date, the Group has non-cancellable operating 
lease commitments of £3,302k, see note 22. However, the Group 
has not yet determined to what extent these commitments 
will result in the recognition of an asset and a liability for 
future payments and how this will affect the Group’s profit and 
classification of cash flows.
The other standards, interpretations and amendments issued by 
the IASB (all of them still subject to endorsement by the European 
Union) but not yet effective are not expected to have a material 
impact on the Group’s future consolidated financial statements, 
and those applicable for the Group are listed below:

Significant accounting judgements,  
estimates and assumptions
The preparation of the Group’s consolidated financial statements 
requires management to make judgements, estimates and 
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenue, 
expenses, assets and liabilities, and the accompanying disclosures. 
Uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result 
in outcomes that require a material adjustment to the carrying 
amount of assets or liabilities for future periods.
On an ongoing basis, the Group evaluates its estimates, 
assumptions and judgements, including those related to revenue 
recognition, development expenses, income taxes, impairment of 
goodwill, intangible assets and property, plant and equipment and 
business combinations.
The Group based its assumptions and estimates on parameters 
available when the consolidated financial statements were 
prepared. Existing circumstances and assumptions about future 
developments, however, may change due to market changes 
or circumstances arising beyond the control of the Group. Such 
changes are reflected in the assumptions when they occur.
Internally developed intangible assets
Under IAS 38, internally generated intangible assets from the 
development phase are recognised if certain conditions are met. 
These conditions include the technical feasibility, intention to 
complete, the ability to use or sell the asset under development, 
and the demonstration of how the asset will generate probable 
future economic benefits. The cost of a recognised internally 
generated intangible asset comprises all directly attributable cost 
necessary to make the asset capable of being used as intended 
by management. In contrast, all expenditures arising from the 
research phase are expensed as incurred.
Determining whether internally generated intangible assets from 
development are to be recognised as intangible assets requires 
significant judgement, particularly in determining whether the 
activities are considered research activities or development 
activities, whether the product enhancement is substantial, 
whether the completion of the asset is technically feasible 
considering a company-specific approach, and the probability of 
future economic benefits from the sale or use.
Management has determined that the conditions for recognising 
internally generated intangible assets from product development 
activities are not met until shortly before the developed products 
are available for sale. This assessment is monitored by the Group 
on a regular basis.
Capitalised software expenditure 
The Group has historically capitalised software projects and 
developments. Expenditure on a bespoke web-based system, 
designed to facilitate online ordering of its products and services, 
is currently capitalised in the Group’s financial statements as the 
Directors have adjudged it to meet the relevant criteria. The rate 
of depreciation on capitalised software is set so as to reflect the 
pattern of usage and the level of pace of change within the global 
information technology market.
Income taxes
Deferred tax assets are recognised for unused tax losses to the 
extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available 
against which the losses can be utilised. Significant management 
judgement is required to determine the amount of deferred tax 
assets that can be recognised, based upon the likely timing and 
the level of future taxable profits together with future tax planning 
strategies.
As at 31
st
 December 2017, the Group had £664k (2016: £255k) of 
tax losses carried forward and other tax credits such as investment 
tax credits and notional interest deduction. These losses relate to 
the subsidiaries that have a history of losses, do not expire and 
may not be used to offset taxable income elsewhere in the Group.
The Group may also be required to evaluate some uncertainty 
surrounding potential liability in relation to uncertain tax 
positions. Uncertain tax positions (whether assets or liabilities) 
are recognised using a “probable” threshold in accordance with 
IAS 12, and they are reflected at the amount expected to be 
recovered from, or paid to, the taxation authorities. It may also 
include interpretations of complex tax laws as well as transfer 
pricing considerations which could be disputed by tax authorities. 
Assessing uncertain tax positions requires significant judgement 
from management.

3 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)
Impairment of goodwill 
The Group has goodwill for a total amount of £51,413k (2016: 
£9,959k) which has been subject to an impairment test. The 
goodwill is tested for impairment based on the Fair Value Less 
Costs of Disposal (FVLCD) method which uses sales and EBITDA 
multiples. The key assumptions used to determine the recoverable 
amount for the different CGU’s are disclosed and further explained 
in note 9.
No impairment charges have been recorded during the reported 
periods.
Impairment of slow-moving and obsolete inventory 
The Group performs regular stockholding reviews, in conjunction 
with sales and market information, to help determine any slow-
moving or obsolete lines. Where identified, adequate provision is 
made in the financial statements for writing down or writing off the 
value of such lines in order to reflect the realisable value of its stock.
Business combinations
The Group determines and allocates the purchase price of an 
acquired business to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as 
of the business combination date. The purchase price allocation 
process requires the Group to use significant estimates and 
assumptions, including:
 { estimated fair value of the acquired intangible assets;
 { estimated fair value of property, plant and equipment;
While the Group is using its best estimates and assumptions as 
part of the purchase price allocation process to accurately value 
assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition, 
our estimates and assumptions are inherently uncertain and 
subject to refinement. Examples of critical estimates in valuing 
certain of the intangible assets the Group has acquired or may 
acquire in the future include but are not limited to:
 { future expected cash flows from customer contracts and 
relationships, software licence sales and maintenance 
agreements;
 { the fair value of the plant and equipment;
 { the fair value of the deferred revenue; 
 { discount rates; and
 { the determination of useful lives and amortisation period of 
acquired intangible assets.
4 Business Combinations and Disposals of 
Subsidiaries
Business combinations 
Reverse acquisition of Animalcare Group plc
On 13
th
 July 2017 Animalcare Group plc acquired 100% of the 
share capital of Ecuphar NV for a total consideration of £133,775k, 
satisfied through a combination of a share-for-share exchange and 
£33,145k in cash net of commissions.
The acquisition of Ecuphar NV by Animalcare Group plc is deemed 
to be a reverse acquisition under the provisions of IFRS 3 “Business 
Combinations”.
In accounting for a reverse acquisition (rather than an 
acquisition) the combined financial statements are deemed to 
be a continuation of the books of the legal acquiree (Ecuphar 
NV) rather than a continuation of those of the legal acquirer 
(Animalcare Group plc).
The assets and liabilities of Ecuphar NV are recognised and 
measured in the Group financial statements at the pre-
combination carrying amounts, without restatement to fair value 
and no goodwill arises in relation to them.
Conversely, the assets of Animalcare Group plc and Animalcare Ltd 
are consolidated at their fair values.
The overall effect is that the consolidated financial statements are 
prepared from an Ecuphar NV perspective rather than Animalcare 
Group plc, and in summary this means:
 { the comparative consolidated financial information is that of 
Ecuphar NV rather than that of Animalcare Group plc;
 { the result for the year and consolidated cumulative profit 
and loss reserves are those of the Ecuphar NV plus the post-
acquisition results of the Animalcare Group plc;
 { a reverse acquisition reserve of (£56,762k) has been created;
 { the share capital and share premium account are that of 
Animalcare Group plc; and
 { the cost of the combination has been determined from the 
perspective of Ecuphar NV.
Goodwill arises on the reverse acquisition when comparing the 
deemed fair value consideration of Animalcare Group plc acquiring 
the shares of Ecuphar NV. The fair value of the consideration is the 
market capitalisation of Animalcare Group plc at the acquisition date 
based on the closing share price on 12
th
 July of 355p per share.

The acquisition consideration, net assets and goodwill are based upon the reverse acquisition of Animalcare Group plc by Ecuphar NV. 
The fair value of the consideration is the market capitalisation of Animalcare Group plc at the closing share price of 355p per share on 
12
th
 July 2017. Transaction costs of equity transactions relating to the issue and readmission of the Company’s shares are accounted for 
as a deduction from equity where they relate to the issue of new shares.
The fair value of the net assets acquired and shown in the table above was £34,290k. The fair value of the consideration was £75,338k 
resulting in goodwill on reverse acquisition of £41,048k. In addition, the fair value uplift of inventory amounted to £401k, and the fair  
value uplift of the identified intangibles amounted to £30,957k. Deferred tax assets and liabilities respectively were increased by £885k 
and (£6,843k).

6 Segment Information 
For management purposes, the Group is organised into two segments: the Pharmaceuticals and the Wholesale segments. 
The Pharmaceuticals segment is active in the development and marketing of innovative pharmaceutical products that provide significant 
benefits to animal health.
The Wholesale segment focuses on the sale of veterinary pharmaceuticals, supplies and instruments in the Belgian market. 
The measurement principles used by the Group in preparing this segment reporting are also the basis for segment performance 
assessment. The Board of Directors of the Group is considered as the Chief Operating Decision Maker. As a performance indicator, the 
Chief Operating Decision Maker controls performance by the Group’s revenue, gross margin, underlying EBITDA and EBITDA. EBITDA is 
defined by the Group as net profit plus finance expenses, less financial income, plus income taxes and deferred taxes, plus depreciation, 
amortisation and impairment. Underlying EBITDA equals EBITDA plus non-underlying items.

Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)
Under the Animalcare Group plc LTIP , which was introduced in June 2014, the Directors’ interests in the LTIP , which was implemented via 
a subscription for growth shares in the capital of Animalcare Ltd, a subsidiary of the Company, are as follows:
 { Iain Menneer – 31,955 A Ordinary Shares of £1.00 each (“A Shares”) for a total cash subscription of £31,955, representing 5.2% of 
Animalcare Ltd’s issued share capital; and
 { Chris Brewster – 19,173 A Shares, representing 3% of Animalcare Ltd’s issued share capital and 11,800 B Ordinary Shares of £1.00 
each (“B Shares”), representing a further 2% of Animalcare Ltd’s issued share capital, for a total cash subscription of £30,973.
The total cash subscriptions were, based on independent valuation, considered to be equal to fair value at the time of acquisition.
Dr Menneer and Mr Brewster had the right to sell their A Shares to the Company at any time after 27
th
 June 2017 in exchange for 
Ordinary Shares of 20 pence each in the Company (“Ordinary Shares”). Their rights to sell the A Shares are subject to, amongst 
other provisions, the Company having a market capitalisation in excess of £39.0m (“the Hurdle”) at the time of sale. The Hurdle was 
determined by Animalcare’s Remuneration Committee and broadly represented a 20% premium to the Company’s market capitalisation 
on 27
th
 June 2014. Each holder of A Shares would, on a sale of his entire holding to the Company, be entitled to receive Ordinary Shares 
representing a percentage of the increase in the Company’s market capitalisation above the Hurdle; being 5% for Dr Menneer and 3% 
for Mr Brewster. The A Shares do not have a right to receive a dividend, except for any amounts distributed on the winding up of the 
Company or on an asset sale.
The B Shares are not entitled to participate in any increase in the value of the Company above the Hurdle but can be exchanged for 
Ordinary Shares of an equal value at any time after 27
th
 June 2017. The B Shares have a right to an annual dividend (on a non-fixed 
coupon basis), calculated by applying a rate of LIBOR + 2% to the nominal value of the B Shares.
Further details of the Plan, including the Hurdle, anti-dilution and other provisions, are set out in Animalcare Ltd’s articles 
of association, which is available within the Investors section (constitutional documents) of the Company’s website 
at http://www.animalcaregroup.co.uk.
It was agreed between the Company, Dr Menneer and Mr Brewster, that the put options did not become exercisable as a result of 
the reverse acquisition of Ecuphar NV. The Company however, determined that it was appropriate to offer the right to exchange their 
shares in Animalcare Ltd for Ordinary Shares shortly before completion of the reverse acquisition, and each took up that right. As a 
consequence, 918,896 new Ordinary Shares were issued to Dr Menneer and Mr Brewster. The number of new Ordinary Shares issued 
pursuant to the exercise of these rights was determined using the lower of the closing middle market price for an Ordinary Share on 
22
nd
 June 2017, being the dealing day before the date the offer to exchange was made and the average of the closing middle market 
prices for an Ordinary Share over the dealing days in the 30
th
 day period before that date, being 392.5 pence.

The Group has unused tax losses, tax credits and notional interest deduction available in an amount of £2,636k for 2017 (2016: £1,045k). 
Deferred tax assets have been recognised on all available tax losses carried forward, resulting in amounts recognised of £699k (2016: 
£292k). This was based on management’s estimate that sufficient positive taxable basis will be generated in the near future for the 
related legal entities with fiscal losses.
8 Earnings Per Share 
Basic earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing the net profit for the year attributable to ordinary equity holders of the 
parent Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year.
The weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during 2016 has been calculated by multiplying the existing Ecuphar NV 
ordinary shares of 13,957,720 by the merger ratio of 63:37 Ecuphar/Animalcare (after taking into account dilution from the exercise of 
certain Animalcare share incentive arrangements) giving a total adjusted weighted average of 23,765,858 shares.
Diluted earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing the net profit attributable to ordinary equity holder of the parent 
Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year plus the weighted average number of 
ordinary shares that would be issued on conversion of all potential dilutive ordinary shares.

In addition to currency translation effects, the goodwill balance increased as a result of the reverse acquisition of the Animalcare 
business in 2017 by £41,048k and decreased as a result of the disposal of Nutriscience Ltd in 2016 by £419k (see note 4). 
As of 31
st
 December 2017, goodwill allocated to the Pharmaceuticals CGU includes goodwill recognised as a result of past business 
combinations of Esteve, Equipharma NV, Ecuphar BV, Cardon Chemicals NV and the reverse acquisition of Animalcare Group plc in 
2017. As of 31
st
 December 2017, goodwill allocated to the Wholesale CGU includes goodwill recognised as a result of the past business 
combinations of Medini NV and Orthopaedics NV. 
The Group has performed an impairment test based on a discounted cash flow model including cash flows derived from the three-year 
budget plan and residual value as of the fourth year.
Both the Pharmaceuticals and Wholesale CGUs are included in their respective reportable segment Pharmaceuticals and Wholesale. 
CGU Pharmaceuticals
The recoverable amount of this cash-generating unit is based on the Fair Value Less Costs of Disposal “FVLCD” which uses a multiples model.
For the calculation of the FVLCD we used both the sales and EBITDA multiples. The multiples used in the model are based on the most 
conservative multiples used by Rothschild for the purpose of valuing both Ecuphar and Animalcare at the time of the acquisition.  
The sales multiples for 2018 of the old Animalcare and Ecuphar businesses are respectively 3.5 and 1.6. The EBITDA multiples used are 
13.8 for Animalcare and 10.9 for Ecuphar. From 2019 onwards, the multiples are determined for the combined businesses. The sales 
multiple is 1.9 and the EBITDA multiple is 11.5. EBITDA and sales are based on the 2018 and 2019 budget provided by management. 
Based on the sales multiple model, the value of the Pharmaceuticals segment is determined at £179,479k, leaving a headroom of £65,882k.
The value of the Pharmaceuticals segment is determined at £153,489k when using the EBITDA multiples approach. This leaves a 
headroom of £39,893k.
CGU Wholesale
The recoverable amount of this cash-generating unit is based on the Fair Value Less Costs of Disposal “FVLCD” which uses a multiples model.
For the calculation of the FVLCD we used both the sales and EBITDA multiples. The multiples used in the model are based on the most 
conservative multiples used by Rothschild for the purpose of valuing both Ecuphar and Animalcare at the time of the acquisition.  
The sales multiples for 2018 of the old Animalcare and Ecuphar businesses are respectively 3.5 and 1.6. The EBITDA multiples used are 
13.8 for Animalcare and 10.9 for Ecuphar. From 2019 onwards, the multiples are determined for the combined businesses. The sales 
multiple is 1.9 and the EBITDA multiple is 11.5. EBITDA and sales are based on the 2018 and 2019 budget provided by management. 
 
Based on the sales multiple model, the value of the Wholesale segment is determined at £53,061k, leaving a headroom of £51,106k. The 
value of the Wholesale segment is determined on £5,602k when using the EBITDA multiples approach. This leaves a headroom of £3,647k.

Revolving credit facilities and roll over investment facilities
In mid-2016, the Group refinanced all of its outstanding investment loans with different banks. Financing arrangements were entered into 
with four Belgian banks. These financing arrangements have been split equally amongst these four banks. The new agreements consist of: 
 { €41.5m revolving credit facilities
 { €10m available acquisition financing
 { €4.08m investment loans
The loans have a variable, EURIBOR based interest rate, increased with a margin of 1.5% or 1.75%. The revolving credit facilities and the 
acquisition financing have a bullet maturity in March 2022. The investment loans are repaid in 23 monthly instalments.

Provisions for risks and charges amount to £72k in December 2017 (2016: £196k) and relate to various obligations which are not 
individually significant.
The assessment of the accounting treatment of the Belgian employee benefit contribution plans with a minimal guaranteed return was 
based on actuarial calculations which resulted in an immaterial impact as only a limited number of individuals can benefit from the plan 
given the limited fixed amount which is being covered per covered individual. No provision has been recognised as at 31
st
 December 
2017 and 2016. As a result no further disclosures have been provided.

Accrued charges mainly relate to accrued product development expenses of £757k, accrued management bonuses in Ecuphar NV of 
£93k (2016: £350k) and several accrued charges relating to commissions and bonuses in Ecuphar Veterinaria for an amount of £333k 
(2016: £318k). 
Deferred income arises from certain services sold by the Group’s subsidiary Animalcare Ltd. In return for a single upfront payment, 
Animalcare Ltd commits to a fixed term contract to provide certain database, pet reunification and other support services to customers. 
There is no contractual restriction on the amount of times the customer makes use of the services. At the commencement of the 
contract, it is not possible to determine how many times the customer will make use of the services, nor does historical evidence provide 
indications of any future pattern of use. As such, income is recognised evenly over the term of the contract, currently between 8 and  
14 years.

In the exercise of its business activity, the Group is exposed to credit, liquidity and market risks. 
Credit risk
As at 31
st
 December 2017, the Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk is £16,680k, which is the amount of the trade receivables in the 
consolidated accounts (2016: £10,781k).
To control this risk, the Group has set up a strict credit collection process. Historically, no major bad debts have been recorded. The Group 
has no individual customers who represent a significant part of the consolidated turnover, nor of the trade receivables at year-end. 
The following is an ageing schedule of trade receivables:

Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company may not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group expects to meet 
its obligations related to the financing agreements through operating cash flows. Additionally, the Group ensures there is sufficient 
headroom on the existing credit lines to have an additional working capital buffer. As at 31

The Group’s indebtedness and its restrictions and covenants agreed upon in the financing agreements may adversely affect the Group’s 
liquidity position. Any breach of covenants can lead to loans being immediately due and payable.
The Company has an international cash pool with different banks to limit excess cash. The Company closely monitors cash balances 
within the Group and uses short-term withdrawals on the credit lines to minimise the cash balances. 
Foreign exchange risk
The Group undertakes transactions denominated in foreign currencies which give rise to the risks associated with currency exchange 
rate fluctuations. Exposures are managed by a combination of matching foreign currency income and expenditure, maintaining foreign 
currency deposits and the use of forward contracts. The carrying values of the Group’s foreign currency assets and liabilities including 
intercompany balances at the reporting date were:

The cumulative effect of the foreign currency translation effects is reported under other comprehensive income in the statement of 
financial position and amounts to £3,183k (2016: £2,003k).
At the end of the reporting period, the Group is mainly exposed to the EUR and the USD. The following table details the effect of a 
10% increase and decrease in the exchange rate of these currencies against sterling when applied to outstanding monetary items 
denominated in foreign currency as at 31
th
 December 2017. A positive number indicates that an increase in profit would arise from a 
10% change in value of sterling against these currencies, and a negative number indicates that a decrease would arise.

Interest rate risk
The maturity dates and interest rates of the financial debts and liabilities are detailed in note 12. The exposure to interest rate risks is 
mainly related to existing borrowing facilities. The current loans of credit institutions have variable interest rates. There are no significant 
differences between the nominal interest rates as listed in note 12 and the effective interest rates of the loans.
If the interest rates would have been 100 bp higher/lower, the financial result would have been £330k lower/higher in 2017 and £ 287k 
lower/higher in 2016.

Capital management
The primary objective of the Group’s shareholders’ capital management strategy is to ensure it maintains healthy capital ratios 
to support its business and maximize shareholder value. Additionally, minimum solvency ratios are agreed upon in the financing 
agreements. Capital is defined as the Group shareholder’s equity which amounts to £89,644k as at 31
st
 December 2017 (2016: 
£19,853k).
The Group consistently reviews its capital structure and makes adjustments in light of changing economic conditions and performances 
of the Group. The Group made no changes to its capital management objectives, policies or processes during the years ended

25 Share-based Payments
During the year the Company operated two share option schemes and one Long Term Incentive Plan as described below:
Animalcare Group plc Executive Share Option Scheme
Under this scheme, options may be granted to certain executives and senior employees of the Group to subscribe for new shares in 
the Company at a fixed price equal to the market value at the time of grant. The options are exercisable three years after the date of 
grant. Once vested, options must be exercised within six years of the date of grant. The exercise of these options is not subject to any 
performance criteria.
SAYE Option Scheme 
This scheme is open to all UK employees to encourage share ownership. Share options are granted at an option price fixed at a 20% 
discount to the market value at the start of the savings period. The SAYE options vest and are exercisable three years after the date of 
grant and must ordinarily be exercised within six months of the completion of the relevant savings period.
Details of the movement in these share option schemes during the year are as follows:

expected lives used in the model were estimated based on management’s best estimate for the effects of non-transferability, exercise 
restrictions, and behavioural considerations.
The Company recognised a total charge in respect of share-based payments of £27k (2016: £nil).
Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)
Information relating to the LTIP , which was exercised during the year, is set out in note 7.7. 
The charge for the year to the income statement in respect of the LTIP is £nil (2016: £nil).

NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS
PERIOD ENDED 31
S T
 DECEMBER 2017
1 Significant Accounting Policies
The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in 
dealing with items which are considered material in relation to the 
financial statements of the Company.
Basis of preparation
The Company financial statements cover the period of 18 months 
from 1
st
 July 2016 to 31
st
 December 2017.
The financial statements have been prepared and approved by 
the Directors under the historical cost convention, except for the 
revaluation of certain financial instruments, in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as adopted 
by the European Union (“adopted IFRSs”) and the Companies Act 
2006 as applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. They have 
also been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the 
AIM Rules.
Under section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 the Company is 
exempt from the requirement to present a separate Profit and 
Loss account in these separate financial statements. The profit 
dealt with in the accounts of the Company was £6,028,000 (2016: 
loss £399,000).
The accounting policies of the Company are the same as for the 
Group where applicable.
Going concern
The Directors have assessed the Company’s ability to continue in 
operational existence for the foreseeable future in accordance 
with FRC Going Concern and Liquidity Risk guidance (October 
2009). It is considered appropriate to continue to prepare the 
financial statements on a going concern basis.
Intangible assets
The Company recognises intangible assets at cost less accumulated 
amortisation and impairment losses. Intangible assets arise 
both as a result of applying IFRS 3 which requires the separate 
recognition of intangible assets from goodwill on all business 
combinations from 1
st
 January 2004, and from the purchase of 
software (that is separable from any associated hardware).
Intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over their 
useful economic lives as follows:
Software Estimated useful life – 4 years
Operating leases
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on 
a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Employee benefits – Pensions
The Company operates a stakeholder pension scheme available to 
all eligible employees. Payments to this scheme are charged as an 
expense as they fall due. 
Investments in subsidiaries
Investments in Group companies are stated at cost less provisions 
for impairment losses.
Dividends
Dividends paid are recognised within the statement of changes in 
equity only when an obligation to pay the dividend arises prior to 
the year end.
Share-based payments
The Company issues equity-settled share-based payments to 
certain employees. Equity-settled share-based payments are 
measured at fair value (excluding the effect of non-market based 
vesting conditions) at the date of grant. The fair value determined 
at the grant date of such equity-settled share-based payments is 
expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based 
on the Company’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest and 
adjusted for the effect of non-market based vesting conditions 
(with a corresponding movement in equity).
Fair value is measured by use of the Black–Scholes model. The 
expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on 
management’s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, 
exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.
The fair value of the shares issued under the Long Term Incentive 
Plan were valued on a discounted cash flow basis in conjunction 
with a third party valuation specialist. 
Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable 
and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year . 
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the statement 
of comprehensive income because it excludes items of income or 
expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further 
excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The Company’s 
liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been 
enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
94 26011   18/05/2018   Proof 4
1 Significant Accounting Policies (continued)
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on 
differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities 
in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used 
in the computation of taxable profit and is accounted for using 
the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are 
generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and 
deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable 
that taxable profits will be available against which deductible 
temporary differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities 
are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the 
initial recognition of goodwill or from the initial recognition (other 
than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a 
transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting 
profit.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each 
balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer 
probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all 
or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to 
apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is 
realised. Deferred tax is charged or credited in the statement of 
comprehensive income, except when it relates to items charged 
or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also 
dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally 
enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax 
liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same 
taxation authority and the Company intends to settle its current 
tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the 
Company’s balance sheet when the Company becomes a party to 
the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand, deposits 
repayable on demand, and other short-term highly liquid 
investments that are readily convertible to a known amount of 
cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Financial liabilities and equity
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according 
to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into. An 
equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest 
in the assets of the Company after deducting all of its liabilities.
Finance income and expense
Finance income comprises interest receivable on funds invested 
that are recognised in the income statement.

The Company presents certain items as exceptional income or expense that, in the judgement of the Directors, merit separate disclosure 
by virtue of their nature, size and incidence.

of Ecuphar NV which completed on 13
th

comprise professional fees including corporate finance, legal, accounting and taxation advice.
Reorganisation and integration costs totalling £105,000 relate to professional fees associated with the reorganisation of the Group 
structure (see note 7) and initial costs in respect of the set-up of a new Long Term Incentive Plan which is expected to be implemented

4 Directors’ Remuneration and Interests (continued)
Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)
Under the Animalcare Group plc LTIP , which was introduced in June 2014, the Directors’ interests in the LTIP , which was implemented via 
a subscription for growth shares in the capital of Animalcare Ltd, a subsidiary of the Company, are as follows:
 { Iain Menneer – 31,955 A Ordinary Shares of £1.00 each (“A Shares”) for a total cash subscription of £31,955, representing 5.2% of 
Animalcare Ltd’s issued share capital; and
 { Chris Brewster – 19,173 A Shares, representing 3% of Animalcare Ltd’s issued share capital and 11,800 B Ordinary Shares of £1.00 
each (“B Shares”), representing a further 2% of Animalcare Ltd’s issued share capital, for a total cash subscription of £30,973.
The total cash subscriptions were, based on independent valuation, considered to be equal to fair value at the time of acquisition.
Dr Menneer and Mr Brewster had the right to sell their A Shares to the Company at any time after 27
th
 June 2017 in exchange for 
Ordinary Shares of 20 pence each in the Company (“Ordinary Shares”). Their rights to sell the A Shares are subject to, amongst 
other provisions, the Company having a market capitalisation in excess of £39.0m (“the Hurdle”) at the time of sale. The Hurdle was 
determined by Animalcare’s Remuneration Committee and broadly represented a 20% premium to the Company’s market capitalisation 
on 27
th
 June 2014. Each holder of A Shares would, on a sale of his entire holding to the Company, be entitled to receive Ordinary Shares 
representing a percentage of the increase in the Company’s market capitalisation above the Hurdle; being 5% for Dr Menneer and 3% 
for Mr Brewster. The A Shares do not have a right to receive a dividend, except for any amounts distributed on the winding up of the 
Company or on an asset sale.
The B Shares are not entitled to participate in any increase in the value of the Company above the Hurdle but can be exchanged for 
Ordinary Shares of an equal value at any time after 27
th
 June 2017. The B Shares have a right to an annual dividend (on a non-fixed 
coupon basis), calculated by applying a rate of LIBOR + 2% to the nominal value of the B Shares.
Further details of the Plan, including the Hurdle, anti-dilution and other provisions, are set out in Animalcare Ltd’s articles 
of association, which is available within the Investors section (constitutional documents) of the Company’s website at 
http://www.animalcaregroup.co.uk.
It was agreed between the Company, Dr Menneer and Mr Brewster, that the put options did not become exercisable as a result of 
the reverse acquisition of Ecuphar NV. The Company, however, determined that it was appropriate to offer the right to exchange their 
shares in Animalcare Limited for Ordinary Shares shortly before completion of the reverse acquisition, and each took up that right. As a 
consequence, 918,896 new Ordinary Shares were issued to Dr Menneer and Mr Brewster. The number of new Ordinary Shares issued 
pursuant to the exercise of these rights was determined using the lower of the closing middle market price for an Ordinary Share on 
22 June 2017, being the dealing day before the date the offer to exchange was made and the average of the closing middle market prices 
for an Ordinary Share over the dealing days in the 30 day period before that date, being 392.5 pence.

Animalcare Group plc Executive Share Option Scheme
Under this scheme, options may be granted to certain executives and senior employees of the Group to subscribe for new shares in 
the Company at a fixed price equal to the market value at the time of grant. The options are exercisable three years after the date of 
grant. Once vested, options must be exercised within six years of the date of grant. The exercise of these options is not subject to any 
performance criteria.
SAYE Option Scheme 
This scheme is open to all UK employees to encourage share ownership. Share options are granted at an option price fixed at a 20% 
discount to the market value at the start of the savings period. The SAYE options vest and are exercisable three years after the date of 
grant and must ordinarily be exercised within six months of the completion of the relevant savings period.
