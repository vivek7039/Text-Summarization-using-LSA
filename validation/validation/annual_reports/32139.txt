OUR GLOBAL FOOTPRINT
AVEVA OPERATES IN 30 COUNTRIES, ENABLING US TO 
SUPPORT CUSTOMERS LOCALL Y ACROSS ALL OF THE 
WORLD’S MAJOR ECONOMIES.
OUR MARKETS
Our products are most applicable  
in industries where scale and 
complexity are the greatest 
challenge. These include: Oil & Gas, 
Marine, Power, Petrochemical & 
Chemical, and other markets  
such as AEC Fabrication, Paper & 
Pulp, Mining and Pharmaceuticals.
Key
Oil & Gas
Oil & Gas accounts for around 
40–45% of revenue. Our 
customers include nine out of  
ten of the world’s leading Oil & 
Gas EPCs and the majority of  
the largest Oil & Gas companies.
Marine
Marine accounts for 
approximately 20% of revenue. 
Our customers include nine  
out of ten of the world’s  
largest shipyards.
Power
Power accounts for some 
15–20% of revenue. Our 
customers include many  
leading EPCs and power 
generation companies.
CUSTOMER PROPOSITION
Our products are most applicable in industries where 
scale and complexity are the greatest challenge. 
Our success has been built on strong, long-term 
relationships with our customers, often spanning 
several decades. These relationships enable us to 
fully understand the industries we serve and ensure 
that our technology development strategy meets 
and anticipates our customers’ developing needs. 
Engineering & Design
Our software enables effective collaboration, 
increased confidence in engineering decisions, 
and the ability to manage change fast. For 
example, all collaborators can access and update 
one integrated system, change is managed 
quickly to avoid unnecessary iterations, and 
zero-clash modelling can be achieved by 
including laser data directly within the design.
Procure
Our customers can keep information consistent 
across global engineering, design, materials 
management and procurement teams. For example, 
it is possible to define and control materials 
efficiently to avoid reworks, as well as the ability to 
share procurement contract management details 
within a centralised system to avoid disputes.
Build
Customers can increase the transparency of 
their construction processes with integration 
at all levels of the workforce. Our tools give 
managers better control through integrated 
workforce planning, enabling the right resources 
and the materials to be in place to maximise 
time, and accommodating changes easily.
Revamp and refit
Our tools make planning and implementing 
modifications quicker and easier, increasing 
efficiency and minimising downtime. The immersive 
3D environment and real-time, integrated laser 
scanning capabilities allow asset and project 
information to be integrated, so revamps can 
be planned and deployed confidently. 
Operate
Customers can minimise operational risk, 
improve change management and increase asset 
intelligence using one easily accessible contextual 
digital information source. Change is managed 
effectively, as the physical asset is synchronised 
with its digital equivalent. This gives engineers 
a clear picture of full information context for all 
decisions in both normal and critical situations. 
Handover
Our customers can save time during familiarisation 
and streamline project handover from the EPC-
managed phase to commissioning and start-
up. For example, information is contextualised 
within the 3D world, saving valuable time during 
familiarisation and the cost of information 
handover management is reduced to near zero.

MT3D
More than 3D
AVEVA’s core sales are in the area of 3D Plant 
and Marine design. We aim to grow sales of 
other design tools such as AVEVA Electrical, 
AVEVA Engineering and information 
management tools such as AVEVA NET to 
address the whole life cycle of industrial assets.
 – We see a major market 
opportunity in leveraging our 
customer base by selling 
additional engineering software 
tools, outside of AVEVA’s core  
3D design platforms.
 – We grew MT3D sales strongly during the year with 
an increase of 2.1% on a constant currency basis. 
Sales of our wider product suite have been a feature 
of this year’s key customer wins, with, for example, 
the AVEVA NET and AVEVA Engage information 
management tools helping to strengthen our offer 
to OOs.

OWNER 
OPERATORS
OOs such as energy and power generation 
companies currently account for only 16%  
of our revenue.
 – A significant market opportunity 
is developing as OOs increasingly 
adopt Digital Assets to help them 
manage their physical assets 
throughout their life cycles.
 – AVEVA’s sales to OOs also grew strongly during the 
year, increasing 5.4% on a constant currency basis.
 – We won some impressive new customer logos 
from our competitors during the year, which 
demonstrates the strength of our technology 
offering for OOs.

GROWTH  
MARKETS
AVEVA generates almost 50% of its revenue 
from EMEA. This largely reflects our heritage  
as a UK-based company and indicates an

STRA TEGIC FRAMEWORK
NOTWITHSTANDING THE CYCLICAL HEADWINDS IN END 
MARKETS THAT AVEVA HAS EXPERIENCED IN THE RECENT 
PAST , WE EXPECT OUR STRATEGY TO DELIVER SOLID 
ORGANIC GROWTH INTO THE LONG TERM.
Our strategy is to increase 
revenues by expanding the 
addressable market as the 
concept of the Digital Asset 
is more widely adopted, 
to sell a wider range of 
products, and to grow in 
industry and geographic 
verticals where the Group’ s 
market share is underweight, 
versus the strength of its 
product offering.
This strategy is organised 
around the pillars shown 
opposite of More than 3D, 
Owner Operators, Growth 
Markets, Broadening Market 
Exposure and Software as a 
Service (SaaS) and the Cloud.
Link to KPIs
Our success in executing our 
strategy ultimately feeds into 
our KPIs (see page 21) which 
track our long-term aim of 
delivering sustainable, 
profitable growth.

MT3D
More than 3D
AVEVA’s core sales are in the area of 3D Plant 
and Marine design. We aim to grow sales of 
other design tools such as AVEVA Electrical, 
AVEVA Engineering and information 
management tools such as AVEVA NET to 
address the whole life cycle of industrial assets.
 – We see a major market 
opportunity in leveraging our 
customer base by selling 
additional engineering software 
tools, outside of AVEVA’s core  
3D design platforms.
 – We grew MT3D sales strongly during the year with 
an increase of 2.1% on a constant currency basis. 
Sales of our wider product suite have been a feature 
of this year’s key customer wins, with, for example, 
the AVEVA NET and AVEVA Engage information 
management tools helping to strengthen our offer 
to OOs.

CHAIRMAN’S ST A TEMENT
AVEVA DELIVERED A RESILIENT PERFORMANCE DURING THE YEAR. 
WE WILL CONTINUE TO TARGET GROWTH, STRENGTHENING 
CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS, WINNING NEW CUSTOMERS AND 
DEVELOPING OUR PRODUCT PORTFOLIO.
I am pleased to report that AVEVA 
delivered a resilient performance 
during 2016/17 , despite two of our key 
end markets, Oil & Gas and Marine, 
remaining subdued. Revenue increased 
7 .1% to £215.8 million (2016 – £201.5 
million) assisted by currency translation 
and profit before tax was £46.9 million 
(2016 – £29.4 million), supported by 
strong cost discipline. On an adjusted 
basis, profit before tax grew 7 .4% to 
£55.0 million (2016 – £51.2 million). 
The Group also increased cash from 
operating activities by 58.2% to  
£57 .2 million (2016 – £36.1 million). 
We are maintaining our progressive 
dividend policy and propose to 
increase the total dividend for the 
year to 40.0 pence per share (2016 
– 36.0 pence). This represents an 
increase of 11.1% over the prior year, 
underpinned by our confidence in the 
long-term prospects for the business.
AVEVA’s net cash position at the year 
end grew to £130.9 million  
(2016 – £107 .9 million). The Board 
believes that it is important to maintain 
a strong balance sheet. This gives our 
customers confidence in the strength 
of our business and allows us to have  
at hand sufficient resources to  
invest in AVEVA’s future growth, for 
example, by investing in Research & 
Development and capitalising on 
acquisition opportunities as they 
become available.
Delivering on our strategy
In addition to delivering solid 
results, we have remained focused 
on executing upon our strategy, in 
order to position AVEVA to achieve 
growth well into the future.
AVEVA achieved good momentum in 
sales of products beyond the core 3D 
design software that currently makes 
up the majority of our revenue. We 
also made good progress with our 
strategy of increasing our sales to 
Owner Operators (OOs), growth in 
the key North American market and 
in broadening our market exposure 
outside of Oil & Gas and Marine. For 
example, during the year we had 
considerable success in the Power 
market, winning contracts with 
companies including KEPCO E&C, 
Southern Company and TerraPower.
These successes were made possible 
by the strength of our technologies 
and people. We continued to 
enhance our existing products and 
develop new offerings during the year 
through our development centres 
in Cambridge and Hyderabad. 
Board developments
At the end of 2016, after 33 years 
with the Group and 17 years as Chief 
Executive, Richard Longdon stepped 
down from his role as Chief Executive 
and as a Director of the Company. 
Richard oversaw the most successful 
phase in AVEVA’s history and was 
the driving force in developing it 
into a global company. The Board 
and I are grateful to Richard for his 
contribution to AVEVA’s success.

We were delighted to appoint James 
Kidd as Deputy Chief Executive 
in July and as Richard’s successor 
as Chief Executive from 1 January 
2017 . James had been Chief 
Financial Officer and a member of 
the Board since January 2011.
We were also pleased to appoint 
David Ward to the Board as James’ 
successor in the role of Chief Financial 
Officer in July. David had been Head 
of Finance at AVEVA since 2011.
James and David were both key to 
developing AVEVA’s strategy and I 
have been impressed with the sharp 
focus that they have demonstrated 
in executing it in their new roles.
We also had changes within our Non-
Executive team. Jonathan Brooks and 
Philip Dayer both reached their nine-
year tenures during the year. Jonathan 
stepped down from the Board in 
November 2016 and Philip will retire 
at the AGM in July 2017 . I would like 
to thank them both on behalf of the 
Board for their contributions to AVEVA.
We welcomed two new Non-Executives 
to the Board. Christopher Humphrey 
joined the Board in July 2016 and 
assumed the role of Chair of the Audit 
Committee in November. Rohinton 
(Ron) Mobed was appointed to the 
Board in March 2017 . Christopher and 
Ron have a wealth of technology and 
information management experience, 
which will add further breadth and 
depth to the skills of the Board.
Summary
AVEVA is now in its 50th year, having 
been founded in 1967 as a government-
funded research institute created by 
the then UK Ministry of Technology at 
Cambridge University. The Company’s 
original mission, to develop computer-
aided design techniques for use by 
British industry, has been achieved 
and indeed greatly exceeded.
The Group now operates in more 
than 30 countries across the globe 
and provides the design technology 
that has created some of the 
world’s largest and most complex 
engineering assets. As I look ahead, 
the opportunities are as exciting as 
they have ever been, as industries 
look to drive efficiencies by adopting 
a Digital Asset approach throughout 
the life cycle of the physical asset.
We will continue to target growth, 
strengthening customer relationships, 
winning new customers in new areas 
and developing our product portfolio.
AVEVA’s progress would not be possible 
without the hard work and dedication 
of all our employees. The Board would 
like to express its sincere thanks for 
their considerable efforts. We would 
also like to thank our customers, 
shareholders and other stakeholders 
for their continued support.

Oil & Gas
MARKET REVIEW
AVEVA’S KEY END MARKETS ARE OIL & GAS, MARINE, POWER, AND 
PETROCHEMICAL & CHEMICAL. OTHER MARKETS WE SERVE INCLUDE 
FABRICATION, PAPER & PULP , MINING, AND PHARMACEUTICALS.  
OIL & GAS ACCOUNTS FOR APPROXIMATEL Y 40–45% OF REVENUE, 
MARINE 20%, POWER 15–20%, PETROCHEMICAL & CHEMICAL 10% AND 
THE REMAINDER 10%.
Oil & Gas
Oil & Gas industry end-market demand 
was weak, with global industry capital 
expenditure falling by over 40% between 
calendar 2014 and calendar 2016. 
(Sources: Barclays, Bank of America 
Merrill Lynch).
This decline had a significant impact on 
the workloads of our EPC customers, 
with the more complex (and therefore 
design-intensive) upstream and offshore 
projects being impacted the most by 
lower oil prices. This, in turn, led to some 
consolidation in our customer base.
These developments impacted demand 
for our software. EPC customers tend  
to favour a rental model for software, 
meaning that their spend with  
AVEVA adjusts to market demand 
relatively quickly.
The oil price did, however, rise towards  
the end of calendar 2016, helping to 
underpin a view that industry capital 
expenditure might start to recover in 
calendar 2017 .
Over time, the industries that we 
serve are growing, although Oil & 
Gas and Marine have historically 
seen substantial cyclical peaks 
and troughs in capital spend.
We aim to outperform the end-market 
growth of the industries that we 
serve as technology, particularly the 
concept of the Digital Asset, is more 
widely adopted throughout the life 
cycles of physical assets. In time this 
will grow the addressable market.
Marine
The Marine market also experienced 
very weak demand during our 2017 
financial year. New ship orders were 
more than halved in calendar 2016 
versus 2015 (Source: Clarksons 
Research). Notwithstanding this, 
AVEVA’s performance was resilient. We 
have strong long-term relationships 
with our customers, with nine out of 
ten of the world’s leading shipyards 
choosing AVEVA products. These yards 
have mostly maintained their software 
licences during the cyclical downturn in 
the expectation of a recovery in future 
years. Clarksons Research forecasts a 
recovery in new ship orders globally, 
with strong annual growth off the low 
calendar year 2016 base out to 2020. 
KEY MARKETS
Market drivers and opportunities
• A cyclical recovery in shipbuilding as 
older ships are replaced by newer, 
more efficient vessels.
• Strength in market sub-sectors,  
such as Naval and Cruise.
Market drivers and opportunities
• Wider adoption of the Digital Asset 
throughout the life cycle of physical 
assets beyond the design phase.
• A cyclical recovery in industry-wide 
capital expenditure to maintain oil 
reserve levels.
• An increase in long-term global 
energy consumption. STRATEGIC REPORT

Power
We saw strength in the Power 
market with several significant 
new contract wins during the year. 
Longer-term trends in Power are 
positive as the world’s emerging 
economies invest in their power-
generation requirements and the 
ageing infrastructure of the developed 
world is maintained or replaced.
In the shorter term, AVEVA has 
benefited from market share gains 
and more demanding technology 
requirements from operators in the 
sector for both design and information 
management tools, as they seek 
to improve asset efficiency.
Petrochemical & Chemical
We saw stability in the Petrochemical & 
Chemical markets during the year, with 
AVEVA achieving some key customer 
wins. We expect to see moderate 
growth over the medium term.
We saw ongoing investment in the 
sector during the year, particularly in 
Asia, with stable market conditions on 
a global basis. AVEVA enjoyed success 
in winning new OO customers in Asia 
during the year in the refining sector.
Other markets
These markets include Fabrication,  
Paper & Pulp, Mining and  
Pharmaceutical.
We enjoyed good customer wins in 
the Paper & Pulp, Pharmaceutical 
and Fabrication sectors.
Market drivers and opportunities
• Growing demand for power in 
emerging economies.
• Replacement of end-of-life power 
stations in developed markets.
• Wider adoption of the Digital Asset

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S STRA TEGIC REVIEW
WHILST CONDITIONS REMAIN CHALLENGING IN 
OUR CORE OIL & GAS AND MARINE MARKETS,  
OUR BUSINESS HAS SEEN EXCELLENT SUCCESSES  
IN OUR KEY GROWTH INDUSTRIES.
As expected, AVEVA’s financial 
performance was resilient despite the 
challenging conditions in our core end 
markets. In addition to delivering solid 
results, we made good progress in 
delivering against our strategy during 
the year and in structuring the business 
to enable future growth. Revenue 
increased 7 .1% to £215.8 million (2016 
– £201.5 million), assisted by a currency 
translation benefit of 11.4%. Profit 
before tax grew to £46.9 million (2016 
– £29.4 million), supported by a strong 
focus on cost control. On an adjusted 
basis, profit before tax grew 7 .4% to 
£55.0 million (2016 – £51.2 million).
On a regional basis, revenue in the 
Americas grew due to a strong 
performance in North America, partly 
offset by difficult market conditions 
in Latin America, specifically in Brazil. 
AVEVA’s performance in EMEA and Asia 
Pacific was robust in the context of the 
subdued Oil & Gas and Marine markets. 
Overall Group revenue declined in 
constant currency terms by 3.8%, 
although we did see an improvement 
in the second half. Excluding Latin 
America, Group revenue declined only 
2.3% in constant currency terms for the 
full year, and was flat in the second half.
We made good progress in executing 
our strategy. On a constant currency 
basis, we delivered good growth with 
More Than 3D (MT3D), Owner 
Operators and sales to the Power 
sector.
The strength of our product offering 
was demonstrated by several key 
new business wins during the year. 
These included wins in both markets 
that offer growth opportunities 
for us and in our more mature 
product and geographic areas.
During the year, I took over as CEO and 
David Ward transitioned to the post of 
CFO. We have both been in the 
business for many years and were core 
to formulating AVEVA’s strategy. We 
plan to continue to pursue this strategy, 
with a sharp focus on execution and 
getting closer to our customers. As 
part of this, I have simplified AVEVA’s 
management structure with greater 
decision-making capabilities and direct 
accountability for performance being 
allocated to our regions. I have also 
added more customer-facing people to 
our Executive team, including a recently 
recruited Chief Revenue Officer, who 
will take overall responsibility for 
leading Global Sales, Partnership 
Management and Marketing.

Delivery against our strategy 
AVEVA’s strategy is to increase 
revenues by growing the addressable 
market for its products as the concept 
of the Digital Asset is more widely 
adopted; to sell a wider range of 
products; and to grow in industry and 
geographic verticals where the Group’s 
market share is underweight, versus 
the strength of its product offering.
Notwithstanding the cyclical headwinds 
in end markets that AVEVA has 
experienced in the recent past, we 
expect our strategy to deliver solid 
organic growth in the long term, across 
end market cycles.
The building blocks of this strategy  
are as follows.
• More than 3D: We see a major 
market opportunity in leveraging our 
customer base and market position 
by selling additional engineering 
software tools, extending beyond 
our core 3D design platforms. 
Further to this, information 
management tools such as AVEVA 
NET, can generate revenue 
throughout the operation life cycle 
of assets, therefore expanding the 
market that we address. 
• Owner Operators: OOs such as 
energy and power generation 
companies currently only account 
for approximately 16% of our 
revenue. However, a significant 
market opportunity is developing as 
OOs increasingly adopt the Digital 
Asset concept to help them manage 
their physical assets throughout 
their life cycles. 
• Growth markets: AVEVA generates 
approximately half of its revenue 
from EMEA. This largely relates to 
our heritage as a UK-based 
company. Over time, we intend to 
grow our revenues in key markets 
such as the USA and China, using 
the competitive advantages that our 
products offer. 
• Broaden market exposure: We  
aim to grow our market share in 
industries beyond our core Oil & Gas 
and Marine markets, with a particular 
focus, in the short term, on Power, 
by applying the strength of our core 
technology and the rich knowledge 
of our people in these markets. 
• Software as a Service (SaaS) and the 
Cloud: We intend to unify all of our 
applications onto a common Cloud 
platform to provide greater value to 
our customers and address a wider 
customer base.
CASE STUDY
GROWTH MARKETS
AVEVA is an established global company with 50 offices in 
30 countries. As such, we can provide customers with local 
sales and support in all of the world’s major economies. 
Notwithstanding this, AVEVA was not the first mover in 
some of the world’s key growth markets and therefore  
has underweight positions due to the ‘stickiness’ of 
customers to incumbent providers. 
We believe that our products offer a strong advantage  
over competing offerings, due to their inherent integration 
based on our leading object-modelling technology, which 
reduces complexity and lowers the total cost of ownership 
for our customers. Our strategy is therefore to apply our 
competitive advantage to gain share in key target markets. 
We are enjoying considerable success in North America, 
where our strategy of leading with sales to Owner 
Operators, often with innovative MT3D product offerings,  
is delivering strong results.

AVEVA GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S STRATEGIC REVIEW CONTINUED
More than 3D ‘MT3D’
AVEVA’s MT3D sales grew during the 
year, increasing 2.1% on a constant 
currency basis. MT3D products 
represented 26.5% of total revenue, 
increasing from 25.2% in the prior 
year. Sales of our wider product suite 
have been a feature of this year’s key 
customer wins, with for example 
the AVEVA NET and AVEVA Engage 
information management tools helping 
to strengthen our offer to OOs.
We are also achieving success 
in leveraging our existing EPC 
(Engineering, Procurement and 
Construction) customer base to sell 
MT3D products. We have developed 
our technology to help deliver 
Building Information Management 
(BIM) projects in Infrastructure – 
not only to help satisfy any BIM 
mandate, but also to support faster, 
more effective project execution 
and handover through improved 
data management. A good example 
is Jacobs, who have used AVEVA 
technologies (AVEVA NET, AVEVA 
Engineering™ and AVEVA Information 
Standards Manager™) to meet their 
client’s information management 
and BIM level 2 requirements, and 
to achieve efficiency improvements 
for a UK highways project.
Owner Operators
AVEVA’s sales to OOs also grew during 
the year, increasing 5.4% on a constant 
currency basis. OOs represented 
16.2% of total revenue, increasing 
from 14.9% in the prior year. We had 
particular success in North America and 
Asia, where we won contracts in the 
Petrochemical & Chemical and Power 
sectors. These included KEPCO E&C, a 
leading global energy solutions provider 
based in South Korea, which chose 
AVEVA for a full range of 3D and MT3D 
design and information management 
products for its new nuclear power 
plant projects. Similarly, another leading 
power generation OO, Southern 
Company, in the USA, selected our 
design and information management 
tools to help improve project execution 
efficiency and asset information 
access. Meanwhile, we strengthened 
our relationship with Eastman, a 
global speciality chemical company.
Growth markets
We enjoyed success in North 
America, where our local strategy 
of leading with sales to OOs and 
of MT3D products is working well, 
and we achieved significant new 
business wins. The business grew by 
18.9% during the year on a constant 
currency basis. We continue to see 
growth potential in China, where 
successes during the year included 
expanding our business with Sinopec 
Engineering Group, which adopted 
AVEVA’s Integrated Engineering and 
Design solution for effective design, 
collaboration and improved efficiency. 
However, overall our business there 
was broadly flat during the year, 
being impacted by tougher market 
conditions, particularly in shipbuilding.
Broaden market exposure
We made good progress during the 
year in broadening our market exposure 
away from the cyclical Oil & Gas and 
Marine end markets. We enjoyed 
particular success in Power where 
revenue increased 11.4% on a constant 
currency basis during the year. Our 
software is well suited to creating and 
managing large complex projects, 
such as gas powered and nuclear 
power stations. During the year, we 
achieved several key wins within the 
Power market with Southern Company 
and TerraPower in the USA, KEPCO 
EPC in Korea and Japan Nuclear Fuel. 
We also achieved success in Paper & 
Pulp, where Valmet, the leading global 
developer and supplier of technologies, 
automation and services for the pulp, 
paper and energy industries, signed a 
multi-year agreement for AVEVA E3D.
AVEVA also enjoyed success in the 
steel fabrication market where sales 
increased by 10.0% on a constant 
currency basis as we continue to 
integrate and leverage the Bocad 
and FabTrol acquisitions. STRATEGIC REPORT

SaaS and the Cloud
While AVEVA’s business model 
already has the high level of recurring 
subscription revenues typically 
associated with Cloud delivery, we 
aim to be technologically ready to 
offer our products on a SaaS model 
in response to customer demand.
For the industries we serve, there 
are several challenges facing our 
customers which need to be overcome 
before there is a full transition to 
Cloud. However, over time we do 
expect that customers will want 
to explore ways of using the Cloud 
to drive efficiency and improve 
collaboration through the supply chain 
and operating cycle of their assets.
We launched our Cloud platform 
AVEVA Connect together with our first 
SaaS offering, Asset Visualisation, at 
the AVEVA World Summit in October 
2016. AVEVA Connect is our SaaS 
ecosystem for Engineering, Design 
and Information Management 
solutions. Asset Visualisation is 
our new Information Management 
as a Service offering. There is a 
willingness from the OOs to move 
towards SaaS for the provision of the 
Digital Asset and we expect these 
products to gain traction with major 
customers in the medium term.
In April this year, we launched a second 
SaaS offering on AVEVA Connect, 
Information Standards Management. 
The Sales team has now been equipped 
to sell these solutions and we have 
brought on board several major oil 
Owner Operators as early adopters. 
Both Asset Visualisation and 
Information Standards Management 
provide entry points for our Owner 
Operator customers to access Digital 
Asset-as-a-Service solutions flexibly 
and cost effectively.
Our technology
Our software is used by customers 
as they design, build and operate 
large capital-intensive assets, mainly 
in the Process, Power and Marine 
industries. Our vision is for the 
widespread adoption of constantly-
evolving Digital Assets, enabling 
our customers to manage continual 
change as they design, build and 
operate some of the world’s most 
complicated physical assets.
We believe that our products offer a 
strong advantage over competing 
offerings, due to their inherent 
integration based on our leading object 
modelling technology, which reduces 
complexity and lowers the total cost of 
ownership for our customers.
AVEVA’s heritage is in 3D design, where 
our core products are AVEVA PDMS 
(Plant Design Management System), 
AVEVA E3D and AVEVA Marine 
products. These products represented 
73.5% of 2016/17 revenues. AVEVA E3D 
is the latest generation 3D product 
which carries a price premium 
reflecting its higher productivity and 
advanced feature set.
AVEVA E3D grew strongly during the 
year as existing customers continued 
to migrate towards it and new contracts 
were won. It contributed almost 13% of 
total revenue, up from below 10% in 
the prior year.
Within More than 3D, the largest 
product sets are schematics 
applications such as Piping and 
Instrumentation Diagram (P&ID), 
Instrumentation & Electrical 
applications and our unique multi-
discipline AVEVA Engineering solution; 
together with information 
management applications such as 
AVEVA NET. These areas grew during 
the year with strong growth in 
information management sales 
particularly to the Owner Operators. 18

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S STRATEGIC REVIEW CONTINUED
Our markets and our customers
AVEVA’s key end markets are  
Oil & Gas, Marine, Power and 
Petrochemical & Chemical. Other 
markets we serve include Architecture, 
Construction & Steel Fabrication, 
Mining & Minerals Processing, 
Paper & Pulp and Pharmaceuticals. 
Oil & Gas accounts for 40–45% 
of revenue, Marine 20%, Power 
15–20%, Petrochemical & Chemical 
10% and the remainder 10%.
AVEVA has four main groups 
of customers. These are EPCs, 
shipyards, OOs and Fabricators.
 
EPCs primarily use AVEVA’s software 
to design and build industrial assets, 
such as oil platforms, power stations 
and process plants for OOs. Demand 
from EPCs for AVEVA’s products is 
therefore impacted by end market 
demand and particularly the level of 
capital expenditure on new installations 
and brownfield projects. AVEVA has 
strong long-standing relationships 
with many leading EPCs. The large, 
global EPCs are managed as strategic 
partnerships through AVEVA’s 
Global Accounts programme. 
OOs are key to achieving AVEVA’s vision 
of a constantly-evolving Digital Asset. 
Whereas historically the Digital Asset 
was core only to the design phase 
of physical assets, it is now widely 
accepted that Digital Assets can help 
OOs to drive efficiency and reduce 
risk through minimising downtime 
and unplanned outages, while 
complying with ever more stringent 
environmental and safety legislation.
We won 9 new OO customers 
during the year and significantly 
expanded our business with 
several existing OO customers.
Oil & Gas
In the Oil & Gas industry, end-market 
demand was weak, with global industry 
capital expenditure falling by over 40% 
between calendar 2014 and calendar 
2016 (Sources: Barclays, Bank of 
America Merrill Lynch).
This decline had a significant impact on 
the workloads of our EPC customers, 
with the more complex (and therefore 
design-intensive) greenfield upstream 
and offshore projects being impacted 
most significantly. This impacted 
demand for our software.
EPC customers tend to favour a rental 
model for software, meaning that their 
spend with AVEVA adjusts to market 
demand relatively quickly and some 
EPCs have reduced their seat count 
reflecting lower activity. There was 
also some consolidation amongst 
EPCs and in the oil services sector 
more generally. However, as OOs seek 
to extend the life of existing assets, 
we saw an increase in revamps and 
modifications (known as brownfield 
projects), which helped to sustain a 
level of demand from EPCs, although 
these projects are typically shorter 
in duration and lower in value.
Due to the downturn in the Oil & Gas 
industry, OOs are putting pressure 
on EPCs to reduce the cost of capital 
projects, often by up to 50%. This is 
putting pressure on the margins of the 
EPCs and they have been forced to look 
at how they become more efficient and 
reduce the cost of projects. EPCs are 
also increasingly looking to technology 
to help drive efficiency in projects. 
Our integrated engineering and design 
approach, which helps manage the 
engineering data across the different 
engineering disciplines, is receiving very 
positive feedback, enabling customers 
to reduce the total cost of ownership 
compared to our competition.
An area of focus for EPCs has 
been around reducing the cost 
of supporting, maintaining and 
developing in-house systems by 
looking to third-party vendors such 
as AVEVA to replace these with 
commercial software products.  STRATEGIC REPORT
19
This is particularly pronounced 
around materials procurement and 
construction management, given 
that many still use in-house systems 
in these areas. As such we are seeing 
significant interest in our Enterprise 
Resource Management product.
We are also seeing EPCs start 
to consider standardising their 
engineering technology strategy 
on one toolset and we believe 
that we are well positioned to 
capitalise on that trend.
Oil & Gas industry capital expenditure 
is forecast to increase in future years 
as investments are made to maintain 
production and reserves. There are 
early signs of improvement in the 
market, however the exact timing of a 
market recovery is difficult to predict.
Marine
AVEVA is a market leader in Marine 
design software, with customers 
including 90% of the world’s largest 
shipyards. The Marine market is in a 
cyclical trough, with a relatively low 
number of new ship builds ongoing. 
Shipyard customers typically prefer an 
Initial Licence Fee model, because they 
view software as a longer-term 
investment rather than being project 
specific. This results in annual 
maintenance payments continuing 
even in tougher market conditions.  
Our recurring revenue from the Marine 
market was broadly flat during the year.
We are also winning significant new 
business in the sector, with new wins  
in Europe, including a customer 
focused on cruise ships, and in Asia, 
where we won a major South East 
Asian customer focused on Marine and 
offshore capital projects. 
As with Oil & Gas, the Marine market is 
forecast by commentators such as 
Clarksons Research to recover from the 
current trough conditions. We expect 
activity to increase as overcapacity in 
the world fleet reduces and demand for 
specialist ships such as Floating 
Production, Storage and Offloading 
vessels and naval vessels grows, 
although again, the exact timing of a 
market recovery is difficult to predict.
CASE STUDY
BROADENING 
MARKET EXPOSURE
AVEVA has a high proportion of recurring revenues at  
76.9% in 2016/17 due to our ‘right-to-use’ licensing model. 
Notwithstanding this resilience, some 65% of our revenues 
are generated in the Oil & Gas and Marine markets. To an 
extent therefore, the Group’s growth prospects have 
historically been materially influenced by end market 
conditions within these markets (e.g. the number of oil 
installations and ships being ordered, designed, built and 
operated). Both Oil & Gas and Marine have grown over the 
long term, but have been subject to short-term cyclicality.  
As such, our strategy is to broaden our exposure to other 
industries, which are growing, offering the opportunity to 
achieve market share gains in areas that are less cyclical  
than our core markets. 
Our focus in 2016/17 was on obtaining share gains in  
the Power industry. We achieved great success in this 
endeavour, developing our business with multiple OO 
customers as well as with companies involved in the  
design and production of generation technology.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S STRATEGIC REVIEW CONTINUED
Power
We had significant success in the 
Power market during the year, winning 
several new contracts with both utilities 
and power systems design companies.
Longer-term trends in the Power 
market are positive as the world’s 
emerging economies invest in their 
power generation requirements and the 
ageing infrastructure of the developed 
world is maintained and replaced.
In the shorter term, AVEVA benefited 
from market share gains and 
requirements from operators in the 
sector for both design and information 
management tools, as they seek 
to improve asset efficiency.
Petrochemical & Chemical
We saw ongoing investment in the 
sector during the year, particularly in 
Asia, with stable market conditions on a 
global basis. AVEVA enjoyed success in 
winning new OO customers in Asia 
during the year in the refining sector.
Other markets
Conditions in AVEVA’s other markets 
are less subject to cyclical volatility, 
meaning that AVEVA can grow in a 
more linear fashion through the 
execution of its strategy. Notable 
developments during the year included 
solid constant currency growth in sales 
to fabricators and a new OO customer 
win in the Pharmaceutical sector.
In the Fabrication sector, AVEVA 
provides integrated end-to-end 
solutions for 3D modelling, detailing 
and fabrication of structural steelwork. 
This enables rapid, high-quality 
fabrication and construction for 
on-time, on-budget, integrated project 
execution for customers specialising  
in the engineering, manufacturing  
and assembly of advanced steel 
structures. In 2016/17 our revenue  
from Fabricator customers increased 
10.0% on a constant currency basis.
Outlook
We believe that AVEVA has both 
the market opportunity and the 
right strategy to deliver substantial 
growth over the longer term.
In the short term, demand cycles 
within our end markets have had an 
impact on growth. Our core markets 
of Oil & Gas and Marine, which 
together account for over 60% of 
Group revenue, have been in a cyclical 
trough over the last three years.
There are early signs of improvement 
in Oil & Gas. Although the timing 
of a full recovery in demand is still 
uncertain, we expect that as the 
headwinds lessen, the growth resulting 
from our strategic initiatives will 
begin to show at the Group level.
The Board remains confident in 
the long-term strength of AVEVA’s 
business model, the deliverability 
of its organic growth strategy and 
its positioning to benefit from a 
recovery in our end markets.

KEY PERFORMANCE INDICA TORS
We aim to deliver good sustainable 
growth, balanced by our need to 
continue to invest in innovation, 
sales and marketing in order to 
achieve this. The goal is to deliver 
profitable growth as the business 
expands, whilst maintaining a 
healthy balance sheet. We have set 
out a range of key performance 
indicators (KPIs) that help to present 
a meaningful picture of how AVEVA is 
performing. Taken overall, we believe 
that this range of KPIs – which offers 
insights into our revenue, investment, 
profitability, and cash generation – 
illustrates the high levels of recurring 
revenue, strong margins and ability 
to convert profits to cash effectively 
that are features of our business. 
Our markets continued to be difficult 
over the past year, particularly in 
Oil & Gas, and that is reflected in 
the KPI trends. It is noteworthy that 
our recurring revenue was relatively 
stable, the adjusted profit before 
tax margin increased, and our 
business remains highly profitable.

CTO’S REVIEW
AVEVA’S SUCCESS IS DRIVEN BY THE STRENGTH OF OUR TECHNOLOGIES  
AND PEOPLE TO DELIVER HIGHL Y-DIFFERENTIATED SOLUTIONS FOR THE 
MARKETS WE SERVE. WE CONTINUED TO ENHANCE OUR EXISTING PRODUCTS 
AND TO DEVELOP NEW OFFERINGS DURING THE YEAR THROUGH OUR 
DEVELOPMENT CENTRES, AND CONTINUED TO EXPAND OUR PRESENCE  
IN HYDERABAD TO ACCESS AN EXCELLENT POOL OF TALENT .
Overview
50 years of innovation have produced 
industry-leading software that is used 
by our customers to create Digital 
Assets, that allow them to manage 
continual change as they design, 
build and operate some of the world’s 
most complicated physical assets.
As technology evolves, with ever-
greater processing power, connectivity, 
mobility of computing platforms and 
the Industrial Internet of Things, our 
vision for the widespread adoption 
of constantly-evolving Digital Assets 
is becoming ever more compelling.
We believe that our products offer 
a strong advantage over competing 
offerings. This is due to their inherent 
integration based on our leading 
object-modelling technology, which 
reduces complexity and lowers 
the total cost of ownership for 
our customers. In an increasingly 
connected world, openness to access 
information sources, either third-
party or customer owned, is proving 
business-critical to our customers.
Supporting our strategy
AVEVA’s strategy is to increase 
revenues by growing the addressable 
market as the concept of the Digital 
Asset is more widely adopted, to 
sell a wider range of products, and 
to grow in industry and geographic 
verticals where the Group’s market 
share is underweight versus the 
strength of its product offering.
We are continually developing our 
technology to support this strategy 
and at the same time accommodating 
the needs of customers in what are 
inherently ‘safety first’ industries for 
application and data continuity. 
Our heritage is in 3D design, where 
our core products are AVEVA PDMS, 
AVEVA Everything3D (AVEVA E3D) 
and AVEVA Marine products. AVEVA 
E3D is the latest-generation 3D 
product which carries a price premium 
reflecting its higher productivity 
and advanced feature set.
AVEVA E3D was launched in 2013 
and is being developed further 
each year. We are now seeing real 
traction in customer uptake. Sales 
grew strongly during the year as 
existing customers continued to 
migrate towards it and new contracts 
were won. AVEVA E3D contributed 
almost 13% of total revenue, up from 
just below 10% in the prior year.
More than 3D (MT3D)
Within MT3D, the largest product 
sets are schematics applications 
such as P&ID, Instrumentation and 
Electrical applications and our unique 
multi-discipline AVEVA Engineering 
solution; together with information 
management applications such as 
AVEVA NET and AVEVA Engage.

We have continued our focus on 
developing our MT3D products during 
2016/17 , for example with continuous 
improvements to AVEVA Engage 
and exciting developments around 
our Instrumentation and Electrical 
applications. AVEVA Engage in 
particular started to gain real traction in 
2016/17 . When it was launched in 2015, 
Engage created a new benchmark 
in information accessibility through 
combining ultra-high performance 
visualisation with application-
agnostic access to information via 
large-format touch devices and it 
has now become a feature of many 
of our key new OO customer wins.
SaaS and the Cloud
We launched our first public Cloud 
products AVEVA Connect™ and AVEVA 
NET Connect at the AVEVA World 
Summit in October 2016. AVEVA 
Connect is our SaaS ecosystem for 
Engineering, Design and Information 
Management products. AVEVA NET 
Connect is our new Information 
Management-as-a-Service offering.
AVEVA Connect will deliver new 
opportunities to drive down IT costs, 
improve flexibility to scale software 
usage to meet project demand, and 
increase focus on core business 
activities without compromising 
security or user experience. With 
AVEVA NET Connect, the Digital Asset 
will have the capability to be rapidly 
deployed in the Cloud, allowing  
cross-disciplinary teams to collaborate 
and share information with complete  
clarity on the engineered status  
of the entire project or operating  
asset. This will enable greater  
collaboration between all parties  
in the supply chain, and  
better decision making 
by asset operators.
VIRTUAL REALITY
Some of our graduates  
using our HoloLens-compatible 
software
Further to this, we recently completed 
the development of our SaaS-based 
Information Standards Management 
tools. Throughout our history we 
have partnered with our customers to 
develop new ways in which technology 
can deliver business benefits and 
in this case we are working with 
several major Owner Operators 
as early-adopter customers. Both 
Asset Visualisation and Information 
Standards Management provide 
entry points for our Owner Operator 
customers to access Digital Asset 
Software-as-a-Service solutions 
flexibly and cost effectively.
Looking to the future
We maintain our continued focus  
on delivering innovation, seeking  
to transform how activities are 
undertaken or even by eliminating 
entire steps in business processes. 
Our goal is to enhance efficiency, drive 
down costs and improving quality and 
business agility for our customers.
Over the last decade AVEVA has spent 
nearly £300 million on Research & 
Development and we will continue 
our investments to remain at the 
leading edge of technology. 
While our R&D costs fell by 1.0%  
on a constant currency basis during 
2016/17 , this reflected efficiencies 
achieved through expanding our 
presence in Hyderabad, India and 
reducing costs in other locations. 
Overall capabilities were not reduced.
Our development efforts are focused 
on extending the competitiveness 
of our existing products, developing 
our Cloud platform, enhancing 
our MT3D product suite and on 
developing exciting new technologies 
to support growth in the longer term. 
An interesting example of this is our 
current development work around 
augmented and virtual reality, where 
we are developing the capacity to let 
customers ‘feel’ the experience of 
being inside their models and data.
We will continue to innovate and 
work closely with our customers 
in this coming year and I look 
forward to reporting back to 
you with our progress.

AVEVA GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
David Ward
Chief Financial Officer
AVEVA delivered a solid performance 
in the financial year ended 31 March 
2017. Reported revenue and profit 
showed growth over the previous year 
and cash generation was particularly 
strong. We ended the year with  
£130.9 million in net cash and no debt 
(2016 – £107.9 million). 
Overview of financial progress
Total revenue for the year was 
£215.8 million which was up 7 .1% 
compared to the previous year (2016 
– £201.5 million) and reported profit 
before tax was £46.9 million which was 
up 59.5% compared to the previous 
year (2016 – £29.4 million). On an 
adjusted basis, profit before tax was 
£55.0 million which was an increase 
of 7 .4% (2016 – £51.2 million).
The weakening of Sterling had 
the impact of increasing reported 
revenues and costs by 11.4% and 9.4% 
respectively, reflecting the significant 
overseas operations of the Group. 
On a constant currency basis revenue 
declined 3.8%, although the rate of 
reduction decelerated during the year, 
with the second half being minus 
2.1% on a constant currency basis, or 
broadly flat excluding the impact of 
the difficult market in Latin America.
Revenue
Revenue model
The Group sells its proprietary software 
products by licensing rights to use the 
software directly to customers through 
our network of global sales offices. 
We operate a ‘right-to-use’ licensing 
model. Customers can choose to 
pay Initial Licence Fees, followed by 
lower mandatory Annual Fees to cover 
support, maintenance and upgrades; 
or Rental Licence Fees. The latter are 
usually paid upfront on an annual basis.
Over a long period, it is usually 
cheaper for a customer to adopt the 
Initial Licence Fee model. However, 
many customers, particularly EPCs, 
prefer to view software as a more 
flexible operational expense which 
can be charged to a project, as 
opposed to a capital expense and 
therefore use the rental model.
AVEVA also generates revenue from 
Training and Services. This is typically 
associated with the implementation of 
new installations, customisation to 
meet specific customer requirements 
and end user training. 
Revenue by category
AVEVA generated 14.9% of revenue 
from Initial Licence Fees, 33.3% of 
revenue from Annual Fees, 43.6% of 
revenue from Rental Licence Fees, 
and 8.2% from Training and Services. 
Recurring revenue, which consists of 
Annual Fees and Rental Licence Fees, 
increased by 7 .8% to £166.0 million 
(2016 – £154.0 million), representing 
76.9% of revenue (2016 – 76.4%).

2 Constant currency is calculated by restating the period’s reported results to reflect the previous year’s  
average exchange rates.
Annual fees grew 13.2% to 
£71.8 million (2016 – £63.4 million),  
but were broadly flat in constant 
currency terms. This reflects 
high rates of customer retention, 
new customer wins and a low 
impact from price increases.
Rental Licence Fees also grew in 
reported terms, but there was a  
decline in constant currency terms  
of 4.6%. This reduction was to a large 
part attributable to the continuing 
weak market conditions in Latin 
America, and specifically Brazil, which 
accounted for 2.8% of the decline. 
Outside of Latin America, Rental 
Licence Fees showed reasonable 
resilience in difficult market conditions, 
particularly for customers operating 
in the Oil & Gas sector, although 
some EPC customers did reduce their 
seat count reflecting lower activity.
Initial Licence Fee revenue was £32.2 
million, representing an increase of 
9.5% (2016 – £29.4 million) reflecting 
the impact of currency translation, with 
the constant currency result being a 
decrease of 2.7%. There were a few 
significant wins with Owner Operators 
who chose to buy initial licences. 
Training and Services revenue was 
down by 2.8% to £17 .6 million 
(2016 – £18.1 million) as a result of 
fewer customer implementation 
projects. On a constant currency 
basis, revenue was down 13.8%. 26
AVEVA GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
Cost focus
AVEVA has a largely fixed cost base, 
albeit with some annual inflation 
embedded within it. We exercised 
strong cost control during the 
financial year in the context of the 
difficult end market conditions. We 
have, however, maintained adequate 
levels of investment in R&D and sales 
capabilities to ensure that we can 
execute our strategy and grow sales 
over the medium and long term.
Overall, in constant currency terms, 
operating costs were 0.9% lower than 
the previous year with the effect of 
cost management actions more than 
compensating for inflationary pressures 
and planned areas of investment.
We continue to have a focused and 
disciplined approach to managing 
the cost base. During the year we 
undertook some restructuring 
activity, which included headcount 
reductions in Latin America and 
corporate management.

caused a further decline in revenues 
in that region. AVEVA’s performance 
in EMEA and Asia Pacific was robust 
in the context of the subdued Oil 
& Gas and Marine markets.
Reported revenue was impacted by a 
£22.0 million (11.4%) benefit related 
to foreign exchange translation. 
Around 20% of the Group’s revenues 
were in each of Sterling and Euros 
and the US dollar was the next most 
material currency at around 15%.
Asia Pacific
Revenue from the Asia Pacific region 
was £76.3 million (2016 – £71.6 million) 
and increased 6.6% over the prior year 
but declined 6.4% in constant currency 
terms. More specifically, we saw strong 
performance in Japan with a few 
significant new wins, but marginally 
weaker performance in South Korea 
and India, in the face of a tough market 
for Marine. Our businesses in China 
and South East Asia were broadly flat 
when compared to the prior year.
EMEA
In EMEA revenue grew 4.9% to 
£106.6 million (2016 – £101.6 million).  
Market conditions in EMEA have  
been reasonably stable, but remain 
challenging for customers with heavy 
exposure to Oil & Gas. However, we 
saw real growth in Germany and 
Finland where we won business in 
Paper & Pulp and revenue from  
Central and Southern Europe was 
higher in reported terms but 
performance in constant currency 
terms was slightly down on the prior 
year. Our businesses in Russia and the 
Middle East performed broadly in line 
with last year.
Training and Services revenue 
declined from the prior year as 
a number of implementation 
projects were completed.
Americas
In the Americas revenue grew 16.3% to 
£32.9 million (2016 – £28.3 million) with 
a very strong performance in North 
America being partly offset by ongoing 
weakness in Latin America, where 
revenues have now declined to a level 
that is no longer material to the Group. 
Our performance in North America 
was very pleasing with revenue in 
the USA increasing 18.9% in constant 
currency terms, following the 
aforementioned customer wins with 
Southern Company, TerraPower and a 
very large global industrial company.
Market conditions in Brazil remained 
very tough through 2016/17 and our 
revenues from Latin America more 
than halved over the prior year, on both 
a reported and constant currency basis. 
We took action during the second 
half of the year to right-size our team 
there for the reduced market size. STRATEGIC REPORT
27
Normalised items include amortisation 
of intangibles (excluding other 
software) of £5.8 million (2016 – £5.6 
million), share-based payments of  
£1.1 million (2016 – £0.5 million),  
gains on fair value of forward foreign  
exchange contracts of £0.7 million 
(2016 – loss of £0.4 million) and  
exceptional items of £3.6 million 
(2016 – £15.2 million).
Research & Development costs were 
broadly flat on a normalised constant 
currency basis reflecting a few 
strategic investments and efficiencies 
achieved through expanding our 
presence in Hyderabad, India and 
reducing costs in other locations. 
Overall our average R&D headcount 
through the year increased by 12%. 
Selling and distribution expenses 
include the costs of our direct sales 
force as well as our regionally based 
technical support and marketing teams 
and in total were £89.2 million in the 
year 2016/17 . The cost of these teams 
decreased by 3.1% on a constant 
currency basis principally due to a lower 
bad debt charge than in the prior year 
of £0.6 million (2016 – £3.4 million).
Administrative expenses increased 
6.0% (or £1.6 million) on a constant 
currency basis, with the increase 
due to some minor investments in 
the HR team and a small increase 
in the cost of staff bonuses.
Exceptional items
During the year, the Group incurred 
exceptional costs of £1.9 million 
(2016 – £15.2 million). These included 
restructuring costs of £4.2 million, 
which were partly offset by factors 
including an indemnified receivable 
claim relating to a previous business 
combination. The restructuring costs 
related to the rationalisation of offices 
and reduction in headcount in specific 
areas of the business. Also included 
are the redundancy costs incurred in 
eliminating the Regional Operations 
layer of management as part of the 
initiative to structure the business 
with clearer lines of accountability.
Prior year exceptional items 
included professional fees of £10.5 
million, principally for legal and 
financial due diligence services 
related to the aborted Schneider 
Electric transaction and exceptional 
restructuring costs of £4.5 million.
Profit before tax
Adjusted profit before tax was 
£55.0 million (2016 – £51.2 million), 
an increase of 7 .4%, principally 
caused by the growth in revenue. 
This resulted in an adjusted profit 
margin of 25.5% (2016 – 25.4%).
Reported profit before tax was £46.9 
million (2016 – £29.4 million). The 
growth of 59.5% was principally due 
to growth in revenue and reduction in 
exceptional items as described above.
Taxation
The Group’s effective tax rate, on an 
adjusted basis, has steadily declined 
over recent years in line with the 
reductions seen in UK corporation 
tax. The adjusted effective tax rate 
for the 2016/17 financial year was 
22.1%, which represented a further 
reduction from 2016 when the 
rate was 22.5%. We see this trend 
continuing as the UK corporate 
rate reduces and we increasingly 
benefit from Patent Box relief.
The headline, or unadjusted, 
effective rate for the year was 18.8% 
(2016 – 30.4%). The prior year rate 
was impacted by non-deductible 
acquisition-related exceptional 
costs of £10.5 million (see above). 
Dividends
With consistent and strong cash flows 
and no net debt, the Group retains 
considerable financial flexibility. The 
Board remains focused on delivering 
growth both organically and through 
acquisitions. Our strong cash flows 
underpin the Board’s sustainable, 
progressive dividend policy, which 
is balanced against keeping cash 
available for M&A opportunities, 
with excess capital being returned 
to shareholders from time to time.
The Board is proposing a final 
dividend of 27 .0 pence per share, 
taking the total dividend for the year 
to 40.0 pence (2016 – 36.0 pence 
per share), an increase of 11.1%. 
The dividend will be payable on 
4 August 2017 , to shareholders 
on the register on 7 July 2017 . 
As announced previously, we have 
rebalanced the interim and final 
dividends, with more of the total 
dividend being paid at the interim.  
As a result, the final dividend 
proposed for 2016/17 of 27 .0 
pence is slightly lower than the 
final dividend paid in respect of 
2015/16 (30.0 pence per share).

Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share was 
59.52 pence and increased 85.8% 
(2016 – 32.03 pence) and diluted 
earnings per share were 59.36 
pence (2016 – 31.96 pence). 
On an adjusted basis, EPS increased 
8.0% to 66.98 pence (2016 – 62.04 
pence) and to 66.81 pence on a 
diluted basis (2016 – 61.91 pence).
Balance sheet and cash flows
AVEVA continues to maintain a 
strong balance sheet and has no 
debt. Net assets at 31 March 2017 
were £220.7 million compared to 
£201.0 million at 31 March 2016. 
Non-current assets increased 
marginally to £89.9 million (2016 – 
£87 .5 million) principally due to foreign 
currency translation effects. During the 
year we purchased intangible software 
rights for a total of £2.3 million, 
which provided valuable additional 
functionality for our products.
Working capital
Gross trade receivables at 31 March 
2017 were £91.1 million which was 
broadly in line with last year (2016 – 
£94.5 million). We again saw a strong 
finish to the year with a large number of 
our Global Account renewals occurring 
in the final quarter. This resulted 
in billings being more weighted 
towards the end of the period, 
although Q4 cash collections were 
marginally stronger than in 2015/16.
The bad debt provision at 31 March 
2017 of £6.1 million was similar 
in scale to the level held at the 
previous year end of £5.9 million.
Deferred income remained stable at 
31 March 2017 and was £45.9 million 
compared to £46.9 million at  
31 March 2016. Trade and other 
payables were higher than the  
prior year at £42.9 million 
(2016 – £37 .2 million).
Cash generation
Net cash (including treasury 
deposits) at 31 March 2017 was 
£130.9 million compared to £107 .9 
million at 31 March 2016.
Cash generated from operating 
activities before tax was £57 .2 million 
(2016 – £36.1 million), with large 
parts of this improvement being due 
to the increased profit recorded in 
2016/17 and the high exceptional 
costs incurred and paid in 2015/16.
Pensions
On an accounting basis, the Group’s 
net retirement benefit obligations 
decreased from £5.2 million last year to 
£2.6 million. This was principally 
caused by the valuation of the UK 
defined benefit pension scheme 
moving from a deficit of £2.3 million 
to a surplus of £1.2 million driven 
by employer contributions of £1.6 
million and strong asset returns over 
the period. Since March 2015, the 
UK defined benefit pension scheme 
has been closed to future accrual. 
Capital structure
At 31 March 2017 , the Group had 
63,975,869 shares of 3 5/9p each 
in issue (2016 – 63,961,113 shares). 
During the year the AVEVA Group 
Employee Benefit Trust 2008 (‘the 
Trust’) purchased 2,160 ordinary shares 
in the Company in the open market at 
an average price of £18.68 per share 
for total consideration of £40,349 in 
order to satisfy awards made under 
the AVEVA Group Management Bonus 
Deferred Share Scheme 2008. At  
31 March 2017 , the Trust owned 10,857 
ordinary shares in the Company. 
13,380 shares (2016 – 26,791) with an 
attributable cost of £296,431 were 
issued to employees in satisfying 
share options that were exercised.
Treasury policy
The Group treasury policy aims 
to ensure that the capital held is 
not put at risk and the treasury 
function is managed under policies 
and procedures approved by the 
Board. These policies are designed 
to reduce the financial risk arising 
from the Group’s normal trading 
activities, which primarily relate to 
credit, interest, liquidity and currency 
risk. The Group is, and expects to 
continue to be, cash positive and 
at 31 March 2017 held net cash of 
£130.9 million. The treasury policy 
includes strict counterparty limits.

PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERT AINTIES
AVEVA FACES A NUMBER OF POTENTIAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES  
WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE GROUP’S LONG- TERM 
PERFORMANCE. THE BOARD IS RESPONSIBLE FOR DETERMINING THE  
NATURE OF THESE RISKS AND ENSURING APPROPRIATE MITIGATING  
ACTIONS ARE IN PLACE TO MANAGE THEM EFFECTIVEL Y .
Risk management process
The Board retains ultimate 
responsibility for the Group’s risk 
management and as part of this, 
regularly completes a review of 
the Group Risk Register and an 
assessment of the adequacy of the 
mitigating controls identified by 
management. To aid this process a 
Risk Committee comprising senior 
management from each function of 
the business was formed in 2015/16. 
The Risk Committee is chaired by 
the CFO and reports jointly to the 
Board and the Executive team.
The Risk Committee meets at least 
twice a year and has responsibility 
for considering risk appetite, risk 
identification, risk quantification/
qualification and the determination 
of mitigating internal controls. The 
Risk Committee is not responsible 
for internal audit activities which 
remain under the responsibility of 
the Audit Committee. More details 
of AVEVA’s assessment of internal 
controls is included within the Audit 
Committee report on pages 44 to 
46 of the Corporate Governance 
section of the Directors’ report.
The Risk Register was compiled 
after considering three main risk 
characteristics – likelihood, size of 
impact and timeframe for when the 
risk may impact the Group. Likelihood 
was assessed on a net risk basis (i.e. 
after the operation of internal controls) 
as the Risk Committee considered this 
gave a more robust view of the risks 
currently faced by AVEVA. Separately, 
the Audit Committee has responsibility 
for determining the appropriate level of 
review required to ensure that internal 
controls are operating as designed.
This year we have continued to 
improve our risk management 
process, by drafting departmental risk 
registers to supplement the Group 
Risk Register. Next year we intend 
that the highest risks from each 
departmental register are considered 
for inclusion on the Group Risk Register. 
The updated Group Risk Register was 
ultimately reviewed and approved 
by the Board and in the context 
of the assessment of viability the 
Board considered which risks, and 
combination of risks, would threaten 
the viability of the Company. 
The principal risks faced by the Group 
are set out on pages 30 to 31, and 
include indicators of the financial 
impact, likelihood and whether the 
risk has increased or decreased in 
significance since the last review.
Viability Statement
In accordance with the revised UK 
Corporate Governance Code, the 
Directors have assessed the Group’s 
prospects and viability over a period 
significantly longer than the outlook 
of the going concern statement 
of 12 months. The Directors have 
determined that the appropriate 
period is three years, corresponding 
with the period covered by the 
Group’s business planning cycle. 
The Directors considered the principal 
risks in plausible but severe scenarios 
and assessed the potential impact 
of a decline in the Group’s revenue 
caused by a period of sustained low 
economic growth resulting in low 
levels of capital investment and this 
was combined with an unfavourable 
foreign exchange assumption. 
Based on this assessment, the 
Directors have considered the Group’s 
current position and principal risks, 
and have a reasonable expectation 
that the Group will be able to continue 
in operation and meet its liabilities as 
they fall due over a three-year period.
In making this statement, the 
Directors have also made the 
following assumptions:
• oil prices will stay relatively flat  
for the next three years
• Brexit will not unduly affect current 
trading or existing customer 
contracts or relationships
• our internal controls in mitigation  
of a significant proportion of the 
risks on the register continue to 
operate effectively.
Going concern statement
The Group has significant financial 
resources, is profitable, has high levels 
of recurring revenue and has a strong 
position in the markets it serves. At 
31 March 2017 , the Group had cash 
and treasury deposit balances of 
£130.9 million (2016 – £107 .9 million) 
and no debt. Therefore, after making 
enquiries and considering the cash flow 
forecasts for the Group, the Directors 
have a reasonable expectation that 
the Group has adequate resources 
to continue in operational existence 
for the foreseeable future. For this 
reason they continue to adopt the 
going concern basis of accounting in 
preparing the financial statements.  30

Risk Likelihood Impact Change Mitigation Strategy
Dependency on key markets
AVEVA generates a substantial amount of its income from 
customers whose main business is derived from capital projects 
in the Oil & Gas, Power and Marine markets. Currently, some 
of AVEVA’s vertical end markets are under pressure with lower 
oil prices and inevitably this is having an impact on the Group’s 
revenues. As the availability of capital expenditure returns to our 
key markets, particularly Oil & Gas, the balance may shift away from 
our traditional core sector of complex off-shore projects, towards 
simpler on-shore projects, such as shale gas extraction. The risk of 
this further reinforces our need for market diversification.
 
AVEVA is expanding into other market 
segments such as Power, Petrochemical 
& Chemical and Construction, albeit 
from a relatively small base. It is central 
to our strategy to diversify our customer 
offerings into Owner Operators and Plant 
operations. This will help secure a longer-
term income stream that extends beyond 
the design/build phase of these capital 
projects. In addition, our extensive global 
presence provides some mitigation from 
over-reliance on key geographic markets.

Competition
AVEVA operates in highly competitive markets that serve the Oil 
& Gas, Power and Marine markets. Our 3D design tools are well 
established in our markets and we believe that there are a relatively 
small number of significant competitors. However, some of these 
competitors could, in the future, pose a greater competitive threat 
to AVEVA’s revenues, particularly if they consolidate or form 
strategic or commercial relationships among themselves or with 
larger, well capitalised companies. 
Further threats are posed by the entrance, into AVEVA’s markets, 
of a much larger technology competitor or transformational 
technology, such as Cloud-based solutions.
The Group’s strategy to extend the Digital Asset footprint is key to 
ensuring that our customer penetration is broad and that AVEVA’s 
sources of revenue are diversified.
  
We carefully monitor customers and 
other suppliers operating within our 
chosen markets. We stay close to our 
customers and ensure we have a strong 
understanding of their needs and their 
expectations from the AVEVA product 
development roadmap.
We expect that the customers we serve 
will, over the next 3 to 5 years, show an 
increased appetite or insistence on their 
software needs being delivered with more 
flexibility. AVEVA is already well progressed 
with its Cloud strategy and expects to be 
able to meet these customer demands as 
they develop.

Professional Services
Where AVEVA assists customers with the deployment of an 
enterprise solution, this involves some degree of consulting and/
or implementation work. This requires specialist knowledge to 
be available and well managed, potentially in many geographic 
locations. There is a risk that the services provided do not  
meet the customer’s expectations or that technical difficulties  
are encountered. 
In some instances we may opt to partner with a third party for this 
work and this relationship also requires careful management and 
maintenance to ensure that AVEVA’s strong reputation with our 
customers is not damaged. 
  
We employ experienced industry 
professionals within our professional 
services team and continue to build 
commercial partnerships with third party 
systems integrators.
We have rigorous processes and controls 
for the appraisal of potential commercial 
opportunities prior to any bid being 
submitted. Bids are appraised on grounds 
of technical complexity as well as financial 
and commercial risk.

5
Acquisitions
An acquisition by AVEVA or of AVEVA could pose a significant 
distraction to management and to the delivery of our business plan.
The Group expects to continue to review acquisition targets as part 
of its strategy. The integration of acquisitions involves a number 
of unique risks, including diversion of management’s attention, 
failure to retain key personnel of the acquired business, failure to 
realise the benefits anticipated to result from the acquisition, and 
successful integration of the acquired intellectual property.
  
While each acquisition and integration is 
unique, AVEVA now has an experienced 
team to appraise and complete 
acquisitions. The Group’s experience of 
previous ‘bolt-on’ acquisitions as well as 
the aborted transaction with Schneider 
Electric provides a good understanding of 
potential transaction and integration risks.

FINANCIAL RISKS
Risk Likelihood Impact Change Mitigation Strategy
Foreign exchange risk
Exposure to foreign currency gains and losses can be material 
to the Group, with more than 80% of the Group’s revenue 
denominated in a currency other than Sterling, of which our two 
largest are US Dollar and Euro. 
The result of the UK referendum on European Union membership 
has led to significant weakening of the British Pound, and the 
volatility is likely to continue until further certainty is reached 
over exit negotiations. 
  
The overseas subsidiaries predominantly 
trade in their own local currencies, which acts 
as a partial natural hedge against currency 
movements. In addition, the Group enters 
into forward foreign currency contracts to 
manage the risk where material and practical. 
The Group limits its hedging of revenue to US 
Dollar, Euro and Japanese Yen, and its hedging 
of costs to Swedish Krona and Indian Rupee.

Risk Likelihood Impact Change Mitigation Strategy
Recruitment and retention of employees
AVEVA’s success has been built on the quality and reputation 
of its products and services, which rely almost entirely on the 
quality of the people developing and delivering them. Managing 
this pool of highly skilled and motivated individuals across all 
disciplines and geographies remains key to our ongoing success. 
  
The Group endeavours to ensure that 
employees are motivated in their work 
and there are regular appraisals, with staff 
encouraged to develop their skills. Annually 
there is a Group-wide salary review that 
rewards strong performance and ensures 
salaries remain competitive. Commission and 
bonus schemes help to ensure the success 
of the Group and individual achievement is 
appropriately rewarded.

Protection of intellectual property
The Group’s success has been built upon the development of its 
substantial intellectual property rights and the future growth of 
the business requires the continual protection of these tools. 
The protection of the Group’s proprietary software products is 
achieved by licensing rights to use the application, rather than 
selling or licensing the computer source code.
  
The Group uses third party technology to 
encrypt, protect and restrict access to its 
products. Access limitations and rights are 
also defined within the terms of the software 
licence agreement. 
The Group seeks to ensure that its intellectual 
property rights are appropriately protected 
by law and seeks to vigorously assert its 
proprietary rights wherever possible.

Research & Development
The Group makes substantial investments in Research & 
Development in enhancing existing products and introducing 
new products and must effectively appraise its investment 
decisions and ensure that we continue to provide class-leading 
solutions that meet the needs of our markets. 
Our software products are complex and new products or 
enhancements may contain undetected errors, failures, 
performance problems or defects which may impact our strong 
reputation with our customers.
  
AVEVA continually reviews the alignment of 
the activities of our Research & Development 
teams to ensure that they remain focused 
on areas that will meet the demands of 
our customers and deliver appropriate 
financial returns. This process is managed by 
developing a product roadmap that identifies 
the schedule for new products and the 
enhancements that will be made to successive 
versions of existing products. Products are 
extensively tested prior to commercial launch.

International operations
The Group operates in over 30 countries globally and must 
determine how best to utilise its resources across these diverse 
markets. Where necessary, the business must adapt its market 
approach to best capitalise on local market opportunities, 
particularly in the strategically key growth economies.
In addition, the Group is required to comply with the local  
laws, regulations and tax legislation in each of these  
jurisdictions. Significant changes in these laws and regulations  
or failure to comply with them could lead to additional  
liabilities and penalties. 
  
The Group manages its overseas operations 
by employing locally qualified personnel 
who are able to provide expertise in the 
appropriate language and an understanding 
of local culture, custom and practice. 
Local management is supported by local 
professional advisers and further oversight is 
maintained from the Group’s corporate legal, 
financial and internal audit functions.

OPERATIONAL RISKS 32
AVEVA GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
Internal Stakeholders
AVEVA is a diverse organisation with 
employees in over 30 countries and 
from many different cultures. 
As of 31 March 2017 , we have a 
headcount of 1,707 (2016 – 1,706),  
and our male/female ratio is  
75% / 25% (2016 – 75% / 25%). 
Keeping employees informed of 
business priorities and changes 
remains a primary focus within 
AVEVA. As a global organisation, it is 
important that everyone feels part of 
AVEVA and that we share information 
across all teams and regions. This 
is achieved through regular internal 
communication initiatives, such 
as people stories, successes and 
competitions, with the aims to be 
inclusive and to celebrate our diversity.
Engagement levels remain high and 
we use feedback from our Global 
Ambassador Network to improve and 
develop information that both informs 
and motivates our employees. 
Our Global Ambassador Network 
continues to provide a channel for our 
employees to provide feedback to the 
senior management team, and helps us 
to gain cultural insights from the areas 
in which our employees are based.
To help our largest regions stay 
informed on both corporate and 
regionally-focussed news, we operate 
editorial teams to manage the 
network’s regional communications. 
These updates receive excellent 
readership rates and feedback has 
shown they are a great tool to support 
our employees in their roles.
External Stakeholders
Transparency and disclosure are 
fundamental to our relationships with 
customers, partners and suppliers. 
We maintain open, honest and 
fair discussions with each of our 
stakeholders to reinforce our reputation 
as a trusted and ethical organisation.
To protect the interest of our 
customers, our expanded Anti-Piracy 
and Compliance team monitors the 
illegal use of AVEVA software and 
enforces compliance within our terms 
and conditions. AVEVA continues to 
invest in both people and technology to 
ensure compliant use of its technology. 
Whilst illegal use of our software is an 
ongoing challenge, AVEVA is becoming 
much more successful in the detection 
of such cases and the subsequent 
enforcement of licence terms.
To embed and reinforce our 
corporate policy against the 
acceptance or payment of bribes, 
we continue to enhance and 
improve our eLearning tools.
Each year, every employee completes 
the Global Corporate Governance 
and Group IT Compliance training 
to ensure that we maintain our 
high ethical standards. We review 
monthly operational challenges 
in the key regional hubs to 
ensure local governance.
Employee Engagement
Employee feedback is a priority 
at AVEVA, and we are constantly 
seeking ways to improve the way our 
employees provide feedback to both 
managers and our Executive team.
In April 2017 , we introduced a new 
micro survey tool designed to 
frequently seek employee feedback 
and opinions on key topics. Whilst 
retaining our traditional full bi-annual 
survey, this tool will be a way of gaining 
supplementary employee insights on a 
regular basis. Due to the nature of the 
tool, managers will have instant access 
to results, and can quickly plan actions, 
changes or interventions as necessary.
We have also increased the accessibility 
and visibility of the Executive team 
through global roadshows and 
briefings for all employees. Focussed 
on specific business updates, these 
sessions are an informal way for 
the Executive team to meet and 
discuss key updates, and to answer 
any questions employees may have. 
Between April and June 2016, there 
were 18 meet-and-greet sessions 
held in various global locations, 
reaching nearly 75% of employees.

top 100 Apprentice Employer list.
It is also crucial we attract students 
from Science, Technology, Engineering 
and Mathematics (STEM) subjects as 
early as possible both through our 
work experience and membership 
of specific science and engineering 
groups, including the BCS and the 
Engineering Development Trust. AVEVA 
was also present at the Big Bang Fair, 
where over 100,000 attendees came 
to hear more about careers within 
our core industries and we have 
sponsored a number of innovation 
awards to inspire the next generation 
of talent to continue their projects.
AVEVA is also an active member, 
with our CEO as Executive signatory, 
of the WISE (Women in Science and 
Engineering) Ten Steps campaign. This 
membership will enable us to become 
widely recognised as a company 
supporting diversity and inclusion, 
fairness and equality and inspiring 
women into technical and senior roles.
Our well-established learning and 
development programmes continue 
to provide a range of opportunities 
for our employees. This includes 
online language studies, technical 
development and management & 
leadership programmes. We also 
have compliance e-learning in place 
which is monitored regularly.
Last year we saw:
• 5,000 hours of online technical 
training (PluralSight) completed
• 4,688 hours of classroom training
• 33 colleagues completing 
management development
• 42 graduates and 12 apprentices 
start their careers with AVEVA
• An increased uptake of coaching 
opportunities for managers at all 
levels, including the Executive team.
AVEVA in the Community
2016/17 has been a very active year 
for Corporate Social Responsibility 
at AVEVA, with colleagues from 
across the globe taking time out to 
support a variety of local, national 
and international causes.
At AVEVA we encourage and celebrate 
our employees’ charitable efforts,  
and share exceptional activities  
carried out via our corporate intranet. 
We operate a programme of matched 
funding, and in addition, during the 
year we donated £45,000 to local and 
national charitable causes. In January 
2017 , we were also honoured to be 
included in the FTSE4Good index, in 
recognition of our efforts to operate in 
an ethically responsible manner.
There have been so many highlights 
this past year but one that particularly 
demonstrates our colleagues’ 
enthusiasm for supporting the local 
communities we operate in came 
from our team in Hyderabad.
In October 2016, the Hyderabad office 
came together to support a local 
school, and the generosity behind 
their actions was truly remarkable. As 
well as organising a very successful 
clothes drive, additional items 
were purchased by the team for 
donation, such as brightly-coloured 
hair clips, remembering how much 
they had loved them as a child.
A member of the team also 
approached a local street seller they 
had frequently passed on their way to 
work and arranged for him to come to 
the school with a variety of different 
items so the children could be given 
something that fitted them. Nearly 
50 new dresses were purchased that 
day which will have made a huge 
boost to the street seller’s income.
There was also a more serious 
side to the visit, with the team 
spending some time teaching 
the children about hygiene, and 
joining in on a maths lesson. 34

Carbon Emissions
AVEVA is committed to minimising 
its carbon emissions, increasing 
the use of recycling opportunities 
and reducing the use of valuable 
natural resources. We are continually 
improving the way in which we capture 
and record our emissions data. 
For the purposes of this report, the 
emissions have been calculated 
according to the ‘Environmental 
Reporting Guidelines: Including 
mandatory greenhouse gas emissions 
reporting guidance’ issued by the 
Department for Environment, Food 
and Rural Affairs (DEFRA), and by 
applying DEFRA’s conversion factors. 
We have aimed for the Greenhouse 
Gas (GHG) emissions to be captured 
for all of our UK and overseas offices 
between April 2016 and March 2017 .

CORPORA TE GOVERNANCE
I am pleased to introduce the 2017 
Corporate Governance statement. 
This year has seen considerable 
changes in the composition of the 
Board. The Nominations Committee 
has been extensively involved in 
the nomination, selection and 
appointment of the Executive 
Directors and Non-Executive 
Directors made during the year. 
We are grateful for the tremendous 
achievements for AVEVA made by the 
resigning Directors. 
The Company is committed to the 
principles of Corporate Governance 
contained in the UK Corporate 
Governance Code provided by the 
Financial Reporting Council and 
for which the Board is accountable 
to shareholders. The Company 
has complied with the provisions 
of the April 2016 UK Corporate 
Governance Code throughout the 
financial year ending 31 March 2017 . 
Further explanation of how the 
principles have been applied is set  
out below and, in connection with 
Directors’ remuneration, in the 
Remuneration Committee report  
on pages 47 to 66.
Composition of the Board
The usual composition of the Board  
is the Chairman, three independent  
Non-Executive Directors and two  
Executive Directors. Our Senior 
Independent Director is Philip Dayer.  
In the course of the year ending  
31 March 2017 , and as announced  
by the Company at appropriate times, 
the Board has undergone several 
significant, planned changes to refresh 
and strengthen the Board, including  
the appointment of a new Chief 
Executive, a new Chief Financial  
Officer and two new independent 
Non-Executive Directors, with several 
of them having handover periods to 
transition into their new roles (see 
more in the Nominations Committee 
report provided on page 41). 
Brief biographical details of all  
Board members are set out on 
pages 42 and 43. The chairmanship 
and membership of all Board 
Committees is set out on page 38.
Board changes
The Nominations Committee has 
responsibility for Board and Committee 
composition, particularly in relation 
to the diversity of background, skills 
and experience. The Committee 
oversees the nomination, selection 
and appointment of Non-Executive 
and Executive Directors and monitors 
succession planning for Board 
and senior management roles. 
Details of the Board changes 
and the work of the Committee 
undertaken this year can be 
found set out in the Nominations 
Committee report on page 41.
Operation of the Board
The Chairman, supported by the 
Company Secretary, ensures that 
the Board functions effectively 
and has established Board 
processes designed to maximise its 
performance and effectiveness.

GROUP STRUCTURE MARCH 2017
Key aspects of these processes are:
• The AVEVA Group Board meets 
regularly in combination with the 
Board of AVEVA Solutions Limited, 
the main operating company in the 
Group which owns all of the Group’s 
trading subsidiaries. The AVEVA 
Solutions Limited Board includes as 
a member the Deputy CEO and 
Chief Technical Officer, as well as all 
the members of the Group Board. 
This ensures that the AVEVA Group 
Board is well informed on technical 
and market factors driving the 
Group’s performance as well as on 
financial outcomes.
• The Board had eight scheduled 
meetings during the year. These 
meetings, together with any 
Committee meetings, are generally 
held at the Group’s Head Office in 
Cambridge or in our London office 
and are approximately one day in 
duration.
• Each scheduled Board meeting has 
an over-arching theme. These 
include an annual technology review, 
business plan/strategy day, 
succession planning, annual budget, 
presentations from Executive 
management, and interim and final 
results. The Board aims that 
Directors visit an AVEVA office or 
business event outside of the UK at 
least once per year. The Executive 
Directors visit non-UK AVEVA offices 
on a regular basis. This year two of 
the Non-Executive Directors 
attended the AVEVA World Summit 
in October 2016, meeting with staff 
and customers throughout the 
event. The Chairman visited the 
Hyderabad offices in October 2016 
and one Non-Executive Director 
travelled to Russia to meet with 
management and staff there as part 
of a review of operations.  AVEVA GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
38
• In addition, the Board holds a 
full-day strategy meeting every year 
at which Executive Directors and 
members of the senior management 
team make presentations covering 
progress against current strategy 
and objectives and ideas for future 
investment. 
• The Board delegates the day-to-day 
responsibility for managing the 
Group to the Executive Directors. 
• To enable the Board to discharge its 
duties, all Directors receive 
appropriate and timely information. 
Briefing papers are distributed by the 
Company Secretary to all Directors, 
usually four working days in advance 
of Board and Committee meetings.
• A monthly reporting pack containing 
management accounts with 
commentary and reports from each 
Executive Director is distributed to 
the Board on a monthly basis.
• Meetings were held between the 
Chairman and the Non-Executive 
Directors during the year, without 
the Executives being present, to 
discuss appropriate matters as 
necessary. 
• The Chairman ensures that the 
Directors take independent 
professional advice where they 
judge it necessary to discharge their 
responsibilities as Directors at the 
Group’s expense. All members of the 
Board have access to the advice of 
the Company Secretary. 
• Non-Executive Directors and 
Executive Directors are encouraged 
annually to undertake training in 
furtherance of their specific roles 
and general duties as a Director.

Matters reserved for the Board
The Board is responsible to 
shareholders for the proper 
management of the Group. There 
is a formal schedule of matters 
specifically reserved for the Board’s 
decision that covers key areas of 
the Group’s affairs, which include:
• overall responsibility for the strategy 
of the Group; 
• corporate governance;
• review of trading performance and 
forecasts;
• risk management;
• Board membership; 
• communications with shareholders;
• approval of major transactions, 
including mergers and  
acquisitions; and 
• approval of the financial statements 
and annual operating and capital 
expenditure budgets.
Independence of Non-Executive 
Directors and segregation of duties
The Board has considered the 
independence of the Non-Executive 
Directors and believes that all are 
currently independent of management 
and free from any material business 
or other relationships that could 
materially interfere with the exercise 
of their independent judgement. 
Their biographies on pages 42 and 43 
demonstrate a range of experience and 
sufficient calibre to bring independent 
judgement on issues of strategy, 
performance, resources and standards 
of conduct which are vital to the Group.
The roles of the Chairman and the 
Chief Executive are distinct and the 
division of responsibility between these 
roles has been clearly established, set 
out in writing and agreed by the Board. 
The Chairman is responsible for the 
effectiveness of the Board and ensuring 
that it meets its obligations and 
responsibilities. The Chief Executive is 
responsible to the Board for the day-
to-day management of the business, 
leadership of the Executive team and 
execution of the Group’s strategic 
and operating plans. The Chairman 
and Chief Executive meet regularly 
to discuss any issues pertaining 
to the Company’s performance, 
reputation and organisation.
 
Committees of the Board
The Board has three committees: 
Audit, Remuneration and Nominations. 
In accordance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code, the duties of the 
Committees are set out in formal terms 
of reference. They are available on 
request from the Company’s registered 
office during normal business hours 
and are available on the Company’s 
website at www.aveva.com. 
Details of the main responsibilities 
and activities during the year of the 
Nominations Committee are included 
on page 41, the Audit Committee on 
pages 44 to 46 and the Remuneration 
Committee on pages 47 to 66.
Performance evaluation
The Board undertakes a formal and 
rigorous review of its performance 
and that of its Committees and 
Directors each financial year. In 2014, 
an extensive review was externally 
facilitated by Armstrong Bonham 
Carter LLP , the independent board 
performance consultants. The most 
recent review was carried out in 
October 2016, led by the Chairman 
and conducted following one-on-
one interviews with each Director. GOVERNANCE REPORT
39
Overall, the review concluded that 
the Board and its Committees had 
demonstrated a high degree of 
effectiveness. The Board is considered 
to be of the right size and having 
appropriate skills representation. 
The October 2016 review identified 
five priorities in the form of broader 
discussion at Board level of risk 
management and succession 
planning, a greater development of 
the annual strategy day, formalisation 
of the internal audit function, the 
appointment of a Non-Executive 
Director with software development 
and/or end market experience and 
an increase in senior management 
presentations to the Board. Each 
of these areas of development has 
been incorporated into the Board’s 
schedule for the next year and 
into objectives for the Executive 
Directors or Board Committees.
Internal control and risk management
The Board has overall responsibility for 
the Group’s system of internal control 
and for monitoring its effectiveness. 
However, such a system is designed 
to manage rather than eliminate 
the risk of failure and by its very 
nature can only provide reasonable 
and not absolute assurance against 
material misstatement or loss. The 
principal risks and uncertainties the 
Group faces are set out on pages 
30 and 31. There were no significant 
control failures during the year.
The Board has established a 
continuous process for identifying, 
evaluating and managing the significant 
risks the Group faces. The Board 
regularly reviews the effectiveness of 
the Group’s internal controls, which 
have been in place from the start 
of the year to the date of approval 
of this report, and believes that it is 
in accordance with the September 
2014 Financial Reporting Council 
Guidance on Risk Management, 
Internal Control and Related 
Financial and Business Reporting.
The key elements of the system of 
internal controls currently include:
• each member of the Executive team 
has responsibility for specific aspects 
of the Group’s operations. They 
meet on a regular basis and are 
responsible for the operational 
strategy, reviewing operating results, 
identification and mitigation of risks 
and communication and application 
of the Group’s policies and 
procedures. Where appropriate, 
matters are reported to the Board;
• regular reports to the Board from the 
Executive team on key 
developments, financial 
performance and operational issues 
in the business;
• operational and financial controls 
and procedures which include 
authorisation limits for expenditure, 
sales contracts and capital 
expenditure, signing authorities, IT 
application controls, organisation 
structure, Group policies, 
segregation of duties and reviews by 
management; 
• an annual budget process which is 
reviewed, monitored and approved 
by the Board; 
• regular meetings between the 
Executive team, sales area managers 
and key functional managers to 
discuss actual performance against 
forecast, budget and prior years. The 
operating results are reported on a 
monthly basis to the Board and 
compared to the budget and the 
latest forecast as appropriate;
• targeted internal audit reviews which 
focus on confirming the operation of 
controls in key process areas; and
• maintenance of insurance cover to 
insure all major risk areas of the 
Group based on the scale of the risk 
and availability of the cover in the 
external market.
The Board’s monitoring covers 
all material controls, including 
financial, non-financial, operational 
and compliance controls and risk 
management. It is based principally on 
reviewing reports from management 
to consider whether significant risks 
are identified, evaluated, managed 
and controlled and whether any 
significant weaknesses are promptly 
remedied and indicate a need for 
more extensive monitoring. The 
Board periodically carries out visits 
to the Group’s subsidiaries and 
receives presentations from local 
management on their operations.
The Board has also performed a specific 
assessment for the purpose of this 
Annual Report. This involved reviewing 
the Group’s risk matrix that had been 
reviewed/updated by the Group’s 
Risk Committee, with representatives 
involved from the Executive team and 
senior managers. This assessment 
considered all significant aspects of 
internal control necessary for the 
Company to successfully carry out the 
key business strategies of the Group 
together with more generic inherent 
risks of the Group’s operations. The 
Audit Committee assists the Board in 
discharging its review responsibilities.
Indemnities to Directors
In accordance with the Company’s 
Articles of Association, Directors 
are granted an indemnity from the 
Company to the extent permitted by 
law in respect of liabilities incurred as 
a result of the performance of their 
duties in their capacity as Directors of 
the Company. The indemnity would 
not provide any coverage to the 
extent the Director is proven to have 
acted fraudulently or dishonestly. 
The Company has maintained 
Directors’ and officers’ liability 
insurance cover throughout the year. AVEVA GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE CONTINUED
Policy on appointment and 
reappointment
In accordance with the Articles 
of Association, all Directors are 
required to retire and submit 
themselves for re-election at least 
every three years by rotation and 
also following their appointment. In 
addition, as in the prior year and in 
accordance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code, all of the Board 
members are offering themselves 
for re-election at the Annual 
General Meeting (unless retiring). 
Non-Executive Directors are appointed 
for a term of three years. The terms 
and conditions of appointment of 
Non-Executive Directors are available 
for inspection at the Company’s 
registered office during normal 
business hours and will be available 
for inspection on the day of the 
forthcoming Annual General Meeting. 
Dialogue with institutional 
shareholders
Communication with shareholders 
is given high priority by the Board. 
The Chief Executive, Chief Financial 
Officer and Head of Investor Relations 
have meetings with representatives 
of institutional shareholders and 
hold analyst briefings at least twice 
a year, following the announcement 
of the interim and full year results, 
but also at other times during the 
year as necessary. Senior managers 
from Product Development, Business 
Strategy and Finance also attended 
analyst and shareholder meetings 
during the year. In January 2017 , the 
Executive Directors and key members 
of the Executive Committee hosted 
shareholders and sell-side analysts at a 
capital markets afternoon. The session 
was an opportunity for the Group to 
provide more detail as to the business 
strategy and key areas of focus. All of 
these meetings seek to build a mutual 
understanding of objectives with major 
shareholders by discussing long-term 
strategy and obtaining feedback. 
The Board also receives formal 
feedback from analysts and 
institutional shareholders through 
the Company’s financial PR adviser 
and financial advisers. The Board is 
appraised of discussions with major 
shareholders to ensure that Executive 
and Non-Executive Directors consider 
any matter raised by shareholders and 
to enable all Directors to understand 
shareholder views. In addition, when 
necessary, the Group consults with 
shareholders in respect of proposals 
for the remuneration of Executive 
Directors. The Senior Independent 
Non-Executive Director, Philip Dayer, is 
available to shareholders if they have 
concerns, which contact through the 
normal channels of Chairman, Chief 
Executive or Chief Financial Officer 
has failed to resolve or if such contact 
would be inappropriate. The Chairman, 
Senior Independent and Non-Executive 
Directors are available for dialogue with 
shareholders at any time and attend 
(together with the other members 
of the Board) the Annual General 
Meeting, but are not routinely involved 
in investor relations or shareholder 
communications. Corporate 
information is also available on the 
Company’s website, www.aveva.com.
Constructive use of the Annual 
General Meeting
The Board seeks to use the Annual 
General Meeting to communicate 
with investors and all shareholders 
are encouraged to participate. The 
Chairmen of the Audit, Remuneration 
and the Nominations Committees 
will be available at the Annual General 
Meeting to answer any questions.
Philip Aiken
Chairman
23 May 2017 GOVERNANCE REPORT
41
During the financial year, the 
Nominations Committee comprised 
a majority of independent Non-
Executive Directors, chaired by 
Philip Aiken. The Committee 
has responsibility for Board and 
Committee composition, particularly 
in relation to the diversity of 
background, skills and experience. 
The Committee oversees the 
nomination, selection and 
appointment of Non-Executive and 
Executive Directors and monitors 
succession planning for the Board  
and senior management roles.
In 2016/17 , the Committee met 
three times and the main areas that 
it concentrated on were succession 
planning, Board refreshment and Board 
and senior management appointments.
Succession planning and  
Board refreshment
Effective succession planning is vital for 
the long-term success of the Company. 
There have been considerable changes 
to the composition of the Board 
during the financial year and the 
Committee has taken a lead role in the 
process for the appointment of both 
Executive and Non-Executive Directors 
and senior management. A key 
requirement of the succession planning 
and Board evaluation has been to 
ensure a balance of skills, experience, 
independence and knowledge that is 
appropriate to manage future growth 
and strategic plans of the Company.
With the appointments during the 
course of 2016 of our new Chief 
Executive, our new Chief Financial 
Officer and our two new Non-
Executive Directors, the Committee 
considers that, at the same time as 
promoting very able internal people 
with vast Company knowledge, 
the Company has also gained 
experienced Board members who 
will complement and add depth to 
the skills and balance of the Board. 
Details of Board changes
On 31 December 2016, after 33 years 
with the Group, 17 years of which as 
Chief Executive, Richard Longdon 
stepped down from his role as Chief 
Executive and Executive Director of  
the Company. 
On 8 July 2016, James Kidd, previously 
Chief Financial Officer since 2011, was 
announced as being Richard Longdon’s 
successor as Chief Executive and was 
appointed as deputy Chief Executive 
with effect from that date. James 
assumed the role of Chief Executive 
with effect from 1 January 2017 .
Additionally, on 8 July 2016, David 
Ward was appointed Chief Financial 
Officer, having previously held the 
position of Head of Finance since 2011.
In respect of these appointments 
as Executive Directors, the 
Committee considered the two 
internal candidates to be the most 
suitable candidates, bearing in mind, 
in particular, their knowledge of, 
and service with, the Company.
The Chairman of the Nominations 
Committee and the remainder of the 
Board considered the independence of 
Philip Dayer now that he is in his third 
term of office. It was concluded that he 
remained independent and continued 
to contribute to the operation of the 
Board. Philip Dayer will not stand 
for re-election at the 2017 AGM.
Jonathan Brooks resigned 
from the Board with effect 
from 8 November 2016.
In respect of the intended resignation 
of Jonathan Brooks in November 
2016, Christopher Humphrey was 
duly appointed as a Non-Executive 
Director on 8 July 2016; this being as 
part of a transition process between 
the two Non-Executive Directors, and 
Christopher Humphrey became Chair 
of the Audit Committee with effect 
from 2 November 2016. Additionally, in 
advance of the intent for Philip Dayer 
not to stand for re-election at the 2017 
AGM, Ron Mobed was appointed as 
a Non-Executive Director on 1 March 
2017 . It was also decided that Jennifer 
Allerton should assume the position 
of Remuneration Committee Chair. In 
relation to both of these appointments, 
the Company consulted with a number 
of search firms, and retained the 
services of Spencer Stuart, to provide 
suitable candidates for consideration 
by the Nominations Committee. Short 
listed candidates were interviewed 
by the Chairman and other Non-
Executive and Executive Directors.
On appointment, all Directors are 
asked to confirm that they have 
sufficient time to devote to the role, 
which is confirmed together with 
details of their duties in the letter of 
appointment. All Directors undergo 
an induction as soon as practical 
following their appointment. As part 
of the induction process, Directors are 
provided with background information 
on the Group and attend the Group’s 
headquarters in Cambridge for 
meetings and presentations from 
senior management. In addition, 
where appropriate, meetings are also 
arranged with the Group’s advisers. 
Diversity policy
The Board considers that diversity, 
including diversity of gender, is 
very important when reviewing the 
composition of the Board and possible 
new appointments. That said, whilst 
the Board notes the 2016 Hampton/
Alexander report on FTSE women 
leaders, it has not set targets on gender 
balance. The Board considers that 
the most important consideration is 
to appoint people based on merit, 
skills and relevant experience with 
a view to enhancing the balance 
and effectiveness of the Board.

AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT
WE ARE COMMITTED TO ENSURING THE INTEGRITY OF THE 
GROUP’S FINANCIAL REPORTING, AUDIT PROCESS, KEY RISK 
MANAGEMENT AND INTERNAL CONTROL.
The Audit Committee has a number of responsibilities:
• to undertake regular scrutiny of the Group’ s financial performance;
• ensuring the financial integrity of the Group is effective; 
• ensuring the Group has the appropriate risk management processes and 
internal controls; and
• ensuring that the internal and external audit processes are robust.
Committee Membership
The Audit Committee at the 
date of this report comprises 
four Non-Executive Directors. 
Christopher Humphrey
Audit Committee Chairman
During 2016/17 the members were:
Chairman
Christopher Humphrey  
(from 2 November 2016)
Jonathan Brooks  
(until 2 November 2016)
Members
Philip Dayer
Jennifer Allerton
Christopher Humphrey  
(from 8 July 2016)
Ron Mobed (from 1 March 2017)
Brief biographical details for all the 
members of the Committee are 
included on pages 42 and 43.
The Audit Committee provides 
effective governance over external 
financial reporting, risk management 
and internal controls and reports its 
findings and recommendations to the 
Board. In my capacity as Chairman of 
the Audit Committee, I am pleased 
to report on the operations of the 
Committee during the past year, with 
emphasis on the specific matters 
we have considered, including 
compliance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code (“the Code”) 
and associated Guidance on Audit 
Committees. I confirm that we have 
fully complied with the requirements 
of the Code as issued in April 2016.
I was appointed Chairman of 
the Committee on 2 November 
2016, succeeding Jonathan 
Brooks who stood down from 
the Board in the same month. 
I would like to thank Jonathan for his 
work as Audit Committee Chairman 
and also for his time in handing over 
this responsibility to me. The Board 
believes I have the necessary recent 
and relevant financial experience 
as required by the Code as I am a 
Chartered Management Accountant 
and a Fellow of CIMA, and have 
most recently held the role of Chief 
Executive Officer and previously 
Group Finance Director of Anite plc, 
a UK listed company, and previously 
senior positions in finance at Conoco, 
Eurotherm International plc and 
Critchley Group plc. I have maintained 
an up-to-date understanding of 
financial and corporate governance 
best practice by attending many 
training sessions and updates 
presented by the major accounting 
firms. The Board also considers that 
the other members of the Committee 
have a broad range of appropriate skills 
and experiences covering financial, 
commercial and operational matters.
My induction process involved me 
meeting senior members of AVEVA’s 
Financial Management team prior to 
Jonathan’s departure and I was closely 
involved with the half year reporting 
processes relating to 2016. I have 
met with key internal employees and 
representatives of Ernst & Y oung (EY) 
to learn more about the workings of 
the Group’s financial reporting and 
audit process. During the year I chaired 
two meetings of the Audit Committee.
Audit Committee terms of reference
The Audit Committee monitors 
the integrity of the financial 
statements of the Group and the 
Committee members (as part of 
the full Board) review all proposed 
announcements to be made by the 
Group and consideration is given to 
any significant financial reporting 
judgements contained in them. 
The Committee considers the 
effectiveness of financial reporting 
and internal controls, compliance 
with legal requirements, accounting 
standards and the Listing, Disclosure 
and Transparency Rules of the Financial 
Conduct Authority. We also review 
any proposed change in accounting 
policies and any recommendations 
from the Group’s auditor regarding 
improvements to internal controls  GOVERNANCE REPORT
45
and the adequacy of resources 
within the Group’s finance function. 
The Committee also assesses the 
process that has been established 
to ensure that the Annual Report is 
fair, balanced and understandable, 
reporting to the Board on their findings.
A full copy of the Committee’s terms 
of reference is available from the 
Company’s website at www.aveva.com. 
Meetings
The Audit Committee meets at least 
four times each year. The Company 
Chairman and CFO are invited to 
attend all meetings. The external 
auditor is also invited to attend. 
Members of senior management 
are invited from time to time to 
make presentations such as the 
Committee’s agenda necessitates. 
The Committee meets quarterly 
with the external auditor without 
any members of the Executive team 
being present. I also meet with the 
external auditor from time to time 
away from the Company’s offices.
Risk and internal controls
The key elements of the Group’s 
internal control framework and 
procedures are set out on page 46. The 
principal risks the Group faces are set 
out on pages 30 and 31. Annually, the 
Audit Committee considers the Group 
Risk Register and related management 
controls. Throughout the process, 
the Board or the Audit Committee:
• gives consideration to whether areas 
should be looked at more closely 
through specific control reviews;
• identifies areas where enhancement 
of internal controls is required; and
• agrees action plans to deliver the 
necessary or recommended 
enhancements.
Overview of the year’ s activities
In addition to its prescribed duties the Audit Committee undertook several additional projects during the year. 
Topic Activity in the year
Revenue recognition
The Committee received regular updates from management as to its consideration of implications 
of the new accounting standard for revenue recognition – IFRS 15. The new revenue recognition 
standard comes into effect on 1 January 2018, and the first period for which revenue will be reported 
under IFRS 15 will be the interim period to September 2018. The Committee is tracking management’s 
progress and a presentation outlining the roadmap and expected impact assessment was presented 
to the Committee in March 2017. 
External audit tender
The Committee undertook a tender of the external audit in the summer of 2016, culminating in 
presentations to the Committee by the incumbent auditor Ernst & Young (EY), as well as Deloitte and 
PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC). The Committee was impressed by the quality of presentations from 
all three firms and, ultimately, EY were successful in retaining the audit. The Committee felt that EY 
were in the strongest position to manage the risk associated with the Company’s transition to the new 
revenue recognition accounting standard, IFRS 15, and were pleased with the competitive fee proposal.
Internal audit
The Committee undertook a review of the Group’s position on internal audit. An outline proposal was 
considered in November 2016 to create an internal audit programme, and the level of assurance that 
such a programme would provide. The proposal was approved by the Committee and incorporates the 
establishment of a minimum controls framework, against which internal audit testing will be focused. 
Following this, two internal audit visits to overseas subsidiaries were conducted by members of the 
Group Finance team, and a further visit was conducted by PwC. More details of the Company’s new 
approach to internal audit is included below.
As part of our ongoing programme of controls assurance, the Committee commissioned internal 
audit to undertake a review of the process and controls involved in the invoicing of annual fees. 
Generally the findings were encouraging but some control improvements were recommended to 
ensure that all price increases available under the customer contracts are incorporated.
Risks and internal controls
In March 2017, management presented an update on the Company Risk Register and the continual 
development of internal controls. The update included:
• The new AVEVA RACI framework which is being enacted for 2017 /18 to support the new regional 
organisational structure. 
• The Risk Committee had updated the Corporate Risk Register and established a process of creating 
functional risk registers, which will feed directly into the Corporate Risk Register for a more holistic 
view of corporate risks.
• In furtherance of cyber security, a dedicated IT security team has been established, and a series of 
mandatory e-learning courses introduced. We continue to perform periodic phishing simulations, 
which show an encouraging improvement over time. 
Non-audit services
Legislation on non-audit services came into effect on 1 April 2017 restricting what work the statutory 
auditor can perform. The Committee has implemented a strict policy which goes beyond the 
minimum requirements of legislation and shall be monitored closely. This has necessitated the 
Committee overseeing a transition of work from Ernst & Young to alternative professional services 
firms and advisers.
  AVEVA GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
46
The Audit Committee has developed 
a framework to gain assurance over 
the system of internal financial and 
operational controls. This comprises: 
• A risk assessment performed by 
operational management and  
the Board to identify key areas  
for assurance. 
• Peer and head office reviews of key 
risk areas of financial internal control. 
During the year, subsidiary company 
control visits were undertaken in 
Malaysia and Germany and specific 
reviews were undertaken related to 
annual fee billing and general 
customer contracting terms.
• The use of qualified third parties to 
undertake specialist reviews in more 
technical areas. During 2016/17 , 
PwC performed an internal audit  
of our China operations. 
• An annual assessment by the  
Audit Committee of the whole 
system of internal financial and 
operational controls. 
There is a formal whistle-blowing 
policy which has been communicated 
to employees. This policy provides 
information on the process to follow 
in the event that any employee feels 
it is appropriate to make a disclosure. 
The Audit Committee is satisfied that 
the process is effective and reviews 
key issues which are reported.
Key estimates
The Audit Committee discusses 
with management and the auditor 
the approach that has been taken in 
assessing all key estimates. These 
include revenue recognition, provision 
for impairment of receivables and 
the valuation of retirement benefit 
obligations. Annually, the Committee 
considers the going concern principle 
upon which the financial statements 
are prepared and also the Group’s 
viability statement disclosures. 
Internal audit
As outlined above, during the year the 
Company has established an internal 
audit function which is co-resourced 
using Company employees as well as 
third party specialists. As a Committee, 
we believe this resourcing model will 
provide the most effective approach, 
with some audit reviews requiring 
internal Company knowledge and for 
other audit review areas specialist input 
from an independent third party will 
be optimal. The Company has initially 
chosen PwC for its internal audit 
partner, although this appointment is 
not contractual or for any fixed term.
The Group’s operations are 
geographically widely spread, which 
means that in some instances, 
where assurance over the operation 
of internal control is considered 
valuable, there is a clear advantage 
in such reviews of controls being 
undertaken by teams with specific local 
regulatory knowledge and without 
any local language barrier. Further, 
the Committee believes that such 
instances favour the provision of 
assurance from external sources, which 
is considered to be both more efficient 
and effective. This will be reviewed 
on a case-by-case basis, with PwC 
performing these visits as necessary.
External audit
The Audit Committee advises the 
Board on the appointment of the 
external auditor and during 2016/17 
undertook a tender of the role of 
external auditor. Three firms were 
invited to the tender process, 
which involved several meetings 
with management and culminated 
in a presentation to the Audit 
Committee in July 2016. Ultimately 
EY were successful in retaining the 
audit. The Committee felt that EY 
were in the strongest position to 
manage the risk associated with the 
Company’s transition to the new 
revenue recognition accounting 
standard, IFRS 15, and were pleased 
with the competitive fee proposal.
The Committee also advises the 
Board on the auditor’s remuneration 
both for audit and non-audit work 
and discusses the nature, scope and 
results of the audit with the external 
auditor. From 1 April 2017 , new, tighter 
non-audit services legislation came 
into effect, and at the same time, the 
Group’s updated policy. The legislation 
and policy severely restricts the level 
of non-audit work that the external 
auditor is able to perform and helps 
to safeguard the independence and 
objectivity of the external auditor. 
The Committee continues to keep 
under review the cost effectiveness 
and quality of the audit service. 
Pursuant to the new policy on non-
audit services, the Audit Committee 
is required to approve any fees 
paid to the auditor for permissible 
non-audit work and delegates the 
authority for approval of such work to 
the Chief Financial Officer where the 
level of fees involved are considered 
insignificant. During the year the 
auditor has ceased all prohibited non-
audit work. The Group engages other 
independent firms of accountants 
to perform tax consulting work and 
other consulting engagements to 
ensure that the independence of 
the auditor is not compromised. 
Audit partners are rotated every 
five years and a formal statement of 
independence is received from the 
auditor each year. The Board and the 
Audit Committee are satisfied that 
the independence of the auditor has 
been maintained. The current audit 
partner, Marcus Butler, will complete his 
second year with the Group this year.
Audit planning and main audit issues
At the November 2016 meeting of the 
Committee the auditor presented their 
audit plan for 2016/17 . This included 
a summary of the proposed audit 
scope for the year for each of the 
Group’s subsidiaries and a summary 
of what the auditor considered to be 
the most significant financial reporting 
risks facing the Group, together 
with the auditor’s proposed audit 
approach to these significant risk 
areas. The main area of audit focus 
for the year is the significant estimate 
surrounding revenue recognition.
Committee objectives for 2017 /18
In March 2017 , the Committee 
considered the objectives for the 
year ahead and it was agreed the 
following would be prioritised:
• Complete induction of Ron Mobed 
as a new Committee member.
• Completion of audited conversion  
to IFRS 15 (opening balance  
sheet position).
• Completion of minimum  
control framework.
• Enhancements to product 
development reporting.

REMUNERA TION COMMITTEE REPORT
AT OUR 2017 AGM WE WILL BE SEEKING SHAREHOLDER 
APPROVAL TO RENEW OUR DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION 
POLICY , AS THE CURRENT POLICY (WHICH WAS 
APPROVED BY SHAREHOLDERS AT OUR 2014 AGM)  
IS DUE TO EXPIRE. 
Introduction
In contemplation of this policy renewal, 
the Remuneration Committee 
conducted a full review of AVEVA’s 
approach to senior Executive 
remuneration. The key findings of this 
review were as follows:
• The main pillars of the current 
structure should be retained.
• AVEVA’s past approach of offering 
long-term equity alignment with 
shareholders solely via regular 
annual awards under an L TIP that 
vest subject to a single EPS target 
could be improved as follows:
 – by continuing to grant ‘standard’ 
L TIP awards each year, albeit with 
vesting based upon the 
achievement of a broader range 
of targets than previously applied 
(i.e. EPS, relative TSR and other 
financial/strategic targets), and
 – by the facility to grant ‘restricted 
shares’ worth up to 35% of salary 
each year, with a corresponding 
reduction in the value of L TIP 
awards granted.
• The current annual bonus plan 
would benefit from a degree of 
simplification and could be made 
more reflective of best practice.
• Certain minor changes should be 
made to ensure that our policy 
continues to reflect AVEVA’s 
circumstances, is aligned to and 
supports achievement of the 
Company’s strategic objectives and 
takes due account of developments 
in best practice that have occurred 
since our current policy was 
established in 2014.
• The current shareholding guidelines 
of 200% of salary for the CEO and 
100% of salary for the CFO should 
be increased to 300% of salary, 
should restricted share plan awards 
be granted.
Further details of the changes we are 
proposing to make to our policy are set 
out overleaf.
Context in which our review  
was undertaken
AVEVA has delivered a solid 
performance over the last two years, 
achieving strong recurring revenue 
and cash flows in the context of 
tough end market conditions. There 
has been a focus on both cost 
control and the implementation of 
a strong strategy to drive organic 
growth over the medium term.
AVEVA’s long-term potential cannot 
be realised without the expertise and 
commitment of our senior Executive 
team, now headed by James Kidd, 
following Richard Longdon’s retirement 
from the Board, with James supported 
by David Ward as our new CFO. It is 
therefore important, and very much 
in the long-term interests of our 
shareholders, that we continue to offer 
remuneration packages that ensure the 
retention and incentivisation of our key 
Executives, while also ensuring that we 
keep the prudent approach we have 
adopted to such matters in the past.

REMUNERATION COMMITTEE REPORT CONTINUED
On a more general level, when 
conducting its review, the Committee 
was also mindful of the continued 
focus on Executive remuneration from 
many quarters, including investors, the 
Press and Government. In formulating 
our new policy, we have taken due 
account of all relevant developments 
in market and best practice, while 
also ensuring that our policies and 
practices are appropriate for AVEVA 
and achieve our underlying objective of 
aligning the long-term interests of our 
Executive Directors and shareholders.
Summary of policy for 2017 onwards
The structure of our new Executive 
Directors’ Remuneration Policy (the 
‘Policy’) is summarised below, with the 
key changes we are proposing to make 
highlighted where relevant.
Base salaries
No changes are proposed to our 
underlying approach to base 
salaries save that, to reflect best 
practice, we will impose an overall 
cap on base salaries of £600,000, 
albeit that this does not signify any 
aspiration or intention to move 
Executive Directors’ salaries to this 
level over the life of the policy. 
In terms of actual base salaries of our 
Executive Directors, James Kidd’s 
salary moved to £450,000 from 
£400,000 in April 2017 as part of the 
Committee’s approach to phasing 
James’ salary up to the intended level 
over a period of time. Note that this 
is below Richard Longdon’s salary of 
£495,000 when he retired as CEO 
on 31 December 2016. It is intended 
to further increase James’ salary to 
£500,000 for 2018/19, but only if James’ 
performance and the Company’s 
underlying circumstances warrant. 
Therefore, the Committee is taking 
a prudent approach to James’ salary 
progression by phasing the increases. 
David Ward’s base salary when he 
joined the Board was £230,000. It is 
also intended that this be increased on 
a phased basis to a more appropriate 
level, subject to his performance. As 
such, David’s base salary was increased 
to £300,000 for 2017 /18.
Benefits
No changes are proposed to our 
underlying policy on benefits provision 
although, as with base salaries and to 
reflect best practice, going forward we 
will impose an overall cap on benefits, 
in this case of £50,000 (excluding 
pension-related benefits which will 
remain at 10% of salary for the 
Executive Directors). 
Annual Bonus
As noted above, our review of the 
structure of the current annual bonus 
plan identified a number of features 
that were unusual, not reflective of 
current market or best practice and 
which also added to the complexity of 
the plan:
• The bonus is split between a ‘ core 
award’ of up to 100% of salary and 
an ‘ outperformance award’ of a 
further 25% of salary.
• Only one metric (adjusted PBT) is 
currently used for the financial 
element, whereas it is now common 
for bonuses to operate with a wider 
range of financial metrics to 
encourage performance against a 
broader range of KPIs.
• Up to 10% of the financial element 
of the bonus can be earned based 
solely on interim (as opposed to full 
year) performance.
• The portion of bonus that is subject 
to deferral into shares was structured 
in a complex manner, with the 
proportion of deferral rising as the 
size of the bonus outturn increases.
To address these issues, the Executive 
Directors’ ongoing bonus opportunity 
will be structured as follows:
• To simplify the plan, the concept of 
separate ‘ core’ and ‘ outperformance’ 
awards will be removed and replaced 
by an overall maximum bonus 
opportunity of 125% of salary (i.e. no 
increase on the current level). 
Significant outperformance will still 
be required for a bonus approaching 
125% of salary to be earned.
• To further assist in simplification, 
and to also bring the bonus plan 
more into line with typical practice, 
the 10% interim bonus feature will 
be removed. Therefore, going 
forward, the Executive Directors’ 
entire bonus opportunity will be 
based on full year performance.
• Flexibility will be reserved to employ 
a broader range of financial and 
non-financial metrics in the bonus, 
thereby reflecting common practice 
and also ensuring that the bonus 
outturn is based on a more rounded 
assessment of overall performance. 
More specifically, for 2017 /18:
 – A bonus of up to 105% of salary 
(i.e. 84% of the maximum bonus) 
will be payable based on 
performance against a sliding 
scale of financial targets, namely 
adjusted PBT (80% of salary) and 
recurring revenue (25% of salary) 
– both important financial KPIs.
 – A bonus of up to 20% of salary 
(i.e. 16% of the maximum bonus) 
will be payable by reference to 
performance against quantifiable 
personal/strategic targets, details 
of performance against which will 
be retrospectively disclosed. 
However, to ensure affordability, 
this element of the bonus will be 
reduced by 50% if a threshold 
level of PBT is not delivered.
• Again in the interests of 
simplification, a straight 40% of any 
bonus earned will be deferred into 
shares which vest (as per the current 
policy) in equal tranches over a 
three-year deferral period.
• The existing malus and clawback 
provisions will be retained, with the 
Committee also reserving the right 
to adjust the bonus outturn based 
on a formulaic assessment of 
performance against the targets if 
this outturn does not reflect 
shareholders’ expectations.
Long-term incentives
How AVEVA can best structure its 
long-term equity-based pay policy has 
been a key issue addressed by the 
Committee during the policy review 
process. The Committee considers it 
vital that the interests of our senior 
management team are genuinely 
aligned with the long-term interests of 
our shareholders. 
In previous years, L TIPs were awarded 
at up to 150% of salary and were based 
solely on a single performance metric, 
namely EPS growth. The new policy 
achieves two main changes to the 
structure of the L TIPs; first, to use a 
blend of metrics to assess performance 
under the L TIP to provide a more 
rounded assessment of performance; 
and secondly to introduce the facility to  GOVERNANCE REPORT
49
replace a portion (worth 75% of salary) 
of the traditional L TIPs with restricted 
share plan awards of a lower quantum 
(worth 35% of salary). For 2017 /18 and 
onwards, it is currently envisaged that 
awards will be structured as follows:
Traditional LTIPs 
Regular annual L TIP awards continue 
to be granted, albeit at a reduced 
quantum of 75% of salary (reflecting 
any grant of restricted share awards). 
These awards vest subject to the 
satisfaction of challenging targets 
measured over a period of not less 
than three years, as previously. For 
awards made in 2017 /18, the targets 
will be structured as follows:
• 50% of the award will be subject  
to a sliding scale of adjusted EPS  
growth targets, maintaining the 
threshold and maximum targets of 
5% and 15% per annum used for 
last year’s awards but – to reflect 
internal and external forecasts 
which suggest continuing potential 
headwinds in AVEVA’s end markets 
– with the addition of an intervening 
target of 10%, so that this element 
of the award vests as per the 
following table:
Adjusted EPS growth  
targets p.a.
Proportion of vesting 
(% of total award)
5% 25%
10% 80%
15% 100%
• 25% of the award will vest based on 
AVEVA’s relative TSR performance 
against the FTSE 250 (excluding 
Investment Trusts, Financial Services 
and Real Estate sector companies). 
25% of this element will vest at 
median, with full vesting at the 
upper quartile.
• The remaining 25% of the award will 
vest based on performance against a 
sliding scale of revenue growth 
targets that have been developed to 
specifically support AVEVA’s growth 
strategy in certain parts of its 
business. Due to commercial 
sensitivity, the Committee does not 
believe it to be in shareholders’ 
interests to prospectively disclose 
details of the revenue growth 
targets. However, they will be 
objectively measurable over a 
three-year period, significant 
outperformance will be required to 
deliver full vesting, the targets will be 
disclosed retrospectively following 
vesting, and vesting will only occur if 
the Committee is satisfied that the 
Company’s underlying financial 
performance warrants such 
payment. 25% of this element (for 
each revenue target) will vest at 
threshold levels of performance, 
with full vesting at maximum 
achievement. The revenue growth 
criteria are as follows:
 – Half of this portion (i.e. 12.5% of 
the total L TIP award) will vest 
based on performance against a 
sliding scale of targets relating to 
three-year growth in revenue from 
Owner Operators (OOs). Revenue 
growth from OOs is an important 
strategic measure for the Group, 
as this will supplement the 
revenue streams already derived 
from Engineering, Procurement & 
Construction contractors (EPCs). 
Therefore it is important that we 
build these key relationships in 
order to protect and develop our 
existing business.
 – The remaining half of this portion 
(i.e. 12.5% of the total L TIP award) 
will vest based on performance 
against a sliding scale of targets 
relating to three-year revenue 
growth in ‘More than 3D’ . 
Historically AVEVA’s core strength 
has been in 3D engineering and 
design software. We wish to 
continue to expand our product 
portfolio so as to be able to offer 
a wider solution to customers. 
This is an important source of 
growth because we have an 
installed base that is still 
relatively unpenetrated in terms 
of the wider product portfolio.  
In addition, we can offer 
prospects a more complete, 
integrated solution which helps 
drive efficiency.
Restricted Share Plan (RSP)
Restricted share plan awards can be 
granted over shares worth up to 35% of 
salary (i.e. replacing a portion of the 
traditional L TIP award that would 
otherwise have been granted, worth up 
to 75% of salary). Should restricted plan 
awards be granted, the shareholding 
guidelines will be increased to 300% of 
annual salary for both CEO and CFO 
(previously 200% and 100%, 
respectively). As is the case with the 
traditional L TIPs, restricted shares will 
be subject to a three-year vesting 
period followed by a two-year post-
vesting holding period. In the event of a 
change in control, awards vest subject 
to pro-rating (unless the Committee 
determines otherwise). Malus and 
clawback provisions would apply to this 
award (as they will to the L TIP awards) 
and awards would only be made if the 
Committee is satisfied that the 
Executive’s performance is satisfactory. 
The Committee will withhold the award 
if there is no bonus achievement. 
When agreeing on the introduction of a 
modest restricted shares element to 
our remuneration policy, the 
Committee concluded that:
• Restricted shares provide a 
genuinely meaningful and tangible 
interest in shares.
• While a wholesale move to restricted 
shares (with a complete cessation of 
the L TIP) was an alternative 
approach, it remained appropriate 
for a significant portion of our 
Executive Directors’ equity pay to 
remain directly linked to the 
achievement of challenging 
performance conditions, thereby 
ensuring that the Executive Directors 
remain accountable to shareholders 
for their performance.
• Introducing a restricted share plan 
addresses the continuing debate 
surrounding overall levels of 
Executive remuneration head on, as 
the impact of a grant of restricted 
shares at 35% of salary and 
corresponding reduction in L TIP 
awards by 75% of salary would 
reduce the maximum value of our 
Executive Directors’ long-term 
incentive opportunity by 40% of 
salary in face value terms. Indeed, 
we have been particularly 
conservative when determining the 
‘L TIP to restricted shares exchange 
rate’ by replacing a 75% of salary 
L TIP opportunity with a 35% of 
salary restricted share award  
(i.e. lower than the generally 
accepted 2:1 exchange rate).
• While the introduction of restricted 
shares could potentially be viewed 
as adding complexity to our pay 
arrangements, their introduction has 
been balanced by a significant 
simplification of the structure of our 
annual bonus plan (which retains the 
large deferred share element – 
further evidence of our commitment 
to equity-based pay and the 
alignment with shareholders that 
this brings).  AVEVA GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017

REMUNERATION COMMITTEE REPORT CONTINUED
• Restricted shares are a new 
development for Executive 
remuneration and their introduction 
has attracted mixed views amongst 
the investment community. 
Accordingly, the Committee has 
decided to introduce restricted 
shares as a supplement to the L TIP 
rather than supplant it.
• The use of restricted shares for the 
Executive Directors would align with 
the structure of equity incentives 
throughout the wider management 
population, where restricted  
shares have been used in tandem 
with LTIP awards for some years 
without any concerns arising 
regarding complexity.
Therefore, by (i) the introduction of a 
limited restricted share plan, (ii) the 
continuation of the L TIP , at greatly 
reduced levels when made in tandem 
with restricted shares, with targets that 
encourage a reward for the delivery of 
performance across a broader range of 
metrics, and (iii) the retention of the 
deferred share element of the bonus, 
AVEVA will have a well thought-out and 
rounded equity-based remuneration 
programme that is tailored to our 
specific circumstances and which 
provides both internal and external 
alignment. The enhanced share 
ownership guidelines and use of 
two-year post-vesting holding periods 
also clearly assist in this regard.
Other Committee activities  
during the year 
In addition to conducting the policy 
review, the Committee undertook a 
number of other activities during and 
relating to 2016/17 , including:
• Agreeing the packages of James 
Kidd, David Ward and Richard 
Longdon following their respective 
changes in role.
• Setting the 2016/17 bonus targets 
and determining the ultimate bonus 
outturn. Full details can be found  
on page 61.
• Granting the 2016 L TIP awards, 
further details of which can be found 
on page 62.
• Determining the vesting of the  
2014 L TIP . Full details can be found 
on page 63.
Finally, our review noted that some 
amendments to the rules of the 
L TIP are required to reflect standard 
market practice. For example, to 
further strengthen alignment between 
Executives and shareholders, it is 
proposed that the L TIP be amended 
to enable the Committee to award an 
amount (in cash or shares) equal in 
value to any dividends that would have 
been paid on vested shares from the 
date of grant to the date on which the 
award is released to the participant. 
Certain other administrative 
amendments to the rules of the L TIP 
are also proposed to: (i) formally 
reflect the introduction of the two-
year post-vesting holding period that 
has applied to recent awards granted 
to Executive Directors; (ii) ensure that 
the plan operates fairly where there 
is a variation of share capital; and (iii) 
bring within the definition of a ‘ change 
in control’ – which could be a vesting 
event – the situation whereby a third 
party that already has a controlling 
interest in AVEVA acquires the entire 
issued share capital of the Company. 
We will be seeking shareholder 
approval for these changes at the AGM.
Summary 
I hope you find the contents of this 
Report clear and are supportive of the 
approach we intend to adopt going 
forward. We appreciate that the 
restricted share plan is, as practice 
currently stands, a relatively unusual 
feature. With this in mind, the 
Committee has included a number of 
safeguards that ensure our approach 
would be fully aligned with the long-
term interests of our shareholders:
• The continuation of a significant 
share deferral element of the (now 
simplified) bonus.
• Limiting the grant of restricted 
shares to 35% of salary, with no 
award made in the event of 
underperformance as determined by 
the annual bonus objectives.
• The continuation of L TIP awards with 
formal three-year targets linked 
directly to our strategic objectives, 
which will be lower than past  
awards in quantum terms to  
reflect an accompanying grant  
of restricted shares.
• The application of a two-year 
post-vesting holding period for  
all awards.
• The enhanced share ownership 
guidelines of 300% of salary  
should restricted share plan awards 
be made.
This approach was subject to an 
extensive prior consultation with our 
major shareholders who I am pleased to 
report were generally very supportive.
Part A of this report contains full details 
of the new policy, in respect of which a 
binding shareholder resolution will be 
tabled at the forthcoming AGM. An 
advisory resolution will also be tabled in 
connection with Part B of this report 
which explains how the existing policy 
was implemented last year. 
Finally, I shall be stepping down from 
the Chairmanship of the Remuneration 
Committee at the forthcoming AGM, 
to be replaced by Jennifer Allerton, 
who has been a member of the 
Remuneration Committee since 
2013. I wish her every success in her 
role as Chair of the Committee.

PART A: THE DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION POLICY
This report sets out the information required by Part 4 of Schedule 8 to the Large and Medium-Sized Companies and Groups 
(Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 (as amended) (the “Regulations”). The report also satisfies the relevant 
requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority, and describes how the Board has applied the principles 
and complied with the provisions relating to Directors’ remuneration in the UK Corporate Governance Code.
The table below summarises the Committee’s future policy on the remuneration of Executive Directors which, if approved by 
shareholders at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting on 7 July 2017 , will replace the existing policy for which shareholder 
approval was obtained at the 2014 Annual General Meeting, and will become binding immediately thereafter. The material 
differences between the existing and proposed new policy (which has also been designed with due account taken of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code) are explained in the statement by the Committee Chairman and also in the table below. It is 
currently intended that the policy will remain valid until the 2020 Annual General Meeting.
The Remuneration Committee aims to ensure that: the Executive Directors are provided with appropriate incentives to align 
them with the achievement of the Company’s long-term strategy and the future creation of shareholder value; enhanced 
performance is encouraged; and, the Executive Directors are, in a fair and responsible manner, rewarded for their individual 
contributions to the success of the Group. Excessive risk-taking is neither encouraged nor rewarded.
It also aims for a combination of fixed and variable payments, benefits and share-based awards that will achieve a balance in 
incentives to deliver short and long-term goals. The Company’s policy is that a substantial proportion of remuneration of 
Executive Directors should be performance-related and should be delivered in shares to create alignment with shareholders’ 
interests. Remuneration for Executive Directors is set in the context of the economic environment in which the Group 
operates, the outcome of the wider pay review for all Group employees, as well as the financial performance of the Group. 
When determining remuneration arrangements, the Committee takes into consideration relevant external considerations as 
well as the remuneration for employees of the Group generally.
Remuneration commitments made which were consistent with the approved Remuneration Policy in force at that time shall 
be honoured, even if they would not otherwise be consistent with the policy prevailing when the commitment is fulfilled.

Base salary
• Helps recruit and retain 
employees.
• Reflects experience 
and role.
• Base salary is normally reviewed annually 
with changes effective from 1 April, although 
salaries may be reviewed more frequently or 
at different times of the year if the 
Committee determines this is appropriate.
• The Committee determines base salary 
taking into account factors including, but not 
limited to:
 – the individual’s role, experience and 
performance in achieving financial and 
non-financial goals within his areas of 
responsibility.
 – salaries at other companies of a similar 
size and complexity as well as global 
technology peers.
 – remuneration of different groups of 
employees within the Company.
 – total organisational salary budgets.
• The Committee takes a phased approach to 
new salaries where appropriate. 
• Paid in cash.
• In determining salary increases the 
Committee generally considers the factors 
outlined in the ‘ operation’ column. 
• Salary increases will normally be in line with 
the range of increases in the broader 
workforce salary, although higher increases 
can be made in certain circumstances, for 
example:
 – an increase in the individual’s scope of 
responsibilities; 
 – in the case of Executive Directors who 
are positioned on a lower initial salary 
while they gain experience in the role; or
 – where the Committee considers that 
salary is behind appropriate market 
positioning for a company of AVEVA’s size 
and complexity.
• However, no salary increase will be paid to an 
incumbent the effect of which is that the 
increased salary is greater than £600,000.
None
Pensions
• Provide a competitive 
retirement benefit in a 
way that is cost 
effective to the 
Company.
• The CEO and CFO are members of the 
AVEVA Group Personal Pension Plan  
(a defined contribution scheme).
• The intention is that new appointments to  
the Board would also participate in the AVEVA 
Group Personal Pension Plan or receive an 
equivalent cash payment. However , if 
appropriate the Committee may determine 
that alternative arrangements for the 
provision of retirement benefits may apply . 
When determining pension arrangements for 
new appointments the Board will give regard 
to the cost of the arrangements, market 
practice and the pension arrangements 
received elsewhere in the Group. 
• 10% of base salary (pension contribution 
and/or cash alternative).

Benefits
• Help recruit and retain 
employees
• Provide a competitive 
range of valued 
benefits
• Assist toward early 
return to work in the 
event of illness or 
injury
• The benefit policy is to provide an 
appropriate level of benefit taking into 
account market practice at other companies 
of similar size and complexity and the level of 
benefits provided for other employees in the 
Group.
• In line with benefits provided for other senior 
employees in the Group, Executive Directors 
currently receive a mobility allowance or 
company car, a fuel allowance and an annual 
allowance toward a range of benefits.
• In the event that an Executive Director was 
required to re-locate to undertake their role, 
the Committee may provide additional 
benefits to reflect the relevant circumstances 
(on a one-off or ongoing basis).
• Benefits are reviewed by the Committee in 
the context of market practice from time to 
time and the Committee may introduce or 
remove particular benefits if it is considered 
appropriate to do so. 
• If the Company were to operate an 
all-employee share plan in the future, 
Executive Directors would be entitled to 
participate in the plan on the same terms as 
other employees.
• The cost of benefit provision will depend 
on the cost to the Company of providing 
individual items and the individual’s 
circumstances.
• However, the addition of further benefits 
than those already provided (excluding 
relocation/recruitment-related benefits and 
participation in any all-employee share plan) 
will not result in the aggregate benefit 
provision for any Executive Director 
increasing to over £50,000.
• None
Annual Incentive Scheme 
• Incentivises and 
rewards the 
achievement of annual 
financial and strategic 
business targets and 
delivery of personal 
objectives.
• Deferred element 
encourages long-term 
shareholding, helps 
retention and 
discourages excessive 
risk-taking.
• The Committee determines an individual’s 
maximum incentive opportunity taking into 
account the responsibilities of the role and 
market practice at comparable companies. 
• Performance targets are set by the 
Committee on an annual basis and ordinarily 
disclosed retrospectively.
• The Committee determines the level of 
bonus paid taking into account performance 
against targets, the underlying performance 
of the business and Executive Directors’ 
performance during the year.
• 40% of any bonus earned is deferred into 
shares under the Deferred Share Scheme
(1)
, 
to which malus/clawback provisions apply
(2)
. 
• The maximum bonus opportunity is 125% of 
base salary.
• The performance measures 
applied may be financial or 
non-financial and corporate, 
divisional or individual and in 
such proportions as the 
Committee considers 
appropriate.
• Where a sliding scale of 
targets is used, attaining the 
threshold level of 
performance for any 
measure will not typically 
produce a payout of more 
than 20% of the maximum 
portion of overall annual 
bonus attributable to that 
measure, with a sliding scale 
to full payout for maximum 
performance. However, the 
annual bonus plan remains a 
discretionary arrangement 
and the Committee retains a 
standard power to apply its 
judgement to adjust the 
outcome of the annual 
bonus plan for any 
performance measure 
should it consider that to be 
appropriate (e.g. if the 
provisional bonus outturn 
does not in the Committee’s 
view reflect overall 
shareholder expectations). GOVERNANCE REPORT

Policy table footnotes
(1) Deferred awards will normally deliver the shares to participants in three equal tranches, one in each of the three years following the year in which an award is granted. The 
Committee has discretion to determine an alternative vesting profile. Dividends can accrue on deferred shares during the deferral period.
(2) Awards granted under the Deferred Share Scheme and the Restricted Share Plan and, from 2012 onwards, under the L TIP , are subject to malus and clawback provisions. 
Those provisions may apply at the discretion of the Committee if accounts are corrected or published that indicate the relevant performance was materially worse than in 
the accounts used to assess vesting. Other elements of remuneration are not subject to malus or clawback. AVEVA GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017

REMUNERATION COMMITTEE REPORT CONTINUED
Stating maximum amounts for the Directors’ Remuneration Policy
The Regulations and related investor guidance encourages companies to disclose a cap within which each element of the 
Directors’ Remuneration Policy will operate. Where maximum amounts for elements of remuneration have been set within the 
Directors’ Remuneration Policy, these will operate simply as caps and are not indicative of any aspiration.
Travel and hospitality
While the Committee does not consider it to form part of benefits in the normal usage of that term, it has been advised that 
corporate hospitality, whether paid for by the Company or another, and business travel for Directors and in exceptional 
circumstances their families may technically come within the applicable rules and so the Committee expressly reserves the 
right for the Committee to authorise such activities within its agreed policies.
Committee discretion
The Committee reserves the right to make any remuneration payments and payments for loss of office (including the exercise 
of any discretions available to it in connection with such payments) notwithstanding that they are not in line with the Policy set 
out above where the terms of the payment were agreed (i) before the Policy came into effect or (ii) at a time when the relevant 
individual was not a Director of the Company and, in the opinion of the Committee, the payment was not in consideration for 
the individual becoming a Director of the Company. For these purposes ‘payments’ include the Committee satisfying awards 
of variable remuneration and an award over shares is ‘agreed’ at the time the award is granted. 
The Committee may operate the L TIP , the RSP , the annual bonus and the Deferred Share Scheme in accordance with their 
terms. This includes:
• The selection of participants;
• The timing of grant of an award/bonus opportunity;
• The size of an award/bonus opportunity subject to the maximum limits set out in the policy table; 
• The determination of performance against targets and resultant vesting/bonus payouts;
• Discretion required when dealing with a change of control or restructuring of the Group;
• Determination of the treatment of leavers based on the rules of the plan and the appropriate treatment chosen;
• Adjustments required in certain circumstances (e.g. rights issues, corporate restructuring events and special  
dividends); and 
• The annual review of performance measures, weightings and targets from year-to-year. 
In addition, while performance measures and targets used in the annual bonus plan and L TIP will generally remain unaltered,  
if events occur which, in the Committee’s opinion, would make a different or amended target a fairer measure of performance, 
the Committee can make such amendments to the targets as it considers appropriate. 
Any use of these discretions would, where relevant, be explained in the Remuneration Committee Report and may, where 
appropriate and practicable, be the subject of consultation with the Company’s major shareholders. In addition, for the 
avoidance of doubt, in approving this policy report, authority is given to the Company to honour any commitments entered 
into with current or former Directors prior to the adoption of this policy. The Committee may also make minor amendments  
to the Policy set out above (for regulatory, exchange control, tax or administrative purposes or to take account of a change in 
legislation) without obtaining shareholder approval for that amendment. 
Remuneration arrangements throughout the Group 
Throughout the Group, remuneration is determined based on the same principles: that remuneration arrangements should be 
appropriate for the role without paying more than is necessary and that pay should be structured to incentivise individuals to 
deliver the objectives of their role. AVEVA employs over 1,700 employees in over 30 locations with roles ranging from 
administrators to technical specialists and sales staff. The structure and level of reward therefore differs from role to role 
depending on skills, experience, level of seniority and market practice for the role. AVEVA’s sales employees participate in 
commission plans that are designed to encourage the growth objectives of the Group. Around 300 employees have annual 
bonus plans with 10 receiving a portion of bonus in shares which is deferred for up to three years; all other employees are 
eligible for a Group Discretionary Award or similar, subject primarily to the Group’s financial performance and secondarily 
subject to individual performance. The most senior management participate in the L TIP and RSP . GOVERNANCE REPORT
55
Selection of performance measures 
The Committee’s guiding principle is that remuneration arrangements that operate throughout the Group should support the 
delivery of our long-term business strategy and therefore the creation of shareholder value. Our key long-term strategic 
priority is to deliver strong but sustainable profit streams to support the delivery of this strategic priority. The metrics used in 
our annual bonus arrangements and L TIP are chosen with this in mind, with the payment of bonuses and the vesting of 
long-term incentives subject to stretching targets established by the Committee at the beginning of each performance period. 
These targets are set taking account of internal forecasts of performance over the performance period, the markets in which 
the Group operates, our long-term growth ambitions and the expectations of the investment community on the Group’s 
future potential performance. 
Remuneration Policy for new hires 
When determining the remuneration package for a newly appointed Executive Director, the Committee would seek to apply 
the following principles: 
• The package should be market competitive to facilitate the recruitment of an individual of sufficient calibre to lead the 
business. At the same time, the Committee would intend to pay no more than it believes is necessary to secure the 
required talent.
• The structure of the ongoing remuneration package would normally include the components set out in the policy table for 
Executive Directors.
• Where an individual forfeits outstanding variable pay opportunities or contractual rights as a result of their appointment, the 
Committee may offer compensatory payments or awards, in such form as the Committee considers appropriate taking into 
account relevant factors, which may include the form of awards, expected value and vesting timeframe of forfeited 
opportunities. When determining such ‘buy-outs’ the guiding principle would be that awards would generally be on a ‘like 
for like’ basis to those forfeited unless not considered appropriate.
• To facilitate awards outlined above, in the event of recruitment, the Committee may grant awards to a new Executive 
Director in accordance with Listing Rule 9.4.2. This provision permits the granting of awards to facilitate, in unusual 
circumstances, the recruitment of an Executive Director, without seeking prior shareholder approval.
• The maximum level of variable remuneration which may be awarded (excluding any ‘buy-out’ awards) is in accordance with 
limits on the Company’s incentive plans as set out in the policy table. 
• Where an Executive Director is required to relocate to take-up their role, the Committee may provide reasonable assistance 
with relocation (either via one-off or on-going payments or benefits) taking into account the individual’s circumstances and 
prevailing market practice.
• In the event that an internal candidate is promoted to the Board, legacy terms and conditions would normally be honoured, 
including pension entitlements and any outstanding incentive awards. 
Executive Director service contracts and policy on payment for loss of office 
When determining leaving arrangements for an Executive Director the Committee takes into account any contractual 
agreements including the provisions of any incentive arrangements, typical market practice and the performance and conduct 
of the individual. 
The service contracts for current and non-current Executive Directors include the following terms:

REMUNERATION COMMITTEE REPORT CONTINUED
The service agreements are available to shareholders to view on request from the Company Secretary.
Notice Period The CEO’s service contract can be terminated by the Company or the Executive Director on nine months’ notice. The CFO’s service 
contract can be terminated by the Company or the Executive Director on six months’ notice. The service agreements provide for a 
period of garden leave not exceeding six months. The Committee will determine the appropriate notice period for any new Director 
taking into account the circumstances of the individual and market practice. Any notice period will normally be no longer than 12 
months. The Committee reserves the right to provide a longer initial notice period of up to 24 months reducing to 12 months over 
the first 12 months of employment if it considers this to be appropriate.
Payment 
in lieu of notice
In the event of termination of contract without notice, the Executive Director shall be entitled to a payment in respect of salary for 
the period of notice. Such payment will normally be made in instalments and subject to mitigation but the Committee shall have 
discretion to make a single payment if this is considered appropriate.
Annual Bonus The Executive Director may, at the discretion of the Committee, remain eligible to receive an annual bonus for the financial year 
in which they ceased employment. Such annual bonus award will be determined by the Committee taking into account the 
circumstances for leaving, time in employment and performance.
Deferred Share 
Scheme 
Death: In the event of a participant’s death unvested awards shall vest. Where awards are in the form of options they may be 
exercised for a period of up to 12 months from death. 
Good leavers: At the discretion of the Committee, leaving by reason of injury, disability, redundancy, the Company for which the 
participant works leaving the Group or any other reasons determined by the Committee. Awards shall continue in full and vest on 
the originally anticipated vesting dates. Alternatively, the Committee may determine that awards should vest when the participant 
ceases employment. Awards in the form of options may be exercised in accordance with the rules of the scheme. 
Leavers in other circumstances: Awards will normally lapse.
Long Term 
Incentive Plan
Good leavers: At the discretion of the Committee, leaving as a result of death, injury, disability, redundancy, retirement, the 
Company for which the participant works leaving the Group or any other reason. Unvested awards shall continue in existence for 
the remainder of the performance period. At the end of the performance period, the awards may be permitted to vest to the extent 
determined in accordance with the applicable performance conditions and, unless the Committee determines otherwise, then 
reduced to reflect the period that elapsed from the start of the performance period to the date of cessation as a proportion of the 
performance period. 
Leavers in other circumstances: Awards will normally lapse. Vested but unexercised options held by participants who leave 
employment other than due to gross misconduct may be exercised for a period following cessation of employment.
Restricted 
Share Plan
Good leavers: At the discretion of the Committee, leaving as a result of death, injury, disability, redundancy, the Company for  
which the participant works leaving the Group or any other reason. Unvested awards shall continue in existence for the remainder 
of the vesting period. At the end of the vesting period, the awards may be permitted to vest, unless the Committee determines 
otherwise, on a pro rata basis to reflect the period that elapsed from the start of the performance period to the date of cessation  
as a proportion of the performance period. 
Leavers in other circumstances: Awards will normally lapse. Vested but unexercised options held by participants who leave 
employment other than due to gross misconduct may be exercised for a period following cessation of employment.
Other payments An Executive Director who joined the Company before January 2008 and who is made redundant, may receive, in addition to a 
payment in lieu of notice, any statutory redundancy payment and any other payment to which he is entitled, a payment under the 
Company’s enhanced redundancy policy. This policy applies to all employees who joined the Company before January 2008. Under 
the policy, an eligible person will receive a payment calculated by reference to their length of service and weekly pay (by reference to 
gross annual salary) as follows:
• 7 weeks’ pay for service of up to 6 years; plus
• 1.5 weeks’ pay for each completed year of service over 7 years up to 20 years; plus 
• 2 weeks’ pay for each completed year of service over 20 years. 
Under the Company’s enhanced redundancy policy, eligible participants, including Executive Directors, may also receive a payment 
in lieu of a 90 day redundancy consultation period. In the event of termination of an Executive Director’s employment, a payment 
may be made in lieu of any accrued but untaken holiday. The Remuneration Committee would be responsible for considering the 
circumstances of the early termination of an Executive Director’s contract and determining whether in exceptional circumstances 
there should be compensation payments in excess of the Company’s contractual obligations.
The Company has the power to enter into settlement agreements with Directors and to pay compensation to settle potential 
legal claims. In addition, and consistent with market practice, in the event of the termination of an Executive Director, the 
Company may make a contribution towards that individual’s legal fees and fees for outplacement services as part of a 
negotiated settlement. Any such fees will be disclosed as part of the detail of termination arrangements. For the avoidance  
of doubt, the policy does not include an explicit cap on the cost of termination payments. GOVERNANCE REPORT
57
Change of control 
In the event of a change of control or a voluntary winding-up of the Company and ultimately at the discretion of the 
Remuneration Committee: 
1. Unvested awards under the Deferred Share Scheme will vest in full at the time of change of control. 
2. Unvested awards granted under the 2014 L TIP rules will vest having regard to the extent to which performance conditions 
have been met and unless the Committee determines otherwise, the proportion of the performance period that has 
elapsed at the date of the change of control or winding-up. 
3. Unvested awards granted under the Restricted Share Plan shall vest in proportion to the full vesting period which has 
elapsed as at the date of change of control.
Employee context
When setting Executive Directors’ pay, the Committee considers the remuneration arrangement of other senior managers and 
employees in the Group more generally to ensure that Executive remuneration arrangements are appropriate in this context. 
AVEVA undertakes an annual salary review in April each year and uses this opportunity to reward strong performance and 
ensure salaries are in line with market rates. It manages this in a competitive environment particularly in the fast-growing 
economic areas. When determining salary increases for Executive Directors the Committee considers the outcome of the 
wider pay review for the Group. The Committee does not consult directly with employees regarding Executive Directors’ 
remuneration. However, at regular intervals the Company conducts a survey of the views of employees in respect of their 
experience of working at AVEVA including their own reward.
Dialogue with shareholders 
The views of our shareholders on remuneration matters are important to the Committee and prior to making any material 
changes to remuneration arrangements the Committee consults with major shareholders and their representative bodies to 
obtain their views (as was the case during the Policy renewal process). The Company remains committed to engaging with 
shareholders in relation to remuneration issues.
External appointments
The Company’s policy is to permit an Executive Director to serve as a Non-Executive Director elsewhere when this does not 
conflict with the individual’s duties to the Company, and where an Executive Director takes such a role they may be entitled to 
retain any fees which they earn from that appointment. 
Remuneration outcomes in different performance scenarios
The remuneration package at AVEVA is structured so that the package rewards performance over both the short and long term 
to ensure that reward is aligned with shareholder value creation. 
The charts overleaf show hypothetical values of the remuneration package for Executive Directors under three assumed 
performance scenarios:

REMUNERATION COMMITTEE REPORT CONTINUED
Remuneration Policy for Non-Executive Directors
Approach to setting fees Basis of fees Other items
• Fees for the Chairman and the Non-Executive 
Directors are determined taking account of the 
individual’s responsibilities, the expected time 
commitment for the role and prevalent market 
rates. 
• The Board is responsible for setting fees for the 
Non-Executive Directors with the Remuneration 
Committee being responsible for setting fees 
for the Chairman. 
• Fees are reviewed at appropriate intervals, 
usually on an annual basis.
• Basic fees are subject to the aggregate limit in 
the Company’s Articles of Association. Any 
changes in this limit would be subject to 
shareholder approval.
• Non-Executive Directors are paid a basic fee for 
membership of the Board with additional fees 
being paid to Non-Executive Directors who hold 
the position of Committee Chairman to take 
into account the additional responsibilities and 
workload. Additional fees may also be paid for 
other Board responsibilities or roles if this is 
considered appropriate.
• The Chairman receives an all-inclusive fee for 
the role.
• Fees are paid in cash.
• Non-Executive Directors do not receive incentive 
pay or share awards.
• Non-Executive Directors do not currently receive 
any benefits nor pension arrangements. Benefits 
may be provided in the future if, in the view of the 
Board (or, in the case of the Chairman, the 
Committee), this was considered appropriate.
• Travel and other reasonable expenses (including 
fees incurred in obtaining professional advice in 
the furtherance of their duties) incurred in the 
course of performing their duties are reimbursed 
to Non-Executive Directors (including any 
associated tax liability).
The Non-Executive Directors have appointment letters, the terms of which recognise that their appointments are subject to 
the Company’s Articles of Association and their services are at the direction of the shareholders.

PART B: THE IMPLEMENTATION REPORT
The Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee is appointed by the Board. The members are Philip Dayer (Chair), Jennifer Allerton, Christopher 
Humphrey and Ron Mobed. All the Committee members are regarded by the Board as independent Non-Executive Directors. 
Philip Dayer will be standing down at the AGM on 7 July and Jennifer Allerton will succeed him as the Chair of the 
Remuneration Committee. Jennifer has been a member of the Remuneration Committee since 2013. 
The role of the Committee is set out in its terms of reference which are available on the Company’s website at 
www.aveva.com. The Committee’s primary responsibility is to determine the remuneration package of both the Company’s 
Executive Directors and its senior management within broad policies agreed with the Board.
FIT Remuneration Consultants (FIT) are the appointed advisors to the Committee. They provide independent advice on 
comparator information and general remuneration. Fees are charged on a time spent basis and the fees paid during the year to 
FIT in relation to the advice provided to the Committee were £61,019. FIT provide no other services to the Company and so the 
Committee is content that their advice is objective and independent.
By invitation, James Kidd and Clare Bye (EVP , Human Resources) attend the meetings to provide company insight and 
advice to help the Committee consider appropriate remuneration. Neither would be in attendance during any discussion of 
their own remuneration.
Six meetings were held during the year, which is higher than usual due to the revision of the Directors’ Remuneration Policy. 
Attendance at the meetings is shown on page 38 of the Corporate Governance section of the Annual Report.
The auditor has reported on certain sections of Part B and stated whether, in their opinion, those parts have been 
properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006. Those sections of Part B which have been subject to audit 
are clearly indicated.

Implementation of policy for 2017 /18
Base salary
Whilst salaries for the Executive Directors would normally be reviewed annually, the promotion of James Kidd to Deputy CEO 
(formerly CFO) in July 2016 and subsequently to CEO in January 2017 has resulted in increases to salary during the year.
Base salary with effect from James Kidd Increase David Ward Increase
1 April 2016 £306,000 n/a
8 July 2016 £350,000 14.4% £230,000 n/a
1 January 2017 £400,000 14.3% £230,000 n/a
1 April 2017 £450,000 12.5% £300,000 30.0%
Benefits
In line with benefits provided for other senior employees, in 2017 /18 Executive Directors will be provided with a company car 
allowance, a fuel allowance and a £600 annual allowance towards a range of flexible benefits. 
 
Pension 
James Kidd and David Ward are members of the A VEV A Group Personal Pension Plan (a defined contribution scheme). James Kidd 
receives a cash in lieu allowance in line with the detail in the policy table. Their pension contributions will remain 10% of salary.
Annual Incentive Scheme
For 2017 /18, the maximum opportunity for Executive Directors under the annual incentive will continue to be 125% of base 
salary although the out-performance element has been incorporated into the core scheme, albeit still requiring a stretch level 
of performance for full payout. The half year element has been removed. REMUNERATION COMMITTEE REPORT CONTINUED
AVEVA GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
60
The financial performance targets are based on (1) Group adjusted profit before tax (PBT) targets, with a maximum weighting 
of 80% of salary, and (2) recurring revenue, with a maximum weighting of 25% of salary. A further maximum of 20% of salary is 
available for the delivery of key individual performance objectives which are agreed with the Remuneration Committee at the 
start of each financial year, although this element will be capped at a maximum achievement of 10% should the Group 
adjusted PBT target not be met.
The Board believes that, given the annual incentive scheme rewards the achievement of the annual business plan, the targets 
are market sensitive and therefore should not be disclosed in advance, but ordinarily will be disclosed retrospectively. 
As a simplification of the previous deferral calculation, 40% of any award made under the Annual Incentive Scheme, 
irrespective of the amount, will be payable in deferred shares as per the policy table.
Long-Term Incentives
As described in the introduction to the Remuneration Committee report, it is currently proposed that the structure of the  
L TIs will change, as summarised below:
Previous LTI arrangement New LTI arrangement
Traditional LTIP: 150% of salary 75% of salary
 EPS growth 150% of salary 37.5% of salary
 Relative TSR performance nil 18.75% of salary
 Strategic objectives nil 18.75% of salary
Restricted Share Plan nil 35% of salary
Total Long-Term Incentives 150% of salary 110% of salary
Further details of the performance conditions are as follows:
• The adjusted EPS growth targets are:
Adjusted EPS growth targets p.a.
Proportion of vesting 
(% of total award)
5% 25%
10% 80%
15% 100%
• The relative TSR performance condition will measure AVEVA against the FTSE 250 (excluding Investment Trusts, Financial 
Services and Real Estate sector companies). 25% of this element will vest at median, with full vesting at the upper quartile.
• The strategic objectives will be a sliding scale of revenue growth targets. 25% of this element (for each revenue target) will 
vest at threshold levels of performance, with full vesting at maximum achievement. The revenue growth criteria are as follows:
 – Half of this portion will vest based on performance against a sliding scale of targets relating to three-year growth in 
revenue from Owner Operators (OOs). 
 – The remaining half of this portion will vest based on performance against a sliding scale of targets relating to three-year 
revenue growth in ‘More than 3D’ . 
 – Due to commercial sensitivity, the Committee does not believe it to be in shareholders’ interests to prospectively 
disclose details of the revenue growth targets. However, they will be objectively measurable over a three-year period, 
significant outperformance will be required to deliver full vesting, the targets will be disclosed retrospectively following 
vesting, and vesting will only occur if the Committee is satisfied that the Company’s underlying financial performance 
warrants such payment. GOVERNANCE REPORT

Elements of single figure of remuneration 
Base salary
The base salary for Richard Longdon was £495,000 (2015/16 – £485,000) until he stepped down at the end of December 2016. 
James Kidd’s salary in 2016/17 was £306,000 (2015/16 – £300,000) until his promotion to Deputy CEO in July 2016 when it 
increased to £350,000 with a further increase to £400,000 when he became CEO in January 2017 . David Ward joined the Board 
as CFO on 8 July 2016, with a base salary of £230,000.
Benefits
In 2016/17 and 2015/16 Executive Directors were provided with a company car or a car allowance, a fuel allowance and a £500 
annual allowance towards a range of flexible benefits. From 1 January 2017 , the annual allowance for flexible benefits increased 
for all UK employees (including for the Executive Directors) to £600 per annum.
Pension 
James Kidd and David Ward are members of the AVEVA Group Personal Pension Plan (a defined contribution scheme). The 
Company contributed 10% of salary to the plan during 2016/17 for David Ward. In line with policy a cash alternative was paid  
to James Kidd.
Annual incentive 
This reflects the total annual incentive paid and payable in 2017 based on performance in the year ended 31 March 2017 .  
This includes both the cash element of the bonus and the portion deferred into shares under the deferred share scheme. 
The majority of the annual incentive is dependent on achieving Group adjusted profit before tax (PBT) performance targets. 
10% of the core award was dependent on achieving the half year PBT target of £9.7m. This was a binary target, paying out 
either nothing or in full. The actual achievement was £9.1m, thereby resulting in no payout. 80% was dependent on full year 
adjusted PBT performance, with nothing paying out if achievement was below £54.15m, and fully paying out if achievement 
reached £62.70m. The actual achievement was £55.0m. This resulted in an achievement of 10.0% of the 80% PBT element, 
representing 8% of scheme value. 
The Executive Directors were given individual performance objectives which comprise the remaining 10% of the annual incentive. 
When determining the level of achievement for this portion of the bonus the Committee considered that James Kidd had met 
this element having made some key appointments to his senior management team and introduced major organisational 
structure changes, along with a new operating model and responsibility matrix to underpin these. These changes will support 
the Company strategy in the future. A clear business plan identifying the Company’s strategic drivers and how these can  
be leveraged and measured has also been delivered. The Committee considered David Ward’s targets as met as he has 
achieved specific tasks in the areas of risk management, internal audit, the adoption of IFRS 15 and AVEVA’s commercial and 
contract function. AVEVA GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017

REMUNERATION COMMITTEE REPORT CONTINUED
As per the policy in force relating to 2017 annual incentive payments, for bonus achievements of less than 70% of the 
potential maximum core bonus, then 75% will be paid in cash and the remaining 25% will be paid in deferred shares, with no 
further performance conditions. The amounts are summarised in the table below.

Long-term incentives 
This includes the L TIP awards granted under the Long- Term Incentive Plan in 2014 that were capable of vesting based on 
performance in the three-year period ended 31 March 2017 .
These awards were subject to the delivery of EPS growth. 0% of awards vest for diluted adjusted EPS growth of less than 12% 
p.a., with 100% of awards vesting for diluted adjusted EPS growth of 20% p.a. Average diluted EPS growth for the three-year 
performance period did not reach the minimum 12% p.a. growth needed and therefore 0% of the L TIP awards will vest for the 
period relating to 2016/17 .

Change in remuneration of the CEO 
The table below illustrates the percentage change in salary, benefits and annual incentive for the Group CEO and two selected 
sub-sets of employees (including only those employees who were employed at the start of the 2015/16 financial year through 
to the end of the 2016/17 financial year). The UK Group has been chosen because AVEVA is headquartered and employs 
around one-quarter of its employees in the UK. Typical salary inflation in some other AVEVA locations is materially higher than 
the UK, which would distort the comparison.

Relative importance of spend on pay
The chart below illustrates the year-on-year change in total remuneration for all employees in the Group compared to adjusted 
profit before tax and distributions to shareholders. The Committee determined adjusted profit before tax was an appropriate 
measure for this chart as it is one of the Group’s key performance indicators and is the primary measure for the annual 
incentive scheme.

interim and final dividend in 2016/17 , increasing the proportion of the interim dividend by 117% over the prior year.
Outside appointments
The Board believes that accepting Non-Executive appointments with other companies enhances the experience of Executive 
Directors and therefore they are entitled to accept appointments outside of the Company provided that Board approval is 
sought prior to accepting the appointment. Whether or not the Director concerned is permitted to retain their fees is 
considered on a case-by-case basis. Neither James nor David currently hold any outside appointments.
Total pension entitlements 
Richard Longdon is a deferred member of the CADCentre Pension Scheme, a defined benefit pension scheme for which 
AVEVA Solutions Ltd is the principal employer, and has accrued the maximum benefit he is entitled to. 
The plan is a contributory, funded, occupational scheme registered with HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) and, since  
1 October 2004, Career Average Revalued Earning benefits apply. He is entitled to a pension on normal retirement, or on 
retirement due to ill health, equivalent to two-thirds of his pensionable salary provided he has completed (or would have 
completed in the case of ill health) 25 years’ service. A lower pension is payable on earlier retirement after the age of 55 by 
agreement with the Company and subject to HMRC guidelines. Pensions are payable to dependants on his death in retirement 
and a lump sum is payable if death occurs in service. 
Richard’s accrued entitlements under the pension scheme are as follows:

pension contributions of £10,000 per annum. David was able to utilise unused carryover from previous years, whereas James 
has no carryover available and thus elected to receive a cash alternative, as allowed under the policy. During 2016/17 in their 
capacity as Directors, David received employer contributions of £16,794 (2015/16 – £nil) and James received cash in lieu of 
contributions of £30,300 (2015/16 – £30,000). AVEVA GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017

Details of the issued share capital can 
be found in note 27 to the consolidated 
financial statements. The rights 
attaching to the Company’s shares are 
set out in its Articles of Association.
Subject to any restrictions referred to in 
the next section, members may attend 
any general meeting of the Company.
There are no restrictions on the transfer 
of ordinary shares in the Company 
other than: certain restrictions which 
may from time to time be imposed 
by laws and regulations (for example, 
insider trading laws); and pursuant 
to the Listing Rules of the Financial 
Conduct Authority whereby Directors 
and certain employees of the Company 
require the approval of the Company 
to deal in the ordinary shares and 
pursuant to the Articles of Association 
where there is default in supplying the 
Company with information concerning 
interests in the Company’s shares. 
There are no special control rights in 
relation to the Company’s shares.
Voting rights
Subject to any restrictions below, on 
a show of hands every member who 
is present in person or by proxy at 
a general meeting has one vote on 
each resolution and, on a poll, every 
member who is present in person or by 
proxy has one vote on each resolution 
for every share of which he/she is the 
registered member. A proxy will have

a resolution on a show of hands in 
certain circumstances specified in the 
Articles of Association. The Notice 
of Annual General Meeting specifies 
deadlines for exercising rights. AVEVA GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
68
A resolution put to the vote of a 
general meeting is decided on a show 
of hands, unless before or on the 
declaration of the result of the show 
of hands, a poll is demanded by the 
Chairman of the meeting. The Articles 
of the Company also allow members, 
in certain circumstances, to demand 
that a resolution is decided by a poll.
A member may vote personally or by 
proxy at a general meeting. Any form 
of proxy must be delivered to the 
Company not less than 48 hours before 
the time appointed for holding the 
meeting or adjourned meeting at which 
the person named in the appointment 
proposes to vote (for this purpose, the 
Directors may specify that no account 
shall be taken of any part of a day that 
is not a working day). A corporation 
which is a member of the Company 
may authorise such persons as it thinks 
fit to act as its representatives at any 
general meeting of the Company.
No member shall be entitled to attend 
or vote, either personally or by proxy, 
at a general meeting in respect of 
any share if any call or other sum 
presently payable to the Company in 
respect of such share remains unpaid 
or in certain other circumstances 
specified in the Articles of Association 
where there is default in supplying the 
Company with information concerning 
interests in the Company’s shares.
Dividends, distributions  
and liquidation
Members can declare final dividends 
by passing an ordinary resolution but 
the amount of the dividends cannot 
exceed the amount recommended by 
the Board. The Board can pay interim 
dividends provided the distributable 
profits of the Company justify such 
payment. The Board may, if authorised 
by an ordinary resolution of the 
members, offer any member the right 
to elect to receive new shares, which 
will be credited as fully paid, instead 
of their cash dividend. Any dividend 
which has not been claimed for 12 
years after it became due for payment 
will be forfeited and will then revert 
to the Company. Members may share 
in surplus assets on a liquidation.
If the Company is wound up, the 
liquidator can, with the sanction of 
the members by special resolution 
and any other sanction required by 
law, divide among the members all or 
any part of the assets of the Company 
and he/she can value any assets and 
determine how the divisions shall be 
carried out as between the members 
or different classes of members. The 
liquidator can also transfer the whole 
or any part of the assets to trustees 
upon any trusts for the benefit of 
the members. No members can 
be compelled to accept any asset 
which would give them any liability.
There are no agreements between 
holders of securities that are known 
to the Company which may result 
in restrictions on the transfer of 
securities or on voting rights, save 
as described below in relation to 
the Employee Benefit Trust.
Change of control
All of the Company’s share-based 
plans contain provisions relating 
to change of control. Outstanding 
awards and options normally 
vest and become exercisable on 
a change of control, subject to 
the satisfaction of any relevant 
performance conditions at that time.
There are no other significant 
agreements to which the Company 
is a party that take effect, alter or 
terminate upon a change of control of 
the Company following a takeover bid.
There are no agreements between 
the Company and its Directors or 
employees providing for compensation 
for loss of office or employment that 
occurs because of a takeover bid. 
Articles of Association
Any amendments to the Articles 
of Association of the Company 
may be made in accordance with 
the provisions of the Companies 
Act by way of special resolution.
Powers of the Directors
The business of the Company is 
managed by the Directors, who may 
exercise all powers of the Company, 
subject to the Company’s Articles 
of Association, relevant statutory 
law and to any direction that may 
be given by the Company in general 
meeting by special resolution. Subject 
to the Companies Act, shares may 
be issued by Board resolution. At 
the Company’s last Annual General 
Meeting, powers were granted to the 
Directors (subject to limits set out in 
the resolutions) to issue and to buy 
back its own shares; similar powers 
are proposed to be granted at the 
forthcoming Annual General Meeting. 
The buy-back authority was limited 
to 10% of the Company’s issued 
share capital. No shares have been 
bought back under this authority.
Appointment of Directors
The Articles of Association limit the 
number of Directors to not less than 
two and not more than ten save 
where members decide otherwise. 
Members may appoint Directors by 
ordinary resolution and may remove 
any Director (subject to the giving 
of special notice) and, if desired, 
replace such removed Director by 
ordinary resolution. New Directors 
may be appointed by the Board but 
are subject to election by members 
at the first Annual General Meeting 
after their appointment. A Director 
may be removed from office if 
requested by all other Directors.
The Company’s Articles of Association 
require that at each AGM there shall 
retire from office (and be subject 
to re-election by members) any 
Director who shall have been a 
Director at the preceding two Annual 
General Meetings and who was not

Statement of Directors’ 
responsibilities in relation to the

The Directors are required to prepare 
consolidated financial statements 
for each financial year in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by

have elected to prepare the parent 
company financial statements in 
accordance with United Kingdom 
General Accepted Accounting Practice 
(United Kingdom Accounting Standards 
and applicable law including FRS 101 
“Reduced Disclosure Framework”). 
Under company law the Directors 
must not approve the financial 
statements unless they are satisfied 
that they give a true and fair view of 
the state of affairs of the Company 
and of the undertakings included in 
the consolidation as a whole as at the 
end of the financial year and the profit 
or loss of the undertakings included in 
the consolidation as a whole, so far as 
concerns members of the Company, 
for the financial year. In preparing those 
Consolidated financial statements, 
the Directors are required to:
• select and apply accounting policies 
in accordance with IAS 8;
• present information, including 
accounting policies, in a manner that 
provides relevant, reliable, 
comparable and understandable 
information; and
• provide additional disclosures when 
compliance with the specific 
requirements in IFRSs is insufficient 
to enable users to understand the 
impact of particular transactions, 
other events and conditions on the 
entity’s financial position and 
financial performance.
In preparing the parent company 
financial statements, the Directors  
are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies 
and then apply them consistently;
• make judgements and accounting 
estimates that are reasonable  
and prudent;
• state whether applicable UK 
accounting standards have been 
followed, subject to any material 
departures disclosed and explained 
in the financial statements; and
• prepare the financial statements on 
the going concern basis unless it is 
inappropriate to presume that the 
Company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for 
keeping adequate accounting records 
which are sufficient to disclose with 
reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the Company 
and enable them to ensure that the 
financial statements comply with the 
Companies Act 2006 and, as regards 
the Group financial statements, 
Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. They 
are also responsible for safeguarding 
the assets of the Company and 
hence for taking reasonable steps 
for the prevention and detection 
of fraud and other irregularities.
Disclosure of information to auditor
The Directors who were members of 
the Board at the time of approving the 
Directors’ report are listed on pages  
42 and 43. Each of these Directors 
confirms that:
• so far as he is aware, there is no 
relevant audit information (as 
defined by Section 418 of the 
Companies Act 2006) of which the 
Company’s auditor is unaware; and
• he has taken all the steps he ought 
to have taken as a Director in order 
to make himself aware of any such 
relevant audit information and to 
establish that the Company’s auditor 
is aware of that information.
Fair and balanced reporting
Having taken advice from the Audit 
Committee, the Board considers 
the Annual Report and Accounts, 
taken as a whole, is fair, balanced 
and understandable and that it 
provides the information necessary 
for shareholders to assess the 
Company’s position and performance, 
business model and strategy.
Responsibility statement pursuant to 
the FCA’ s Disclosure and Transparency 
Rule 4 (DTR 4)
Each Director of the Company 
(whose names and functions appear 
on pages 42 and 43) confirms that 
(solely for the purpose of DTR 4) 
to the best of their knowledge:
• the financial statements in this 
document, prepared in accordance 
with the applicable UK law and 
applicable accounting standards, 
give a true and fair view of the 
assets, liabilities, financial position 
and profit of the Company and the 
undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole; and
• the Strategic Report and the 
Directors’ report include a fair review 
of the development and 
performance of the business and the 
position of the Company and the 
undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole, 
together with a description of the 
principal risks and uncertainties that 
they face.

Overview of our audit approach
Risks of material misstatement
 
Risk of inappropriate revenue recognition on software licence contracts, in particular:
–  for the rental revenue stream, inappropriate application of the Group revenue recognition 
policy and IAS 18 (Revenue) for licence revenue recognition, could result in, for example, 
revenue being recorded when performance conditions have not been satisfied, incorrect 
deferral of revenue for support and maintenance and other obligations; and
–  for all revenue streams, inappropriate revenue recognition in relation to cut off, as revenue 
may not have been recognised in the correct accounting period.
Audit scope –  We performed an audit of the complete financial information of six components and audit 
procedures on specific balances for a further six components. 
–  The components where we performed full or specific audit procedures accounted for 65%  
of adjusted pre-tax profit and 87% of revenue.
Materiality –  Overall Group materiality of £2.5m which represents approximately 5% of adjusted  
pre-tax profit.

Our assessment of risk of material misstatement
We identified the risks of material misstatement described below as those that had the greatest effect on our overall audit 
strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit and the direction of the efforts of the audit team. In addressing these risks,  
we have performed the procedures below which were designed in the context of the financial statements as a whole and, 
consequently, we do not express any opinion on these individual areas.
Risk 
Risk of inappropriate revenue recognition on software licence contracts, in particular:
–  For the rental revenue stream, inappropriate application of the Group revenue recognition policy and IAS 18 (Revenue) for licence revenue 
recognition, could result in, for example, revenue being recorded when performance conditions have not been satisfied, incorrect deferral 
of revenue for support and maintenance and other obligations – £94.2m (2016 – £90.6m).
–  For all revenue streams, inappropriate revenue recognition in relation to cut off, as revenue may not have been recognised in the correct 
accounting period – £215.8m (2016 – £201.5m).
Refer to the Audit Committee Report (pages 44 to 46); Accounting policies (pages 113 to 120); and note 3 of the Consolidated Financial 
Statements (page 84) 
Our response to the risk 
We have reviewed and walked through the central process over the approval and recognition of revenue contracts across the Group.
We have walked through and assessed the design effectiveness of key management controls over data input and IT.
A summary of our key procedures are:
We have performed rental licence revenue sample transaction testing at a local and Group level to ensure that revenue has been recorded 
in accordance with the Group’s revenue recognition policy and IAS 18 and has been appropriately recorded in the current year income 
statement or deferred on the balance sheet as appropriate. This was achieved by testing a sample of contracts by:
– agreeing licence revenues to signed contracts or software licence agreements;
– agreeing the revenue to subsequent payment as evidence of collectability;
– checking evidence to support that software has been delivered to customers and prior to revenue recognition;
–  reviewing contract terms for any conditions that would impact the timing of revenue recognition and in turn the completeness of 
deferred revenue; 
– ensuring appropriate allocation of the fair value and recognition of revenue for other deliverables included within the contract; and
– assessing whether revenue has been recognised in line with the Group’s revenue recognition policy and IAS 18. 
We selected a sample of revenue journals and assessed the appropriateness of the journal by checking to supporting evidence and ensuring 
compliance with the Group’s revenue recognition policy and IAS 18. The sample selected was based on risk based criteria including but not 
limited to manual journal entries, those close to period end and postings that are inconsistent with roles and responsibilities. 
We have performed an independent assessment as to whether the fair value rate of the support and maintenance is still applicable and that 
any non-standard contracts have an appropriate fair value rate applied. 
To better understand the nature of the contractual relationships with customers, any contractual issues or any ongoing contractual 
obligations, we made enquiries of management outside the finance function, including the sales team and legal counsel to ensure that 
appropriate obligations and commitments had been recorded in the financial statements.
We have performed a test of detail on a sample of deferred revenue and accrued revenue items to ensure it is in accordance with the 
revenue recognition principles. 
We have performed analytical review by revenue stream and geography to access unexpected trends and patterns that could be indicative 
of incorrect revenue recognition. 
We have performed cut-off testing for a sample of revenue items booked either side of year end to ensure that licence revenue was only 
recognised for software in the period where the contract was signed by both AVEVA and the customer prior to year end and the software 
has been made available prior to the year end.
As a primary team we gained oversight of the testing performed by the overseas teams through:
–  Our review of their reporting deliverables where they are required to report on any exceptions identified from their testing and unusual 
contractual terms and conditions; 
–  Reviewing contracts meeting the Board review threshold; and 
–  Reviewing any contracts identified as having unusual terms or conditions by management and/or overseas audit teams to confirm 
appropriate recognition of revenue in accordance with the contract accounting policy. 
We performed full and specific scope audit procedures over this risk area in 12 locations, which covered 87% of the risk amount. At the 
Group level we also performed the same revenue procedures for the rest of the locations at Group materiality, which covered the remaining 
13% of the risk amount.
In addition, the Group audit team performed these same procedures (to Group materiality) for the remaining components to ensure 100% 
coverage of revenue. 
Key observations communicated to the Audit Committee
We conclude that revenue recognised in the year, and deferred as at 31 March 2017, is materially correct on the basis of our procedures 
performed both at Group and by component audit teams.  AVEVA GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT CONTINUED
The scope of our audit 
Tailoring the scope
Our assessment of audit risk, our 
evaluation of materiality and our 
allocation of performance materiality 
determine our audit scope for each 
entity within the Group. Taken 
together, this enables us to form an 
opinion on the consolidated financial 
statements. We take into account size, 
risk profile, the organisation of the 
Group and effectiveness of Group-wide 
controls and changes in the business 
environment when assessing the level 
of work to be performed at each entity.
In assessing the risk of material 
misstatement to the Group financial 
statements, and to ensure we had 
adequate quantitative coverage of 
significant accounts in the financial 
statements, of the 30 reporting 
components of the Group, we selected 
12 components covering entities 
within the UK, France, Germany, 
Korea, USA, Brazil, India, China and 
Sweden, which represent the principal 
business units within the Group.
Of the 12 components selected, we 
performed an audit of the complete 
financial information of six components 
(“full scope components”) which 
were selected based on their size or 
risk characteristics. For the remaining 
six components (“specific scope 
components”), we performed audit 
procedures on specific accounts 
within that component that we 
considered had the potential for the 
greatest impact on the significant 
accounts in the financial statements 
either because of the size of these 
accounts or their risk profile. 
The reporting components where 
we performed audit procedures 
accounted for 65% (2016 – 105%) of 
the Group’s adjusted pre-tax profit 
and 87% (2016 – 81%) of the Group’s 
Revenue. For the current year, the full 
scope components contributed 66% 
(2016 – 57%) of the Group’s adjusted 
pre-tax profit and 75% (2016 – 52%) of 
the Group’s revenue. The specific scope 
component contributed (1% – loss) 
(2016 – 48%) of the Group’s adjusted 
pre-tax profit and 12% (2016 – 29%) of 
the Group’s Revenue. The reduction in 
coverage for adjusted pre-tax profit is 
due to loss making components within 
the specific scope category. The audit 
scope of these components may not 
have included testing of all significant 
accounts of the component but will 
have contributed to the coverage of 
significant testing for the Group. At the 
Group level we performed the revenue 
audit procedures described above in 
the risk section at Group materiality 
on the rest of the components of 
the Group which accounted for the 
remaining 13% of the Group’s revenue. 
The Group audit risk in relation to 
revenue recognition was subject 
to audit procedures over the entire 
Group locations with revenue. 
Of the remaining 18 components 
that together represent 35% of the 
Group’s adjusted pre-tax profit, none 
are individually greater than 5% of the 
Group’s adjusted pre-tax profit. For 
these components, as explained above, 
we performed the revenue procedures 
at Group materiality as described in 
the risk section and as a result covering 
100% of revenue and for the remaining 
accounts we performed analytical 
review, testing of consolidation 
journals, intercompany elimination 
and foreign currency translation 
recalculation to respond to any 
potential risks of material misstatement 
to the Group financial statements.
The chart below illustrates the 
coverage obtained from the work 
performed by our audit teams.

Changes from the prior year 
USA has been designated a full scope 
component this year, whereas it was 
designated as a specific scope location 
in the prior year. We have changed the 
designation as a the component has 
increased in proportion of the total 
Group. For the current year we have 
scoped out Malaysia and Japan from the 
specific scope category and scoped in 
Sweden as part of our rotational scope 
for the smaller components  
of the Group. 
Involvement with component teams 
In establishing our overall approach 
to the Group audit, we determined 
the type of work that needed to be 
undertaken at each of the components 
by us, as the primary audit engagement 
team, or by component auditors 
from other EY global network firms 
operating under our instruction. Of 
the six full scope components, the 
audit was performed on three of these 
directly by the primary audit team. 
In addition, audit procedures were 
also performed by the primary audit 
team for one of the six specific scope 
components. For the remaining eight 
components, where the work was 
performed by component auditors, 
we determined the appropriate 
level of involvement to enable us to 
determine that sufficient audit evidence 
had been obtained as a basis for our 
opinion on the Group as a whole.
The Group audit team continued to 
follow a programme of planned visits 
that has been designed to ensure that 
the Senior Statutory Auditor visits and 
his representatives visits at least two 
(2016 – two) of the components each 
year. During the current year’s audit 
cycle, visits were undertaken by the 
primary audit team to the component 
teams in China, USA and France (2016 
– Germany and India). These visits 
involved, where appropriate, discussing 
the audit approach with the component 
team and any issues arising from their 
work, meeting with local and regional 
management, attending the planning 
meeting in USA and the closing 
meetings in China and France; and 
reviewing key audit working papers on 
risk areas. The primary team interacted 
regularly with the component teams 
where appropriate during various 
stages of the audit, reviewed key 
working papers and were responsible 
for the scope and direction of the audit 
process. This, together with the 
additional procedures performed at 
Group level, gave us appropriate 
evidence for our opinion on the Group 
financial statements. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
75
Starting basis Profit before tax – £46.9m
Adjustments Exceptional items – £2.4m
Materiality Adjusted pre-tax profit – £49.3m
Materiality of £2.5m (5% of materiality basis)
Our application of materiality 
We apply the concept of materiality in 
planning and performing the audit, in 
evaluating the effect of identified 
misstatements on the audit and in 
forming our audit opinion. 
Materiality
The magnitude of an omission or 
misstatement that, individually or in 
the aggregate, could reasonably be 
expected to influence the economic 
decisions of the users of the financial 
statements. Materiality provides a basis 
for determining the nature and extent 
of our audit procedures.
We determined materiality for the 
Group to be £2.5 million (2016 – £2.2 
million), which is 5% (2016 – 5%) of 
adjusted pre-tax profit because, in our 
view, this is the most relevant measure 
of the underlying financial performance 
of the Group. For 2017 we have used 
pre-tax profit adjusted for restructuring 
costs (£4.2m) and the refund on 
consideration on the 8over8 acquisition 
from shareholders (£1.8m). For 2016 
we used pre-tax profit adjusted for the 
aborted acquisition costs of Schneider 
Electric (£10.2m) and certain 
restructuring costs (£3.8m). 
 
Performance materiality
The application of materiality at 
the individual account or balance 
level. It is set at an amount to 
reduce to an appropriately low level 
the probability that the aggregate 
of uncorrected and undetected 
misstatements exceeds materiality.
On the basis of our risk assessments, 
together with our assessment of the 
Group’s overall control environment, 
our judgement was that performance 
materiality was 75% (2016 – 75%) of 
our planning materiality, namely £1.9m 
(2016 – £1.7m). We have set 
performance materiality at this 
percentage to ensure that the total 
uncorrected and undetected audit 
differences in all accounts did not 
exceed our materiality.
Audit work at component locations 
for the purpose of obtaining 
audit coverage over significant 
financial statement accounts is 
undertaken based on a percentage 
of total performance materiality. The 
performance materiality set for each 
component is based on the relative 
scale and risk of the component to the 
Group as a whole and our assessment 
of the risk of misstatement at that 
component. In the current year, the 
range of performance materiality 
allocated to components was £0.4m 
to £1.0m (2016 – £0.5m to £0.9m). 
Reporting threshold
An amount below which identified 
misstatements are considered as being 
clearly trivial.
We agreed with the Audit Committee 
that we would report to them all 
uncorrected audit differences in excess 
of £0.12m (2016 – £0.11m), which 
is set at 5% of planning materiality, 
as well as differences below that 
threshold that, in our view, warranted 
reporting on qualitative grounds.
We evaluate any uncorrected 
misstatements against both the 
quantitative measures of materiality 
discussed above and in light of other 
relevant qualitative considerations in 
forming our opinion.
Scope of the audit of the financial 
statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence 
about the amounts and disclosures 
in the financial statements sufficient 
to give reasonable assurance that the 
financial statements are free from 
material misstatement, whether 
caused by fraud or error. This includes 
an assessment of: whether the 
accounting policies are appropriate to 
the Group’s and the Parent Company’s 
circumstances and have been 
consistently applied and adequately 
disclosed; the reasonableness of 
significant accounting estimates 
made by the Directors; and the 
overall presentation of the financial 
statements. In addition, we read 
all the financial and non-financial 
information in the Annual Report to 
identify material inconsistencies with 
the audited financial statements and 
to identify any information that is 
apparently materially incorrect based 
on, or materially inconsistent with, 
the knowledge acquired by us in the 
course of performing the audit. If we 
become aware of any apparent material 
misstatements or inconsistencies we 
consider the implications for our report.
Respective responsibilities of  
directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ 
Responsibilities Statement set out on 
page 70, the Directors are responsible 
for the preparation of the financial 
statements and for being satisfied 
that they give a true and fair view. Our 
responsibility is to audit and express

Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report is made solely to the 
Company’s members, as a body, in 
accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 
of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit 
work has been undertaken so that we

those matters we are required to state 
to them in an auditor’s report and 
for no other purpose. To the fullest 
extent permitted by law, we do not 
accept or assume responsibility to 
anyone other than the Company and 
the Company’s members as a body, 
for our audit work, for this report, or 
for the opinions we have formed. 
Opinion on other matters prescribed 
by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
 – the part of the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report to be audited 
has been properly prepared in 
accordance with the Companies Act 
2006; and
 – based on the work undertaken in the 
course of the audit: 
 – the information given in the 
Strategic Report and the Directors’ 
Report for the financial year for 
which the financial statements are 
prepared is consistent with the 
financial statements.
 – the Strategic Report and the 
Directors’ Report have been 
prepared in accordance with 
applicable legal requirements. AVEVA GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1 Corporate information
AVEVA Group plc is a public limited Company incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom. The address of the 
registered office is given on page 123. AVEVA Group plc’s shares are publicly traded on the Official List of the London  
Stock Exchange. 
2 Key accounting policies
Explained below are the key accounting policies of the Group. The full Statement of Group Accounting Policies is included  
on pages 113 to 120.
a) Basis of preparation
The accounting policies which follow set out those policies which apply in preparing the financial statements for the year 
ended 31 March 2017 . The Consolidated financial statements are presented in Pounds Sterling (£) and all values are rounded  
to the nearest thousand (£000) except when otherwise indicated.
The Consolidated financial statements of AVEVA Group plc and all its subsidiaries (the Group) have been prepared in 
accordance with IFRS, as adopted by the European Union, as they apply to the financial statements of the Group for the year 
ended 31 March 2017 . The Group’s financial statements are also consistent with IFRSs as issued by the IASB. 
The Group presents a non-GAAP performance measure on the face of the Consolidated income statement. The Directors 
believe that the ‘adjusted profit before tax’ and ‘adjusted diluted and basic earnings per share’ measures presented provide  
a reliable and consistent presentation of the underlying performance of the Group. Adjusted profit is not defined by IFRS and 
therefore may not be directly comparable with the ‘adjusted’ profit measures of other companies.
The business is managed and measured on a day-to-day basis using adjusted results. To arrive at adjusted results, certain 
adjustments are made for normalised and exceptional items that are individually important and which could, if included, 
distort the understanding of the performance for the year and the comparability between periods.
Normalised items
These are recurring items which management considers to have a distorting effect on the underlying results of the Group,  
and are non-cash items.
These items relate to amortisation of intangibles (excluding other software), share-based payment charges and fair value 
adjustments on financial derivatives, although other types of recurring items may arise. Recurring items are adjusted each  
year irrespective of materiality to ensure consistent treatment.
Exceptional items
These are items which are non-recurring and are identified by virtue of either their size or their nature. These items can 
include, but are not restricted to, the costs of significant restructuring exercises, fees associated with business combinations 
and costs incurred in integrating acquired companies. 
In the prior year, deferred revenue was presented as part of the line item ‘trade and other payables’; in the current year 
deferred revenue is presented as a separate line item on the balance sheet. The prior year line item ‘trade and other payables’ 
therefore decreased by the amount of deferred revenue of £46,874,000. 
The parent Company financial statements of AVEVA Group plc are included on pages 107 to 111.
b) Revenue
The Group generates its revenue principally from licensing the rights to use its software products directly to end users and  
to a lesser extent indirectly through resellers. Revenue is measured at fair value of the consideration received or receivable and 
represents the amounts receivable for goods and services provided in the ordinary course of business, net of discounts and 
sales taxes. It comprises initial licence fees, annual licence fees and rental licence fees, together with income from consultancy 
and other related services.
For each revenue stream, revenue is not recognised unless and until:
 – a clear contractual arrangement can be evidenced;
 – delivery has been made in accordance with that contract;
 – if required, contractual acceptance criteria have been met; and
 – the fee has been agreed and collectability is probable. Where extended payment terms beyond 90 days exist, appropriate 
approvals are obtained to ensure there is sufficient comfort that collectability is probable and the fee is determinable.  
If approvals are not obtained, revenue is deferred until payment is due. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
83
Initial/annual licence agreements
Users are charged an initial licence fee upon installation for a set number of users together with an obligatory annual fee, 
which is charged every year. Annual fees consist of the continuing right to use and customer support and maintenance, which 
includes core product upgrades and enhancements, and remote support services. Users must continue to pay annual fees in 
order to maintain the right to use the software.
Initial licence fees are recognised once the above conditions have been met. Annual fees are recognised on a straight-line 
basis over the period of the contract, which is typically 12 months. If annual fees are charged at a discount, an amount is 
allocated out of the initial licence fee at fair market value based on the value established when annual fees are charged 
separately to customers.
Rental licence agreements
As an alternative to the initial licence fee plus annual fee model, the Group also supplies its software under three different 
types of rental licence agreement.
Rental licence fees which are invoiced monthly and which are cancellable by the customer are recognised on a monthly basis.
Other rental licence agreements are invoiced at the start of the contracted period, which is typically one year, are non-
cancellable and consist of two separate components: the initial software delivery, and the continuing right to use with 
customer support and maintenance. Revenue in respect of the continuing right to use and customer support and 
maintenance element is valued at fair market value based on the value established when annual fees are charged separately  
to the customer. This component is recognised on a straight-line basis over the period of the contract. The residual amount 
representing the implied initial fee element is recognised upfront, provided all of the above criteria have been met. Where 
uncertainty exists and it is not possible to reliably determine the fair value of the customer support and maintenance element, 
all revenue is recognised on a straight-line basis over the period of the contract.
The Group also licenses its software using a token licensing model. Under this model, a ‘basket’ of tokens representing 
licences to use different software products over a defined period is granted, which enables the customer to draw these down 
as and when required. Where the customer commits in advance to a specified number of tokens over a defined period,  
a proportion of revenue is recognised with an appropriate element deferred for customer support and maintenance 
obligations, subject to the above recognition conditions being met. Where the customer is charged in arrears, revenue is 
recognised based on the actual number of tokens used.
Services
Services consist primarily of consultancy, implementation services and training, and are performed under separate service 
arrangements. Revenue from these services is recognised as the services are performed and stage of completion is 
determined by reference to the costs incurred as a proportion of the total estimated costs of the service project. If a contract 
cannot be reliably estimated, revenue is recognised only to the extent that costs have been incurred. Provision is made as 
soon as a loss is foreseen.
If an arrangement includes both licence and service elements, licence fee revenue is recognised upon delivery of the software 
provided that services do not include significant customisation or modification of the base product and the payment terms  
for licences are not subject to acceptance criteria. In all other cases, revenues from both licence and service elements are 
recognised as services are performed.
c) Significant accounting estimates
Revenue recognition
The assessments and estimates used by the Group for revenue recognition could have a significant impact on the amount  
and timing of revenue recognised.
Revenue from sales of software licences when these are combined with the delivery of significant implementation or 
customisation services is recognised in line with the delivery of the services to the customer. This policy involves the 
assessment of which customer projects include significant customisation or implementation and also an assessment of the 
stage of completion of such projects. 
The fair value estimate of the element of a customer rental fee attributable to the continuing right to use, and to customer 
support and maintenance, is reviewed periodically. On average, the element attributable to customer support and 
maintenance as a proportion of the initial software delivery is 17%. A 1% deviation in this percentage would not lead to  
a material change in revenue. AVEVA GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017

2 Key accounting policies continued
Provision for impairment of receivables
The Group makes provision for the impairment of receivables on a customer-specific basis. The determination of the 
appropriate level of provision involves an estimate of the potential risk of default or non-payment by the Group’s customers 
and management consider a number of factors, including the financial strength of the customers, the level of default that the 
Group has suffered in the past, the age of the receivable outstanding and the Group’s trading experience with that customer. 
The provision for impairment of receivables at 31 March 2017 was £6,054,000 (2016 – £5,879,000).
Intangible assets
IFRS 3 requires the identification of acquired intangible assets as part of a business combination. The methods used to value 
such intangible assets require the use of estimates including forecast performance and customer attrition rates. Future results 
are impacted by the amortisation periods adopted and changes to the estimated useful lives would result in different effects 
on the income statement.
Goodwill is tested annually for impairment. Tests for impairment are based on discounted cash flows and assumptions 
(including discount rates, timing and growth prospects) which are inherently subjective. Further details about the assumptions 
used are set out in note 14.
Retirement benefit obligations
The determination of the Group’s obligations and expense for defined benefit pensions is dependent on the selection, by the 
Board of Directors, of assumptions used by the pension scheme actuary in calculating these amounts. The assumptions 
applied, together with sensitivity analysis, are described in note 25 and include, amongst others, the discount rate, the 
inflation rate, rates of increase in salaries and mortality rates. While the Directors consider that the assumptions are 
appropriate, significant differences in the actual experience or significant changes in assumptions may materially affect the 
reported amount of the Group’s future pension obligations, actuarial gains and losses included in the Consolidated statement 
of comprehensive income in future years and the future staff costs. The net carrying amount of retirement benefit obligations 
at 31 March 2017 was £3,810,000 (2016 – £5,162,000).
d) Impairment of assets
Goodwill arising on acquisition is allocated to cash-generating units expected to benefit from the combination’s synergies and 
represents the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes and generates cash flows which 
are independent of other cash-generating units. The recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which goodwill has 
been allocated is tested for impairment annually or when events or changes in circumstance indicate that it might be impaired. 
The carrying values of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets other than goodwill are reviewed for impairment 
when events or changes in circumstance indicate the carrying value may be impaired. If any such indication exists and where 
the carrying values exceed the estimated recoverable amount, the assets or cash-generating units are written down to their 
recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the greater of net selling price and value in use. In assessing value in use, the 
estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market 
assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. For an asset that does not generate largely 
independent cash inflows, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. 
Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement in the selling and administrative expenses line item.

Schneider Electric and the acquisition of FabTrol Systems Inc. 
As described in the 2016 Annual Report, we intended to make continued cost savings in addition to those already made in 
2015/16 to mitigate the impact of cost inflation and other planned investments elsewhere in the business. During the 2016/17 
financial year the Group incurred exceptional restructuring costs of £4,152,000 in connection with the rationalisation of offices 
and reduction in headcount in specific areas of the business. Also included are the redundancy costs incurred in eliminating 
the Regional Operations layer of management. These activities are a continuation of the restructuring activities of the previous 
year which were ultimately more protracted than initially expected due to changes in the Executive management team.
The Group has provided for a potential sales tax liability in respect of prior periods, related to the local sales of one of  
the Group’s subsidiary companies. The provision includes an estimate of the underpaid tax as well as related interest for  
late payment. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The calculations of basic and diluted earnings per share are based on the net profit attributable to equity holders of the parent 
for the year of £38,066,000 (2016 – £20,474,000). Basic earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing the net profit 
attributable to equity holders of the parent by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year. 
Diluted earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing the net profit attributable to equity holders of the parent by the 
weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year plus the weighted average number of ordinary 
shares that would be issued on the conversion of all the potentially dilutive share options into ordinary shares. Details of the 
terms and conditions of share options are provided in note 26.

adjustment of £4,260,000 in relation to the acquisition of 8over8 Limited.

The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired. 
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the cash-generating units (CGUs) that are expected 
to benefit from that business combination. In 2016/17 the goodwill impairment testing was carried out on a value in use (VIU) 
basis using the most recently approved management budgets for the year ended 31 March 2018 together with the most 
recent three-year business plan extrapolated to a duration of five years in total. Projected cash flows beyond five years have 
been assumed at the long-term growth rate for that region and these have been used to formulate a terminal value for the 
discounted cash flow calculation.  
Key assumptions
The key assumptions in the most recent annual budget on which the cash flow projections are based relate to discount rates, 
long-term growth rates and operating margins.
The cash flow projections have been discounted using the Group’s pre-tax weighted average cost of capital adjusted for the 
country and market risk. Long-term growth rates used are assumed to be equal to the long-term growth rate in the gross 
domestic product of the region in which the CGU operates. CGU operating margin is based on past results.

EMEA 11% 9% 1.9% 1.0%
Americas 11% 11% 1.9% 2.0%
Summary of results
During the year all goodwill was tested for impairment, with no impairment charge resulting (2016 – £nil).
As the VIU is most sensitive to a change in the discount rate and long-term growth rate, the Directors have considered 
combinations of a reduction in the long-term growth rate and an increase in the discount rate and concluded that no 
reasonably foreseeable changes in key assumptions would result in an impairment of goodwill, such is the margin by which 
the estimate exceeds the carrying value. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

23 Financial risk management
The Group’s principal financial instruments comprise cash and short-term deposits, treasury deposits and forward foreign 
exchange contracts. The Group has various other financial assets and liabilities such as trade receivables and trade payables, 
which arise directly from its operations.
The Group enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to manage currency risks arising from the Group’s operations.
It is, and has been throughout the period under review, the Group’s policy that no speculative trading in financial instruments 
shall be undertaken.
The main risks arising from the Group’s financial instruments are market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. The Board reviews 
and agrees policies for managing such risks on a regular basis as summarised below:
a) Market risk
Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates and interest rates, will affect the Group’s 
income or the value of its holding of financial instruments. The objective of market risk management is to manage and control 
market risk exposures within acceptable parameters.
Interest rate risk
The Group holds net funds and hence its interest rate risk is associated with short-term cash deposits and treasury deposits. 
The Group’s overall objective with respect to holding these deposits is to maintain a balance between security of funds, 
accessibility and competitive rates of return.
For the presentation of market risks, IFRS 7 requires sensitivity analysis that shows the effects of hypothetical changes of 
relevant risk variables on profit or loss and shareholders’ equity. The Group is exposed to fluctuations in interest rates on its 
cash and cash equivalents and treasury deposits. The Group does not have any borrowings. The impact is determined by 
applying sensitised interest rates to the cash and cash equivalents and treasury deposit balances.
A 1% point decrease in the Sterling and US Dollar interest rates would have reduced interest income by approximately 
£382,000 (2016 – £633,000) and profit after tax by £306,000 (2016 – £506,000).
Foreign currency risk
Foreign currency risk arises from the Group undertaking a significant number of foreign currency transactions in the course of 
operations. These exposures arise from sales by business units in currencies other than the Group’s presentational currency 
of Sterling.  AVEVA GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
96
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
CONTINUED
23 Financial risk management continued
The majority of costs are denominated in the functional currency of the business unit. The main exposures relate to the US 
Dollar, Euro, South Korean Won and Japanese Y en, reflecting the fact that a significant proportion of the Group’s revenue and 
cash receipts are denominated in these currencies, whilst a large proportion of its costs, such as Research & Development, are 
settled in Sterling, Indian Rupees and Swedish Krona.
The Group manages exchange risks, where possible, by using forward foreign exchange contracts. The Group enters into 
forward foreign exchange contracts to sell US Dollars and Euros to match forecast cash flows arising from its recurring revenue 
base. In addition, it enters into specific forward foreign exchange contracts for individually significant revenue contracts, 
when the timing of forecast cash flows is reasonably certain. Other currency exposures are less easy to hedge cost effectively. 
At 31 March 2017 , the Group had outstanding currency exchange contracts to sell $14.5 million (2016 – $18 million) and  
€9.8 million (2016 – €10.4 million). 
The Group has not applied hedge accounting during the current year and therefore all gains and losses on forward foreign 
exchange contracts have been included in the Consolidated income statement.
The Group has investments in foreign operations whose net assets are exposed to currency translation risk. Gains and losses 
arising from these structural currency exposures are recognised in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Foreign currency sensitivity analysis
For the presentation of market risks, IFRS 7 requires sensitivity analysis that shows the effects of hypothetical changes in the 
foreign exchange rates in profit or loss or shareholders’ equity. The impact is determined by applying the sensitised foreign 
exchange rate to the monetary assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date.
Currency risks as defined by IFRS 7 arise on account of financial instruments being denominated in a currency that is not the 
functional currency and being of a monetary nature; differences resulting from the translation of financial statements into the 
Group’s presentation currency are not taken into consideration.
A 10% change in the US Dollar against Sterling and Euro against Sterling would have impacted equity and profit after tax by the 
amounts shown below as at the reporting date shown. In management’s opinion, this is a reasonably possible change given 
current market conditions. Our analysis indicates that a 10% change in other currencies would not have a significant impact. 
This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular interest rates and other foreign currencies, remain constant. The 
analysis is performed on the same basis for 2015/16.

b) Credit risk
The Group’s principal financial assets are cash equivalents, treasury deposits, trade and other receivables.
Counterparties for cash and cash equivalents and treasury deposits are governed by the treasury policy, which has been 
approved by the Board, and are limited to financial institutions which have a high credit rating assigned by international credit 
rating agencies. As set out in the Group’s treasury policy, the amount of exposure to each counterparty is subject to a specific 
limit, up to a maximum of 50% of the Group’s total counterparty risk. Within this overall limit, some counterparties are subject 
to more restrictive caps on counterparty exposure. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
97
The Group trades only with recognised, creditworthy third parties and provides credit to customers in the normal course of 
business. The amounts presented in the Consolidated balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables. An 
allowance for impairment is made where there is an identified loss event, which, based on previous experience, is evidence of 
a reduction in the recoverability of the cash flows. The Group has credit control functions to monitor receivable balances on an 
ongoing basis. Credit checks are performed before credit is granted to new customers. Due to the credit control procedures in 
place, we believe all the receivables are of good quality. The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with 
exposure spread over a large number of customers. The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying 
amount of each financial asset. The exposure to credit risk is mitigated where necessary by either letters of credit or payments 
in advance.
The Group does not require collateral in respect of its financial assets.
c) Liquidity risk
The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate cash reserves and by continuously monitoring forecast and actual 
cash flows and matching the maturity of financial assets and liabilities. The Group has no borrowings from third parties and 
therefore liquidity risk is not considered a significant risk at this time.
The table below analyses the Group’s financial liabilities, which will be settled on a net basis, into relevant maturity groupings

d) Fair values
The book values of the Group’s financial assets and liabilities consist of bank and cash balances of £85,462,000 (2016 – 
£64,611,000) and treasury deposits of £45,486,000 (2016 – £43,316,000). The carrying amounts of these financial assets and 
liabilities in the Group’s financial statements approximates their fair values.
In addition, the Group’s financial assets include forward foreign exchange contracts. Financial instruments which are 
recognised at fair value subsequent to initial recognition are grouped into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair 
value is observable. The three levels are defined as follows:
 – Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or 
liabilities.
 – Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are 
observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
 – Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that 
are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).
At 31 March 2017 , the Group had forward foreign exchange contracts which were measured at Level 2 fair value subsequent to 
initial recognition. The fair value of the liability in respect of foreign exchange contracts was £196,000 at 31 March 2017 (2016 
– £864,000 liability).
The resulting gain of £668,000 (2016 – loss of £432,000) on the movement of the fair value of forward foreign exchange 
contracts is recognised in the Consolidated income statement within administrative expenses.
e) Capital management
The Group’s policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor market, creditor, customer and employee 
confidence and to sustain future development of the business. The capital structure of the Group consists of equity 
attributable to the equity holders of AVEVA Group plc comprising issued share capital, other reserves and retained earnings.
To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the dividend payment to shareholders, return capital to 
shareholders or issue new shares. No changes were made in the objectives, policies or processes during the years ended  
31 March 2016 or 2017 .
The Board monitors the capital structure on a regular basis and determines the level of annual dividend. The Group is not 
exposed to any externally imposed capital requirements.

Certain deferred tax assets and liabilities have been offset. The following is the analysis of the deferred tax balances (after 
offset) for financial reporting purposes:
2017 
£000
2016 
£000
Deferred tax liabilities (3,381) (3,187)
Deferred tax assets 3,594 2,617
213 (570)
At the balance sheet date, the Group has unused tax losses of £8,757 ,000 (2016 – £7 ,005,000) available for offset against future 
profits. Of the total deferred tax asset of £2,317 ,000 (2016 – £1,514,000), £844,000 (2016 – £933,000) has been recognised 
and is included above. These losses may be carried forward indefinitely.
At the balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of overseas 
subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised was approximately £46,570,000 (2016 – £37 ,134,000). 
No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the 
reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future. It is 
likely that the majority of the overseas earnings would qualify for the UK dividend exemption but may be subject to foreign 
withholding taxes.

The UK defined benefit scheme surplus has been recognised as a non-current asset as the Group has a right to any remaining 
surplus after all liabilities are paid. The Trustees may not distribute any surplus without the agreement of the Group. If such 
agreement is withheld, the Trustees are required to repay any remaining funds to the Group.
a) UK defined benefit scheme
The Group operates a UK defined benefit pension plan providing benefits based on final pensionable pay which is funded. This 
scheme was closed to new employees on 30 September 2002 (with the option of reopening if required) and was converted to 
a Career Average Revalued Earnings basis on 30 September 2004. The scheme closed to future benefit accrual with effect 
from 1 April 2015. Pensions are also payable to dependants on death. Administration on behalf of the members is governed by 
a trust deed, and the funds are held and managed by professional investment managers who are independent of the Group.
Contributions to the scheme are made in accordance with advice from an external, professionally qualified actuary, 
Broadstone Corporate Benefits Limited, at rates which are calculated to be sufficient to meet the future liabilities of the 
scheme. Scheme assets are stated at their market values at the respective balance sheet dates. AVEVA GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017

Company contributions were £1,580,000 (2016 – £1,580,000), comprising deficit contributions totalling £1,400,000 per annum 
plus an administration charge of £180,000. The total contributions in 2017 /18 and 2018/19 are expected to be approximately 
£1,580,000 in each year.
The PPF levy of approximately £28,000 was payable in addition (2016 – £20,000). 
The assumed discount rate, inflation rate and mortality all have a significant effect on the IAS 19 accounting valuation.

b) German defined benefit schemes
There are three defined benefit pension schemes in AVEVA GmbH. Tribon Solutions GmbH operated an unfunded defined 
benefit scheme that provides benefits to three deferred members following an acquisition in 1992. No current employees 
participate in the scheme and it is closed to new applicants. Benefit payments are made as they fall due. The scheme was 
transferred to AVEVA GmbH when Tribon Solutions GmbH and AVEVA GmbH merged in 2005. 
Since the acquisition of Bocad in May 2012, AVEVA Software GmbH had been responsible for the pension obligations of six 
former Bocad employees. At the time of the acquisition, the pension obligations were only partly financed via external funding 
vehicles. In March 2013, AVEVA concluded an agreement with an external insurance provider which resulted in the insurance 
company being obliged to provide all benefits as detailed in the individual pension commitments, with AVEVA only having an 
obligation if the external insurance provider defaults.
In addition, AVEVA GmbH operates a defined benefit pension scheme for one employee. This scheme is closed to  
new members.  AVEVA GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017

c) South Korean severance pay
South Korean employees are entitled to a lump sum on severance of their employment equal to one month’s salary for each 
year of service. The IAS 19 valuation of the liability has been carried out using the following assumptions:

The retirement age for AVEVA Korea Limited employees is 60 years of age (2016 – 60 years of age). 
d) Other retirement schemes
All Swedish employees employed by AVEVA AB aged 28 or over are members of the ITP , an industry scheme for salaried 
employees which provides benefits in addition to the state pension arrangements. The ITP scheme is managed by Alecta,  
a Swedish insurance company. It is a multi-employer defined benefit scheme with a supplementary defined contribution 
component. AVEVA AB pays monthly premiums to the insurers which vary by age, service and salary of the employee. AVEVA 
AB is unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities in the scheme on a fair and reasonable basis because 
this information is not provided by the scheme and therefore has accounted for the scheme as if it was a defined contribution 
pension scheme. At 31 March 2017 , Alecta’s surplus in the form of collective funding level was 152% (2016 – 144%) which was 
calculated in accordance with the Swedish Annual Accounts Act for Insurance Companies. The total cost charged to the 
income statement was £879,042 (2016 – £701,550).
e) Defined contribution schemes
The Group operates defined contribution retirement schemes for certain UK, US, German, French, Norwegian and Asian 
employees. The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the Group. The total cost charged to income of 
£6,465,670 (2016 – £6,346,000) represents contributions payable to these schemes by the Group at the rates specified in  
the rules of the plans.
26 Share-based payment plans
The Group has four equity-settled share schemes: the AVEVA Group plc Long- Term Incentive Plan (L TIP); the AVEVA Group 
Management Bonus Deferred Share Scheme; the AVEVA Group plc Senior Employee Restricted Share Plan 2015; and the 
AVEVA Group plc Executive Share Option Scheme 2007 . No grants have been made under the 2007 scheme which was 
approved at the Annual General Meeting on 12 July 2007 . Details of these plans are set out below.

The average fair value of options granted during the year was £17 .32 (2016 – £19.55). In calculating the fair value, the expected 
life of the options is based on historical data and is not necessarily indicative of exercise patterns that may occur. The expected 
volatility reflects the assumption that the historical volatility is indicative of future trends, which may also not necessarily be 
the actual outcome.
The Group recognised an expense of £1,084,000 related to equity-settled share-based payment transactions in the year ended 
31 March 2017 (2016 – expense of £494,000).
Details of the share option plans are as follows:
a) Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)
The following awards have been made under the L TIP . The exercise price is equal to the nominal value of the underlying 
shares, which is 3.56 pence. Options under the L TIP are normally exercisable in full or in part between the third and tenth

2016/17 awards
In 2016/17 , a total of 125,559 share options were awarded to Executive Directors and senior management under the L TIP . The 
performance conditions attached to this award are based on EPS growth over the three years from 2016/17 to 2018/19. If 
average adjusted diluted Earnings Per Share (EPS) growth is more than 15% then all shares shall vest. If average adjusted 
diluted EPS growth over the same period is less than 5% then none of the shares will vest. For growth rates between 5% and 
15% the number of shares that vest will be determined by linear interpolation between 25% and 100%.

In 2015/16, a total of 253,610 share options were awarded to Executive Directors and senior management under the L TIP .  
The performance conditions attached to this award are based on EPS growth over the three years from 2015/16 to 2017 /18.  
If average adjusted diluted EPS growth is more than 20% then all shares shall vest. If average adjusted diluted EPS growth over 
the same period is less than 12% then none of the shares will vest. For growth rates between 12% and 20% the number of 
shares that vest will be determined by linear interpolation between 25% and 100%.
2014/15 awards
In 2014/15, a total of 189,740 share options were awarded to Executive Directors and senior management under the L TIP . The 
performance conditions attached to this award are based on EPS growth over the three years from 2014/15 to 2016/17 . If 
average adjusted diluted EPS growth is more than 20% then all shares shall vest. If average adjusted diluted EPS growth over 
the same period is less than 12% then none of the shares will vest. For growth rates between 12% and 20% the number of 
shares that vest will be determined by linear interpolation between 25% and 100%.
2013/14 awards
In 2013/14, a total of 136,886 share options were awarded to Executive Directors and senior management under the L TIP . The 
performance conditions attached to this award are based on EPS growth over the three years from 2013/14 to 2015/16. If 
average adjusted diluted EPS growth is more than 20% then all shares shall vest. If average adjusted diluted EPS growth over 
the same period is less than 14% then none of the shares will vest. For growth rates between 14% and 20% the number of 
shares that vest will be determined by linear interpolation between 25% and 100%.
b) Deferred annual bonus share plan
In 2008, the Company established the AVEVA Group Management Bonus Deferred Share Scheme 2008 (the Deferred Share 
Scheme). Directors and senior management participate in the scheme. Subject to the achievement of performance conditions 
relating to a single financial year, these incentive arrangements are intended to reward the recipient partly in cash and partly in 
ordinary shares in the Company to be delivered on a deferred basis.
In July 2016, the AVEVA Group Employee Benefit Trust 2008 awarded 2,160 (2016 – 2,131) deferred shares to the Executive 
Directors and senior management in respect of the bonus earned in the year ended 31 March 2016 (2016 – bonus earned in 
year ended 31 March 2015).
The award of deferred shares takes the form of nil-cost options exercisable by participants in three equal tranches, one in each 
of the three years following the year in which the award is made. The option may be exercised in the 42-day period beginning 
on the announcement of the financial results of the Group in each of the three calendar years after that in which the option 
was granted. The last date of the exercise is the end of the 42-day period following the announcement of the financial results 
of the Group in the third calendar year following that in which the option was granted or (if applicable) such later date as the 
Remuneration Committee may specify. These awards are made solely in respect of performance in the financial year 
immediately prior to their grant. Delivery of the deferred shares is not subject to further performance conditions but each 
participant is required to remain an employee or Director of the Group during the three-year vesting period in order to receive 
his deferred shares in full (except in the case of death or the occurrence of a takeover, reconstruction or amalgamation, or 
voluntary winding up of the Company).
c) AVEVA Group plc Senior Employee Restricted Share Plan 2015
In 2015, the Company established the AVEVA Group plc Senior Employee Restricted Share Plan 2015 (the Restricted Share 
Plan). The scheme allows awards of options to be made to senior management employees and the exercise price of awards 
granted is 3.56 pence, being the nominal value of the underlying shares. The right to exercise an option is subject to 
completion of a required period of continued employment within the Group, usually being three years. Options that are not 
exercised prior to the fifth anniversary (or, in the case of an award with an overall award period of more than four years, the 
sixth anniversary) of the date of grant shall lapse. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
105
In July 2016 a total of 61,311 options were granted to senior management. The shares under option are exercisable three years 
after the date of award.
In July 2015 a total of 66,638 options were granted to senior management. One-third of the shares under option are 
exercisable two years after the date of award and two-thirds of the shares under option are exercisable after three years.

COMPANY STATEMENT OF CHANGES IN SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY

NOTES TO THE COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1 Authorisation of Financial Statements and Corporate information
The financial statements of AVEVA Group plc (the Company) for the year ended 31 March 2017 were authorised for issue by 
the Board of Directors on 23 May 2017 and the balance sheet was signed on the Board’s behalf by Philip Aiken, the Group 
Chairman, and James Kidd, the CEO. AVEVA Group plc is a limited company incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales 
whose shares are publicly traded on the London Stock Exchange. The principal activity of the Company is that of a 
holding company.
These financial statements were prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure 
Framework (FRS 101) and in accordance with applicable accounting standards. The financial statements are prepared on the 
historical cost basis. The accounting policies which follow set out those policies which apply in preparing the financial 
statements for the year ended 31 March 2017 . The financial statements are presented in Sterling, rounded to the 
nearest thousand.
No income statement is presented by the Company as permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006. The results of 
AVEVA Group plc are included in the Consolidated financial statements of AVEVA Group plc. 
The Directors believe that the Company is well placed to manage its business risks successfully despite macroeconomic and 
geopolitical uncertainties. It has considerable financial resources and no borrowings. As a consequence of these factors and 
having reviewed the forecasts for the coming year, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that there are adequate 
resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Thus, they continue to adopt the going concern 
basis of accounting in preparing the annual financial statements. 
2 Summary of significant accounting policies
Explained below are the significant accounting policies of the Company. The full Statement of Group Accounting Policies is 
included on pages 113 to 120.
a) Basis of accounting
The Company has taken advantage of the following disclosure exemptions under FRS 101:
 – the requirements of IAS 7: Statement of Cash Flows
 – the requirements of IAS 8: IFRSs issued but not effective
 – the requirements of IFRS 2: Share-based payments
 – the requirements of IFRS 7: Financial Instruments: Disclosures
 – the requirements of IFRS 13: Fair value measurements
 – the requirements of IAS 24: Related party disclosures
The basis for all of the above exemptions is because equivalent disclosures are included in the Consolidated financial 
statements of the Group in which the entity is consolidated.
b) T axation
Corporation tax payable is provided on taxable profits using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively 
enacted by the balance sheet date. 
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date 
where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more, or a right to pay less, tax in the future have occurred at 
the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis at the average tax rates that are expected to apply 
in periods in which timing differences reverse, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance 
sheet date.
c) Share-based payments
The accounting policy in relation to share-based payment transactions is disclosed in full in the Consolidated financial 
statements. The Company recognises the expense relating to the Executive Directors. The Company also records a 
corresponding increase in its investments in subsidiaries with a credit to equity which is equivalent to the IFRS 2 cost in 
subsidiary undertakings.
d) Investments in subsidiaries
Fixed asset investments in subsidiaries are shown at cost less provision for impairment. AVEVA GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017

Corporate information
AVEVA Group plc is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom. The address of the  
registered office is given on page 123. AVEVA Group plc’s shares are publicly traded on the Official List of the London  
Stock Exchange. 
Basis of preparation
The accounting policies which follow set out those policies which apply in preparing the financial statements for the year 
ended 31 March 2017 . The Consolidated financial statements are presented in Pounds Sterling (£) and all values are rounded  
to the nearest thousand (£000) except when otherwise indicated.
The Group presents a non-GAAP performance measure on the face of the Consolidated income statement. The Directors 
believe that the ‘adjusted profit before tax’ and ‘adjusted diluted and basic earnings per share’ measures presented provide  
a reliable and consistent presentation of the underlying performance of the Group. Adjusted profit is not defined by IFRS and 
therefore may not be directly comparable with the ‘adjusted’ profit measures of other companies.
The business is managed and measured on a day-to-day basis using adjusted results. To arrive at adjusted results, certain 
adjustments are made for normalised and exceptional items that are individually important and which could, if included, 
distort the understanding of the performance for the year and the comparability between periods.
Normalised items
These are recurring items which management considers to have a distorting effect on the underlying results of the Group,  
and are non-cash items.
These items relate to amortisation of intangibles (excluding other software), share-based payment charges and fair value 
adjustments on financial derivatives, although other types of recurring items may arise. Recurring items are adjusted each  
year irrespective of materiality to ensure consistent treatment.
Exceptional items
These are items which are non-recurring and are identified by virtue of either their size or their nature. These items can 
include, but are not restricted to, the costs of significant restructuring exercises, fees associated with business combinations 
and costs incurred in integrating acquired companies. 
In the prior year deferred revenue was presented as part of the line item ‘trade and other payables’; in the current year deferred 
revenue is presented as a separate line item on the balance sheet. The prior year item ‘trade and other payables’ therefore 
decreased by the amount of deferred revenue of £46,874,000.
Statement of compliance
The Consolidated financial statements of AVEVA Group plc and all its subsidiaries (the Group) have been prepared in 
accordance with IFRS, as adopted by the European Union, as they apply to the financial statements of the Group for the year 
ended 31 March 2017 . The Group’s financial statements are also consistent with IFRSs as issued by the IASB. 
The parent Company financial statements of AVEVA Group plc have been prepared under the FRS 101 reduced disclosure 
framework and are included on pages 107 to 111.
Basis of consolidation
The Consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of AVEVA Group plc and its subsidiaries as at  
31 March each year. The financial statements of subsidiaries are prepared using existing GAAP for each country of operation. 
Adjustments are made to translate any differences that may exist between the respective local GAAP and IFRSs.
Inter-company balances and transactions, including unrealised profits arising from intra-Group transactions, have been 
eliminated in full.
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is obtained by the Group and cease to be consolidated from  
the date on which control is transferred out of the Group.
On acquisition, assets and liabilities of subsidiaries are measured at their fair values at the date of acquisition, with any excess 
of the cost of acquisition over this value being capitalised as goodwill.
Adoption of new and revised standards
The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial year. New standards and interpretations 
which came into force during the year did not have a significant impact on the Group’s financial statements.
STATEMENT OF GROUP ACCOUNTING POLICIES AVEVA GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
114
STATEMENT OF GROUP ACCOUNTING POLICIES
CONTINUED
New standards and interpretations not yet effective
The IASB have issued the following standards (although in some cases not yet adopted by the EU) which are expected to have 
implications for the reporting of the financial position or performance of the Group or which will require additional disclosures 
in future financial years:
Effective for periods 
commencing after
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers 1 January 2018
IFRS 16 Leases 1 January 2019
IFRS 2 Amendments – Classification and Measurement of Share-based payment transactions
IAS 7 Amendments – Disclosure initiative
IAS 12 Amendments – Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for unrealised losses
IFRS 10 and IAS 28 Amendments – Sales or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Associate or 
Joint Venture
1 January 2019 
The Group intends to adopt these standards in the first accounting period after the effective date. The Directors do not expect 
that the adoption of the standards listed above will have a material impact on the financial statements of the Group in future 
periods, except as noted below:
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers
IFRS 15 prescribes a principles-based approach to accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers, as well as 
additional reporting disclosures. The standard supersedes IAS 18 Revenue, IAS 11 Construction Contracts and several revenue-
related interpretations.
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers outlines a single comprehensive five-step model to account for how revenue 
as goods or services are transferred to customers. Furthermore, it provides new guidance on whether revenue should be 
recognised at a point in time or over time and, more specifically, includes guidance on revenue from licensing arrangements.
IFRS 15 must be applied for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. It is endorsed by the EU (except for the Clarifications 
to IFRS 15 issued by the IASB in April 2016). The Company plans to adopt IFRS 15 in its consolidated financial statements for 
the year ending 31 March 2019, using the full retrospective approach.
The Company has completed an initial assessment of the potential impact of the adoption of IFRS 15 on its consolidated 
financial statements. The main aspects of the assessment are outlined below:
(i) Rendering of services – transfer of control
Revenue from sales of initial licences and the initial software delivery element of rental licences is currently recognised upon 
delivery. Delivery occurs when the customer has access to the intellectual property described in the contract. In some limited 
circumstances, under the current policy, AVEVA may recognise revenue from a licence agreement rateably over the contract 
period. This assessment is based on whether AVEVA can reliably estimate the maintenance and support element of 
the contract. 
Under IFRS 15, revenue is recognised when a customer obtains control of the services. All distinct performance obligations 
relating to licences for software are transferred to the customer at a ‘point in time’ . Therefore, under IFRS 15, all revenue from 
software licences which are distinct performance obligations will be recognised at a ‘point in time’ and not ‘ over time’ . 
Based on the initial assessment, and in the absence of an uptake in AVEVA’s Cloud offerings, the Company does not anticipate 
material differences between the current policy and the requirement under IFRS 15 to recognise software licences at a ‘point 
in time’ .
(ii) Stand-alone selling prices
Revenue from contracts with separately-identifiable components (multiple-element arrangements) are currently recognised 
based on the relative fair value of the components. Under IFRS 15, the total consideration of a customer arrangement will be 
allocated based on their relative stand-alone selling prices. Stand-alone selling prices are determined based on list prices (with 
standard discounts where appropriate), the adjusted market assessment approach and the residual approach.
The Company has performed an initial comparison of the fair value approach under IAS 18 and the stand-alone selling prices 
under IFRS 15. Based on the initial assessment, these amounts are broadly the same, therefore the Company at this stage 
does not anticipate material differences in the revenue recognition based on stand-alone selling prices. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
115
(iii) Providing extended payment terms to customers
Under IAS 18, where AVEVA provides a customer with extended payment terms, the revenue is deferred until the consideration 
is due in accordance with the contract. Under IFRS 15, all the contractual payments are included in the transaction price and 
allocated to the performance obligations at the start of the contract. 
Based on the initial assessment, the Company has identified a potential impact on revenues for a limited number of contracts 
which, under IFRS 15, could be recognised in the Income Statement at an earlier point in time rather than deferring recognition 
until the stage payments are invoiced. The Company is currently performing a detailed analysis on a contract-by-contract basis 
to assess the related impact.
IFRS 16 Leases
IFRS 16 Leases (effective for the year ending 31 March 2020, not yet endorsed by the EU) will require all leases to be recognised 
on the balance sheet. Currently, IAS 17 Leases only requires leases categorised as finance leases to be recognised on the 
balance sheet, with leases categorised as operating leases not recognised. Lessees will recognise a ‘right of use’ asset and a 
corresponding liability on the balance sheet. The asset will be amortised over the length of the lease and the liability measured 
at amortised cost. It is currently not practicable to quantify the effect at the date of the publication of these financial 
statements. Existing operating lease commitments are set out in note 22.
Beyond the information above, it is not practicable to provide a reasonable estimate of the effect of these standards until  
a detailed review has been completed.
Significant accounting estimates
The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date that 
have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial 
year are discussed below:
Retirement benefit obligations
The determination of the Group’s obligations and expense for defined benefit pensions is dependent on the selection, by the 
Board of Directors, of assumptions used by the pension scheme actuary in calculating these amounts. The assumptions 
applied, together with sensitivity analysis, are described in note 25 and include, amongst others, the discount rate, the 
inflation rate, rates of increase in salaries and mortality rates. While the Directors consider that the assumptions are 
appropriate, significant differences in the actual experience or significant changes in assumptions may materially affect the 
reported amount of the Group’s future pension obligations, actuarial gains and losses included in the Consolidated statement 
of comprehensive income in future years and the future staff costs. The net carrying amount of retirement benefit obligations 
at 31 March 2017 was £3,810,000 (2016 – £5,162,000). This year for the first time there is also a net surplus on the UK defined 
benefit scheme of £1,222,000 (2016 – nil).
Provision for impairment of receivables
The Group makes provision for the impairment of receivables on a customer-specific basis. The determination of the 
appropriate level of provision involves an estimate of the potential risk of default or non-payment by the Group’s customers 
and management consider a number of factors, including the financial strength of the customers, the level of default that the 
Group has suffered in the past, the age of the receivable outstanding and the Group’s trading experience with that customer. 
The provision for impairment of receivables at 31 March 2017 was £6,054,000 (2016 – £5,879,000).
Revenue recognition
The assessments and estimates used by the Group for revenue recognition could have a significant impact on the amount  
and timing of revenue recognised.
Revenue from sales of software licences when these are combined with the delivery of significant implementation or 
customisation services is recognised in line with the delivery of the services to the customer. This policy involves the 
assessment of which customer projects include significant customisation or implementation and also an assessment of the 
stage of completion of such projects. 
The fair value estimate of the element of a customer rental fee attributable to the continuing right to use, and to customer 
support and maintenance, is reviewed periodically. On average, the element attributable to customer support and 
maintenance as a proportion of the initial software delivery is 17%. A 1% deviation in this percentage would not lead to  
a material change in revenue.  AVEVA GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017

STATEMENT OF GROUP ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Intangible assets
IFRS 3 requires the identification of acquired intangible assets as part of a business combination. The methods used to value 
such intangible assets require the use of estimates including forecast performance and customer attrition rates. Future results 
are impacted by the amortisation periods adopted and changes to the estimated useful lives would result in different effects 
on the income statement.
Goodwill is tested annually for impairment. Tests for impairment are based on discounted cash flows and assumptions 
(including discount rates, timing and growth prospects) which are inherently subjective. Further details about the assumptions 
used are set out in note 14.
Revenue
The Group generates its revenue principally from licensing the rights to use its software products directly to end users and to  
a lesser extent indirectly through resellers. Revenue is measured at fair value of the consideration received or receivable and 
represents the amounts receivable for goods and services provided in the ordinary course of business, net of discounts and 
sales taxes. It comprises initial licence fees, annual fees and rental licence fees, together with income from consultancy and 
other related services.
For each revenue stream, revenue is not recognised unless and until:
 – a clear contractual arrangement can be evidenced;
 – delivery has been made in accordance with that contract;
 – if required, contractual acceptance criteria have been met; and
 – the fee has been agreed and collectability is probable. Where extended payment terms beyond 90 days exist, appropriate 
approvals are obtained to ensure there is sufficient comfort that collectability is probable and the fee is determinable.  
If approvals are not obtained, revenue recognition is deferred until payment is due.
Initial/annual licence agreements
Users are charged an initial licence fee upon installation for a set number of users together with an obligatory annual fee, 
which is charged every year. Annual fees consist of the continuing right to use and customer support and maintenance, which 
includes core product upgrades and enhancements, and remote support services. Users must continue to pay annual fees in 
order to maintain the right to use the software.
Initial licence fees are recognised once the above conditions have been met. Annual fees are recognised on a straight-line 
basis over the period of the contract, which is typically 12 months. If annual fees are charged at a discount, an amount is 
allocated out of the initial licence fee at fair market value based on the value established when annual fees are charged 
separately to customers.
Rental licence agreements
As an alternative to the initial licence fee plus annual fee model, the Group also supplies its software under three different 
types of rental licence agreement.
Rental licence fees which are invoiced monthly and which are cancellable by the customer are recognised on a monthly basis. 
Other rental licence agreements are invoiced at the start of the contracted period, which is typically one year, are non-
cancellable and consist of two separate components; the initial software delivery, and the continuing right to use with 
customer support and maintenance. Revenue in respect of the continuing right to use and customer support and 
maintenance element is valued at fair market value based on the value established when annual fees are charged separately  
to the customer. This component is recognised on a straight-line basis over the period of the contract. The residual amount 
representing the implied initial fee element is recognised upfront, provided all of the above criteria have been met. Where 
uncertainty exists and it is not possible to reliably determine the fair value of the customer support and maintenance element, 
all revenue is recognised on a straight-line basis over the period of the contract.
The Group also licenses its software using a token licensing model. Under this model, a ‘basket’ of tokens representing 
licences to use different software products over a defined period is granted, which enables the customer to draw these down 
as and when required. Where the customer commits in advance to a specified number of tokens over a defined period, a 
proportion of revenue is recognised with an appropriate element deferred for customer support and maintenance obligations, 
subject to the above recognition conditions being met. Where the customer is charged in arrears, revenue is recognised based 
on the actual number of tokens used. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
117
Services
Services consist primarily of consultancy, implementation services and training and are performed under separate service 
arrangements. Revenue from these services is recognised as the services are performed and stage of completion is 
determined by reference to the costs incurred as a proportion of the total estimated costs of the service project. If a contract 
cannot be reliably estimated, revenue is recognised only to the extent that costs have been incurred. Provision is made as 
soon as a loss is foreseen.
If an arrangement includes both licence and service elements, licence fee revenue is recognised upon delivery of the software 
provided that services do not include significant customisation or modification of the base product and the payment terms for 
licences are not subject to acceptance criteria. In all other cases, revenues from both licence and service elements are 
recognised as services are performed.
Foreign currencies
The functional and presentational currency of AVEVA Group plc is Pounds Sterling (£). Transactions in foreign currencies are 
initially recorded at the functional currency rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the functional currency rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. 
All differences are taken to the Consolidated income statement.
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate 
as at the date of the initial transaction.
The subsidiaries have a number of different functional currencies. As at the reporting date, the assets and liabilities of these 
overseas subsidiaries are translated into Pounds Sterling (£) at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date, and their 
income statements are translated at the weighted average exchange rates for the year. Exchange differences arising on the 
retranslation are taken directly to the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income. 
Goodwill
Goodwill on acquisitions is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the cost of the business combination over the 
acquirer’s interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities. Following initial recognition, 
goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. 
Where goodwill forms part of a cash-generating unit and part of the operation within that unit is disposed of, the goodwill 
associated with the operation disposed of is included in the carrying amount of the operation when determining the gain or 
loss on disposal of the operation. Goodwill disposed of in this circumstance is measured on the basis of the relative values of 
the operation disposed of and the portion of the cash-generating unit retained.
If the potential benefit of tax losses or other deferred tax assets does not satisfy the criteria in IFRS 3 for separate recognition 
when a business combination is initially accounted for but is subsequently realised, the Group recognises the deferred tax 
income in the Consolidated income statement.
Intangible assets
Intangible assets acquired separately are capitalised at cost and from a business acquisition are capitalised at fair value as at 
the date of acquisition. Following initial recognition, the cost model is applied to each class of intangible asset as set out below. 
Expenditure on internally developed intangible assets, excluding development costs, is taken to the Consolidated income 
statement in the year in which it is incurred. Internal software development expenditure is recognised as an intangible asset 
only after its technical feasibility and commercial viability can be demonstrated.
Useful lives are also examined on an annual basis and adjustments, where applicable, are made on a prospective basis. 
Amortisation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful economic lives of the asset, which are as follows:
Years
Developed technology 5–12
Customer relationships 5–20
Purchased brand 5
Other software 3
Purchased software rights 5–10
Research expenditure
Research expenditure is written off in the year of expenditure. AVEVA GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017

STATEMENT OF GROUP ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Government grants
Grants in respect of specific Research & Development projects are recognised as receivable when there is reasonable 
assurance that they will be received and the conditions to obtain them have been complied with. They are credited to the 
income statement in the same period as the related Research & Development costs for which the grant is compensating.  
The grant income is presented as a deduction from the related expense.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses. 
Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis to write down the assets to their estimated residual value over the useful 
economic life of the asset as follows:
Years
Computer equipment 3
Fixtures, fittings and office equipment 6–8
Motor vehicles 4
Leasehold buildings and improvements are amortised on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease (3 to 49 years) or 
useful economic life, if shorter. 
Impairment of assets
Goodwill arising on acquisition is allocated to cash-generating units expected to benefit from the combination’s synergies and 
represents the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes and generates cash flows which 
are independent of other cash-generating units. The recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which goodwill has 
been allocated is tested for impairment annually or when events or changes in circumstance indicate that it might be impaired. 
The carrying values of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets other than goodwill are reviewed for impairment 
when events or changes in circumstance indicate the carrying value may be impaired. If any such indication exists and where 
the carrying values exceed the estimated recoverable amount, the assets or cash-generating units are written down to their 
recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the greater of net selling price and value in use. In assessing value in use, the 
estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market 
assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. For an asset that does not generate largely 
independent cash inflows, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. 
Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement in the administrative expenses line item.
Trade and other receivables
Trade receivables, which generally have 30 to 90 day terms, are recognised and carried at original invoice amount less an 
allowance for any uncollectible amounts. An estimate for doubtful debts is made when collection of the full amount is no 
longer probable. Bad debts are written off when identified.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and short-term deposits in the Consolidated balance sheet comprise cash at bank and in hand and short-term deposits 
with an original maturity of three months or less. The carrying amount of these approximates their fair value. For the purpose 
of the Consolidated cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as defined above, 
net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
Derivative financial instruments
The only derivative financial instruments the Group holds are forward foreign exchange contracts to reduce exposure to 
foreign exchange risk. The Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. All forward 
foreign exchange contracts have been marked-to-market and are held at fair value on the Consolidated balance sheet. The 
Group has not applied hedge accounting during the year and therefore movements in fair value are being recorded in the 
Consolidated income statement. Fair value is estimated using the settlement rates prevailing at the period end.
Leases
Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and benefits of ownership of the asset are classified as operating 
leases. Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense in the Consolidated income statement on a straight-line basis 
over the lease term. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
119
Taxation
The Group is subject to income tax in numerous jurisdictions. The Group recognises provisions for tax based on estimates of 
taxes that are likely to become due. Where the final tax outcome is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, 
such differences will impact the current income tax and deferred tax provisions in the period in which such determinations 
are made. 
Deferred income tax is provided, using the liability method, on all temporary differences at the balance sheet date between 
the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes.
Legislation has been enacted to allow UK companies to elect for the Research & Development Expenditure Credit (RDEC)  
on qualifying expenditure incurred since 1 April 2013, instead of the super-deduction rules. At the balance sheet date, 
management has concluded that the election will be made and therefore the RDEC is recorded as income included in profit 
before tax, netted against Research & Development expenses as the RDEC is of the nature of a government grant. 
Deferred income tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences:
 – except where the deferred income tax liability arises from goodwill amortisation or the initial recognition of an asset or 
liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting 
profit nor taxable profit or loss; and
 – in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, except where the timing of the 
reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse  
in the foreseeable future. 
Deferred income tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, carry-forward of unused tax assets and 
unused tax losses to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary 
differences, carry-forward of unused tax assets and unused tax losses can be utilised:
 – except where the deferred income tax asset relating to the deductible temporary difference arises from the initial 
recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, 
affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss; and
 – in respect of deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, deferred tax assets are only 
recognised to the extent that it is probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable 
profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that  
it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset to 
be utilised.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the year when the asset  
is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the 
balance sheet date.
The income tax effects of items recorded in either other comprehensive income or equity are recognised in the Consolidated 
statement of comprehensive income or the Consolidated statement of changes in shareholders’ equity respectively. 
Otherwise, income tax is recognised in the Consolidated income statement. 
Revenue, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of sales taxes except:
 – where the sales tax incurred on a purchase of goods and services is not recoverable from the taxation authority, in which 
case the sales tax is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of the expense item as applicable; and
 – receivables and payables are stated with the amount of sales taxes included.
The net amount of sales taxes recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority is included as part of receivables or 
payables in the Consolidated balance sheet. 
Post retirement benefits
The Group operates defined benefit pension schemes in the UK, Sweden and Germany. The Group also provides certain post 
employment benefits to its South Korean employees. 
The UK defined benefit pension scheme, previously available to all UK employees, was closed to new applicants in 2002 and 
closed to future accrual from 31 March 2015. UK employees are now offered membership of a defined contribution scheme. AVEVA GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
120
STATEMENT OF GROUP ACCOUNTING POLICIES
CONTINUED
The German unfunded defined benefit schemes are closed to new applicants and provide benefits to nine deferred members. 
These schemes were acquired as part of previous business combinations. No current employees participate in the schemes. 
Full provision has been made for the liability on the Consolidated balance sheet. The Group also operates a defined benefit 
pension scheme for one German employee.
The Group provides pension arrangements to its Swedish employees through an industry-wide defined benefit scheme. It is 
not possible to identify the share of the underlying assets and liabilities in the scheme which is attributable to the Group on a 
fair and reasonable basis. Therefore, the Group has applied the provisions in IAS 19 to account for the scheme as if it was a 
defined contribution scheme.
For the defined benefit schemes, the defined benefit obligation is calculated annually for each plan by qualified external 
actuaries using the projected unit credit method which attributes entitlement to benefits to the current period (to determine 
current service cost) and to the current and prior periods (to determine the present value of defined benefit obligation). The 
retirement benefit liability in the Consolidated balance sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit obligation 
(using a discount rate derived from a published index of AA rated corporate bonds) as reduced by the fair value of plan assets 
out of which the obligations are to be settled directly. Fair value is based on market price information and in the case of quoted 
securities is the published bid price. The value of a net pension benefit asset is restricted to the present value of any amount 
the Group expects to recover by way of refunds from the plan or reductions in the future contributions. The current service 
cost is recognised in the Consolidated income statement as an employee benefit expense. The net interest element of the 
defined benefit cost is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net defined benefit liability or asset.
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments or changes in actuarial assumptions are credited or charged  
in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income in the period in which they arise.
The Group also operates defined contribution pension schemes for a number of UK and non-UK employees. Contributions to 
defined contribution plans are charged to profit before tax as they become payable.
Share-based payments
The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the date at which they are 
granted, further details of which are given in note 26. 
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period in 
which the performance conditions are fulfilled, ending on the date on which the relevant employees become fully entitled to 
the award (vesting date). The cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date until the 
vesting date reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the Group’s best estimate of the number of equity 
instruments that will ultimately vest.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market 
condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market condition is satisfied, provided that all other 
performance conditions are satisfied.
Where the terms of an equity-settled award are modified, as a minimum an expense is recognised as if the terms had not been 
modified. In addition, an expense is recognised for any increase in the value of the transaction as a result of the modification, 
as measured at the date of modification.
Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation and any expense not yet 
recognised for the award is recognised immediately. However, if a new award is substituted for the cancelled award, and 
designated as a replacement award on the date that it is granted, the cancelled and new awards are treated as if they were a 
modification of the original award, as described in the previous paragraph. 
The dilutive effect of outstanding options is reflected as additional share dilution in the computation of earnings per share, 
subject to an estimate of whether performance conditions will be met.
Employee benefit trust
The Group has established an employee benefit trust (AVEVA Group Employee Benefit Trust 2008), which is a separately 
administered trust and is funded by loans from Group companies. The assets of the trust comprise shares in AVEVA Group plc 
and cash balances. The Group recognises assets and liabilities of the trust in the Consolidated financial statements and shares 
held by the trust are recorded at cost as a deduction from shareholders’ equity.
Consideration received for the sale of shares held by the trust is recognised in equity, with any difference between the 
proceeds from the sale and the original cost being taken to retained earnings.  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
