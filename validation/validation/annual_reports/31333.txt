06 Report for the period ending 31 December 2017 Xeros Technology Group plc This has been another year of 
considerable progress at Xeros.
We also commenced implementation of our plan to move our 
Hotel & Lodging business to a low-cost model with the launch 
of the Symphony Project in April 2017. Symphony Project 
enables OEMs to integrate Xeros’ technology into their own-
branded products and to use their existing channels for its 
commercialisation. Subject to successful validation and testing 
we are targeting OEMs to begin this commercialisation in 2019. 
At the end of the year, we had a total of 381 commissioned 
machines earning revenue, a growth of 80% during the year. 
Our learning and US market presence has been instrumental 
in creating demand for Xeros’ benefits in multiple new 
geographies and has provided credibility for all the applications 
we are now looking to commercialise.
Following the contract signature with Wollsdorf Leder, 
our Tanning Technologies team have successfully delivered 
many scale trials with leading European tanneries. With 
the technology itself now proven, focus has been on 
completing the engineering solutions which customers 
need to incorporate the technology into their process. Our 
plan is to sign a number of multi-year contracts in 2018.
The development of Textile Technologies, which we started in 
mid-2016, is now delivering comparable water and chemistry 
savings to those achieved by our other applications. Following 
further scale trials, we are planning to engage with major 
garment manufacturers and targeting to sign development 
agreements by the end of the year.
We have a clear commercialisation strategy predicated on 
generating returns on our intellectual property. We only 
physically enter markets where it is imperative for us to prove 
out and de-risk our applications, ahead of licensing or selling 
our technology to others who are best placed to maximise 
their commercial potential. 
Our strategy is dependent upon a robust intellectual property 
portfolio which at the end of March 2018 totalled 48 “pending” 
and “granted” patent families which represents an increase 
of 7 since the beginning of 2017.
In December, we raised £25m before fees to accelerate the 
commercialisation of our application portfolio and to achieve 
specific commercial milestones in each of our businesses, 
thereby giving a clear line of sight to monetisation of our 
intellectual property portfolio.
The Board and I view the Group as now being close to a 
number of major inflection points, each of which has the 
capacity to generate significant value for our investors, many 
of whom have been supportive since the inception of the 
Group in 2006. Their loyalty, combined with the continued 
commitment and dedication of our employees, has taken us 
to this point. I look forward to 2018 being a pivotal year in the 
development of the Group.

Having now materially completed the development for the
majority of our chosen applications, the Group is focused on
their commercialisation under IP-rich, capital-light business
models. 
After many years of groundbreaking innovation, we are now in 
the position of being able to engage meaningfully with major 
industry players around the world, who are best placed to 
market and sell our technologies into the global markets they 
serve.
Our applications are targeted at global scale industries, the 
long-term viability of which are being threatened by increasing 
water constraints and pollution challenges. Xeros’ technologies 
materially improve sustainability whilst simultaneously delivering 
performance and economic benefits. In this respect, Xeros 
represents a unique solution to a world already suffering from 
high water stress, which will only increase with population 
growth and continued urbanisation. 
During the year, we continued to demonstrate and prove 
the benefits of Xeros technology in our Cleaning and Tanning 
Technology businesses. We also established that we have the 
potential to create significant value with our Textile applications.
In Cleaning Technologies, we established a new business 
unit, High Performance Workwear, which made a number 
of acquisitions in the fifteen months to April 2018 to build a 
platform from which to serve firefighters across the US. The 
application of Xeros’ technology significantly reduces harmful 
contamination in firefighters’ expensive Personal Protective 
Equipment (“PPE”) whilst simultaneously extending its life. 
The learning and knowledge from owning these businesses 
will create a platform that we believe will create a valuable 
proprietary asset that can be leveraged to bring our technology 
to PPE markets on a global basis.
In the domestic market, we launched our new low cost 
domestic washing machine design, the XDrum
TM
, to wide 
acclaim at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas in 
January 2018. We also unveiled our proprietary microparticle 
filtration solution, the XFiltra
TM
, which radically reduces the 
micro-plastic pollution produced by the washing of synthetic 
garments. Our objective in doing so was to start meaningful 
discussions with major OEMs, which are now underway. 
07 Xeros Technology Group plc Report for the period ending 31 December 2017
Chairman’s statement “The Xeros machines’ water and 
power savings will provide our 
department with long-term savings. 
I am most impressed with the 
customer service at Xeros, they truly 
value their customers. Xeros will 
continue to revolutionize the way 
we clean firefighter gear. They are 
committed to the health and safety 
of firefighters.”

08 Report for the period ending 31 December 2017 Xeros Technology Group plc We have established that our 
technologies can deliver these 
benefits in three world-scale 
industries: cleaning, tanning and 
textiles. We are now progressively 
commercialising applications 
in these sectors to generate 
profitable returns, leveraging 
our intellectual property and 
know-how with low capital 
requirements.
Mark Nichols
Chief Executive Officer
Strategic review
Xeros develops polymer based technologies which radically 
improve the sustainability, performance and economics 
of water intensive processes, dramatically reducing water, 
chemistry, energy and effluent whilst either meeting or 
exceeding the conventional quality standards for the materials 
being processed.
We have established that our technologies can deliver these 
benefits in three world-scale industries: cleaning, tanning and 
textiles. We are now progressively commercialising applications 
in these sectors to generate profitable returns, leveraging 
our intellectual property and know-how with low capital 
requirements.
Given the scale of the markets in which we operate, our 
strategy is to commercialise our technology with partners 
who already have strong international market positions and 
who also demonstrate a strategic intent to deliver increased 
levels of sustainability. The disruptive nature of our technology 
enables the creation of new high value-added business models 
and revenue streams. Where necessary, we enter markets 
ourselves to prove out our propositions so that our prospective 
partners benefit from materially lower risk profiles when they 
join us in the commercialisation process.
In order to accelerate the adoption of our technology, we have 
increased and aligned our resources to each of the application 
areas that we are pursuing with the vast majority being applied 
to those with nearer term profitability. Commercialisation is 
in progress in our Cleaning Technologies business with Hotel 
& Lodging and High Performance Workwear business units 
generating revenue of £2.0m and £0.2m respectively. We are 
targeting Tanning Technologies to deliver its first revenues in 
2018 with Textile Technologies revenues in 2019, once scale 
trials have been completed.
Having proven the scale and the quantum of the economic 
improvements of many of our applications, we are now 
organised to generate revenues where the time horizons 
for generating significant income from our investments are 
increasingly in the near term.
In December, we raised £25m before fees in an oversubscribed 
placing to accelerate the commercialisation of our application 
portfolio and to achieve specific commercial milestones in 
each of our businesses, thereby giving a clear line of sight to 
monetisation of our intellectual property portfolio. The Group 
expects to raise further funds in 2018 for the execution of 
specific commercialisation strategies.
Chief Executive Officer’s review
09 Xeros Technology Group plc Report for the period ending 31 December 2017 Operating review
Cleaning Technologies
High Performance Workwear
Having extensively trialled our technology in the high added 
value Personal Protective Equipment (“PPE”) market during 
2017, we entered this market with the acquisition of Marken 
PPE Restoration’s operations in Nevada in July 2017. Turnover 
for the five months ended December 2017 totalled £0.2m. This 
was an initial step in our aim to create a nation-wide network 
which will enable us to serve the US firefighter market. We have 
since acquired our second and third sites in Atlanta and Miami 
through the acquisition of the trade and assets of Gloves Inc. 
in March 2018 and are targeting to open two more by the end 
of the current year. Our target is to have a total of five sites by 
the end of 2018 with full national coverage of the US achieved 
by the end of 2019.
The US firefighter PPE market is a specialist market for the 
cleaning, inspection and repair of uniforms and is valued at 
approximately $330m p.a. With 1.1m firefighters in the US, there 
are 350,000 professional firefighters based in approximately 
8,000 fire crews. Nearly 40% of these professional firefighters 
are based within 100 miles of one of the top 10 major US 
metropolitan areas. Each professional firefighter has, on 
average, two sets of bespoke turnout gear.
Once our network in the US is completed, we believe we will 
create a valuable proprietary asset which can be leveraged 
to bring our technology to PPE markets on a global basis. 
The PPE market spans many additional sub-segments 
including petrochemicals, mining, military and transportation, 
many of which are becoming increasingly aware of the adverse 
and potentially dangerous effects of incorrectly or insufficiently 
cleaned workwear. In the transportation sector, we increased 
the footprint of machines in France cleaning the PPE of SNCF’s 
workers to six by the end of December 2017.
The ability of Xeros’ technology to significantly outperform 
conventional cleaning technologies, coupled with major cost 
savings from extending the life of expensive PPE garments, 
puts Xeros in a unique position to create high added value for 
our customers and our shareholders.
Domestic Laundry
During 2017, we developed a new solution called the XDrum
TM 
to simply and inexpensively incorporate Xeros’ cleaning 
technology inside a domestic washing machine. Similar 
to High Performance Workwear, we have demonstrated 
that Xeros’ technology can improve cleaning results whilst 
simultaneously making garments look better for longer. 
In so doing, we have the capacity to provide consumers 
with washing outcomes which are better, cheaper and 
more environmentally friendly than conventional washing 
machine technology.
We unveiled the XDrum
TM
 technology at the Consumer 
Electronics Show (“CES”) in January 2018, following which we 
have entered into structured discussions with a number of 
major OEMs with the objective of licensing our technology.
In response to the increasing amounts of micro-plastic 
pollution from synthetic fibres in fabrics and garments that 
are released when they are washed, Xeros also unveiled its 
proprietary XFiltra
TM
 technology at CES. The Company expects 
regulatory authorities across the world to increasingly demand 
that OEMs place such filters in their washing machines to 
reduce the micro-plastic pollution. 
Xeros’ XFiltra
TM
 is a novel, simple, low cost solution to meet 
this need. A licensing process similar to that of XDrum
TM
 
is being developed as a potential revenue stream.
The estimated global market size for domestic washing 
machines in 2015 was 119m units including 57m units sold 
in China.
Hotel & Lodging
We entered the US market in 2013 with our own brand 
machines and an ‘all requirements’ multi-year contract 
package, which was sold and delivered by our own staff in 
combination with ‘Forward Channel Partners’. In 2017, we 
initiated a plan to transition to a business model whereby 
major market incumbents incorporate and sell our proprietary 
technology in exchange for royalties.
To this end we announced Symphony Project in April 2017 and 
demonstrated a leading conventional branded commercial 
size washing machine with Xeros’ technology inside at the 
Clean Show in Las Vegas in June. Following this demonstration, 
we are currently working with two major OEMs on the testing 
and validation of Xeros’ technology inside their own branded 
machines. The objective being to have these companies 
marketing, selling and servicing machines incorporating Xeros’ 
technology through their own well-established channels.
10
Chief Executive Officer’s review continued
Report for the period ending 31 December 2017 Xeros Technology Group plc Simultaneously, we have signed agreements with Forward 
Channel Partners in Australia, UAE and South Africa, who 
will market, sell and provide the full set of services for Xeros 
enabled machines. A number of additional opportunities 
in high water shortage/price countries are in the pipeline. 
We have adopted a similar approach in the US with a high 
focus on metropolitan areas with acute water shortages. This 
targeted approach to the US market will be with a reduced 
direct sales and service force and with focused Forward 
Channel Partners.
Having validated the value and benefits of our technology in 
the years since our market entry, the new model to which we 
are migrating will enable broader market penetration of our 
technology but with lower capital intensity for Xeros, both in 
operational and financial terms; the savings being redeployed 
to commercialise our other applications.
The Information Technology solutions required to implement 
the new commercialisation model met major milestones 
during the year, with the release of the XConnect
TM
 online 
portal. The portal provides complete operational, financial and 
sustainability information with which to manage and optimise 
on-premise laundries.
As part of our strategy to commercialise our technologies 
in China, the Company joined the UK Department of 
International Trade’s mission to exhibit the country’s best 
advanced manufacturing and innovation companies at the 
International Industrial Fair in Shanghai in November 2017. 
Xeros was selected to participate alongside major UK brands 
and technologies including Jaguar Land Rover, Dyson, McLaren 
and The Graphene Institute. Xeros is now actively developing 
opportunities for the licensing of its Cleaning Technologies 
in China.
In October 2017, we started to implement the relocation of all 
our US operations (excluding High Performance Workwear) 
into a new facility in Providence, Rhode Island. It was 
commissioned in March 2018. The facility, which benefits 
from favourable tax incentives, will consolidate four office 
and warehouse locations and result in cost savings.
Additional measures taken to increase penetration of 
the market included commercialising, at scale, our 16kg 
commercial washing machine to supplement our 25kg version. 
The first trial units were delivered to US customers in late 2016, 
with 88 commissioned by the end of 2017.
Including both our 25kg and 16kg machine options, the total 
number of machines commissioned and generating revenue 
grew by 169 during the year commencing 1 January 2017 to 
a total of 381 at the end of December 2017.
Our plan in this application is for Xeros to make a financial 
return on its intellectual property and know-how with 
relatively low capital intensity. Our target is that by the end 
of 2020, a machine incorporating Xeros’ technology will 
be commissioned every working hour, with each providing 
a royalty to Xeros.
Tanning Technologies
As of the end of March 2018, our tanning team have processed 
over 2,300 hides in trials in the Retanning and Dyeing phases 
of the tanning process with multiple tanneries. Production 
scale trials have proven that our technology works for all hide 
applications, including auto and shoe leather, and in the 
different drum types used in their production irrespective 
of their construction material. 
As of the end of March 2018, we have designed the 
engineering solutions required to introduce our polymers 
into the tanning process, manage them during the cycle, 
and then remove them from hides before their reuse. These 
developments are a significant step forward for transitioning 
tanneries from trials to contract and implementation. Under 
proposed contracts, the cost of the equipment that Xeros 
would supply would be reimbursed, so making the business 
one of low capital intensity for the Group.
Our business model for this industry is one of sharing gains 
with customers under long-term contracts. This has been 
validated by the contract signed with Wollsdorf Leder in 
July 2017 and in other ongoing commercial negotiations. 
We await a start date for implementing our engineering 
solutions in Wollsdorf. Following customer acceptance of 
our engineering solutions, revenue will be generated.
We are currently focused on commercialising our technology 
in the Retanning and Dyeing stages which use large volumes 
of water to apply specialty chemicals. In due course, we will 
also move upstream to the Tanning stages of the process 
which typically uses proportionately more water to apply bulk 
chemicals. 
We estimate that 300 million bovine hides are tanned per 
annum and we target to be applying our technology to up 
to 20% of this market by the end of 2022.
Textile Technologies
During 2017, we ratified our mid-2016 decision to include 
textiles applications within our commercialisation plans due to 
the scale of the global textiles industry and the very significant 
water and chemistry usage within the industry. We have 
now successfully demonstrated that Xeros’ technology has 
the capacity to deliver water, chemistry, energy and effluent 
reductions which at least match performance outcomes in 
our other selected applications. 
We are achieving these results in Denim Finishing and 
Garment Dyeing with reductions in chemical and water 
consumption of up to 70%, initially in lab scale trials but now 
also increasingly at larger scale. In the case of Denim Finishing, 
we have also achieved significant reductions in cycle time.
We have the capacity to dramatically reduce 
water, chemistry, energy and effluent whilst 
either meeting or exceeding the conventional 
quality standards.
11 Xeros Technology Group plc Report for the period ending 31 December 2017 Our scale trials have been conducted in our Technology Centre 
using adapted commercial size washing machines which are 
equivalent to the engineered solutions used in the industry.
We have concurrently been working on filing IP on our 
inventions on these applications with four applications made 
across both areas. With this protection in place, we anticipate 
moving to scale trials and development agreements with 
major manufacturers in the near term.
Xeros’ solutions in these applications offer manufacturers 
the resource and pollution reductions that consumers and 
governments are demanding. One example being the plan 
for “Zero Discharge of Hazardous Chemicals by 2020” which 
has 23 global clothing brands as signatories. 
This is a sizable opportunity for Xeros, with 22.7 million tonnes 
of natural fibres processed annually for the clothing and textiles 
industries, a third of those in China.
Polymer Technologies
During 2017 we completed the polymer developments 
necessary to begin commercialisation of all our present 
applications in Cleaning, Tanning and Textiles. In Cleaning 
Technologies, we use the cleaning properties of nylon 
polymers which are supplied by our global partner, BASF, 
under a multi-year agreement through to 2021. Polypropylene, 
which is broadly available on a global basis, is used for all our 
Tanning and Textiles applications. 
Our polymer science team continues to work on developing 
“Generation Three” polymers which use novel surface effects 
with the objective of delivering further major reductions in 
process inputs or improvements in our Cleaning Technologies. 
We are currently scaling these developments up at lab scale 
and in the event they are successful, we anticipate these 
improvements being introduced within a two year timeframe.
All our novel polymer and engineering developments are 
underpinned by Intellectual Property and in the 15 months to 
the end of March 2018 we increased our ‘pending’ or ‘granted’ 
patent families by seven to a total of 48. A number of these 
filings have the benefit of significantly extending the time 
horizon of the protection of our applications.
Outlook 
With the development of our Cleaning and Tanning 
Technologies materially completed during 2017, Xeros is now 
focused on their commercialisation. The proven sustainability, 
performance and economic benefits of our technologies 
have become increasingly understood and accepted by both 
consumers and those who serve them. They are attracting a 
number of major industry players to the table. We look forward 
to reaching formal agreements in the current year. 
The results from our Textiles programme are as material as 
those in Cleaning and Tanning. They indicate that we have 
the capacity to substantially improve the long-term viability 
of another global industry, which is currently under extreme 
pressure to reduce its environmental impact. We anticipate 
demonstrating these technologies at scale with manufacturers 
in the current year.
All of the commercialisation models for our applications are 
IP-rich and capital-light with our physical participation in the 
supply chain only undertaken at an early stage, when there is 
a need to prove out and de-risk our technologies for current 
market incumbents.
In December 2017 we raised £25m, before fees, from both 
existing and new investors to fund the business through to 
the realisation of significant commercial milestones by the end 
of 2018. In each of our businesses we have a clear strategy to 
achieve commercial inflection points in 2018 which will allow 
future monetisation of these businesses. With development 
work materially completed in 2017 and the foundations for 
commercialisation put in place, Xeros’ costs will remain fixed 
whilst revenues increase from licensing and other low capital 
intensity models.
Overall, the Group is trading in line with the Board’s 
expectations.

On a normalised basis, average monthly earned income is 30% 
higher than the previous period (year ended 31 December 
2017: £189,000 compared to 17-months to 31 December 2016: 
£145,000). Service income includes £249,000 from Marken PPE 
since its acquisition in July 2017. This income reflects the unit-
based pricing model in this business.
In the Hotel & Lodging business, the point at which revenue 
and costs from machine sales can be recognised is dependent 
on the completion of a number of stages. These include the 
installation of the machine, commissioning of the machine, 
acceptance of the machine by the customer, completion of 
utility incentive formalities, where applicable, and then, in the 
case of lease sales, finalisation of the lease agreement. The

Chief Financial Officer’s review
13 Xeros Technology Group plc Report for the period ending 31 December 2017 During the period the Group has focused on increasing its 
commissioning capacity in the Hotel & Lodging business 
through the use of Forward Channel Partners and this has 
resulted in an increase of 143 machines commissioned in 2017 
(17-month 31 December 2016: 64). At the start of the period the 
Group had 104 machines installed but not yet commissioned 
and, due to the focus on increasing commissioning capacity, 
these machines were either commissioned or sold during the 
year. Therefore the number of machines installed but not yet 
commissioned at the end of the year was zero and the balance 
reduced by 104 during the year. 
As at 31 December 2017 the total revenue generating estate 
increased by 169 machines (17-month 31 December: 140) to 
381 machines. As there were 212 revenue generating machines 
at the start of the year this represents growth of 80% during 
the year.
As at 31 December 2017, contracted future revenues amount 
to £4.2m (31 December 2016: £3.8m) and average contract 
length is 24 months (31 December 2016: 59 months). As the 
Group’s commercial activities have expanded this average 
contract period reflects normal trading terms.
Gross loss was £448,000 (17-month 31 December 2016: gross 
profit £290,000). Adjusted gross loss, defined as gross loss plus 
lease interest income, was £368,000 (17-month 31 December 
2016: gross profit of £363,000). The gross loss figure includes a 
loss of £74,000 from the Marken business since its acquisition 
in July 2017. The move to a gross loss in the period was a result 
of an increase in consumables costs (principally chemistry and 
machine spare parts) used to support a larger customer base. 
Adjusted gross profit/loss and adjusted EBITDA are considered 
the key financial performance measures of the Group as they 
reflect the true nature of our continuing trading activities.
The Group has continued to invest in its R&D programme 
but, as the Group has now completed all fundamental 
development, the total R&D spend in the period has fallen 
in comparison with the prior period. The Group spent £5.1m on 
R&D including staff and patent costs (17-month 31 December 
2016: £7.6m). This includes direct R&D expense of £1.8m 
(17-month 31 December 2016: £3.1m), patent and intellectual 
property expense of £1.2m (17-month 31 December 2016: 
£1.7m) and £2.0m of salary costs (17-month 31 December 2016: 
£2.8m). This R&D spend was all expensed during the period as 
it represents Group expenditure on Textiles, Domestic laundry 
development and Tanning engineering development, none 
of which yet meet the full criteria for capitalisation of these 
costs in accordance with IAS 38. When these business areas 
are deemed to have met the IAS 38 capitalisation criteria 
ongoing development costs will be capitalised.
Total administrative expenses (which include the R&D 
expenses) increased to £30.9m (17-month 31 December 2016: 
£22.6m). During the period the Group began the reallocation 
of expenses away from the US Hotel & Lodging business and 
towards the new areas of High Performance Workwear and 
Domestic Laundry. This was achieved through a reduction 
in direct headcount in the US and an increase in the use of 
Forward Channel Partners. This reallocation of expenses will 
continue in 2018.
Administrative expenses include a foreign exchange loss 
of £2.2m resulting from movements in the US Dollar rate 
(17-month 31 December 2016: gain of £3.8m) and £0.4m of 
administrative expenses from Marken since its acquisition in 
July 2017. After adjusting for Marken and the impact of foreign 
exchange, underlying administrative expenses increased from 
£26.4m (17 months ending 31 December 2016) to £28.3m. 
This has resulted in an adjusted EBITDA loss of £28.7m 
(17-month 31 December 2016: loss £20.7m). Adjusted EBITDA 
is defined as the loss on ordinary activities before interest, tax, 
share-based payment expense, non-operating exceptional 
costs, depreciation and amortisation. Non-operating 
exceptional costs are the professional advisory costs related 
to the December 2017 fundraising.
Whilst Sterling is still weaker against the US$ compared to the 
previous reporting period, which increases the reported losses 
in 2017, it has gradually strengthened against the US$ during 
2017. As we continue to fund the working capital and operating 
costs of the US Hotel & Lodging and Marken businesses this 
stronger Sterling benefits the Group.
The Group reported an operating loss of £31.3m (17-month 
31 December 2016: loss £22.4m). The loss per share was 34.92p 
(17-month 31 December 2016: loss 25.04p).
The Group expects cash utilisation to remain at current levels 
over the coming years, as we continue to fund the current 
portfolio of businesses. The increase in net cash outflow from 
operations to £27.1m (17-month period ended 31 December 
2016: £26.4m) reflects these activities and was in line with the 
Board’s expectations. 
The Group had existing cash resources as at 31 December 2017 
of £25.1m (31 December 2016: £28.9m) and remains debt free. 
The Group expects to raise further funds from investors in 2018.
The Group has tax losses of approximately £72.5m to offset 
against future taxable profits (31 December 2016: £42.4m).

14 Report for the period ending 31 December 2017 Xeros Technology Group plc
Chief Financial Officer’s review continued Principal activity
Xeros Technology Group plc (LN: XSG) is a platform technology 
company that is reinventing water intensive industrial and 
commercial processes by reducing water and chemistry 
usage with its polymer technologies. Its patented technologies 
have the capacity to provide material economic, operational 
and sustainability improvements that are unattainable with 
traditional processes. The Group is currently exploiting its 
intellectual property in three areas: Cleaning Technologies, 
Tanning Technologies and Textile Technologies.
The Company is incorporated and domiciled in the UK.
Business model
A description of the Group’s activities and how it seeks to 
add value are included in the Chairman’s statement, Chief 
Executive Officer’s review and Chief Financial Officer’s review 
on pages 7 to 14.
Business review and results
A review of the Group’s performance and future prospects  
is included in the Chairman’s statement, Chief Executive 
Officer’s review and Chief Financial Officer’s review on 
pages 7 to 14. The loss for the year attributable to equity holders 
was £30,611,000 (17-month period ended 31 December 2016: 
£20,239,000). The directors do not recommend the payment 
of a dividend (2016: nil).
Key performance indicators
As the Group is in the process of development and 
commercialisation, the directors consider the key quantitative 
performance indicator to be the level of cash and deposits 
held in the business of £25,149,000 (31 December 2016: 
£28,934,000). The Board performs regular reviews of 
actual results against budget, and monitors cash balances 
on a regular basis to ensure that the business has sufficient 
resources to enact its current strategy. Certain qualitative 
measures, such as the performance of product development 
initiatives, are also monitored on a regular basis. The Board 
will continue to review the KPIs used to assess the business 
as it grows.
Key risks
The Board carefully considers the risks facing the Group 
and endeavours to minimise the impact of those risks. 
The key risks are as follows:
Intellectual property
The Group’s success will depend in part on its ability to 
maintain adequate protection of its intellectual property, 
covering its processes and applications. The intellectual 
property on which the Group’s business is based is a 
combination of patent applications and proprietary know-
how. No assurance can be given that any pending patent 
applications or any future patent applications will result in 
granted patents, that any patents will be granted on a timely 
basis, that the scope of any patent protection will exclude 
competitors or provide competitive advantages to the Group, 
that any of the Group’s patents will be held valid if challenged, 
or that third parties will not claim rights in, or ownership of, 
the patents and other proprietary rights held by the Group. 
There can be no assurance that others have not developed 
or will not develop similar products, duplicate any of the 
Group’s products or design around any patent applications 
held by the Group. Others may hold or receive patents 
which contain claims having a scope that covers products 
developed by the Group (whether or not patents are issued 
to the Group). In addition, no assurance can be given that 
others will not independently develop or otherwise acquire 
substantially equivalent techniques or otherwise gain access 
to the Group’s unpatented proprietary technology or disclose 
such technology or that the Group can ultimately protect 
meaningful rights to such unpatented technology.
Any claims made against the Group’s intellectual property 
rights, even without merit, could be time consuming and 
expensive to defend and could have a materially detrimental 
effect on the Group’s resources. 
Third party intellectual property
Although the Board believes that the Group’s current products, 
products in development and processes do not infringe the 
intellectual property rights of any third parties, it is impossible 
to be aware of all third party intellectual property. No assurance 
can be given that third parties will not in the future claim rights 
in or ownership of the patents and other proprietary rights 
from time to time held by the Group. 
Research and development risk
The Group is involved in complex scientific areas and new 
product development. There is no guarantee that the Group 
will be successful in its research and product development. 
Some of the Group’s technology and intellectual property 
portfolio is at an early stage of commercial development. The 
Group may not be able to develop and exploit its technology 
sufficiently to enable it to develop commercial and marketable 
products. Furthermore, the Group may not be able to develop 
new applications or identify additional specific market needs 
that can be addressed by the Group’s technology.
Risk of competing technology
There is a risk that technological advances in competing 
technology and/or the lower cost of such technology may 
impede the commercial exploitation of the Group’s technology. 
Acceptance of the Group’s products
The success of the Group will depend on the market’s 
acceptance of, and attribution of value to, its core technology 
and the benefits of incorporating the same into various 
applications. There can be no guarantee that this acceptance 
will be forthcoming, that an acceptable value will be placed 
upon such technology or that the Group’s core technology 
will succeed as an alternative to other applications.
15 Xeros Technology Group plc Report for the period ending 31 December 2017
Strategic report Commercialisation risk
The Group has, and will continue to, enter into arrangements 
with third parties in respect of the development, production 
and commercialisation of products based on its technology. 
The Group’s negotiating position in agreeing terms of either 
joint development, distribution, service or supply arrangements 
may be affected by its size and limited cash resources relative 
to potential development partners with substantial cash 
resources and established levels of commercial success. 
An inability to enter into or renew such arrangements on 
favourable terms, if at all, or disagreements between the 
Group and any of its potential partners could lead to delays 
in the Group’s commercialisation strategy. 
Early stage of operations
Whilst the Group has made initial limited product sales, it is 
still at an early stage of development. There are a number 
of operational, strategic and financial risks associated with 
such early stage companies. In particular, the Group’s future 
growth and prospects will depend on its ability to develop 
products and services for applications which have sufficient 
commercial appeal, to manage growth and to continue to 
develop operational, financial and quality control systems on 
a timely basis, whilst at the same time maintaining effective 
cost controls. Any failure to develop operational, financial and 
management information and quality control systems in line 
with the Group’s growth could have a material adverse effect 
on its business, financial condition and results of operations.
The Group is currently loss making and there can be no 
certainty that the Group will achieve increased or sustained 
revenues, profitability or positive cash flow from its operating 
activities within the timeframe expected by the Board or at all. 
The development of the Group’s revenues is difficult to predict 
and there is no guarantee that it will generate any material 
revenues in the foreseeable future. The Group has a limited 
operating history upon which its performance and prospects 
can be evaluated.
Competition risk
Given the potentially disruptive nature of the Group’s 
technology in relation to established markets, the Group may 
face significant competition and negative commentary from 
organisations which have greater capital resources than it and/
or which have a product offering competitive to that of the 
Group, to the detriment of the Group. 
Supply chain risk
The Group is dependent on a limited number of key suppliers 
in relation to the production of its polymer bead cleaning 
system (which includes the production of the machines used 
in the system). Should any such key supplier cease to deal 
with the Group for any reason and/or materially and adversely 
change the terms upon which it deals with the Group, 
difficulties may be experienced by the Group in sourcing 
alternative suppliers on acceptable terms. 
Dependence on key executives and personnel and the ability 
to attract and retain appropriately qualified personnel
The Group’s future success is substantially dependent on the 
continued services and performance of its executive Directors 
and senior management and its ability to attract and retain 
suitably skilled and experienced personnel. The Group cannot 
give assurances that members of the senior management 
team and the executive Directors will continue to remain 
within the Group. Finding and hiring any such replacements 
could be costly and might require the Group to grant 
significant equity awards or other incentive compensation, 
which could adversely impact its financial results.
Reduction in government support for environmental-focused 
technologies
Most states in the US offer energy incentive programs to help 
offset energy costs, with the Federal Energy Management 
Program’s Energy Incentive Program providing information 
to federal agencies about the availability of energy-efficiency 
and renewable-energy project funding for public purpose 
programs on a state-by-state basis. These public purpose 
programs are administered by utilities, state agencies, or other 
third parties and paid for by utility ratepayers. The Group’s 
existing and prospective customers in the US are potentially 
able to benefit from attractive incentives to install Xeros 
washing machines as a result of these incentive programs. 
In the event that the federal government reviews, reduces 
or withdraws its energy efficiency and renewable-energy 
project funding, the Group’s ability to sign up new customers 
who would be able to benefit from incentives to install Xeros 
washing machines could be adversely affected.
Brexit
The Board expects future revenues from the commercialisation 
of its technology in the EU to effectively be in the form of 
royalties on its intellectual property. The international patent 
laws that apply to the protection of intellectual property are 
not affected by the status of the UK’s membership of the 
EU and therefore the Board does not view Brexit as posing 
a material risk to the Group’s future revenues.
Foreign exchange risk
Given the international nature of its business, the Group is 
exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from the normal 
conduct of its activities. The Board regularly reviews this foreign 
exchange risk and all forward currency purchases of foreign 
currency are reviewed and approved within the framework 
of an agreed risk policy.
Future developments
Future developments are described in the Chairman’s 
statement, Chief Executive Officer’s review and Chief Financial 
Officer’s review on pages 7 to 14.

18 Report for the period ending 31 December 2017 Xeros Technology Group plc
Directors’ report continued It is the Company’s policy that Executive Directors should 
have contracts with an indefinite term providing for a 
maximum of six months’ notice. In the event of early 
termination, the Directors’ contracts provide for compensation 
up to a maximum of basic salary for the notice period.
Non-executive Directors are employed on letters of 
appointment which may be terminated on not less than 
one month’s notice. 
Companies with securities listed on AIM do not need to 
comply with the UKLA Listing Rules. The Remuneration 
Committee is however committed to maintaining high 
standards of corporate governance and disclosure and has 
applied the guidelines as far as practical given the current size 
and development of the Company.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee consists of John Samuel as 
Chairman, Julian Viggars, Richard Ellis and Stephen Taylor. 
The Remuneration Committee will review and make 
recommendations in respect of the Directors’ remuneration 
and benefits packages, including share options, and the 
terms of their appointment. The Remuneration Committee 
will also make recommendations to the Board concerning 
the allocation of share options to employees under the share 
incentive schemes. The Remuneration Committee will meet 
at least once a year. 
The main elements of the remuneration packages for 
Executive Directors and senior management are:
Basic annual salary (including Directors’ fees)
The base salary is reviewed annually from the beginning of 
each calendar year. The review process is undertaken by the 
Remuneration Committee and takes into account several 
factors, including the current position and development of 
the Group, individual contribution and market salaries for 
comparable organisations. 
Discretionary annual bonus and Deferred Annual Bonus Plan
All Executive Directors and senior managers are eligible for 
a discretionary annual bonus which is paid in accordance with 
a bonus scheme developed by the Remuneration Committee. 
This takes into account individual contribution, business 
performance and commercial progress, along with financial 
results.
The Group has a Deferred Annual Bonus plan (the ‘DAB 
Plan’). Under the terms of the DAB Plan directors and senior 
managers will be given the opportunity to defer up to 50% 
of any gross cash annual bonus in exchange for a nominal 
cost share option over ordinary shares in the Company 
(the ‘Deferred Award’), which can be exercised after 3 years 
(or earlier if the participant ceases employment). The 
number of ordinary shares comprising the Deferred Award 
(i.e. subject to the option) will be calculated by dividing the 
amount of the cash bonus deferred by the closing market 
value of the ordinary shares of the Company on the dealing 
day immediately prior to the date of grant of the award. By 
participating in the DAB Plan directors and senior managers 
will be entitled to receive a matching award at no additional 
cost (the ‘Matching Award’). The Matching Award will also be 
a nominal cost option over ordinary shares in the Company. 
The number of ordinary shares comprising the Matching 
Award will be equivalent to two times the number of ordinary 
shares received in the Deferred Award. Participants will not 
be entitled to receive the Matching Award until the vesting 
date is reached which is three years from the date of grant 
of the award. The vesting of a Matching Award will be subject 
to performance conditions which will be determined by the 
Remuneration Committee. The first awards under the DAB 
Plan took place early in 2015 following confirmation of bonuses 
for the calendar year 2014, and further awards were made in 
early 2016 following confirmation of bonuses for the calendar 
year 2015, and in early 2017 following confirmation of bonuses 
for the calendar year 2016.
Share incentive schemes
The Group operates share option plans, under which certain 
directors and senior management have been granted options 
to subscribe for ordinary shares. All options are equity settled. 
The options are subject to service and performance conditions, 
have an exercise price of between 0.15 pence and 305.00 
pence and the vesting period is generally 1-3 years. If the 
options remain unexercised after a period of 10 years from 
the date of grant, the options expire. The Group has no legal 
or constructive obligation to repurchase or settle the options 
in cash.
Remuneration policy for Non-Executive Directors
Remuneration for Non-Executive Directors is set by the 
Chairman and the Executive Members of the Board.  
Non-Executives do not participate in bonus schemes.

21 Xeros Technology Group plc Report for the period ending 31 December 2017
Directors’ remuneration report continued Corporate governance
The Company is not required to comply with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code (the ‘Code’) and does not voluntarily apply 
the full requirements of the Code. However, our governance 
arrangements do meet many of the requirements of the 
Code which the directors deem most relevant to an AIM listed 
company having consideration to the size, nature and scope 
of the Company and Group’s activities. 
The Board
The Board currently comprises two Executive Directors and 
four Non-Executive Directors.
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee consists of Julian Viggars as Chairman 
and John Samuel. The Audit Committee will, inter alia, 
determine and examine matters relating to the financial 
affairs of the Company including the terms of engagement 
of the Company’s auditor and, in consultation with the auditor, 
the scope of the audit. It will receive and review reports from 
management and the Company’s auditor relating to the 
annual accounts and the accounting and the internal control 
systems in use throughout the Group. The Audit Committee 
will meet at least twice a year.
Nominations Committee
The Nominations Committee consists of John Samuel as 
Chairman, Julian Viggars and Richard Ellis. The Nominations 
Committee will monitor the size and composition of the 
Board and the other Board Committees, be responsible for 
identifying suitable candidates for Board membership and 
monitor the performance and suitability of the current Board 
on an ongoing basis. The Nominations Committee will meet 
at least once a year.
Internal control
The Board is responsible for maintaining a sound system of 
internal control. The Board’s measures are designed to manage, 
not eliminate risk, and such a system provides reasonable 
but not absolute assurance against material misstatement 
or loss. Whilst, as a small AIM listed company, the Company is 
not required to comply with the full provisions of the “Internal 
Control Guidance for Directors on the Combined Code” (The 
Turnbull Report), the Board considers that the internal controls 
do meet many of those requirements and are adequate given 
the size of the Company.
Some key features of the internal control system are:
(i) Management accounts information, budgets, forecasts 
and business risk issues are regularly reviewed by the Board 
which meets at least seven times per year;
(ii) The Company has operational, accounting and 
employment policies in place;
(iii) The Board actively identifies and evaluates the risks inherent 
in the business and ensures that appropriate controls and 
procedures are in place to manage these risks;
(iv) There is a clearly defined organisational structure, and 
(v) There are well-established financial reporting and control 
systems.
Going concern
At 31 December 2017, the Group had £25.1m of cash and 
cash equivalents. At this stage in its development the Group 
is reliant on equity share funding. When making their going 
concern assessment the directors assess available and 
committed funds against all non-discretionary expenditure, 
and related cash flows, as forecast for the period ended 
30 April 2019. These forecasts indicate that the Group is able 
to settle its liabilities as they fall due in the forecast period. 
In these forecasts the directors have considered appropriate 
sensitivities such as the level of discretionary expenditure 
included and the ability to raise additional funds during 2018. 
Accordingly, the directors consider that this should enable the 
Group to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable 
future and the Directors believe that it remains appropriate to 
prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis.
Note 17 to this financial information includes the Group’s 
objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital, 
its financial risk management objectives, details of its financial 
instruments and its exposure to credit, liquidity and market 
risk. The Directors have considered their obligation, in relation 
to the assessment of the going concern of the Group and each 
statutory entity within it and have reviewed the current budget 
cash forecasts and assumptions as well as the main risk factors 
facing the Group.
Corporate governance report
22 Report for the period ending 31 December 2017 Xeros Technology Group plc Statement of Directors’ responsibilities in respect of the 
Annual Report and the financial statements
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report 
and the Group and parent Company financial statements 
in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
 
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and 
parent Company financial statements for each financial year. 
As required by the AIM rules of the London Stock Exchange 
they are required to prepare the Group financial statements 
in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
as adopted by the EU and applicable law and have elected 
to prepare the parent Company financial statements on the 
same basis.
 
Under company law the Directors must not approve the 
financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give 
a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and 
the parent Company and of their profit or loss for that period. 
In preparing each of the Group and the parent Company 
financial statements, the Directors are required to:
a. select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently;
b. make judgements and estimates that are reasonable, 
relevant and reliable;
c. state whether they have been prepared in accordance 
with IFRS as adopted by the EU; 
d. assess the Group and parent Company’s ability to continue 
as a going concern, disclosing as applicable, matters 
relating to going concern; and
e. use the going concern basis of accounting unless they 
either intend to liquidate the Group or the parent Company, 
or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but 
to do so.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the parent 
Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy 
at any time the financial position of the parent Company and 
to enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply 
with the Companies Act 2006. They are responsible for such 
internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the 
preparation of financial statements that are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and have a 
general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably 
open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group and to 
prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, the Directors are also 
responsible for preparing a Strategic Report and a Directors’ 
Report that complies with that law and those regulations.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and 
integrity of the corporate and financial information included 
on the Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom 
governing the preparation and dissemination of financial 
statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
23 Xeros Technology Group plc Report for the period ending 31 December 2017
Statement of Directors’ responsibilities 1. Our opinion is unmodified 
We have audited the financial statements of Xeros Technology 
Group plc (“the Company”) for the year ended 31 December 
2017 which comprise the consolidated statement of profit 
and loss and other comprehensive income, consolidated 
statement of changes in equity, consolidated statement 
of financial position, consolidated statement of cash flows, 
company statement of changes in equity, company statement 
of financial position, company statement of cash flows and the 
related notes, including the accounting policies in note 2. 
In our opinion: 
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state 
of the Group’s and of the parent Company’s affairs as at 
31 December 2017 and of the Group’s loss for the year then 
ended; 
• the Group financial statements have been properly prepared 
in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards as adopted by the European Union (IFRSs as 
adopted by the EU); 
• the parent Company financial statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU 
and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the 
Companies Act 2006; and 
• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance 
with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006. 
Basis for opinion 
We conducted our audit in accordance with International 
Standards on Auditing (UK) (“ISAs (UK)”) and applicable law. 
Our responsibilities are described below. We have fulfilled 
our ethical responsibilities under, and are independent of the 
Group in accordance with, UK ethical requirements including 
the FRC Ethical Standard as applied to listed entities. We 
believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is a sufficient 
and appropriate basis for our opinion. 
2. Key audit matters: our assessment of risks of material 
misstatement
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional 
judgment, were of most significance in the audit of the 
financial statements and include the most significant assessed 
risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) 
identified by us, including those which had the greatest effect 
on: the overall audit strategy; the allocation of resources in 
the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. 
These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of 
the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion 
thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these 
matters. In arriving at our audit opinion above, the key audit 
matters, in decreasing order of audit significance, were as 
follows (unchanged from 2016): 
Completeness of capitalised development costs (Group: 
capitalised development costs at 31 December 2017 £nil 
(2016: £nil))
Risk vs 2016: tu
Refer to pages 32 and 36.
• The risk 
  Accounting treatment – The Group is developing its 
own technologies and products across various markets 
and sectors, with each project being at various stages of 
development. The technologies in these developments are 
inherently disruptive, therefore technical feasibility can take 
significant investment and the commercial success of each 
project can be subjective. Commercial subjectivity is largely 
driven by the fact the Group’s products have no proven 
market or track record of commercial success. Assessing 
whether the capitalisation criteria are met is inherently 
judgmental and there is a risk that the appropriate point 
in time for capitalisation is not identified appropriately and 
therefore costs continue to be expensed when they should 
be capitalised. 
• Our response 
 Our procedures included:
 •  Assessing application – Specific focus was given to the 
status of the significant development projects currently 
ongoing and to which the majority of research and 
development spend relates. We critically assessed the 
Group’s evaluation of the technical and commercial status 
of each of these projects and the conclusion against the 
criteria for capitalisation, including inspecting project status 
announcements. This included in particular for Tanning 
Technologies, consideration of the contract now in place 
with a key partner and how this impacted achievement 
of the criteria. 
 •  Personnel interviews – We corroborated the status of the 
projects by interviewing technical staff outside of the finance 
function. 
Recoverability of carrying value of investment in 
subsidiary (Parent Company only, investment carrying 
value at 31 December 2017 £9.1m (2016: £7.9m), inter-company 
receivable carrying value at 31 December 2017 £63.6m  
(2016: £60.5m))
Risk vs 2016: tu
Refer to pages 63 and 64.
• The risk 
  Forecast-based valuation – The parent Company balance 
sheet includes an investment in a trading subsidiary of £9.1m 
(2016: £7.9m) and a receivable from that subsidiary of £63.6m 
(2016: £60.5m). The subsidiary is currently loss making given 
the nature of its development stage activities and therefore 
the Company’s assessment of potential impairment is 
inherently subjective. Given the nature of the business, 
the Group assesses recoverability with reference to their 
expectations of the projects and external valuations. 
Independent auditor’s report to the members 
of Xeros Technology Group plc
24 Report for the period ending 31 December 2017 Xeros Technology Group plc • Our response 
 Our procedures included:
 •  Our sector experience – We considered the current stage 
of the various projects currently in development in the 
subsidiary and in particular how these have enabled the 
Group to raise further equity linked to announcements of 
development progress.
 •  Comparing valuations – We considered the carrying value 
of investment and inter-company receivable with reference 
to the net assets of the subsidiary. We also considered the 
carrying values of each underlying business segment in the 
subsidiaries with reference to analyst reports.
 •  Assessing analyst credentials – We evaluated the third-
party analyst’s credentials and independence.
3. Our application of materiality and an overview of the 
scope of our audit 
The materiality for the Group financial statements as a 
whole was set at £1,111,000 (2016: £750,000), determined 
with reference to a benchmark of Group loss before taxation, 
of which it represents 3.5% (2016: 3.5%).
Materiality for the parent Company financial statements as 
a whole was set at £889,000 (2016: £740,000) determined 
with reference to a benchmark of gross assets, of which it 
represents 0.8% (2016: 1%).
We agreed to report to the Audit Committee any corrected 
and uncorrected identified misstatements exceeding £56,000 
(2016: £37,500) in addition to other identified misstatements 
that warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.
Of the Group’s 4 (2016: 3) reporting components, we subjected 
4 (2016: 3) to full scope audits for Group reporting purposes. 
These components accounted for 100% of: total Group 
revenue, Group loss before taxation and total Group assets. 
All component audits (2016: all), including that of the parent 
Company, were performed by the Group team.
Component materiality levels were set individually for each 
component having regard to the mix of size and risk profile of 
the Group across the components, and ranged from £889,000 
to £659,000 (2016: £740,000 to £355,000). 
4. We have nothing to report on going concern 
We are required to report to you if we have concluded that the 
use of the going concern basis of accounting is inappropriate 
or there is an undisclosed material uncertainty that may cast 
significant doubt over the use of that basis for a period of at 
least twelve months from the date of approval of the financial 
statements. We have nothing to report in these respects. 
5. We have nothing to report on the other information 
in the Annual Report 
The directors are responsible for the other information 
presented in the Annual Report together with the financial 
statements. Our opinion on the financial statements does 
not cover the other information and, accordingly, we do not 
express an audit opinion or, except as explicitly stated below, 
any form of assurance conclusion thereon. 
Our responsibility is to read the other information and, in 
doing so, consider whether, based on our financial statements 
audit work, the information therein is materially misstated 
or inconsistent with the financial statements or our audit 
knowledge. Based solely on that work we have not identified 
material misstatements in the other information. 
Strategic report and directors’ report 
Based solely on our work on the other information: 
• we have not identified material misstatements in the strategic 
report and the directors’ report; 
• in our opinion the information given in those reports for the 
financial year is consistent with the financial statements; and 
• in our opinion those reports have been prepared in 
accordance with the Companies Act 2006. 
6. We have nothing to report on the other matters on which 
we are required to report by exception 
Under the Companies Act 2006, we are required to report 
to you if, in our opinion: 
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the 
parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have 
not been received from branches not visited by us; or 
• the parent Company financial statements are not in 
agreement with the accounting records and returns; or 
• certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by 
law are not made; or 
• we have not received all the information and explanations 
we require for our audit. 
We have nothing to report in these respects. 
25 Xeros Technology Group plc Report for the period ending 31 December 2017
Independent auditor’s report to the members  
of Xeros Technology Group plc continued 7. Respective responsibilities 
Directors’ responsibilities 
As explained more fully in their statement set out on page 23, 
the directors are responsible for: the preparation of the financial 
statements including being satisfied that they give a true and 
fair view; such internal control as they determine is necessary 
to enable the preparation of financial statements that are 
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or 
error; assessing the Group and parent Company’s ability to 
continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters 
related to going concern; and using the going concern basis of 
accounting unless they either intend to liquidate the Group or 
the parent Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic 
alternative but to do so. 
Auditor’s responsibilities 
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether the financial statements as a whole are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to 
issue our opinion in an auditor’s report. Reasonable assurance 
is a high level of assurance, but does not guarantee that an 
audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always 
detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements 
can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, 
individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected 
to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis 
of the financial statements. 
A fuller description of our responsibilities is provided on the 
FRC’s website at www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. 
8. The purpose of our audit work and to whom we owe 
our responsibilities 
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, 
as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the 
Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so 
that we might state to the Company’s members those matters 
we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for 
no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we 
do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than 
the Company and the Company’s members, as a body, for our 
audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

30 Report for the period ending 31 December 2017 Xeros Technology Group plc 1) Basis of preparation
Xeros Technology Group plc is a public limited company domiciled in the United Kingdom. The financial statements of Xeros 
Technology Group plc are audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017. These include 
comparatives for the 17-month period to 31 December 2016. The level of rounding for financial information is the nearest 
thousand Pounds.
The Company’s registered office is Unit 2, Evolution, Advanced Manufacturing Park, Whittle Way, Catcliffe, Rotherham, S60 5BL. 
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union (EU IFRS).
Business combinations and basis of consolidation
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Company. Control exists when the Company has the power, directly or indirectly, to 
govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. In assessing control, potential 
voting rights that presently are exercisable or convertible are taken into account. The financial statements of subsidiaries are 
included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
Where the acquisition is treated as a business combination, the purchase method of accounting is used to account for the 
acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group.
The cost of an acquisition is measured as the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred 
or assumed at the date of exchange. Acquisition costs are expensed as incurred. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities 
and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date. 
The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded 
as goodwill. If the cost of the acquisition is less than the fair value of net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is 
recognised directly in the income statement.
All intra-Group balances and transactions, including unrealised profits arising from intra-Group transactions, are eliminated fully  
on consolidation. 
Going concern
At 31 December 2017, the Group had £25.1m of cash and cash equivalents. At this stage in its development the Group is loss 
making and incurs operating cash outflows. It is therefore reliant on equity share funding to continue its development operations 
and will require a further capital injection to meet forecast spend (both discretionary and non discretionary) over the next 
12 months to April 2019. As with all such businesses, the Group is reliant on cyclical equity funding while developing technologies, 
with a long-term view to commercialising those technologies to enable them to provide a return to the shareholders. Whilst there 
is no guarantee that further equity funding will be made available, the directors believe that given past history of successful share 
placings, and the consistent development progress across the project portfolio, the required cash can be raised in line with the 
above.
When making their going concern assessment the directors assess available and committed funds against all non-discretionary 
expenditure, and related cash flows, as forecast for the period ended 30 April 2019. These forecasts indicate that the Group is 
able to settle its liabilities as they fall due in the forecast period. In these forecasts the directors have considered appropriate 
sensitivities such as the level of discretionary expenditure included and the ability to raise additional funds as described above. 
Accordingly, the directors consider that this should enable the Group to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable 
future and the Directors believe that it remains appropriate to prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis.
Note 17 to this financial information includes the Group’s objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital, its financial 
risk management objectives, details of its financial instruments and its exposure to credit, liquidity and market risk. The Directors

Notes to the consolidated financial statements
For the year ended 31 December 2017 2) Significant accounting policies
The principal accounting policies applied are set out below.
Revenue recognition
Revenue is recognised at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for the sale of goods and services in the 
ordinary course of business and is shown net of Value Added Tax. The Group primarily earns revenues from the sale/provision of 
polymer bead cleaning equipment, consumables and services.
Within the Hotel & Lodging segment, where products are sold outright, product sales revenues are recognised once substantially 
all the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred. Where sales are made through the Xeros Sbeadycare® service, the 
contract is separated into the element relating to the initial sale of equipment (where relevant), and the ongoing service element. 
Consideration is allocated to the different components based on their relative fair values. Service income is recognised pro-rata 
over the life of the contract. Where equipment is sold under a finance lease agreement revenue is recognised in accordance with 
the stated lessor accounting policy. Amounts received in respect of operating leases are recognised in the income statement with 
reference to the period of rental.
Within the High Performance Workwear segment, revenues are recognised once the service contracted with the customer is 
completed.
The difference between the amount of income recognised and the amount invoiced on a particular contract is included in 
the statement of financial position as deferred income. Amounts included in deferred income due within one year are expected 
to be recognised within one year and are included within current liabilities.
Foreign currencies
The individual financial statements of each Group entity are presented in the currency of the primary economic environment in 
which the entity operates (its functional currency). For the purposes of the consolidated financial statements, the results and the 
financial position of each Group entity are expressed in Pounds Sterling, which is the functional currency of the Company and 
the presentational currency for the consolidated financial statements.
In preparing the financial statements of the individual entities, transactions in currencies other than the entity’s functional 
currency (foreign currencies) are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing at the dates of the transactions. At each balance 
sheet date, monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing at the balance sheet date. 
Non-monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing at the 
date when the fair value was determined.
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in foreign currency are not retranslated.
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated using exchange rates at the balance sheet date. The components 
of shareholders’ equity are stated at historical value. An average exchange rate for the period is used to translate the results and 
cash flows of foreign operations.
Exchange differences arising on translating the results and net assets of foreign operations are taken to the translation reserve in 
equity until the disposal of the investment. The gain or loss in the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income on 
the disposal of foreign operations includes the release of the translation reserve relating to the operation that is being sold. 
Government grants
Government grants are recognised where there is reasonable assurance that the grant will be received and all attached 
conditions will be complied with. When the grant relates to an expense item, it is recognised as income on a systematic basis over 
the periods that the costs, which it is intended to compensate, are expensed. Where the grant relates to an asset, it is recognised 
as income in equal amounts over the expected useful life of the related asset.
Income from grants is allocated to ‘cost of sales’ and ‘administrative expenses’ in the consolidated statement of profit or loss and 
other comprehensive income to match it against the underlying expenditure incurred.
32 Report for the period ending 31 December 2017 Xeros Technology Group plc
Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued
For the year ended 31 December 2017 Research and development
Expenditure on research activities is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred. Development costs are only 
capitalised when the related products meet the recognition criteria of an internally generated intangible asset, the key criteria 
being as follows:
• it is probable that the future economic benefits that are attributable to the asset will flow to the Group;
• the project is technically and commercially feasible;
• the Group intends to and has sufficient resources to complete the project;
• the Group has the ability to use or sell the asset; and
• the cost of the asset can be measured reliably.
Such intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis from the point at which the assets are ready for use over the period 
of the expected benefit and are reviewed for an indication of impairment at each reporting date. Other development costs are 
charged against profit or loss as incurred since the criteria for their recognition as an asset are not met.
The costs of an internally generated intangible asset comprise all directly attributable costs necessary to create, produce and 
prepare the asset to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management. Directly attributable costs include 
employee costs incurred on technical development, testing and certification, materials consumed and any relevant third-party 
cost. The costs of internally generated developments are recognised as intangible assets and are subsequently measured in the 
same way as externally acquired intangible assets. However, until completion of the development project, the assets are subject 
to impairment testing only.
No development costs to date have been capitalised as intangible assets as it is deemed that the probability of future economic 
benefit is currently uncertain.
Leases
As a lessee
At the current time, the Group only partakes of lease arrangements where all of the risks and rewards incidental to ownership 
are not transferred to the Group (an ‘operating lease’). The total rentals payable under the lease are charged to the consolidated 
statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The aggregate benefit 
of lease incentives is recognised as a reduction in the rental expense over the lease term.
As a lessor
As the Group transfers substantially all the risks and benefits of ownership of the asset, the arrangement is classified as a finance 
lease and a receivable is recognised for the initial direct costs of the lease and the present value of the minimum lease payments. 
As payments fall due, finance income is recognised in the income statement so as to achieve a constant rate of return on the 
remaining net investment in the lease. Assets held for rentals to customers under operating leases are recorded as fixed assets 
and are depreciated on a straight-line basis to their estimated residual values over their estimated useful lives. Operating lease 
income is recognised within revenue on a straight-line basis over the term of the rental period.
Intangible assets and goodwill
Recognition and measurement
Goodwill – Goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiaries is measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
Other intangible assets – Other intangible assets, including customer relationships and brands, that are acquired by the Group 
and have finite useful lives are measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses.
Amortisation
Amortisation is calculated to write off the cost of intangible assets less their estimated residual values using the straight-line 
method over their estimated useful lives and is generally recognised in profit or loss. Goodwill is not amortised. The estimated 
useful lives for current and comparative periods are as follows:
Customer lists  – 5 years
Brands   – 5 years
Amortisation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each reporting date and adjusted if appropriate. Assets 
considered to have indefinite useful economic lives are tested annually for impairment.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued
For the year ended 31 December 2017 2) Significant accounting policies continued
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment losses. Cost includes the 
original purchase price of the asset and the costs attributable to bringing the asset to its working condition for its intended use. 
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the costs of assets over their estimated useful lives, on the following basis:
Leasehold improvements – over the term of the lease on a straight-line basis
Plant and machinery – 20% on cost on a straight-line basis
Fixtures and fittings – 20% on cost on a straight-line basis
Computer equipment – 33% on cost on a straight-line basis
The gain or loss arising on the disposal of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying 
amount of the asset and is recognised in the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income.
Impairment of non-current assets
For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable 
cash flows (cash-generating units). As a result, some assets are tested individually for impairment and some are tested at cash-
generating unit level. Goodwill is allocated to those cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from synergies of the 
related business combination and represent the lowest level at which management monitors goodwill. Cash-generating units 
to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment at least annually. All other individual assets or cash-generating 
units are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be 
recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the assets or cash-generating unit’s carrying amount 
exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value, reflecting market conditions less costs to sell, 
and value in use based on an internal discounted cash flow evaluation.
Inventories
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost incurred in bringing each product to its present location 
and condition is accounted for as follows:
Raw materials, work in progress and finished goods – Purchase cost on a first-in, first-out basis.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business.
Share based payments
Certain employees and consultants (including Directors and senior executives) of the Group receive remuneration in the form of 
share-based payment transactions, whereby employees render services as consideration for equity instruments (“equity-settled 
transactions”).
The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the date on which they are 
granted. The fair value is determined by using an appropriate pricing model. The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised, 
together with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period in which the performance and/or service conditions are fulfilled, 
ending on the date on which the relevant employees become fully entitled to the award (“the vesting date”). The cumulative 
expense recognised for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date until the vesting date reflects the extent to which the 
vesting period has expired and the Group’s best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest. The profit 
or loss charge or credit for a period represents the movement in cumulative expense recognised as at the beginning and end of 
that period.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market 
condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market condition is satisfied, provided that all other 
performance and/or service conditions are satisfied. Where the terms of an equity-settled award are modified, the minimum 
expense recognised is the expense as if the terms had not been modified. An additional expense is recognised for any 
modification, which increases the total fair value of the share-based payment arrangement or is otherwise beneficial to the 
employee as measured at the date of modification.
Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation and any expense not 
yet recognised for the award is recognised immediately. However, if a new award is substituted for the cancelled award and 
designated as a replacement award on the date that it is granted, the cancelled and new awards are treated as if they were a 
modification of the original award, as described in the previous paragraph. The dilutive effect of outstanding options is reflected 
as additional share dilution in the computation of earnings per share.

For the year ended 31 December 2017
Report for the period ending 31 December 2017 Xeros Technology Group plc Financial assets and liabilities
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position when the Group 
becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. Financial assets are de-recognised when the contractual rights 
to the cash flows from the financial asset expire or when the contractual rights to those assets are transferred. Financial liabilities 
are de-recognised when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged, cancelled or expired.
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost less provision for impairment. 
Appropriate provisions for estimated irrecoverable amounts are recognised in the statement of profit or loss and other 
comprehensive income when there is objective evidence that the assets are impaired.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand, demand deposits, and other short-term highly liquid investments that are 
readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Investments – bank deposits
Comprise bank deposits maturing more than three months after the balance sheet date.
Equity instruments
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all of its liabilities. 
Equity instruments issued by the Group are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Trade and other payables
Trade payables are initially measured at their fair value and are subsequently measured at their amortised cost using the effective 
interest rate method; this method allocates interest expense over the relevant period by applying the “effective interest rate” to 
the carrying amount of the liability.
Taxation
The tax expense/(credit) represents the sum of the tax currently payable or recoverable and the movement in deferred tax assets 
and liabilities.
Current tax is based upon taxable profit/(loss) for the year. Taxable profit/(loss) differs from net profit/(loss) as reported in the 
statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable 
or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated by using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the 
reporting date.
Credit is taken in the accounting period for research and development tax credits, which have been claimed from HM Revenue 
and Customs, in respect of qualifying research and development costs incurred. Research and development tax credits are 
recognised on an accruals basis with reference to the level of certainty regarding acceptance of the claims by HMRC.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability is 
settled based upon tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date. Deferred tax is charged or 
credited in the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income, except when it relates to items credited or charged 
directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity. 
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and 
liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit and is accounted 
for using the liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred 
tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary 
differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from 
the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the 
profit nor the accounting period.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer 
probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.

Critical accounting estimates and areas of judgement
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including 
expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these 
estimates. The estimates and assumptions that have the most significant effects on the carrying amounts of the assets and 
liabilities in the financial information are discussed below:
Revenue recognition
The Group offers an integrated service and care package, marketed under Xeros Sbeadycare®. This package includes the transfer 
of equipment and an ongoing commitment to service and support. As part of determining the appropriate revenue recognition 
policy for such packages, the Group is required to determine the relative fair values of the various elements of revenue. The Group 
is also required to make judgements as to the market rate of interest used in the calculations. Due to the unique nature of the 
product and the stage of development of the Group, such assessment is based on limited historical information and requires 
a level of judgement. These judgements may be revised in future years.
Research and development costs
Careful judgement by the Directors is applied when deciding whether the recognition requirements for capitalising development 
costs have been met. This is necessary as the economic success of any product development is uncertain and may be subject 
to future technical problems. Judgements are based on the information available at each reporting date which includes the 
progress with testing and certification and progress on, for example, establishment of commercial arrangements with third 
parties. Specifically, the Directors consider production scale evidence of commercial operation of the Group’s technology. In 
addition, all internal activities related to research and development of new products are continuously monitored by the Directors. 
To date, no development costs have been capitalised.
Accounting standards and interpretations not applied
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following IFRSs, IASs and Interpretations were in issue but not yet 
effective. Their adoption is not expected to have a material effect on the financial statements unless otherwise indicated:
 
IFRS 2 (amended June 2016) Share-based payment 1 January 2018
IFRS 4 (amended September 2016) Insurance Contracts 1 January 2018
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments 1 January 2018

IAS 41 (amended June 2014) Agriculture 1 January 2018
Amendments resulting from September 2014 Annual Improvements to IFRSs 1 January 2018
The Group is implementing IFRS 15 for the period ending 31 December 2018. Transition is ongoing and will be performed under 
the cumulative effect method as permitted under the standard. Had IFRS 15 been in effect for the period ended 31 December 
2017, the Directors do not consider that there would have been a material impact on the results reported.
The Directors are currently evaluating the impact of IFRS 16 on the accounting policies of the Group. 
The Directors do not consider that IFRS 9 will have a material impact on the results of the Group. It is not anticipated that any 
of the other new standards or interpretations will have a material impact.

High Performance Workwear
The recoverable amount of this CGU is based on fair value less costs of disposal, estimated using discounted cash flows. 
The key assumptions used in the estimation of the recoverable amount are set out below. The values assigned to the key 
assumptions represent management’s assessment of future trends in the relevant industry and have been based on historical 
data from both external and internal sources.

All goodwill relates to the purchase of Marken PPE. Goodwill arising on acquisition represents excess of the fair value of the 
consideration given over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired. The goodwill arising from the acquisition consists 
largely of the synergies expected from combining the Marken PPE business with the proprietary Xeros technology and the 
workforce acquired.
The Group tests annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The forecast used in impairment testing is approved by management and the Board of Directors and is based on a bottom up 
assessment of costs and uses the known and estimated sales pipeline.

Assets under construction comprised leasehold improvements at the Company’s Technology Centre at the Advanced 
Manufacturing Park. These premises were completed in August 2015 and these costs were transferred to leasehold improvements.
Included within plant and machinery are assets with a net book value of £2,582,000 (31 December 2016: £506,000) which the 
Group leases (as lessor) to customers under a number of operating lease agreements.
When an operating lease is agreed with a customer, the assets to which the operating lease relates are, if necessary, transferred 
from inventory into property, plant and equipment for the duration of the lease. Depreciation is charged on these assets in line 
with their useful economic lives.

Contractual payment terms with the Group’s customers are typically 30 to 60 days.
The Directors considered the carrying value of trade receivables at 31 December 2017 and made a provision of £270,000  
(31 December 2016: £77,000) for potential impairment losses arising from balances which were considered to be past due. The 
Directors believe that the carrying value of trade and other receivables represents their fair value. In determining the recoverability 
of trade receivables the Directors consider any change in the credit quality of the receivable from the date credit was granted up 
to the reporting date. For details on credit risk management policies, refer to note 17.
Other receivables of £1,104,000 (31 December 2016: £1,656,000) due after more than one year comprise the long-term portion 
of finance leases where the Group acts as lessor.
In July 2017 a small number of lease agreements were sold to Hitachi Capital. The value of the agreements sold is not material

The Directors consider that the carrying value of cash and cash equivalents approximates to their fair value. For details of credit 
risk management policies, refer to note 17.
17) Financial instruments
The Group’s principal financial instruments comprise short-term receivables and payables and cash and cash equivalents. The 
Group does not trade in financial instruments but uses derivative financial instruments in the form of forward foreign currency 
contracts to help manage its foreign currency exposure and to enable the Group to manage its working capital requirements.
(a) Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities
Derivative financial instruments – fair value hierarchy
The following hierarchy classifies each class of financial asset or liability depending on the valuation technique applied in 
determining its fair value:
Level 1: The fair value is calculated based on quoted prices traded in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2: The fair value is based on inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset 
or liability, either directly or indirectly. The fair value of a financial instrument is the price that would be received to sell 
an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
Level 3: The fair value is based on inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable 
inputs).
In these financial statements, all of the forward foreign exchange contracts are considered to be Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. 
There have been no transfers between categories in the current or preceding year. The fair value of financial instruments held 
at fair value have been determined based on available market information at the balance sheet date.

(b) Credit risk
Financial risk management
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its 
contractual obligations. 
The Group is exposed to credit risk in respect of trade and lease receivable balances such that, if one or more customers or 
a counterparty to a financial instrument encounters financial difficulties, this could materially and adversely affect the Group’s 
financial results. The Group attempts to mitigate credit risk by assessing the credit rating of new customers and financial 
counterparties prior to entering into contracts and by entering into contracts with customers on agreed credit terms.
The Group is potentially exposed to credit risk in respect of its bank deposits in the event of failure of the respective banks. 
The Group attempts to mitigate this risk by spreading its cash deposits across different banks and through ongoing monitoring 
of the credit ratings of those banks. Further details are set out in note 16. At 31 December 2017, the Directors were not aware of 
any factors affecting the recoverability of the Group’s bank balances.
Exposure to credit risk
At 31 December 2017, the Group had net trade receivables outstanding of £345,000 (2016: £272,000). The Directors have 
considered the recoverability of outstanding balances at 31 December 2017 and have made provisions for bad and doubtful debts 
amounting to £270,000 (2016: £77,000). The Group had lease receivable balances outstanding of £1,356,000 (2016: £1,940,000) 
after the deduction of provisions amounting to £108,000 (2016: £nil).
The concentration of credit risk for trade and other receivables and lease receivables at the balance sheet date by geographic 
region was:
 
31 December
2017

United Kingdom 1,029 1,153
United States of America 2,310 2,333
 3,339 3,486
(c) Liquidity risk
Financial risk management
Liquidity risk arises from the Group’s management of working capital. It is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in 
meeting its future obligations as they fall due. The Group’s policy is to ensure that it will always have sufficient cash to allow it 
to meet its liabilities when they become due. To achieve this aim, it seeks to maintain cash balances to meet its expected cash 
requirements.
The following are the contractual maturities of financial liabilities:
Non-derivative financial liabilities 31 December

(d) Market risk
Financial risk management
Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as interest rates or foreign exchange rates will affect the Group’s income. 
The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters. Market 
interest rate risk arises from the Group’s holding of cash and cash equivalent balances and from cash held on term deposit 
accounts (see notes 15 and 16). The Board makes ad hoc decisions at its regular Board meetings, as to whether to hold funds 
in instant access accounts or longer-term deposits. All accounts are held with reputable banks. These policies are considered 
to be appropriate to the current stage of development of the Group and will be kept under review in future years. 
Foreign currency risk
The Group is exposed to currency risk on sales and purchases and cash held in bank accounts that are denominated in a currency 
other than the respective functional currencies of Group entities, primarily Pound Sterling (£), the US Dollar ($) and the Euro (€).  
The Group’s policy is to reduce currency exposure on sales and purchasing through forward foreign currency contracts.
The following are the fair values of assets held in respect of forward foreign currency contracts:
Derivative financial assets 31 December

Sensitivity analysis
A 10% weakening of the following currencies against the Pound Sterling (£) at 31 December 2017 would have increased equity 
and profit or loss by the amounts shown below. The calculation assumes that the change occurred at the balance sheet date and 
had been applied to the risk exposure existing at that date.
This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular, other exchange rates and interest rates remain constant. The analysis 
is performed on the same basis for the period ended 31 December 2016.

A 10% strengthening of the above currencies against the Pound Sterling at 31 December 2017 would have had the equal but 
opposite effect on the above currencies to the amounts shown above on the basis that all other variables remain constant.
Interest rate risk
At the balance sheet date the interest rate profile of the Group’s interest-bearing financial instruments was:

Based on the Group’s above balances at 31 December 2017, if interest rates had been 5% higher, then the impact on the results for 
the year would be a reduction in the loss for the period of approximately £831,000 with a corresponding increase in the Group’s 
net assets. If the interest rate had reduced to zero %, then the impact on the results for the period would be an increase in the 
loss for the year of £51,000 with a corresponding decrease in the Group’s net assets.

(31 December 2016: £24,976,000).
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are:
• to safeguard the entity’s ability to continue as a going concern, so that it can provide returns for shareholders and benefits for 
other stakeholders; and
• to provide an adequate return to shareholders by pricing products and services commensurately with the level of risk.
The capital structure of the Group consists of shareholders’ equity as set out in the consolidated statement of changes in equity. 
All working capital requirements are financed from existing cash resources. There are no externally imposed capital requirements. 
Financing decisions are made by the Board of Directors based on forecasts of the expected timing and level of capital and 
operating expenditure required to meet the Group’s commitments and development plans.

approximate their fair value. The Group has financial risk management policies in place to ensure that all payables are paid within 
the credit timeframe and no interest has been charged by any suppliers as a result of late payment of invoices during the period.

an asset in the statement of financial position due to the uncertainty in the timing of its crystallisation.

Share options
The Company has share option plans (The Xeros Technology Group plc Unapproved Share Option Scheme and The Xeros 
Technology Group plc Enterprise Management Incentive Share Option Scheme) under which it grants options over ordinary 
shares to certain Directors, employees and consultants of the Group. Options under these plans are exercisable at a range of 
exercise prices ranging from the nominal value of the Company’s shares to the market price of the Company’s shares on the date 
of the grant. The vesting period for shares is usually over a period of three years. The options are settled in equity once exercised. 
If the options remain unexercised for a period after 10 years from the date of grant, the options expire. Options are forfeited if the 
employee leaves the Group before the options vest.

During the year ended 31 December 2017, the Company entered into numerous transactions with its subsidiary company which 
net off on consolidation – these have not been shown above.
25) Acquisition of subsidiary
During the year, the Group incorporated a new wholly-owned subsidiary in the USA, Xeros High Performance Workwear Inc.  
On 1 July 2017, Xeros High Performance Workwear Inc. acquired 100% of the trade and net assets of Marken PPE Restoration, 
a division of Marken Enterprises Inc., a company incorporated in the USA. 
For the six months ended 31 December 2017, Xeros High Performance Workwear contributed revenue of £249,000 and a loss 
of £499,000. If the acquisition had taken place on 1 January 2017, management estimates that consolidated revenue would 
have been £2,455,000 and consolidated loss before taxation would have been £(31,944,000). In determining those amounts, 
management has assumed that the fair value adjustments that arose on the date of acquisition would have been the same as 
if the acquisition had occurred on 1 January 2017.
Consideration transferred
The following table summarises the acquisition date fair value of each major class of consideration transferred.
 £000
Cash 577
Contingent consideration 192
Total consideration transferred 769
Contingent consideration
The Group has agreed to pay the sellers additional consideration up to a maximum of $250,000 (£192,000 at the date of 
acquisition) over a two-year period following acquisition. This is based on an earn-out calculation which requires the Company 
to achieve sales revenue targets in each of the two years. The Group has included £185,000 in creditors at 31 December 2017, 
being $250,000 translated at the year-end exchange rate. 
Acquisition-related costs
The Group incurred acquisition-related costs of £44,000 on legal fees and due diligence expenses. These costs have been 
included in administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of profit and loss and other comprehensive income.

Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed

 £000
Property, plant and equipment 38
Intangible assets 572
Trade and other receivables 26
Trade and other payables –
Total identifiable net assets acquired 636
Measurement of fair values
All assets and liabilities acquired are recognised at fair value. For trade and other receivables and trade and other payables, 
fair value was deemed to be equivalent to book value. Estimates were made in respect of property, plant and equipment and 
intangible assets based upon management’s assessment of the value in use of the assets to the Xeros Group.
The intangible assets acquired with the trade and assets comprise £246,000 in relation to non-contractual customer relationships 
and £326,000 in relation to the Marken PPE brand acquired.
Goodwill
Goodwill arising from the acquisition has been recognised as follows:
 £000
Consideration transferred 769
Fair value of identifiable net assets (636)
Goodwill 133
The goodwill arising from the acquisition consists largely of the synergies expected from combining the Marken PPE business 
with the proprietary Xeros technology and the workforce acquired.
26) Events after the reporting period
The Group entered into a key transaction after the reporting date of 31 December 2017.
On 22 March 2018, Xeros Technology Group plc purchased the trade and assets of Gloves Inc., a provider of cleaning, inspection 
and repair services for firefighter personal protection equipment with facilities in Atlanta and Miami, USA. The maximum total 
consideration for the acquisition is $1.1m, comprising an initial cash consideration of $800,000 and a conditional deferred 
payment of up to $0.3m. The conditional deferred payment is dependent on the future revenue performance of the trade 
and assets acquired from Gloves Inc.
For the year ended 31 December 2017, the relevant trade and assets of Gloves Inc. generated revenues of $0.99m and EBITDA 
of $0.36m.
Due to the proximity of the above business combination to the reporting date, the initial accounting for these transactions is 
still to be completed, and consequently details of the amounts of assets and liabilities acquired and fair value of contingent 
consideration are not disclosed within these financial statements.

The financial statements of the Company are presented as required by the Companies Act 2006 and in accordance with IFRS. 
The principal accounting policies adopted are the same as for those set out in the Group’s financial statements.
Critical accounting estimates and areas of judgement
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experiences and other factors, including 
expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these 
estimates. The estimates and assumptions that have the most significant effects on the carrying amounts of the assets and 
liabilities in the financial information are discussed below:
Carrying value of investments and intercompany loan balances
Xeros Technology Group has significant balances held as investments in subsidiaries and intercompany loan balances. The 
Directors consider the valuation and recoverability of these balances based on the potential future cashflows from utilisation 
of the Xeros technology. The Directors consider all available evidence in making their judgements on the recoverability of 
these balances, including internal forecasts and valuations performed by third parties. The Directors consider that there is 
no impairment of these amounts.
C2) Company results
The Company has elected to take the exemption under section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 not to present the parent Company’s 
statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income. The parent Company’s result for the year ended 31 December 2017 
was a loss of £1,842,000 (period ended 31 December 2016: £1,523,000).
The audit fee for the Company is set out in note 4 of the Group’s financial statements.
