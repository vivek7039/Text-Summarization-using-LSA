STRATEGIC REPORT
Chairman’s statement
SUCCESSFUL INTEGRATION
—
In my first statement a year ago, I stated that Greene King was a strong 
business with an excellent track record which, following the Spirit acquisition, 
was at an exciting time in its development. A year on, this remains the 
case. The team has worked extremely hard over the last two years on the 
integration, which has completed one year ahead of schedule. This means 
we can now give all our focus to pursuing opportunities to grow and take 
share, prioritising long-term value creation, while delivering continued strong 
cash generation and maintaining a robust balance sheet. Ours is a strategically 
strong and well managed business which is positioned to address the 
tougher trading environment forecast for the next few years. 
Overview
We achieved another year of record results and market outperformance, 
driven by a good performance from the underlying business and an 
additional seven-week contribution from Spirit. Group revenue grew 6.9% 
to over £2.2bn, while operating profit before exceptional and non-underlying 
items
1,2
 increased by 4.9% to £411.5m. Profit before tax, exceptional and 
non-underlying items
1,2
 grew 6.6% to £273.5m, leading to a 1.3% increase 
in adjusted earnings per share
1,2
 to 70.8p. 
Dividend
Reflecting this performance and confidence in our long-term prospects, 
the board has recommended a final dividend of 24.4p, giving a total dividend 
for the year of 33.2p. This represents growth of 3.6% compared to last 
year and continues the long-term track record of progressive dividends. 
The board continues to target minimum dividend cover of around two 
times earnings. 
People
We have 44,000 talented and hard-working team members. The continued 
success of the business during the Spirit integration demonstrates the effort 
they have put in over the last 12 months. I would like to take this opportunity 
to thank everyone who has worked so hard during the last year helping us 
to deliver these results at the same time as completing the integration of 
Spirit ahead of schedule. 
Board changes
At the AGM in September 2016, Ian Durant retired from the board after 
nine years, latterly as chairman of the audit committee. Rob Rowley took 
over as audit chair at the same time. In December 2016, Gordon Fryett 
joined the board bringing a wealth of experience of both retail and property 
through his career at Tesco. I should like to record the board’s thanks to 
Ian for his contribution to Greene King over such a critical period.
Looking ahead
We are excited about the opportunities we see in our core pub retailing 
brands, where the results from our brand conversions are showing very 
positive sales uplifts. We will continue with the programme over the coming 
years, ensuring our pubs remain attractive and relevant to our customers 
as they face into the challenges that the economic uncertainties will 
undoubtedly bring. 
Within the pub sector, Greene King’s combination of brands, teams and 
assets leaves us well placed to deliver long-term growth and returns to 
shareholders. Uncertainty affecting both business and consumer confidence 
is likely to continue following the recent election and the unknown length 
and outcome of the Brexit negotiations. Alongside the rest of the industry, 
we are experiencing significant cost pressures but Greene King’s scale and 
the consequent cost efficiencies, not least from the Spirit integration, should 
enable us to mitigate much of the cost increases. Our aim is to ensure that 
Greene King emerges from the near-term period of uncertainty stronger 
than ever and I look forward to reporting on our progress towards this 
goal in a year’s time.

BEST FOR
CUSTOMERS
We aim to be the best in 
the eyes of the customer, 
which means offering them 
industry-leading value, 
service and quality.
Our offering is delivered by the best people and in high quality, 
appealing pubs with clear and exciting brands and formats. 
With the dual challenges of weakening consumer confidence and growing 
competition, exceeding our customers’ expectations is more important than ever. 
This year we have invested more in improving value, service and quality (VSQ) 
in order to provide an even better offer for our customers, in line with our 
overarching aim of becoming the best pub company in the UK.
Our food development team is responsible for developing and delivering new 
menus and dishes across Pub Company. Its objective is to create best-in-class 
menus, making Greene King recognised for quality and choice, and offering 
customers experiences that they will value, remember and want to share. 
We have been focusing particularly on improving the quality and consistency 
of the most ordered dishes across Pub Company, targeting increased consumer 
loyalty. The team has reformulated how we serve these pub classics, including fish 
and chips and hunter’s chicken, with better ingredients and presentation across 
our retail brands. The investment in improving these dishes has been reflected in 
the results of our mystery guest programme, in which we benchmark our pubs 
against more than 20 other brands on VSQ measures. 
Recent results
 – Greene King’s top four dishes outperform the non-Greene King brands 
surveyed in our mystery guest programme, averaging over 8/10 versus 
non-Greene King brands, which averaged 7.81/10
 – Chef & Brewer’s burger scored the highest of all pubs surveyed
 – Chef & Brewer also scored highest for its chicken tikka masala and its chips
 – Flaming Grill scored highest for its hunter’s chicken
 – Greene King Locals (Mainstream) scored highest for its fish and chips
 – Our food development team was recently recognised at the Menu Innovation 
and Development Awards

STRATEGIC REPORT
Focus area
we believe we have a 
responsibility to support 
young people by creating 
opportunities to earn and learn.
The greatest asset we have at Greene King is our people. 
We employ around 44,000 team members across the group 
and so being an attractive place to work, retaining the best 
people and developing and investing in them are keys to our 
continued success. Greene King is uniquely positioned to offer 
careers across a number of roles, disciplines, environments and 
locations and we work hard to ensure that every member 
of our team gets the opportunity to learn and progress.
We have developed an industry-leading apprenticeship programme, with 
over 3,000 apprentices joining Greene King over the last year, gaining valuable skills 
which will help them build their career with us. Our programme offers bespoke 
qualifications that cover a range of jobs, including front of house, kitchen and 
management, which are tailored to each of our brands.
This year we launched Craft Academy, a brewing venture led by apprentices and 
based at Greene King’s brewery in Bury St Edmunds. The Craft Academy helps 
craft new talent by giving young people the chance to earn while they learn about 
brewing, design, marketing and sales. With the help of experienced mentors, 
the 18-month course teaches participants industry-specific skills as they work 
towards a bespoke apprenticeship qualification, all the while creating beers under 
the Craft Academy brand and bringing them to market.
Award winning
Our overall apprenticeship programme has been recognised by winning a number 
of recent awards, including:
 – Top 100 National Apprenticeship Employer 2016 (National Apprenticeship Service)
 – Best Apprenticeship Strategy 2016 (Springboard Awards of Excellence)
 – Top 70 School Leaver Employers Table 2017 (Rate My Apprenticeship)
 – National Apprenticeship Service (East of England) Highly Commended 2016

BEST FOR
COMMUNITIES
We strive to be the best 
for the communities in 
which we serve.
Our pubs support their communities in a number of ways, 
but charity is one of the key areas of focus. 
Locally, we support important charities close to our pubs’, team members’ 
and customers’ hearts, but as a business we have come together to establish 
a partnership with Macmillan Cancer Support.
Greene King and Macmillan both share the privileged position of being at the 
heart of the community. We think this is one of the reasons our partnership is so 
successful. We began working with Macmillan in 2012 and are proud to have just 
reached the incredible milestone of having raised £3m for the cancer charity.
This year, we launched our first company-wide fundraiser, Miles for Macmillan, in which 
our team members and customers are invited to walk, run, cycle and swim enough miles 
to reach the moon. The impressive challenge will see us cover a combined quarter of 
a million miles, taking part in local fun runs and bike rides, the London to Paris cycle ride 
and climbing Mount Kilimanjaro. 
As the partnership grows from strength to strength, we are now looking at how we 
can develop our support further. By 2020, one in two people will be affected by cancer 
during their lifetime and we believe that, by being so close to our communities, we have 
an opportunity to support people living with cancer. Therefore, during the next year, we 
are hoping to launch an employee volunteering programme with Macmillan where 
they can offer ‘light touch’ emotional support and raise awareness of national and local 
cancer support services to team members and customers. 
We are also developing Macmillan’s work and cancer training programme, which 
will enable our HR and management teams to support our own team members 
who are affected by cancer.
We achieved a huge amount last year and are looking forward to continuing to 
make a difference to the lives of those who are living with cancer.

improvements in estate quality as a result of the Spirit acquisition, the 
disposal of 54 pubs from the combined estate and synergy contribution. 
Operating profit grew 8.8% to £92.8m. 
Brewing & Brands achieved revenue of £200.3m in the year, up 1.7%. OBV 
was down 2.8%, in line with the total ale market and beating the cask ale 
market. Our share of the UK cask ale market was 10.3%. Operating profit 
was down 5.2% to £31.0m and operating profit margin was down 1.1%pts 
to 15.5%. Factors impacting profit conversion included increased cost of 
goods sold and investment in marketing and price, mainly in the second 
half of the year. 
The integration of Spirit was completed a year early with annual cost 
synergy realisation of £35m. 
The group delivered strong free cash flow

we again covered our debt service obligation, core capital expenditure and 
dividend from internally generated cash. Net debt to EBITDA

Adjusted earnings per share grew 1.3% to 70.8p and we have recommended 
a 3.6% increase in the dividend per share, maintaining our long-term 
progressive dividend policy. 
The business achieved another year of strong returns, generating a ROCE

of 9.4%, which remains comfortably above our weighted average cost of 
capital (WACC).

STRATEGIC REPORT
Trading environment
Consumer confidence in the UK has softened over the last 12 months 
with nominal wage growth starting to fall behind rising levels of cost 
inflation leading to a squeeze on disposable household income. While 
spending on essentials has held up, discretionary spending has started to 
fall. Within this, we believe that affordable treats such as visits to the pub 
will continue to play an important role in consumer discretionary spending. 
We anticipate that this challenging environment will intensify over the next 
few years, partly due to the ongoing political and economic uncertainty 
in the UK. If this is the case, we think our business model is well placed 
to outperform the market: Pub Company has good national coverage with 
a bias towards London and the South East; we operate pubs in the value, 
mainstream and premium sectors; and we have a good mix of sales between 
drink, food and rooms. In addition, 30% of our profits come from our 
cash-generative non-retail businesses, Pub Partners and Brewing & Brands. 
Our business model 
is well placed 
to outperform 
the market.
As well as the macro themes evident over the last year, we have also seen 
a number of developing consumer trends within the eating and drinking out 
sectors. Consumers are raising their expectations for their eating and drinking 
out experiences, particularly in the value, quality, service and environment 
of the offer, while they are also increasingly seeking out healthier options 
in their food and drink options. The digitalisation of leisure continues to 
develop at pace, with digital channels becoming increasingly important 
in getting closer to the consumer and in growing market share. We are 
active in using our scale, following the Spirit integration, to continue to 
invest in areas to ensure we meet consumer expectations going forward.
At the same time that the consumer is becoming more demanding, the 
cost environment has become more challenging. Regulatory pressures 
including the National Living Wage, the Apprenticeship Levy and business 
rates, compounded by inflation and foreign exchange costs, are impacting 
margins across the hospitality industry. We are at an advantage in that 
we have the benefits of the Spirit acquisition and integration to help offset 
these cost pressures but we shall also seek out opportunities for further 
cost savings. 
Due in some degree to the cost pressures described above, competition 
for market share is intensifying and broadening. We are the leading pub 
company in an eating and drinking out market that is expected to grow 
7.2%, or £6.2bn, over the next few years
1
. At the same time, it is expected 
that the local, wet-led pub sector will see an ongoing decline in the number 
of pubs, following falls of 12.5%, 8.2% and 12.5% in England, Scotland and 
Wales since 2011
2
. Competition for wet-led pubs comes predominantly 
from the off-trade, where we are seeing continued discounting being used 
to drive volume. Competition for our food-led destination pubs comes 
from the increasing supply of food-led outlets, expected to increase 1.9% 
between 2017 and 2020
1
, but also from the night in, supported by better 
home comforts, value offers from grocers and growth in delivery and 
takeaway aggregator sites.

Integration 
Following the acquisition of Spirit in June 2015, we have managed to complete 
its integration in just two years, one year ahead of the original schedule. 
This integration has created a much stronger business and a better platform 
for long-term growth and outperformance. There have been four key 
elements to the physical integration of Greene King and Spirit:
1.  Cost synergies – having originally targeted annual cost synergies of 
£30m within three years, we subsequently upgraded the target to 
£35m and we have managed to meet that target within two years. 
The main elements of the cost synergies included savings through 
overheads, purchasing and distribution. We may be able to generate 
additional synergies from the acquisition and these could be used to 
both invest in key areas of our business, such as people, systems and 
brands, and to offset some of the cost increases we are experiencing.
2.  IT systems – we have seamlessly rolled out the Pub Company IT 
system into over 1,700 pubs. We have also developed a single database 
for the combined business which is now in use and which is increasing 
customer insight while significantly improving efficiencies. 
3.  Distribution – the Spirit and Greene King food supply chains have 
been consolidated. Over 1,000 pubs have successfully changed their 
supply model with no impact on availability to menu items. We have 
also finished consolidating our non-food supply chain and our integrated 
drinks supply chain is in place. The integration of supply chains will 
enable us to optimise our network and improve group efficiency. 
4.  Organisation structures – we have completed an organisational 
restructure of the wider group, including reorganising the functions 
and teams within Pub Company to better align to our focus brands 
and combining the leadership of Pub Partners and Brewing & Brands. 
We believe this will enable further development of our focus brands, 
as well as delivering cost efficiencies and further synergies from the 
combined management of the non-retail divisions. We have also 
appointed a new chief commercial officer, who joined from Reckitt 
Benckiser and is responsible for all Greene King’s retail commercial 
activities across both the marketing and trading functions, and a new 
group HR director who joins us from Brakes in October. 
The integration of 
Spirit has created 
a better platform 
for long-term growth 
and outperformance. Annual report 2017 GREENE KING PLC 15
STRATEGIC REPORT
With the integration complete, we can increase focus on our brand 
optimisation strategy. This strategy is targeted at creating efficiencies through 
having a smaller number of larger pub retail brands including the five focus 
brands of Greene King Locals, Hungry Horse, Flaming Grill, Farmhouse 
Inns and Chef & Brewer. In the year, we spent £30.2m on brand conversions 
with 63 pubs successfully converted to more suitable brands within the 
combined Greene King portfolio. The average sales uplift for these pubs 
is over 30%. Looking ahead, we expect to make annual investments of 
£30m to £40m in brand conversions between FY18 and FY20.
Community
We raised over £800,000 for Macmillan Cancer Support over the year 
and, in May, the company reached a new fundraising milestone, having raised 
over £3m for the charity over our five-year partnership. Greene King will 
now embark on its ‘Miles for Macmillan’ campaign, in which the company’s 
44,000 team members and its guests are invited to walk, run, bike or swim 
enough miles to reach the moon. The impressive feat will see them cover 
a combined quarter of a million miles, taking part in marathons, a London 
to Paris bike ride in July and a climb of Mount Kilimanjaro in October. 
Last year, we announced our partnership with The Prince’s Trust, launching 
a new scheme giving unemployed young people an opportunity to develop 
skills in the hospitality sector, achieve accredited hospitality qualifications 
and apply for an internship at the group. Nine programmes were completed 
this year, with 103 young people taking part and 49 offers of permanent 
employment made. 
We also made a donation of £15,000 to Pub is The Hub’s Community 
Services Fund in order to help support rural pubs that want to diversify 
their services for the benefit of their communities. This is the fourth year 
we have given to the fund, bringing the total donated to £60,000.
Current trading 
In the first eight weeks of the year, Pub Company trading has been in 
line with our expectations, bearing in mind the tough comparatives from 
last year. Pub Partners has seen a slower start to the year but this was 
anticipated as we start to annualise the benefits from the Spirit integration. 
Brewing & Brands has returned to OBV growth with a strong start to 
the year in the take home, free trade and export channels.

Our business model
DELIVERING LONG-TERM 
GROWTH AND RETURNS
—
An integrated business model
In addition to driving growth in Pub Company through enhanced investment, further benefits of our integrated business model include the 
flexibility to transfer pubs between Pub Company and Pub Partners and ensure that we match each pub with the best operating model. 
Both Pub Company and Pub Partners are customers of Brewing & Brands, increasing the distribution of our ales.
Underpinning our business model is a financial strategy to maximise the strength, flexibility and efficiency of our balance sheet, with the aim 
of supporting growth through investment in our estate and selectively acquiring new sites, while maintaining our progressive dividend policy.
Our business model
Pub Company
Pub Company consists of both more food-
focused destination pubs and restaurants 
and more community-focused local pubs. 
The principal revenue streams are food 
and drink available for consumption on our 
premises. We gain further revenue from our 
accommodation offer on some sites, and 
a number of our sites have gaming machines. 
The success of Pub Company is driven by our 
customers’ desire to eat and drink outside of 
their homes and is specifically determined by 
the number of customers we attract and the 
amount that they spend with us. Pub Company 
(1,769 pubs) is the key growth driver for the 
group and in this division we typically own 
and operate the pubs. This division is a key 
focus area for growth and we will continue 
to invest the cash generated from the group 
in our people and our pubs to ensure that 
Pub Company continues to gain share in 
the UK eating and drinking out market.
Pub Partners
Pub Partners is responsible for operating our 
tenanted, leased and franchised pubs and aims 
to ensure that each pub has the right licensee to 
operate it, on the right agreement and with the 
right offer. Revenue in our Pub Partners business 
of 1,155 pubs is principally achieved through the 
supply of beer and other drinks to our licensees 
and the rent that they pay us for the pub and 
our support. We also derive a small portion of 
revenue from gaming machines. We both invest 
in this business, to ensure that we can offer 
prospective lessees the best pubs, and divert 
cash generated to invest in Pub Company.
Brewing & Brands
Brewing & Brands operates two breweries, 
one in Bury St Edmunds and the other in 
Dunbar, that brew our core portfolio of ales, 
which are complemented by an innovative 
range of craft ales. We generate revenue in 
this division from the sale and distribution 
of ales produced by us in our own breweries, 
and from the sale and distribution of drinks 
(both alcoholic and non-alcoholic) produced 
by third parties. As well as to our internal 
customers in the other divisions, we also sell 
our ales to other pub companies and to 
individual free trade customers. A further 
important revenue stream is the sale of 
our own-brewed ales to supermarkets 
and other retail outlets and, increasingly, 
in the export market.

Our markets
Overview
Our core markets are the UK eating out and UK drinking out markets. 
We also compete in the UK ale market through our brewing of our 
industry-leading ale portfolio and have a foothold in the UK staying 
out market.
The last 12 months have been characterised by a period of increased 
consumer uncertainty driven by a number of political and economic 
factors. Despite this uncertainty, consumer spending on eating out and 
drinking out is estimated to have grown 1.7% in the last 12 months
1
. 
Our core market, UK pubs and restaurants, is estimated to have grown 
1.5%
1
 with LFL growth of 1.1% over the last 12 months
2
.
Alongside this, our core markets have become increasingly dynamic 
and competitive, with more choice for consumers than ever before. 
We have continued to develop our offer to address this challenge and 
Pub Company successfully outperformed the market in the 12 months 
to April 2017, growing total sales by 7.7% and LFL sales by 1.5%.
Our core market, pubs and restaurants,

Economic environment 
Consumer confidence has weakened since the outcome of the EU 
referendum with consumers uncertain about the future outlook for both 
the economy and their personal finances. Despite this, UK real household 
spending grew by 2.8% in 2016. We remain cautious about the future 
economic environment as we have seen nominal wage growth start to 
fall behind rising inflation, creating a squeeze on the household disposable 
income available for discretionary spend.

STRATEGIC REPORT
Political environment
The current political environment is adding further challenges to the 
industry through the National Living Wage, the National Minimum Wage, 
the Apprenticeship Levy and the recent proposed increases in business 
rates and alcohol duties. All these policy initiatives will impact on costs 
and margins within the hospitality industry going forward. We continue 
to work closely with trade organisations to encourage the government 
to offset some of the industry impact from these initiatives while, at the 
same time, being proactive in dealing with these external headwinds.
Following the removal of the beer duty escalator in 2013, beer duty has 
either been cut or frozen in successive budgets until March 2017 when 
it was increased by 3.9%, along with similar increases for wines, spirits 
and ciders. This is expected to cost the UK pub industry £125m and 
could cost up to 4,000 jobs
1
.
The statutory Pubs Code went live in July 2016 and before the launch 
we trained over 100 team members to ensure we were as fully compliant 
with the statutory code as we were with the voluntary code. The main 
impact on Pub Partners will come from the ability of licensees to take a 
market rent only (MRO) option or, essentially, a commercial free-of-tie 
agreement. We have 27 MRO applications currently going through the 
adjudication process and at the year end we had no MRO agreements taken. 
We remain of the view that MRO will have no material impact on the group. 
UK eating and drinking out
We offer a variety of eating and drinking out options and experiences 
across both our destination pubs and local community pubs. We compete 
in a broad UK eating and drinking out market made up of 327,000 outlets 
and annual total spend of more than £88bn
2
. Within this market, the pubs 
and bars segment consists of 47,000 outlets and total spend of more than 
£22bn, or 25% of overall eating and drinking out spend.
The market is increasingly dynamic and competitive with the supply of 
new branded eating out sites improving the convenience and choice for 
consumers. At the same time, eating at home has become more attractive 
due to the twin drivers of grocery food deflation and the growth of branded 
takeaway and delivery businesses. There are also demand challenges with 
higher consumer expectations for value, service and quality, which are 
mainly impacting the value food sector, the ongoing digitalisation of leisure 
and the demand for healthier options.
Through our pubs and our portfolio of award-winning ales we offer choice 
for all types of drinkers and occasions. Drink is a key driver of overall 
spend in the pubs sector with 40% of all meals involving an alcoholic drink 
and 52% of consumers saying that alcohol is an important choice driver 
for where to eat
3
. A strong drinks range is therefore a crucial factor in 
achieving overall customer satisfaction and we aim to capture share of 
spend by providing a drinks range that offers value, quality and an 
experience for our guests. 
Although we have seen a decline in UK alcohol consumption, drinking out 
habits continue to evolve with an increasing shift towards quality vs quantity 
– presenting opportunities arriving in areas including premium ale and craft.
We have also seen a reduction in capacity in the wet-led pubs market. 
These two factors have resulted in strong market performance in the 
wet-led pubs segment, which outperformed the overall market in the 
12 months to April 2017 (market segment LFL sales growth of 2.9%). 
We remain optimistic about the future growth opportunities in wet-led 
pubs, which will be underpinned by premiumisation, events and new 
occasions (e.g. breakfast and coffee).
The overall UK eating and drinking out market is expected to grow by 2.3% 
over the next three years
2
, supported by supply growth in the market, 
increases in the proportion of adults eating out of home and the frequency 
with which they do so, and rising population and employment levels. 
Segments of the market such as fast food and ‘retail grab and go’ will be 
among the fastest growing parts of the market.
The pubs and bars segment is forecast to grow from £22bn today to 
£23bn by 2020 (1.5% CAGR)
2
. Our largest division, Pub Company, sits 
within the managed and branded pubs segment which will be the key 
driver of the evolution of the pub sector (4.1% CAGR)
2
 as consumers are 
drawn to brands that stand out and have defined, consistent propositions 
that signal reassuring brand familiarity, excitement and the opportunity to 
try something new. In contrast, overall spend in the tenanted and leased 
sector will continue to decline primarily as a result of falling supply. We see 
an opportunity here to buck the inherent market decline by strengthening 
the quality of our estate to win share from (less well invested) competitors.

UK ale market
The overall UK ale market declined by 2.7% in volume for the year 
to April 2017, driven largely by standard ale in keg and can. Changing 
promotional dynamics in the grocery sector in response to inflationary 
pressures have resulted in an eight-year low in promotional levels. 
The volume-driven standard ale sector has been particularly affected. 
The premium ale category, however, continues to grow, being up 3.5% 
in volume terms.
With continued interest from consumers for beers with heritage and 
provenance, as well as new drinkers looking for new styles of beer, we feel, 
as the UK brewer with the leading premium ale brand Old Speckled Hen 
and the leading premium cask ale brand Abbot Ale, coupled with an exciting 
range of seasonal and ‘craft’ beers, we are well placed to capitalise on 
these trends.
We expect the UK ale market to continue to evolve and improve but 
the focus will move away from volume and towards value as the trend 
towards premiumisation continues. We remain confident in our ability 
to continue to grow share with our enviable portfolio of brands that 
can meet the needs of consumers across all drinking occasions.
UK staying out market 
We compete in the UK provincial staying out market and offer great value 
and convenience to guests on both business and leisure visits. We see the 
combination of a pub restaurant and adjacent rooms to be an attractive 
guest proposition in the context of increasing business and leisure travel, 
and therefore one which offers plenty of opportunity for pubs to take 
share from the more traditional branded hotel chains. In 2016, we have 
therefore added a further 36 bedrooms to our estate, taking our year-end 
total to 3,433.
The staying out market enjoyed a strong year in 2016 benefiting from 
continued GDP growth. RevPAR in the provincial staying out market 
is expected to grow 3% in 2017 and 1.7% in 2018, driven by moderate 
increases in occupancy and average daily rate (ADR)
4
. We expect to see 
further upside from the increased popularity of the ‘staycation’, due to 
the increased cost of overseas holidays, and increases in inbound tourism 
due to the weaker pound.

be critical in driving our long-term growth. 
We will continue our brand optimisation 
programme, converting pubs to the most

ensure that we develop our brands in line 
with the changing economic environment. 
For Green King Locals, Pub Partners and 
Brewing & Brands, the Greene King brand 
is key to superior performance and we will 
continue to invest in communicating the 
brand’s benefits in order to maintain our 
brand marketing leadership. A strong digital

Overview
Our vision is to be the best pub company 
in Britain – the best for our customers, our 
teams, our communities and our shareholders. 
By being the best, we believe we will generate 
superior underlying growth and returns for 
our stakeholders. Pubs have to contend with 
a wider set of competitors, including coffee 
shops, takeaway aggregators and grab-and-go 
stores, more than ever before, and a faster pace 
of consumer change. This means we will try to 
redefine what our pubs offer their customers, 
ensuring they have a broader and more lasting 
appeal. In order to deliver our vision, we have 
identified five strategic priorities for the 
medium term:
Best for our customers, best for our 
teams, best for our shareholders 
and best for our communities

Underpinning our company strategy is 
a financial strategy designed to maximise 
the strength and flexibility of our balance 
sheet. Through a relentless focus on 
cash generated from operations, we 
will continue to cover our debt service 
obligation, our core capital expenditure 
and our dividend through internally 
generated cash flow. Our long-term 
financing provides us with funding for 
general business operations, including 
increasing our optionality to invest in 
the business. 
Key progress in the last 12 months:
 – Free cash flow continues to cover 
scheduled debt repayments after 
core capex and dividends
 – 4.0x net debt to EBITDA ratio
 – Dividend up 3.6%

 Own the UK’s 
best invested 
pub estate
Our aim is to own and run the best pubs 
in Britain, which we will achieve through 
proactive management of our pub portfolio 
and continued industry-leading investment 
in our estate. We will continue to drive 
the quality of our estate upwards within 
both Pub Company and Pub Partners by 
acquiring properties at the top end of our 
portfolio while divesting of those at the 
bottom. We will also look for investment 
opportunities to put more premium offers 
into our assets to better protect the 
long-term cash generation from our pubs. 
Annual core capital investment is expected 
to be £130m to £145m over the next three 
years. We will retain an element of flexibility 
in both brand conversion capex and core 
capex to ensure we invest in the most 
suitable way in response to the changing 
economic environment.
Key progress in the last 12 months:
 – Average 5–6 year investment cycle
 – Invested over £120m in core capex 
across the estate in the year
 – Continued returns > WACC
 – 65 tail disposals in our managed estate 
and 54 disposals in Pub Partners

Work with the 
best people
We employ around 44,000 people at 
Greene King and being an attractive place to 
work means offering a sociable and engaging 
environment while creating opportunities 
to develop and grow careers. Greene King 
is uniquely positioned to offer careers across 
a number of roles, disciplines, environments 
and locations and we work hard to ensure 
that every member of our team gets the 
opportunity to learn and progress. We put 
apprenticeships at the core of our talent 
strategy to help us develop skilled and 
committed individuals and our industry-
leading position has been recognised at the 
Springboard Awards for having the Best 
Apprenticeship Strategy. We also want to 
attract, recruit, retain and develop the best 
operators in our Pub Partners business and 
this means extending our focus on training 
and development to both existing and future 
licensees. Working with, and investing in, 
the best people will help us to deliver the 
very best service to our customers across 
our managed and tenanted pubs, our 
breweries and our depots.

Key performance indicators
For the fifty-two weeks ended 30 April 2017
To maintain focus on our five strategic priorities, we have a set of overall financial and non-financial KPIs 
which are used to track progress against our priorities and help align remuneration to performance.
SUMMARY
We assess projected and actual investment 
returns to ensure that we continue to focus 
capital expenditure on areas that generate 
the highest possible sustainable returns. In 
the year we achieved a return on investment 
of 24.5%.
DEFINITION
Return on investment across our core 
pub businesses. Calculated as the average 
incremental increase in pub EBITDA post 
investment divided by the total core capex 
invested in completed developments.

SUMMARY
We monitor return on capital employed in 
comparison to our overall weighted average 
costs of capital. ROCE for the financial year 
of 9.4% remains comfortably ahead of our 
cost of capital.
DEFINITION
Return on capital employed is calculated by 
dividing annualised pre-exceptional operating 
profit by periodic average capital employed. 
Capital employed is defined as total net assets 
excluding deferred tax balances, derivatives, 
post employment liabilities and net debt.
SUMMARY
Following a year of considerable change we 
have seen team turnover increase compared 
to the previous year though employee 
engagement scores have remained strong 
at 85%. The underlying net promoter score 
(NPS), which we use as a measure of service 
standards, increased by 0.5%pts to 58.4%.
Our increased investment in the recruitment, 
retention and development of our people will 
lead to a better trained and more motivated 
team across our business, which will be 
reflected in ongoing improvements in team 
retention and customer service.
DEFINITIONS
Team turnover – The percentage of leavers 
against the average headcount over a rolling 
annual period, excluding any student leavers.
Team engagement – The proportion of 
respondents who agreed with the following 
statement: ‘I would recommend Greene King 
as a great place to work to others’.
Net promoter score – Calculated by asking 
customers how likely they are to recommend 
the pub on a scale of 0–10 (10 being the most 
favourable). The percentage of responses where 
the score is 0–6 (brand detractors) is subtracted 
from the percentage of responses where the 
score is 9 or 10 (brand promoters) to give the 
NPS. Scores of 7 or 8 (passive) are ignored.

SUMMARY
We monitor LFL profit in order to understand 
the performance of our tenanted estate excluding 
the impact of disposals. LFL net profit grew 
by 5.0% compared to the prior year.
DEFINITION
Pub Partners’ LFL profit includes pub operating 
profit and central overheads but excludes 
exceptional items. LFL profit performance is 
calculated against a comparable 52-week period 
in the prior year for pubs that were trading 
for the entirety of both 52-week periods. The 
calculations include figures for acquired Spirit 
pubs for a comparable 52-week period in both 
the current and comparative financial years.

STRATEGIC REPORT
Our Pub Company strategy is to attract customers with exciting brands 
that deliver unrivalled value, service and quality. The acquisition of Spirit 
has helped us accelerate this strategy through the addition of successful 
brands and the opportunity to learn from each other and enhance the 
customer offer. It also provides greater scale to drive cost efficiencies that 
can be reinvested in the business and help to protect margins.
Pub Company is the core driver of growth within our business and it grew 
0.4%pts faster than the market
1
 over the year with LFL sales growth of 1.5%. 
Revenue was up 7.7% to £1,817.4m, driven by a good Christmas, a 
stronger fourth quarter, an impressive performance from our wet-led 
local pubs and a 4.1% increase in the average number of pubs trading. 
Sales figures were also boosted by average uplifts of over 30% from the 
brand conversions completed over the year. Drink sales growth was 
notably strong in the year. 
Operating profit grew 3.0% to £308.1m while the operating profit margin 
was down 0.7%pts to 17.0% following investment in food quality, customer 
service and price, as well as the difficult cost environment.
We also had a notably strong year from Local Pubs and we have recently 
invested in the ex-Spirit Taylor Walker estate in London, converting over 
100 pubs to the Greene King brand. The performance of Local Pubs has 
been supported by marketing campaigns such as the ‘To the Pub’ digital 
campaign and the ‘Best of British’ campaign and we will continue to target 
growth in Greene King Locals through campaigns this year such as 
‘Summer of Sound’, Greene King’s own music competition, run in 
conjunction with Radio X. 
On an underlying basis, our net promoter score grew 0.5%pts to 58.4%. 
We continue to target improved service and expect increased investment 
in labour and training to lift guest satisfaction scores across the business 
in the new financial year. 
The most important element of our business is the people we employ, 
with around 44,000 people working at Greene King, of which more than 
95% work in Pub Company. Following a year of considerable change, 
we saw a small increase in team turnover compared to the previous year, 
although employee engagement scores remained strong at 85%. Our 
leading apprenticeship programme saw another 3,076 starters in the year 
and we were pleased to receive the Best Apprenticeship Strategy award 
at the Springboard Awards as well as being the only pub company to 
appear in the Rate My Apprenticeship Top 70 School Leaver Employers 
Table 2017. Our increased investment in the recruitment, retention and 
development of our people will lead to a better trained and more motivated 
team across our business, which will be reflected in ongoing improvements 
in team retention and customer service. 
Consistent investment in our estate is one of the key differentiators of 
Greene King and a significant driver of our growth. We invested £93.3m 
in core capex over the year, we opened eleven new pubs at the top end 
of our estate and we successfully completed the disposal of 65 pubs at the 
bottom end as we continue to improve the overall quality of our estate. 
Digital is becoming ever more important in the eating and drinking out 
sectors. We now have one combined database platform across the group, 
improving the effectiveness of our customer digital communications. Our 
social media audience continues to expand with a 42% increase in followers 
of the Greene King Twitter feed, a 19% increase in LinkedIn followers and 
an increase of 24% in our Facebook fan base to 2.9m. Our new corporate 
website was launched in July 2016 and we have since seen a 148% increase 
in users to 80,000 per month. The website has had over 4m page views 
in total this year. Now that we have completed the integration of the two 
businesses, we can look toward further investment in digital innovation 
in order to increase engagement with, and insight into, our customers.
We had a notably 
strong year from 
Local Pubs.

STRATEGIC REPORT
In Pub Partners, our strategy is to be the preferred partner for the best 
operators in the industry. We will achieve this through the offer of the 
best retail partnerships in flexible formats and in the best pubs. 
Pub Partners has had another impressive year of growth, recording 
sector-leading LFL EBITDA growth and receiving a series of well deserved 
industry awards. 
The division operated 0.3% more pubs on average during the year, while 
revenue was up 5.8% to £198.8m. Revenue growth was driven by the 
increased number of turnover agreements in our estate, food supply 
agreements with licensees and the inclusion of the Spirit acquisition 
for a full year. EBITDA was up 8.2% to £103.1m and average EBITDA 
per pub was up 7.9% to £86.2k. LFL net profit was up 5.0% against 
a 4.4% comparative in FY16. 
We will continue to target growth and profitability within the division 
through increasing the number of turnover agreements, expanding the 
number of pubs ordering food directly through our supply chain and 
developing the offer available to those already benefiting from our 
supply chain, alongside a strong investment programme. 
Investment in our partners, including leadership, multi-site training and 
apprenticeship support, led to 12-month retention of new licensees of 
96%. Over 2,000 delegates benefited from training over the year and 
we recently launched a 12-month Management Development Programme, 
designed to help licensees develop and retain their key team members. 
We continue to dispose of non-core pubs which we do not believe will 
deliver good returns in the long term and to help us invest in those pubs 
with a long-term future. Over the course of the year, we sold 54 non-core 
pubs in line with this strategy. Most of our investment is targeted at 
repositioning pubs from value to mainstream or mainstream to premium, 
increasing the food mix within our pubs and improving the trading potential 
of outdoor spaces. This has driven improved financial performance in Pub 
Partners’ ROI and ROCE. 
The statutory Pubs Code went live in July 2016 and before the launch 
we trained over 100 team members to ensure we were as fully compliant 
with the statutory code as we were with the voluntary code. The main 
impact on Pub Partners will come from the ability of licensees to take a 
market rent only (MRO) option or, essentially, a commercial free-of-tie 
agreement. We have 27 MRO applications currently going through the 
adjudication process and at the year end we had no MRO agreements 
taken. We remain of the view that MRO will have no material impact 
on the group. 
Our success in being the preferred partner for the best independent 
operators was recognised when we received the Publican award for Leased 
and Tenanted Pub Company of the Year, the NITA training prize for our 
licensee development programme and the ALMR BDM of the year.

STRATEGIC REPORT
In Brewing & Brands, our long-term strategy is to win market share and 
increase cash generation through building consumer loyalty to our core 
ale brands and our innovative range of seasonal and ‘craft’ ales. This 
strategy has led to us being the UK’s leading premium cask ale brewer.
OBV fell 2.8% in a cask ale market down 3.8%
1
 and a total ale market 
down 2.7%
1
. Performance over the full year was held back by the weaker 
ale market combined with the reduction in our exposure to lower margin 
accounts in the on- and off-trade channels. The second half saw improved 
trading leading to record full year revenue of £200.3m, up 1.7%. Margins 
were impacted, however, by the increased cost of goods sold and 
investment in marketing and price.
Greene King’s core brands maintained their UK market-leading positions: 
Greene King IPA continues to be the fastest selling cask ale brand in the 
on-trade; Old Speckled Hen is still the number one premium ale brand 
with the highest prompted awareness amongst beer drinkers of 75%; 
Abbot Ale continues to be the number one premium cask ale brand and 
delivered a particularly strong year of growth; and Belhaven Best, Scotland’s 
number one draught ale, became the number four keg ale in the UK. 
This continued success was helped by maintaining our industry-leading 
brand investment: our sponsorship of the England and Wales Cricket 
Board included a new television advert starring Alastair Cook, Ben Stokes 
and Michael Vaughan; we won additional sporting sponsorships across 
rugby, football and cricket; we became the official beer supplier to the 
Royal Albert Hall; and we have been trialling a new lager brand for the 
Scottish market called Saltire. Most recently, Greene King partnered with 
Radio X to make a Radio X beer, available exclusively in Greene King pubs, 
called Amplified Ale. 
Brewing & Brands had a particularly innovative year, launching its Craft 
Academy in February and debuting five new beer brands developed by 
our team of apprentice brewers. The beers are Over Easy (3.8% session 
IPA), Big Bang IPA (5.6% bold and citrusy IPA), Bitter Sweet (6% black IPA), 
Desert Ryeder (4.8% rye beer) and High & Dry (5% dry hop lager). 
In addition, we successfully launched new gluten-free variants of 
Greene King IPA and Old Speckled Hen in January. 
Our beers won multiple awards this year. Our flagship iconic brand, 
Greene King IPA, achieved the sought-after Best Advertising Campaign at 
the Beer Marketing Awards and Best Packaging Redesign at the International 
Beer Challenge; Belhaven was named Exporter of the Year at the Scottish 
Beer Awards and scooped Best TV/Cinema advert in the Scottish 
Creative Awards; and six prestigious gold medals were awarded in the 
internationally recognised Monde Selection to Old Crafty Hen, Mighty 
Moose IPA, Twisted Grapefruit IPA, Twisted Thistle IPA, Intergalactic 
Dry Hop Lager and Bitter Sweet IPA.
Our brewery tours were also awarded a fifth consecutive Certificate of 
Excellence by TripAdvisor and the Westgate brewery brought home a 
President’s Award from ROSPA for achieving its eleventh consecutive 
gold safety award.
At the end of the year, we decided to combine the leadership of Brewing 
& Brands and Pub Partners, which we believe will foster greater collaboration 
between the two divisions as well as bringing increased cost efficiencies. 
We remain fully committed to investment in our market-leading brands 
and to driving further innovation within the Brewing & Brands business.

REVENUES REACHED 
A RECORD HIGH
GROUP REVENUE INCREASED:
6.9%
FREE CASH FLOW:
£119.6m
ROCE:
9.4%
DIVIDEND:
33.2p
Income statement 
Revenue was £2,216.5m, an increase of 6.9% compared to the prior year 
reflecting the benefit from LFL sales growth and a full year contribution 
from Spirit. Pub Company was the biggest driver of the increase, with 
revenue up 7.7% and average revenue per pub rising 3.4%. The combined 
Pub Company business now accounts for over 82% of group revenue. 
Total revenue in Pub Partners was £198.8m. Average tenanted and leased 
revenue per pub increased 5.5% and average EBITDA per pub grew 7.9% 
due to the improved quality of the pub estate and also benefiting from fair 
value accounting and the inclusion of synergies. Brewing & Brands grew 
revenue 1.7% to £200.3m. 
Operating profit before exceptional and non-underlying items was £411.5m, 
which was an increase of 4.9% on the prior year. Group operating profit 
margin before exceptional and non-underlying items was down 30 basis 
points to 18.6%, reflecting a higher contribution from the managed estate 
and, within this, a reduction in Pub Company margin from 17.7% to 17.0%. 
The reduction of the Pub Company margin reflected our ongoing investment 
in value, service and quality, alongside significant inflationary increases in 
the cost of goods sold and labour. 
Net interest costs before exceptional and non-underlying items were 
£138.0m, 1.7% higher than last year due to the full year impact of Spirit 
debt costs partially offset by refinancing activities in the year.
Profit before tax and exceptional and non-underlying items was £273.5m, 
an increase of 6.6% on last year. The tax charge before exceptional and 
non-underlying items equated to an effective tax rate of 19.9% (2016: 19.3%).
Basic earnings per share before exceptional and non-underlying items of 
70.8p was up 1.3%. Statutory profit before tax was £184.9m, down 2.6% 
on last year.
Cash flow and capital structure
Operating cash flows remained very strong. We generated free cash flow 
of £119.6m, ahead of our scheduled debt repayments of £55.0m and after 
our core capital expenditure and dividend payments. Free cash flow benefited 
from favourable working capital timing, a small reduction in core capex 
as we focused on brand conversions and the utilisation of non-recurring 
Spirit tax losses. Overall, EBITDA before exceptional and non-underlying 
items was £524.1m. 
In October, we agreed an amendment and extension to our revolving 
credit facility. The revised £400m facility runs to 31 October 2021 and 
provides shorter-term financing at more favourable pricing than the 
previous facility. 
Group net debt at the year end was £2,074.5m, an increase of £26.1m 
from last year.
— Annual report 2017 GREENE KING PLC 31
STRATEGIC REPORT
In line with our strategic priorities, our objective is to maximise the 
strength of our balance sheet, and the group has a capital structure 
aimed at meeting the short, medium and longer-term funding requirements 
of the business. The principal elements of the group’s capital structure 
are our revolving credit facility, that was £170m drawn at the year end, 
and two long-term asset-backed financing vehicles. At the year end, the 
Greene King securitisation had secured bonds with a carrying value of 
£1,392.5m and an average life of eleven years, secured against 1,464 pubs 
with a carrying value of £1.7bn and valuation at the time of issuance of 
£2.2bn. The Spirit debenture had secured bonds with a carrying value 
of £777.6m and an average life of eleven years, secured against 
1,010 pubs with a market value and carrying value of £1.5bn.
Our credit metrics remain strong with 96% of our interest costs at a fixed 
rate and an average cash cost of debt of 6.3%. Fixed charge cover was 
maintained at 2.3x and net debt to EBITDA increased slightly to 4.0x from 
3.9x last year. The Greene King secured vehicle had a free cash flow debt 
service cover ratio of 1.7x at the year end, giving 35% headroom. The Spirit 
debenture vehicle had a free cash flow debt service cover ratio of 1.9x 
giving headroom of 32%.
Capital expenditure and disposals
During the year, we invested in both maintaining and developing our existing 
estate. Total capital expenditure during the year was £194.9m with a further 
£39.1m of expenditure relating to pub repairs and maintenance recorded in 
the income statement. Core estate capital expenditure was £126.0m with 
a further £35.9m invested in acquiring pubs and developing previously 
acquired pubs. There were eleven new pub openings during the year. We 
also invested £33.0m in our brand conversion and IT integration programme.
We disposed of 65 pubs in Pub Company, 54 pubs in Pub Partners and 
three closed pubs, which led to a profit on disposal of £3.4m and raised 
proceeds of £88.6m. 
Return on capital employed (ROCE)
The group is focused on delivering the best possible returns on our assets 
and on the investments we make. We are focused on capital discipline, 
through targeted investment in new build pubs, single site acquisitions and 
in developing our existing estate to drive organic growth with disposals of 
non-core pubs. This has contributed to maintaining ROCE at 9.4%. ROCE 
remains comfortably ahead of the group’s cost of capital. 
Dividend
The board has recommended a final dividend of 24.4p per share, up 3.4%, 
subject to shareholder approval. This will be paid on 15 September 2017 
to shareholders on the register at the close of business on 11 August 2017.
The proposed final dividend brings the total dividend for the year to 33.2p 
per share, up 3.6%. This maintains our long-term track record of annual 
dividend growth and is in line with the board’s policy of maintaining a 
minimum dividend cover of around two times underlying earnings, while 
continuing to invest for future growth.
Tax
The effective rate of corporation tax (before exceptional and non-underlying 
items) was 19.9%, which is in line with the standard UK corporation tax 
rate, compared to 19.3% in the previous year. This resulted in a charge to 
operating profits (before exceptional and non-underlying items) of £54.3m 
(2016: £49.4m). The exceptional and non-underlying tax credit of £21.1m 
(2016: £50.5m) is discussed under exceptional and non-underlying items.
The group generates revenue, profits and employment, all of which deliver 
substantial tax revenues for the UK government in the form of duties, VAT, 
income tax and corporation tax. In the year, total tax revenues paid and 
collected by the group were £580m (2016: £570m). The group’s tax policy, 
which has been approved by the board, aligns with this strategy and ensures 
that the group fulfils its obligations as a responsible UK taxpayer. 
On 6 June 2016, a formal agreement was reached with HMRC on a number 
of historical tax positions and on 22 July 2016 the Court of Appeal published 
its final decision on the Sussex case. As a result, the group settled tax of 
£20.7m and interest of £12.2m during the year. 
We have one remaining open historical position with HMRC, which is an 
internal property arrangement implemented in 2012. The group is at a 
relatively early stage in discussions with HMRC and will continue to defend 
its position robustly. 
The provisions for uncertain tax positions and related interest accrued 
at the balance sheet date were £8.0m (2016: £31.6m) and £1.9m 
(2016: £13.8m) respectively. 
Pensions
The group maintains three defined contribution schemes, which are open 
to all new employees, and two defined benefit schemes, which are closed 
to new entrants and to future accrual.
At 30 April 2017, there was an IAS 19 pension deficit of £11.2m representing 
a reduction of £41.1m since the previous year end. The closing assets of 
the group’s two pension schemes totalled £888.0m and closing liabilities 
were £899.2m compared to £801.2m and £853.5m respectively at the 
previous year end. 
The deficit reduced due to strong asset returns and contributions made 
by the group during the year, combined with the impact of changes to 
market-based discount rates and inflation assumptions. 
Total cash contributions in the year were £3.9m for past service. 
The next triennial reviews for both the Greene King and Spirit pension 
schemes will be as at April 2018 and are due by July 2019.
Exceptional and non ‑underlying items
We recorded an exceptional and non-underlying items charge of £67.5m, 
consisting of a £65.0m charge to operating profit before tax, a £23.6m 
charge to finance costs and a net exceptional and non-underlying tax 
credit of £21.1m. Items recognised in the year included the following:
1.  A £10.8m charge for legal, professional, integration and reorganisation 
costs following the Spirit acquisition. 
2.  A net impairment charge of £58.6m (2016: £32.2m) was made against 
the carrying value of our pubs and other assets. This comprises an 
impairment charge of £77.7m offset by reversals of previously 
recognised impairment losses of £19.1m. A £23.7m impairment charge 
has been recognised in relation to a small number of pubs due to 
changes in the local trading environment and a further £34.9m of 
impairment has been recognised following the planned exit of certain 
sites during the current financial year. 
3.  A net surplus on disposal of property, plant and equipment of £3.4m 
(2016: £23.8m).
The total dividend 
for the year is 
33.2p per share. GREENE KING PLC Annual report 2017 32
STRATEGIC REPORT
Financial review continued
Exceptional and non ‑underlying items continued
4.  £23.6m of exceptional and non-underlying finance costs, which includes 
£23.6m of costs in respect of the mark-to-market movements in the 
fair value of interest rate swaps not qualifying for hedge accounting, 
£11.8m of costs recycled from the hedging reserve in respect of settled 
interest rate swap liabilities and a £12.2m gain on settlement of 
interest rate swap liabilities.
5.  The exceptional and non-underlying tax credit of £21.1m consists of a 
£5.0m tax credit on exceptional items, a £2.8m tax credit on non-underlying 
items, a deferred tax credit of £9.5m in respect of the licensed estate, 
a £0.5m tax charge in respect of prior periods and a £4.3m tax credit 
in respect of rate changes. 
Of the £67.5m total exceptional and non-underlying items charge, cash 
expenditure was £47.3m relating primarily to integration costs of £14.4m 
and settling £32.9m of historical tax positions with HMRC. 
Guidance for financial year 2017/18
We expect total gross cost inflation of around £60m and, after our cost 
mitigation plans of £40–45m, we expect net cost inflation of £15–20m.
In Pub Company, we anticipate opening c.10 pubs and disposing of 
50–60 pubs. 
In Pub Partners, we expect to dispose of 40–50 pubs. These disposals 
will continue to improve the quality of the estate while generating cash 
for other uses across the business.
We anticipate spending £130–145m, excluding brand optimisation capex, 
on maintaining and developing our pubs, in order to ensure they remain 
attractive places for customers to spend their time. 
Spend on the brand optimisation programme is expected to total £30–40m 
– out of a total spend over four years of £120–150m – and we are targeting 
EBITDA returns significantly ahead of our cost of capital. 
New build development capex is expected to be £30–40m. 
We expect the interest charge to be in the region of £135–140m 
when taking into account the charge relating to our debt facilities, 
pensions and provisions. 
The pre-exceptional tax rate is expected to be c.19%.

Risks and uncertainties
Greene King is not alone in facing a range of risks and uncertainties in the course of its business. 
Our aim is to identify and manage these risks effectively so that we can deliver on our strategic 
objective of being the best pub company in the UK and to maximise shareholder returns.
Approach to risk management
Board
Overall responsibility for the group’s risk management framework lies 
with the board. It reviews the group’s principal risks on an annual basis, 
together with the actions taken to mitigate them. The board has continued 
to focus on its risk tolerance by defining group-level risk tolerance 
statements to set out the board’s desired risk-taking approach to the 
achievement of our strategic objectives, in the context of managing our 
principal risks. Our risk tolerance is an expression of the types and 
amount of risk we are willing to take or accept to achieve our plan, and 
enables us to better determine the mitigating activities required to manage 
to within acceptable risk levels.
Details of our broad risk tolerance in relation to each of our key risks is 
set out in the table on pages 34 to 37.
Audit committee
The audit committee has been delegated responsibility for reviewing the 
effectiveness of the group’s risk management processes. It regularly reviews 
the risk management processes for each business unit and functional area, 
on a rotational basis, reviewing presentations from relevant management 
and challenging their analyses.
Management
The implementation of risk management and internal control systems is 
the responsibility of the executive directors and other senior management, 
with each business unit or functional area responsible for identifying, assessing 
and managing the risks in their respective areas. They are required to 
maintain, review and regularly update a risk register to assist in this process.
Risk management process
Classification of risks follows a standard methodology used in risk management 
and takes into account the likelihood of their occurrence and the scale of 
potential impact (both financial and reputational) on the business.
Once the key economic, operational, financial, people and strategic risks have 
been identified, each business unit and functional area is then responsible 
for evaluating current controls in place to manage their risks, drawing up 
plans to improve controls and managing new risks as and when they arise. 
Each key risk has an ‘action owner’ to ensure that responsibilities are formally 
aligned. To ensure continuous improvement across the business, progress 
of these risk implementation plans is monitored by senior management on 
a regular basis.
In addition, a group-wide risk committee reviews the individual risk registers 
in detail, monitors the risk mitigation plans and assists in the production of 
the group risk register, whereby risk registers are aggregated and considered 
on a top-down basis in the context of delivering our strategy for the group.
Given that some risks are external and not fully within our control, the 
risk management processes are designed to manage risks which may have 
a material impact on our business, rather than to fully mitigate all risks.

Business strategy
↑
Failure to adopt the right 
strategy for the group or 
poor execution of the group’s 
strategy could lead to 
reduced revenue, profitability 
and lower growth rates than 
our strategic objectives.
Our strategy is focused on building strong and attractive 
brands, delivering industry-leading service and quality, 
working with the best people, owning the UK’s best 
invested pub estate and maintaining a strong balance 
sheet and flexible capital structure.
Overall strategy is determined by the board at an annual 
two-day strategy meeting, and progress against strategic 
plans is reviewed regularly by the board and the operating 
board, which is tasked with the execution of the plans on a 
day-to-day basis. There is regular review of the execution of 
strategic plans by management in operating board meetings 
and at other relevant meetings.
We are comfortable 
managing risks which 
we understand and 
are consistent with 
the delivery of our 
strategic objectives.

Customer offer
↑
Failure to deliver an appealing 
customer offer, to identify 
and respond to fast-changing 
consumer tastes and habits 
(including the use of digital 
media), to respond to increased 
competition, to price products 
appropriately and to align the 
portfolio to the market could 
all lead to reduced revenue 
and profitability and lower 
market share and growth 
rates than anticipated.
We have identified a range of consumer trends and 
developed plans to respond to them, including the piloting 
of new brands or variations of existing brands and the sale 
of non-core sites. We use guest satisfaction tools and net 
promoter scores to collect customer feedback and measure 
performance of our pubs. Each brand has its own pricing 
strategy and discounting and promotions are carefully targeted. 
Competitor activity is monitored at both a strategic and 
tactical level, and we provide training, support and a range 
of innovative agreements for our tenants, so that they are 
also able to compete in their markets.
We support and train our employees to ensure service 
standards meet guest expectations and continue to improve, 
and we are increasing our use of social media to enhance 
our communications with our guests and other consumers.
With our vision to be the 
best pub company in the 
UK we expect to be able 
to react swiftly and 
appropriately to changing 
consumer trends to 
maintain earnings and the 
achievement of our 
strategic objectives.

Economic uncertainty and cost pressures
↑
We are at risk of a weakening 
economy and softer consumer 
confidence in the UK, 
particularly given the recent 
UK general election and as 
Brexit negotiations unfold. 
We also face significant cost 
headwinds, including wage 
cost inflation as a result of the 
introduction of the National 
Living Wage, higher business 
rates and increased costs of 
goods, which could all lead to 
reduced revenue, profitability 
and lower growth rates.
We have a relentless focus on value, service and quality 
and are continuing to invest in our pubs, as well as piloting 
new brands and variations of existing brands, to ensure 
that our pubs appeal to a broad range of consumers.  
Plans have been developed to mitigate much of the 
anticipated cost increases facing the business, including 
better procurement and labour scheduling and otherwise 
reducing our cost base. We have a broad geographic 
spread of pubs across the country, including in 
London and the South East.
We acknowledge and 
recognise that in the 
normal course of business, 
the group is exposed to 
risks in this area. We are 
willing to accept a level 
of risk in order to achieve 
our strategic priorities 
and will manage the 
business accordingly.

Data security
↑
A significant cyber security 
breach or other loss of data 
could impact our ability to 
do business, impacting both 
revenue and profitability. 
In addition we could suffer 
reputational damage and 
financial damage from fines 
or compensation. Deliberate 
acts of cyber crime are on 
the increase, targeting all 
markets and heightening 
risk exposure.
A data governance group oversees improvements in 
systems and processes, including information security, 
designed to maintain securely employee, customer and 
other data held by the group, and also seeks to raise 
awareness of issues among employees and ensure their 
compliance with our IT policies.
A range of enhanced controls have been introduced 
across the business by the group’s information security 
team to improve the security of our networks and 
systems, including encryption, enhanced access and 
information handling controls. Our networks are 
protected by firewalls and anti-virus protection systems, 
and threats to our data security, by viruses, hacking or 
breach of access controls, are constantly monitored.
We have a low tolerance 
level for significant 
breaches within our 
IT operations.

Recruitment, retention and development of employees and licensees
↑
If we are unable to recruit, 
develop and retain key 
employees it may be more 
difficult to execute our 
business plans and strategy, 
impacting our revenue and 
profitability. For our Pub 
Partners division we face 
similar issues with regard 
to licensees.
We have both a branded recruitment plan to ensure that 
we attract suitable candidates and operate a range of 
apprenticeship programmes. Career development plans 
are in place to retain key employees, whilst remuneration 
packages are benchmarked to ensure that they remain 
competitive. We have recently launched our new values 
programme, Winning Ways, to improve engagement 
across the business.
Where appropriate exit interviews are conducted to 
enable action plans to be developed to deal with key 
leaver reasons, and our annual employee engagement 
survey is used to obtain direct feedback from employees 
on a range of issues. Managers are tasked with developing 
action plans to deal with the feedback received.
For our tenanted pub business we have a range of tenancy 
agreements, training programmes and support available 
to attract and retain the best quality licensees.
The nature of the sector 
in which we operate 
is predisposed to high 
employee turnover levels, 
but we have a low tolerance 
for levels which exceed the 
sector average, and we 
expect our staff to have the 
appropriate skills to deliver 
the functions of the business.

PRIORITIES
Suppliers, distributors and our own production facilities
↔
We are reliant on a number 
of key suppliers and third party 
distributors and on our own 
ability to produce, package and 
distribute our own beers. 
Supply disruption could impact 
customer satisfaction and lead 
to loss of revenue whilst the 
long-term failure or withdrawal 
of a key supplier or distributor 
could also lead to increased 
costs. If we were unable to 
brew, package and distribute 
our own beers for long 
periods we could suffer loss 
of revenue and profitability.
We maintain back-up plans in case of the failure by or loss 
of a key supplier, and we expect our key suppliers to 
maintain disaster recovery plans which we review on a 
regular basis. Regular monitoring is undertaken of KPIs 
applicable to both third party suppliers and distributors, 
with issues flagged for resolution.
In the event of a failure in our own production and 
distribution activities a range of alternative solutions exist 
to enable us to continue to brew, package and distribute 
our own beers.
We recognise that we 
carry an inherent risk in 
relation to both our own 
production facilities and 
third party suppliers but 
we seek to minimise this 
risk through management 
and control.
1 2
Health and safety and food safety
↔
If we fail to comply with 
major health and safety 
legislation and cause serious 
injury or loss of life to one of 
our customers, employees or 
tenants, this could have a 
significant impact on our 
reputation, leading to financial 
loss. If there is an issue in our 
food supply chain, including 
the provision of incorrect 
allergen information, that 
leads to serious illness or loss 
of life to one of our 
customers this could lead to 
restrictions in supply, 
potential increases in the cost 
of goods and reduced sales.
We have a comprehensive range of formally documented 
policies and procedures in place, including centrally 
managed systems of compliance KPI tracking and internal 
and independent audits to ensure compliance with current 
legislation and approved guidance. Our health and safety 
policies have been reviewed by our primary authority 
partner, Reading Borough Council, which has rated our 
safety management system, which includes training for all 
relevant staff, as very good. We have also established a link 
between EHO ‘Scores on the Doors’ and remuneration 
incentives for relevant employees.
In our tenanted estate we have a detailed compliance 
programme to ensure that pubs are safely handed over 
to new tenants. 
In relation to our food supply chain we require all suppliers 
to have BRC or SALSA accreditation as a minimum and we 
risk-rate suppliers on an annual basis to determine audit 
type and frequency. Regular meetings are held with key 
suppliers to review issues and follow up on any corrective 
actions required.
We have no tolerance for 
health and safety or food 
safety breaches within 
our operations.

Funding requirements
↔
If we are unable to meet the 
funding requirements of the 
group we risk reduced revenue 
and lower profitability than 
our strategic plan.
The group’s debt structures and financing requirements 
are kept under regular review. The group has a £400m 
bank facility to support activities outside the securitisation 
and debenture vehicles, which is available until 2021, and 
we completed a tap of the Greene King securitisation 
vehicle in May 2016.
The Spirit debenture has secured bonds with a carrying 
value of £770m and an average life of eleven years. 
A group treasurer has been appointed to manage 
the group’s funding requirements going forward.
We expect the group to 
be able to access suitable 
financial facilities to meet 
the ongoing requirements 
of the business and our 
longer-term strategic 
objectives.

Covenant risks
↔
If we are unable to meet the 
covenant requirements of the 
group’s debenture, securitisation 
and other financing arrangements 
our ability to pay dividends or 
reinvest cash could be affected, 
which in turn would damage 
our reputation and ongoing 
creditworthiness.
Long-term strategy and business plans are formulated to 
ensure that financial covenants can be met and monitored 
on a regular basis. Working capital is carefully forecast, 
regularly reviewed and closely managed by the finance teams. 
The refinancing model closely tracks future covenant 
headroom across all debt platforms through all 
transactions considered.
We expect to be able 
to meet our payment 
obligations and covenant 
levels under a range of 
cautious but plausible 
liquidity scenarios.

Pension scheme funding
↔
Any inability to meet the funding 
requirements of our defined 
benefit pension schemes, which 
are subject to the risk of changes 
in life expectancy, actual and 
expected price inflation and 
investment yields, could impact our 
balance sheet, whilst the volatility 
of the deficit makes longer-
term planning more difficult.
All schemes are closed to future accrual to reduce 
volatility. We are proposing to extend a liability 
management programme in the Spirit scheme to the 
Greene King scheme, whilst there is regular monitoring 
of the schemes’ investments and an ongoing dialogue  
with the trustees regarding funding requirements.
We expect to maintain 
funding levels for our 
pension schemes at 
manageable levels.

Viability statement
In accordance with provision C.2.2 of the 2014 UK Corporate Governance 
Code, the board is required to assess the prospects of the company over 
an appropriate period of time selected by it.
The board concluded that for these purposes a three-year period was 
appropriate as it is aligned to the group’s strategic planning process. 
The latest three-year plan was approved by the board in February 2017 
and covers the three-year period to the end of the 2019/20 financial year.
Long-term financing is provided by the group’s securitisation and 
debenture vehicles both of which have a weighted average life of eleven 
years remaining. The group also utilises a £400m revolving credit facility, 
which expires in October 2021, to provide liquidity and to manage its 
seasonal cash flows.
The group’s three-year plan is prepared by consolidating each business 
segment’s own plan and overlaying group assumptions in respect of estate 
optimisation and capital structure. Key assumptions underpinning the three-year 
plan and the associated cash flow forecasts are the economic outlook, 
revenue growth expectations, impact of expected inflationary cost pressures 
and estate development and disposal opportunities.
The three-year plan considers cash flows and compliance with the 
financial covenants contained within the group’s revolving credit facility 
and structured finance vehicles.
As detailed on pages 34 to 37 the board has conducted a robust assessment 
of the principal risks facing the company. This includes consideration of 
strategic risks, economic and market risks, operational and people risks 
and financial risks. The resilience of the group to the impact of these risks 
has been assessed by applying significant but plausible sensitivities to the 
cash flow projections based on past experience. This includes modelling 
the effect of reduced consumer confidence and therefore spending, the 
failure of our business to maintain and develop compelling customer offers, 
food safety issues, lower than anticipated acquisition synergies and the 
impact of increased regulation across the business.
Taking account of the company’s current position, principal risks and the 
sensitivity analysis discussed above, as well as the potential mitigating actions 
that the company can take, and the experience that the company has in 
adapting the business to change, the board has a reasonable expectation 
that the company will be able to continue in operation and meet its 
liabilities as they fall due over the three-year period of assessment. GREENE KING PLC Annual report 2017 38

Corporate responsibility
MAKING A POSITIVE 
CONTRIBUTION
—
We recently reached £3m of funds raised for Macmillan Cancer Support 
since the launch of our corporate partnership with them in 2012. This is 
testament to the thousands of our people and customers who back our 
partnership and who have raised £1m in the past year alone.
The money we raise directly funds patient care, with Macmillan’s nurses 
supporting hundreds of thousands of people diagnosed with cancer every year.
We were delighted to be recognised by Macmillan this year by winning 
a Fundraising Excellence Award at Macmillan’s corporate partnership 
event. We were also shortlisted at the Better Society Awards for the 
Best Scheme to Encourage Staff Fundraising.
In the coming year, we are looking to grow our partnership beyond 
fundraising with a volunteering programme for our people and by 
introducing Macmillan’s work and cancer training to support our team 
members who may be affected by cancer. 
Keeping it local
For the fourth year in a row, we donated £15,000 to not-for-profit 
group Pub is The Hub’s community services fund, which helps rural 
pubs diversify their services for community benefit. 
Our team members based in Burton upon Trent have supported the local 
St Giles Hospice, donating £1,000 from money raised at the office’s Christmas 
party, plus 50 chairs to the hospice’s outlet store after a refurbishment.
At our head office in Bury St Edmunds, the Finance Shared Services 
department has been supporting East Anglia’s Children’s Hospices 
(EACH). This year they have proudly presented a cheque for £27,000, 
which has been raised for the charity during the past five years.

Miles for Macmillan
In 2016, we launched our first company-wide fundraiser, Miles for 
Macmillan. The campaign aims to achieve enough miles to get to the 
moon (250,000) during the next three years, with team members 
and customers choosing to run, bike, hike and swim in return for 
sponsorship. From local fun runs to the London to Paris cycle ride 
and Mount Kilimanjaro climb taking place in the coming months, 
our team members are getting fit while raising money.
We are particularly proud of one of our team members, Julie English, 
who is taking on the enormous task of climbing Mount Kilimanjaro 
later this year. Julie works in our property team and has been given 
the all clear following breast cancer in 2015 so is ready to take on the 
challenge. Julie has always been fit and got straight back into running 
during and after her treatment and is training hard for the climb. 
Julie said: “I decided I wanted to do something new and take on a 
big challenge, so I’ve signed up to do Mount Kilimanjaro as part of 
our Miles for Macmillan campaign. I am terrified but I want to raise 
as much money as I can.”

The Prince’s Trust: Adam Walch
Adam Walch felt uninspired at 18, after two years working in jobs 
where he did not feel a sense of passion or enjoyment. Then he 
discovered The Prince’s Trust’s ‘Get into Hospitality’ programme 
at his local job centre.
He says the three weeks’ training helped shape his understanding 
of hospitality and after completing the programme he was offered 
a front-of-house role at the Caernarvon Castle in Prenton. Adam 
has now been there for a year and said: “I love what I do and work 
alongside a fantastic and supportive team. I’d highly recommend the 
programme to anyone looking into a career in the hospitality industry 
– it’s given me opportunities I never thought I’d be able to pursue.”
Apprenticeships 
Our award-winning apprenticeship programme has now seen over 
9,000 team members work towards an apprenticeship qualification 
since it began in 2011. This year we have also focused on introducing 
apprenticeships to other areas of our business outside of Pub Company. 
We have also been planning for the introduction of the Apprenticeship 
Levy and have all the necessary processes in place for this new method 
of funding apprenticeships in the UK.
We are delighted to have been recognised this year by featuring in the 
government-supported Top 100 Apprenticeship Employers List. Greene King 
was also the only pub company to appear in the RateMyApprenticeship 
Top 70 School Leaver Employers Table 2017 and won Best Apprenticeship 
Strategy at the Springboard Awards for Excellence.
A year with The Prince’s Trust
We continue to support disadvantaged young people at the start of 
their careers through our partnership with The Prince’s Trust. We are

Corporate responsibility continued
With more than 200 years of trading history behind us, we are committed 
to providing customers with the best experiences. As part of our ongoing 
goal to be the best in our industry, we also have a responsibility to 
champion healthy eating and responsible drinking. 
Nutritional improvement – focusing on choice
We continue to review the nutritional content of our menus and are 
working towards full compliance with the government’s 2017 salt targets. 
In line with the publication of the Childhood Obesity – Plan for Action 
report in 2016, we are reviewing the sugar and salt content of a number 
of our product ranges, as well as working closely with our suppliers, in 
order to nutritionally improve the dishes on our menus, particularly 
those designed for children.
Furthermore, we continue to provide a range of lower-calorie menu 
options for customers looking for a lighter option, such as within 
Flaming Grill and Greene King Locals. As a key part of the menu 
development process, we regularly review our menus to provide 
healthier options for customers.
Allergens – bringing together one process 
across the business
Following our acquisition of Spirit in 2015, we have taken the opportunity 
to review our allergen policies in order to ensure we have a clear set of 
guidelines across the business. The full allergen information of all of our 
meals is now available, which our customers can request when they visit 
one of our pubs or restaurants, as well viewing it beforehand on our 
branded websites. 
Gluten
We continue to respond to the growing demand to provide a range of 
dishes for customers wishing to avoid gluten. Our spring/summer 2017 
menu launch contained a separate menu containing no gluten ingredients 
to highlight further dish choices for our customers. Our Eating Inn brand 
now has a range of dishes containing no gluten ingredients to choose 
from, such as our seabass and scallop risotto or halloumi niçoise salad. 
We have also recently launched gluten-free versions of two of our most 
popular beers, Old Speckled Hen and Greene King IPA, as we look to 
make beer more accessible to customers who have reduced their gluten 
intake for health or lifestyle reasons.
Vegan dishes
A rising demand for vegan dishes means this is something a number of 
our menus now take into account, including Old English Inns, which offers 
a roasted vegetable bowl with cherry tomatoes as well as a chocolate and 
coconut torte. We continue to further develop our vegan and vegetarian 
dish ranges.

Enjoy Responsibly website
As part of our continued commitment to promoting responsible 
drinking, we relaunched our Enjoy Responsibly website as part of a 
wider Greene King corporate website refurbishment. It has been 
designed to offer information and advice on enjoying alcohol responsibly. 
It provides information such as how much is too much alcohol, 
how to cut down, advice on alcohol and young people plus tips for 
enjoying alcohol responsibly. 
All of our brands promote the Enjoy Responsibly website on their 
marketing materials. 
For more information, please visit www.enjoyresponsibly.co.uk. 
Food standards 
We are proud that out of the 1,614 pubs visited in 2016/17 by local 
authorities, 1,538 (95.29%) earned a four or five star rating. It is paramount 
that we provide our customers with consistently high quality food and so 
we actively promote excellent kitchen standards. In Pub Company, this 
is achieved through training, internal and external audits and operational 
incentive schemes. 
Promoting responsible drinking
All our Pub Company premises operate the ‘Challenge 21’ or ‘Challenge 25’ 
programmes and team members must pass an online training course on 
this before they can serve alcohol. 
We are proud that a number of our venues across the UK achieved Best 
Bar None accreditations this year. Our pubs belong to Pub Watch and 
Best Bar None where access to these schemes is available. 
In 2016, more than 1,000 Greene King pubs took part in our annual 
Christmas anti-drink-drive campaign with Coca-Cola, by offering 
nominated drivers a free soft drink. 
Quality standards for our beers
Westgate Brewery in Bury St Edmunds and the Belhaven Brewery in 
Dunbar have once again achieved an A-grade rating with the British Retail 
Consortium confirming that our beers are always brewed to the very 
highest of quality and food safety standards.

Energy and carbon
This year, we have introduced ‘Night Watch’ to reduce energy consumption 
by our managed pub estate. This means between the hours of midnight and 
7.00am, all electricity is turned off where possible, such as all lights, boilers 
and bottled fridges. We report on this weekly, which gives us the ability to 
track progress and ensure that energy reduction is in place by site.
We are also pleased to now report that all of our managed pubs are fitted 
with LED lighting in all customer-facing areas. The final 216 pubs had LED 
lighting installed this year. In their first full month of having LEDs, the last 
216 pubs to be fitted reduced their electricity consumption by 204,000kWh. 
To reduce energy used in our beer cooling systems, we have invested in 
eco pumps. We have installed these in 1,100 of our pub cellars, which will 
cut energy use by 44% in these pumps. 
Our Brewing & Brands division is continually seeking to reduce energy 
consumption and carbon emissions. Initiatives during 2016 included improving 
the energy efficiency of lighting at our Bury St Edmunds bottling plant, 
aiming to save 200,000kWh per year. Better training for our drivers has 
also ensured vehicles are less likely to be left idle with the engine on, 
reducing fuel waste. Several other projects are ongoing, such as investigating 
the procurement of green CO
2
 from local sources for use in our brewing 
and packaging operations.

Zero waste to landfill by 2020
As a 218-year-old company, sustainability is at the heart of Greene King 
and we have recently become the first major pub company in the UK 
to pledge that by 2020 we will send zero waste to landfill. 
The declaration follows the launch of Greene King’s partnership with 
waste management company SWR in April 2016, and its commitment 
to the Courtauld 2025 initiative to create a best practice waste solution. 
This has already led to 95% diversion away from landfill since the 
agreement was signed, with almost 8,000 tonnes of food diverted 
from landfill across the entire estate. Initiatives have been introduced 
across our managed sites, including pub teams separating waste into 
dedicated bins for food, cardboard, glass and other materials before 
it is collected, reducing our number of general waste bins by 42%.

Water
We are at the forefront of the new water market, being the first 
self-supply licence holder and the first to implement a switch on the 
market database. By holding the licence, we can continue to reduce 
water used in our pubs as well as ensuring data is correct for accurate 
billing and that costs are competitive and transparent. 
Preventing water waste is important to our business and a focused 
programme of water leak identification and repair is ongoing within 
our production areas. It is proving successful not just in reducing leaks, 
but also in raising awareness of the importance of highlighting leaks 
as soon as they occur. 
Other 2016 initiatives included reusing water and not allowing it to 
drain away, thanks to a secondary reverse osmosis plant in the brewery. 
This has saved 7,800m
3
 of water – the equivalent of more than three 
Olympic-sized swimming pools.

Greene King Brewing & Brands has achieved recertification to the 
International Standard for Environmental Management Systems. This has 
a core set of values, known as the ISO 14001, for developing an effective 
environment management system. A work programme is already underway 
at Greene King to transition to the new ISO 14001 standard. This led to 
a senior management forum that was a great opportunity for discussion 
of a wide range of internal and external environment-related issues facing 
the business now and in the future.
Mandatory greenhouse gases 
The table opposite, which has been produced in compliance with the 
requirements of the Companies Act 2006 (Strategic and Directors’ Report) 
Regulations 2013, shows the main greenhouse gas emissions in tonnes of 
CO
2
 equivalent (CO
2
e) for our scope 1 (direct) and scope 2 (indirect) 
CO
2
 emissions. The figures below include those of Spirit Pub Company 
from the date of acquisition, being 23 June 2015, except where stated.
Scope 1 relates to the direct emissions from the fuels we use in our 
breweries, pubs, restaurants, hotels and offices such as natural gas and 
liquid petroleum gas. It also includes emissions from owned vehicles 
(including company cars) but excludes logistics where we outsource this 
to third parties. Refrigerant gas and F-gas emissions in respect of our 
breweries, pubs and restaurants are also included, except in relation to 
Spirit Pub Company for 2015/16. 
We have used the UK government’s greenhouse gas (GHG) Conversion 
Factors for Company Reporting for all scope 1 emissions (2015 for 2015/16 
and 2016 for 2016/17). GHG emissions from refrigeration and air conditioning 
units have been determined using the simplified material balance method as 
described in the Environmental Reporting Guidelines 2013. 
Scope 2 relates to the indirect emissions associated with the generation of 
electricity consumed in our sites. Emissions have been calculated using the 
Carbon Reduction Commitment (CRC) Energy Efficiency Scheme factor 
(2015 for 2015/16 and 2016 for 2016/17).
Electricity and gas figures in the table below cover the CRC reporting 
period from 1 April to 31 March each year, whilst all other figures cover 
our respective financial years. The intensity ratio refers to turnover in our 
Pub Company and Brewing & Brands businesses as the vast majority of 
our CO

 emissions relate to those businesses.

KEY TO COMMITTEES GREENE KING PLC Annual report 2017 46
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
Statement of compliance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code (2014 version)
The company is subject to the UK Corporate Governance Code which 
is issued by the Financial Reporting Council and which is available at 
www.frc.org.uk. The Code sets out guidance in the form of principles and 
provisions on how companies should be directed and controlled to follow 
good governance practice. Companies listed in the UK are required to disclose 
how they have applied the main principles and whether they have complied 
with its provisions throughout the financial year. Where the provisions 
have not been complied with companies must provide an explanation. 
The board considers that the company has complied with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code dated September 2014 throughout the year in all respects, 
save that, during the period between the retirement of Ian Durant from 
the board in September 2016, until Gordon Fryett joined the board on 
1 December 2016, there were only two independent non-executive director 
members of the audit committee, one less than the three required by 
Code provision A4.2. Although the decision to appoint Gordon Fryett 
was made and announced in September 2016, his appointment only 
became effective on 1 December 2016 as his prior commitments meant 
that he was unable to attend any meetings scheduled prior to that date. 
The board
Board composition
As at the year end the board comprised the chairman, two executive 
directors and four non-executive directors. The non-executive chairman 
is Philip Yea, the chief executive is Rooney Anand and the senior 
independent director is Rob Rowley. 
The board believes that the structure and size of the board are appropriate 
and that no single individual or group dominates the decision-making 
process. During the year one non-executive director, Ian Durant, retired 
from the board and he was replaced by Gordon Fryett, who joined the 
board in December. Further details are set out in the nomination 
committee report.
The directors’ biographies are on pages 44 and 45. 
Corporate governance statement
Chairman’s introduction
I am pleased to introduce this report on the systems of 
governance and control which the board operates to ensure that 
we comply with the main principles and relevant provisions of the 
UK Corporate Governance Code (the Code). As a board we take 
corporate governance very seriously, and I will continue to ensure 
that we maintain high standards throughout my tenure.
The 2016/17 financial year was a busy one for Greene King. 
The business focus continued to be on dealing with the integration 
of Spirit Pub Company and on the performance of our three main 
business units, whilst at board level we continued to ensure that 
we have a well balanced and effective board, strong oversight 
of risk management, alignment of remuneration policies with 
shareholder interests and sound shareholder relationships. 
In accordance with the Code, we conducted a board evaluation 
exercise during the year. We used an internally generated questionnaire 
covering a range of topics as a starting point, which was completed 
by all board members and the company secretary. I then followed 
up on these with individual discussions with everyone who had 
completed the questionnaire, with a view to focusing on how to 
improve board effectiveness. As a result we have implemented 
a number of minor changes to our ways of working, but I am 
pleased to be able to report that nothing significant was raised.
Finally, I would like to thank my fellow directors for their support 
during my first year as chairman. I am confident that we can continue 
to maintain a strong and effective governance system to enable 
the business to deliver its strategy, generate shareholder value 
and safeguard our shareholders’ long-term interests. 
Philip Yea
Chairman 
I believe we can 
continue to maintain 
a strong and effective 
governance system. Annual report 2017 GREENE KING PLC 47
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
Independence of non-executive directors
In compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code, more than half 
of the board, excluding the chairman, are non-executive directors. The 
board is satisfied that all of the non-executive directors were independent 
throughout the year, in that they satisfied the independence criteria of the 
code on their appointment and continue to satisfy those criteria. 
Philip Yea, the chairman, was independent on appointment, having never 
been employed by the company and having diverse business interests 
beyond the company, and in the opinion of the board remains independent.
Rob Rowley was the senior independent non-executive director during 
the year. He too has never been employed by the company and has diverse 
business interests. As well as supporting the chairman and acting as a 
sounding board for the chairman and an intermediary for other directors, 
a key responsibility for the senior independent director is to be available 
for direct contact from shareholders should they require.

Leadership
Role of the board
The board has collective responsibility for the long-term success of 
the company and for its leadership, strategy, control and management. 
The offices of chairman and chief executive are separate and distinct and 
the division of responsibilities between them has been clearly established, 
set out in writing and agreed by the board. 
The chairman is responsible for the leadership and effectiveness of the 
board and for ensuring that each non-executive director is able to make 
an effective contribution to the board through debate and discussion with 
the executive directors. He is also responsible for setting the style and 
tone of board discussions.
The chief executive’s role is to develop the company’s strategic direction 
and to lead senior management in executing the company’s strategy and 
managing the operational requirements of the business. 
The non-executive directors have a particular responsibility to ensure that 
the strategies proposed by the executive directors are carefully examined 
and fully discussed, that the performance of the company is monitored 
and challenged and that the financial information provided is comprehensive 
and accurate. They are also responsible for ensuring, through the relevant 
committees, that appropriate remuneration arrangements are in place 
for the executive directors.
Operation of the board
The board has a formal schedule of matters which are reserved for its 
consideration, including approval of the long-term objectives and strategy, 
approval of budgets and financial statements including the annual report 
and accounts, acquisitions and disposals, changes to the structure of the 
group and overall corporate governance issues. It reviews trading 
performance and considers major capital expenditure.
The board has delegated certain responsibilities to standing committees, 
details of which are set out on page 48. By delegating key responsibilities 
to these committees, the board is able to ensure that adequate time is devoted 
by board members to the oversight of key areas within their responsibility.
Day-to-day management and control of the business is delegated to the 
executive directors, business unit managing directors and certain key functional 
heads, who meet formally on a four-weekly basis together with other senior 
managers as appropriate. 
Board meetings are scheduled to be held eight times a year, with main 
meetings linked to key events in the company’s financial calendar, with the 
annual results and dividend being approved in June or July and the interim 
results and dividend in November or December. Regular agenda items 
include an overview of the market and current trading as well as a detailed 
review of financial performance against agreed targets. 
There is a two-day meeting of the board in February each year focusing 
on strategy, with the business unit managing directors and heads of the 
main functional areas, namely trading, marketing, HR and property, attending 
for part thereof. The strategy sessions include an in-depth review of 
relevant economic factors and issues affecting the sector and management’s 
projections for the medium term. The board then has the opportunity to 
agree the strategic plans across all areas for the short and medium term. 
Following approval of the company’s strategy, budgets are prepared for 
the next financial year, which are reviewed and approved by the board in 
April. The board also has a programme to conduct more detailed reviews 
of different aspects of the business at each meeting, with the schedule 
of topics being regularly reviewed to ensure that it remains appropriate. 
The relevant managing director or functional head attends such meetings 
to present and answer questions. 
The board has responsibility for determining, with the assistance of the 
audit committee, whether the annual report, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced 
and understandable to enable shareholders to assess the company’s 
performance, business model and strategy. In coming to its view, the board 
took into account the views of the audit committee, which assisted in the 
process this year, as well as its own knowledge of the group, its strategy 
and performance in the year, the guidance given to all contributors to 
the annual report and a detailed review by senior management of the 
overall content.
Key focus areas for the board during the year included the continuing 
integration of the Spirit business, focusing on both synergy capture and 
the brand swap programme, where the board reviewed the returns on 
investment and the plans for each proposed core brand; and the impact 
of the Brexit vote, with the associated cost challenges and impact on 
consumer confidence, and the actions being taken by management 
to address these issues. GREENE KING PLC Annual report 2017 48
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
Between meetings, as required, the board can be in frequent contact to 
progress the company’s business and, if necessary, board meetings can be 
held at short notice. Where possible, however, ad hoc committees of the 
board are appointed to deal with matters which it is known will need to 
be dealt with between scheduled board meetings. It is expected that all 
directors attend board and relevant committee meetings, unless they are 
prevented from doing so by prior commitments. If directors are unable to 
attend meetings in person or by telephone they are given the opportunity 
to be consulted and comment in advance of the meeting. 
Attendance at meetings held during the year is set out opposite.
Board papers are generally circulated seven days prior to each board or 
committee meeting to ensure that directors have sufficient time to review 
them before the meeting. Documentation includes detailed management 
accounts, reports on current trading, reports from each business unit and 
main functional areas and full papers on matters where the board is 
required to give its approval. 
The chairman holds regular, informal meetings with the non-executive 
directors without the executive directors being present and the 
non-executives also meet with the chairman and the chief executive 
on an informal basis twice each year.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
Board effectiveness
Board performance and evaluation
The UK Corporate Governance Code requires the board to conduct 
an annual evaluation of its own performance and that of its committees 
and directors. 
The board evaluation exercise was carried out by Philip Yea, who conducted 
a questionnaire-based review followed by in-depth discussions with each 
director. All material matters agreed during the previous review had been 
actioned. Overall it was felt that the board was working well and that the 
strategy review meeting had been particularly effective. A regular review 
of the forward agenda for board meetings has allowed effective planning 
of important board discussions, and a number of topics for future review 
were identified and agreed as part of this exercise. The company’s risk 
management process continued to evolve, both requiring and enabling a 
more nuanced discussion of risk appetite. Certain changes to the meeting 
cycle and the interaction between the audit committee dates and those of 
the board were agreed, subject to a further review after an initial period. 
A number of actions were agreed to improve the interface between the 
remuneration committee and the company between its meetings. The 
findings were recorded in a paper considered by the board at its meeting 
in April 2017. An evaluation was also undertaken of the operation of each 
of the board’s committees, and of the chairman, the latter being conducted 
by Rob Rowley, the senior independent non-executive director.
In addition to the annual evaluation exercise there remains an ongoing 
dialogue within the board to ensure that it operates effectively and that 
any matters raised are addressed in a timely manner. 
The performance of the executive directors is reviewed annually by the 
remuneration committee in conjunction with their annual pay review 
and the payment of bonuses. 
Training and support
The training needs of the board and its committees are regularly reviewed 
and each director is responsible for ensuring their skills and knowledge of 
the company remain up to date. Particular emphasis is placed on ensuring 
that directors are aware of proposed legislative changes in areas such 
as corporate governance, financial reporting and sector-specific issues. 
All directors are encouraged to visit the company’s pubs and restaurants 
and do so throughout the year. 
Newly appointed directors, including Gordon Fryett, who joined the board 
in December, receive a tailored induction on joining the board to acquaint 
them with the company. This includes meetings with other board members 
and senior management, the provision of an induction pack containing general 
information on the company, its policies and procedures and financial and 
operational information and a briefing on directors’ responsibilities.
There is an agreed written procedure for directors, in the furtherance of their 
duties, to take independent professional advice at the company’s expense. 
Directors also have access to the services of the company secretary. 
The company has in place directors’ and officers’ liability insurance.
Commitments and conflicts of interest
All significant commitments which the directors have outside Greene King 
are disclosed prior to appointment and on an ongoing basis when there 
are any changes. The board is satisfied that the chairman and each of the 
non-executive directors commits sufficient time to their duties and fulfils 
their obligations to the company.
The board has the right, under the articles of association, to approve 
potential situational conflicts of interest. A small number of such potential 
conflicts have been approved by the board following disclosure by certain 
directors, in each case with the relevant director not taking part in any 
decision relating to their own position. Directors are also aware that the 
disclosure and authorisation of any potential conflict situation does not 
detract from their requirement to notify the board separately of an actual 
or potential conflict in relation to a proposed transaction by the company. 
Communication with shareholders 
The board is keen to ensure that our shareholders have a good understanding 
of the business and its performance, and that the directors are aware of 
any issues or concerns which shareholders may have. Communication 
with shareholders takes a variety of forms.
Institutional shareholders and analysts
There is a regular dialogue with institutional shareholders, including 
meetings after the announcement of the year-end and interim results. 
Analysts are also invited to presentations at those times and separately 
to analyst trips to visit our premises and hear presentations on specific 
divisions of the business. The board receives regular reports and feedback 
on the meetings held between the executive directors and principal 
shareholders, and copies of analysts’ reports on the company. 
The senior independent non-executive director, Rob Rowley, is available 
to shareholders if they have concerns about governance issues which the 
normal channels of contact fail to resolve. 
AGM
The AGM is fully utilised as a means of communicating directly with 
private shareholders, who receive a brief presentation on the business 
before the formal business of the meeting begins. They also have the full 
opportunity to ask questions during the meeting and to meet directors 
and senior management informally after the meeting. The board aims to 
ensure that all members of the board, including in particular the chairmen 
of the board committees, are available to answer questions at the AGM. 
The notice of the AGM is sent to shareholders at least 20 working days 
before the meeting. All substantive items of business at shareholders’ 
meetings are dealt with under separate resolutions, including a resolution 
to adopt the report and accounts. The chairman announces the results of 
the proxy voting on each resolution after it has been dealt with on a show 
of hands. 
The next AGM will be held on 8 September 2017 at the Millennium 
Grandstand, Rowley Mile Racecourse Conference Centre, Newmarket, 
Suffolk CB8 0TF. Details can be found in the separate notice of meeting.
Website
The company maintains a website (www.greeneking.co.uk) to provide 
up-to-date, detailed information on the company’s operations and 
brands, which includes a dedicated investor relations section. All company 
announcements are available on this site, as are copies of slides used for 
presentations to investment analysts. We are happy to answer questions 
by telephone or email (investorrelations@greeneking.co.uk or 
companysecretary@greeneking.co.uk).
Board committees
The board has established a nomination committee, an audit committee 
and a remuneration committee, each of which has formal terms of reference 
governing its method of operation. Each of the terms of reference, which 
have been approved by the board, is available on request or to download 
from the company’s website and will be available for inspection at the AGM.
DTR disclosure
The information required by DTR 7.2 is set out in this report, the nomination 
committee report and the audit committee report, except for information 
required under DTR 7.2.6 which is set out in the directors’ report. GREENE KING PLC Annual report 2017 50
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
Membership
During the year the nomination committee was chaired by Philip Yea. 
The other members of the committee were Mike Coupe, Ian Durant 
(until his retirement in September 2016), Rob Rowley, Lynne Weedall 
and Gordon Fryett (following his appointment as a director in 
December 2016). All members were considered by the board 
to be independent. 
Responsibilities
The key responsibilities of the nomination committee are to identify, 
evaluate and nominate candidates for appointment to the board, to review 
regularly the structure, size and composition (including the skills, knowledge 
and experience) of the board and to make recommendations to the board 
with regard to any adjustments that are deemed necessary. 
The committee is also responsible for considering the company’s 
succession plans for board members and senior management, taking into 
account the challenges and opportunities facing the company, and what 
skills and expertise are therefore needed on the board in the future, 
and for reviewing membership of the board’s committees to ensure that 
undue reliance is not placed upon any individuals.
I am pleased to introduce our nomination 
committee report for 2016/17, which explains 
the committee’s focus and activities during the 
year. As indicated last year when I took over 
as chairman, the focus of the committee has 
continued to be on succession planning and 
on ensuring that the size, composition and 
structure of the board is appropriate for the 
delivery of the group’s strategic objectives. 
We have also worked to ensure that all 
relevant provisions of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code continue to be met. 
Philip Yea
Chairman of the nomination committee
Nomination committee report
Activities during the year
The committee held six meetings during the year. Attendance at these 
meetings by the committee members is shown in the table on page 48. 
A key activity for the committee during the year was to find a new 
non-executive director in place of Ian Durant, who retired from the board 
at the AGM in September 2016. Given that the board had previously agreed 
that Rob Rowley, as the former finance director of Reuters Group plc, 
should assume the chairmanship of the audit committee, it was agreed 
that previous financial experience was not a key priority for the new 
director. Instead the committee decided to focus on finding a candidate 
with relevant retail and property experience, given the large portfolio of 
assets owned by the company. The committee chose The Zygos Partnership 
to assist in the recruitment process; The Zygos Partnership has no other 
connection with the company and has signed up to the voluntary code 
of conduct on matters such as diversity for executive search firms. 
In conjunction with them, a job specification and a profile of the likely 
characteristics, qualifications, experience and merits required were 
produced before starting the search, with the aim of finding a shortlist 
of candidates suited to the role, without prejudice between male 
and female candidates.
A longlist of candidates was initially drawn up for the role, from which 
a shortlist evolved after consideration by the committee. The continuing 
non-executive directors then interviewed the shortlisted candidates 
before the committee made a formal recommendation to the board 
that Gordon Fryett be appointed to the board. Gordon has many years’ 
experience in retail and property matters, having held the position of group 
property director at Tesco plc until his retirement in November 2013.
In terms of committee composition, Philip Yea became chairman of the 
nomination committee with effect from the beginning of the current 
financial year, Rob Rowley took over as chairman of the audit committee 
on the retirement of Ian Durant and Gordon Fryett was appointed as a 
member of the nomination, audit and remuneration committees on his 
appointment to the board. No other changes were recommended to 
the composition of the board committees. 
In relation to succession planning, during the year the committee received 
a detailed report from the group HR director on the senior management 
team’s skills and performance and the succession plans for each of them. 
The issues of succession planning and board structure will remain the ongoing 
focus of the committee during the course of the forthcoming year. 
On the recommendation of the nomination committee, and taking into 
account the continuing effective performance of the directors, the board 
has decided once again this year to ask all directors to stand for re-election 
at the forthcoming AGM, with the exception of Gordon Fryett, who will 
be standing for election for the first time.
Other matters considered by the committee during the year included the 
board evaluation exercise, the position of chairman of the trustees of the 
Greene King final salary pension scheme, the training requirements of the 
directors and the committee’s terms of reference. 
Diversity
The board approves of the principle of trying to recruit more women 
into senior management and director roles. There is currently one female 
director on the board, Lynne Weedall, who is chairman of the remuneration 
committee. With a board of seven people, the board believes that the key 
is to ensure a suitable range of skills, experience and knowledge across the 
board members, and that the issues of gender and diversity are just two 
considerations to be taken into account when filling board vacancies. Annual report 2017 GREENE KING PLC 51
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
Following Ian Durant’s retirement from the 
board at the AGM in September 2016, I was 
subsequently appointed as chairman of the 
audit committee, and am therefore pleased to 
introduce our audit committee report for 2016/17. 
The committee’s key responsibilities include 
monitoring the integrity of the group’s financial 
reporting, internal controls and risk management 
procedures, overseeing the internal and external 
audit processes and a range of other corporate 
governance activities. 
During the year the committee devoted particular 
attention to the following key areas: the year-end 
financial statements and interim report and associated 
audit matters; the integration of the new Ernst 
& Young audit partner to ensure delivery of a 
robust and detailed audit of the group’s financial 
statements; and risk management processes and 
internal controls including the viability statement.
Rob Rowley
Chairman of the audit committee
Membership
The audit committee was chaired during the year by Ian Durant until 
his retirement in September 2016 when Rob Rowley was appointed as 
chairman. The other members of the committee were Mike Coupe and, 
from December 2016, Gordon Fryett. All members are considered by 
the board to be independent. The board is satisfied that Rob Rowley 
has recent and relevant financial experience, as a former finance director 
of Reuters Group plc.
Audit committee report
Responsibilities
A key responsibility for the audit committee is reviewing the financial 
reporting, controls and risk management processes across the group. 
The committee assesses the external audit conclusions on both the full 
year and interim results, in each case prior to their submission to the board. 
Whilst the board retains responsibility for undertaking the required 
assessment that the annual report is fair, balanced and understandable, 
the audit committee this year, at the request of the board, has undertaken 
a review of this prior to submission of the annual report to the board, 
as detailed below. 
The committee also reviews the company’s internal control systems, 
advises the board on the appointment of external auditor, oversees 
the relationship with the external auditor, and reviews the quality and 
effectiveness of both the internal and the external audit. In addition, the 
committee is responsible for considering the company’s whistle blowing 
procedures and reviewing their effectiveness in practice. 
In relation to risk matters, the committee reviews the group’s risk 
management policies and procedures prior to submission to the board 
and receives detailed reports on the risk management processes within 
the business units and key functional areas. The committee receives 
regular updates on regulatory, accounting and reporting developments 
and their application to the company.
Operation of the committee
The committee held three half-day meetings during the year. Attendance 
at these meetings by the committee members is shown in the table on 
page 48. On each occasion the external auditor, chief financial officer and 
senior members of the finance function attended, as well as the company 
secretary, head of risk and members of the internal audit function. By 
rotation, operational managers and functional heads present risk reports 
at audit committee meetings.
There is an opportunity at each meeting for the committee to discuss matters 
privately with the internal and external auditors without management 
present. Outside of scheduled meeting times, the chairman of the committee 
is in regular contact with the external audit partner to discuss matters 
relevant to the company. 
The committee’s terms of reference are available on the company’s website 
and these are reviewed annually and updated to reflect changes in the 
responsibility and regulation of the committee. In addition, the committee 
conducts a review of its own performance on an annual basis and considers 
steps for future improvement taking input from the members of the 
committee, the external auditor and senior members of the finance 
function. As a result of the review the audit committee has assisted the 
board in its fair, balanced and understandable review of the annual report, 
as explained below. 
Financial statements and audit
The committee reviewed and provided input into the audit scope and 
audit plan presented by the external auditor, taking into account the 
comments on the prior year’s annual report by the Financial Reporting 
Council in its review of those accounts. In considering the financial 
statements the committee reviewed the group’s accounting policies 
to ensure consistency on a year-to-year basis and the methods used to 
account for significant or unusual transactions. Significant issues that the 
committee addressed in relation to the financial statements are set out in 
the table below. The committee also reviewed management’s attestation 
paper setting out the information that had been provided to the auditor 
to enable it to form its opinion on the group’s financial statements and 
demonstrating that it was appropriate for the directors to make the 
representations set out in the letter of representation. GREENE KING PLC Annual report 2017 52
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
Significant issues considered by the audit committee in relation to the financial statements for 2016/17
Matter considered What the committee did
Uncertain tax 
positions and stamp 
duty land tax
During the period a formal agreement was reached with HMRC on a number of historical tax positions and the Court of 
Appeal issued its final decision on the Sussex case. The only remaining historical open item with HMRC is an internal property 
arrangement which management expects to resolve before the end of the 2017/18 financial year. The committee is satisfied 
that an appropriate provision is in place in respect of this following discussion with the external auditor. 
Impairment of 
property, plant 
and equipment and 
intangible assets
The committee considered detailed reports prepared by management concerning the methodology used to determine the 
extent of any impairment required. The committee reviewed the methodology and assumptions used, reviewed management’s 
proposals and considered the expected timetable for the disposal of non-core sites. The committee assessed the proposed 
changes to both the underlying growth rates and the discount rate used and determined them to be appropriate in the 
current economic environment. 
Capital versus 
expense accounting
The committee reviewed the group’s fixed asset accounting policy during the year and considered the allocation of costs 
as either capital or expense. At the committee’s request, management undertook an additional evaluation of the business’ 
processes for the allocation of costs and reported its findings to the committee. Following revisions to the policy and the 
introduction of additional controls within the business, the committee was satisfied that the risk of material error identified 
had been appropriately mitigated.
Accounting for 
supplier income and 
customer rebates
The committee reviewed the group’s accounting for supplier income, including listing fees, performance fees and volume 
rebates, noting that such income is not recognised until it can be reliably estimated. The auditor’s review of both supplier 
income and customer rebates was considered. The committee was satisfied that the current controls in place provided 
reasonable assurance that the risks associated with these areas are being appropriately managed. 
Presentation of 
exceptional items
The treatment of exceptional items was considered following increased market scrutiny in this area, particularly in relation 
to the reporting of alternative performance measures by regulators, including the Financial Reporting Council which had 
reviewed the group’s prior year accounts. The committee approved the revised reporting of performance measures to 
address these concerns and ensure that they are properly defined.
Fair, balanced and understandable annual report
One of the key governance requirements in relation to the annual report 
is that it should be fair, balanced and understandable. The audit committee 
undertook a review of management’s processes in this regard (including 
the clear guidance given to contributors and the review process adopted by 
management) and also considered in detail the draft annual report to ensure 
that it was fair, balanced and understandable in its view. The committee 
then recommended to the board that it could make the required disclosure 
as set out on page 71. 
Effectiveness of the external audit 
After the 2015/16 audit was completed a review of the effectiveness of the 
auditor and of the audit service was undertaken, supported by a questionnaire 
completed by the audit committee chairman, the chief financial officer, and 
a number of key members of the finance team involved in the preparation 
of the statutory accounts. The overall quality of the service, the audit partner 
and the audit team were all reviewed and matters such as the management 
of the audit team, the quality of its challenge, insight and communications 
and the cost effectiveness of the audit were considered. Taking into account 
the internal review the committee was satisfied that the quality of the audit 
service provided by Ernst & Young LLP was appropriate. The feedback 
from the review was also provided to Ernst & Young LLP. 
Ensuring external auditor independence
The audit committee is cognisant of the importance of auditor independence 
and objectivity and has a policy in relation to the use of the auditor for 
non-audit work. The company will award non-audit work to the firm 
which provides the best commercial solution for the work in question, 
taking into account the skills and experience of the firm, (if the audit firm 
is being considered) the nature of the services involved, the level of fees 
relative to the audit fee and whether there are safeguards in place to 
mitigate to an acceptable level any threat to objectivity and independence 
in the conduct of the audit resulting from such services. 
Work estimated to cost in excess of £25,000 is put out to tender unless 
agreed otherwise by the chairman of the audit committee. The chief financial 
officer may approve specific engagements up to £50,000 (in aggregate up 
to £100,000 p.a.), and the chairman of the audit committee may approve 
engagements up to £100,000 (in aggregate up to £200,000 p.a.), with fees 
in excess of those limits being subject to approval of the full committee. 
This policy was complied with during the year.
The audit committee has recently approved a revised policy for non-audit 
services in line with the recent guidance issued by the FRC, which is now 
in effect for the group’s 2017/18 and future financial years. In addition to 
the above financial restrictions the audit committee is now required to 
pre-approve all non-audit services, except in limited circumstances relating 
to ad hoc accounting advice, to review any services proposed to be provided 
by the external auditor, to consider whether the skills and expertise of the 
audit firm make it the most suitable supplier of the non-audit services, and 
to ensure that the fees for non-audit services do not exceed 70% of the 
average audit fee over a three-year period. 
The committee also has a policy in relation to the appointment of former 
partners or employees of the auditor by the group to prevent any potential 
conflict between their undertaking of the audit and their new appointment.
During the year the company made limited use of specialist teams within 
Ernst & Young LLP for non-audit work, including in relation to the LTIP target 
review and the restated FRS 101 accounts for Greene King Finance plc, 
required in relation to the A6 bond issuance completed in May 2016. The 
total fees paid to Ernst & Young LLP during the year amounted to £640k 
of which £40k (6%) related to non-audit work. Further detail is in note 4 
to the accounts.
In order to assist the committee with its consideration of the independence 
and objectivity of the external auditor, the external auditor undertook an 
annual review of its services provided to the group. In light of this review, 
and the further safeguards in place to protect such independence and 
objectivity, the committee determined that the carrying out of such services 
by the external auditor did not, and will not going forward, impair the 
external auditor’s independence or objectivity.
Audit committee report continued Annual report 2017 GREENE KING PLC 53
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
External auditor – tendering and re-appointment
The company last tendered the external audit contract in 1997 and 
Ernst & Young has been the auditor since then, with an annual rolling contract 
and subject to an annual shareholder vote at the AGM. Ernst & Young is 
required to rotate the audit partner responsible for the group every five 
years and a new audit partner was appointed for this financial year. 
In accordance with The Statutory Audit Services for Large Companies 
Market Investigation (Mandatory Use of Competitive Processes and 
Audit Committee Responsibilities) Order 2014 (the Order) and in light 
of the transitional provisions on audit matters thereunder which allow 
a period until April 2024 before an audit tender and change is required, 
and given the recent change of audit committee chairman, the committee 
recommended to the board, and the board accepted the recommendation, 
that Ernst & Young LLP should be retained as the group’s auditor for the 
time being. The committee will give consideration to undertaking a full 
audit tender, in which Ernst & Young LLP will not be permitted to partake, 
within the next four years. The company was in compliance with the 
Order during the year.
The committee therefore recommended to the board that Ernst & Young LLP 
should be re-appointed as the company’s auditor for the forthcoming 
year. This resolution will be put to shareholders at the AGM. 
Internal audit
The company’s internal audit function is responsible for reviewing the 
effectiveness and efficiency of the systems of internal control in place to 
safeguard the assets of the company. Under the terms of reference for the 
function, the internal audit team has direct access to the audit committee 
chairman to enable it to raise any significant issues and to maintain independence. 
Members of the internal audit team also attend the audit committee meetings 
to report on the progress and actions taken by the function. During the 
year, as well as full reviews of relevant divisions, the internal audit function 
reported to the committee on a number of areas where it had carried 
out key financial control reviews, including compliance with the Statutory 
Code (as explained below), free trade loan and customer account 
management, and the transition to a controls-based audit.
Other matters considered during the year
The committee considered the group’s policy in relation to the valuation 
of its property assets, in light of the fact that Spirit Pub Company operated 
with an annual revaluation policy, whereas Greene King has historically 
adopted a policy whereby property, plant and equipment are valued at 
cost or deemed cost on transition to IFRS. The committee considered 
the advantages and disadvantages of each approach and recommended 
to the board no change to Greene King’s policy in this regard.
The committee reviewed, as it does on an annual basis, the group’s whistle 
blowing policy and its application across the business. All whistle blowing 
reports were investigated and resolved satisfactorily, with no significant 
issues emerging.
The committee has continued to review the subject of cyber security 
and receives regular reports from management on the issue and how it 
is managing external threats in this area. Significant investment has been 
made in hardware, software and user awareness during the year and 
management has continued to undertake testing (including by external 
consultants) of the company’s defences against a cyber security attack. 
The terms of reference of the committee were also reviewed during 
the year and updated following the introduction of The Pubs Code etc. 
Regulations 2016, which implemented a Statutory Code applicable to 
companies owning 500 or more tied tenanted pubs, to enable the audit 
committee to approve the compliance report which must be submitted 
to the Pubs Code adjudicator within four months of the year end. 
The first formal compliance report is due in August 2018.
Internal control and risk management
As disclosed in the risks and uncertainties section of this report on page 33, 
there is an ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and managing the 
principal risks faced by the company. The board has overall responsibility 
for the group’s risk management framework and systems of internal control 
and for reviewing their effectiveness, whilst the audit committee monitors 
and reviews those internal controls and risks on a regular basis, and reports 
to the board on its findings. During the course of the year the committee 
continued to review reports from a number of business units and functional 
areas on their respective risk management processes and key risks and on 
the key financial internal controls and to challenge representatives of the 
relevant business unit or functional area who attended those meetings 
and presented the relevant reports. 
The risk management framework and internal control systems are designed 
to manage to an acceptable level, and not to eliminate, the risk of failure to 
achieve business objectives. They can provide reasonable, but not absolute, 
assurance that the group’s assets are safeguarded and that the financial 
information used within the business and for external reporting is reliable. 
The company has in place procedures to assess the key risks to which it is 
exposed and has formalised the control environment needed to address 
these and other issues. There are processes in place which accord with 
the Financial Reporting Council’s Guidance on Risk Management, Internal 
Control and Related Financial and Business Reporting, and these remained 
in place up to the date of this report. The board is satisfied that there are 
no significant weaknesses in these systems and that the group’s internal 
controls are operating effectively.
The key elements of the internal control framework, in addition to the risk 
management processes outlined in the risks and uncertainties section of 
this report, are:
 – the schedule of matters reserved for the board;
 – the group’s defined management structure with suitable authority limits 
and responsibilities, staffed by appropriate personnel;
 – regular updates for the board on strategy;
 – a comprehensive planning and financial reporting procedure including 
annual budgets and a three-year strategic plan, both of which are 
reviewed and approved by the board; 
 – ongoing monitoring by both the board and senior management of 
performance against budgets, through the periodic reporting of detailed 
management accounts and key performance indicators;
 – ongoing monitoring by the board of compliance with financial covenants;
 – a centralised financial reporting system and close process, with controls 
and reconciliation procedures designed to facilitate the production of 
the consolidated accounts; 
 – clearly defined evaluation and approval processes for acquisitions and 
disposals, capital expenditure and project control, with escalating levels 
of authority (including board approval for major acquisitions and disposals), 
detailed appraisal and review procedures and post-completion reviews;
 – a review of retail operational compliance by the retail internal audit 
team responsible and other analytical and control procedures facilitated 
by the EPOS till system;
 – audits conducted by the group internal audit function of business 
and functional control environments; and
 – documented policies to cover modern slavery, bribery and whistle blowing 
and regular updates on any incidents. GREENE KING PLC Annual report 2017 54
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
Remuneration report
I am pleased once again to be able to 
summarise the company’s remuneration policy, 
the way in which it has been implemented 
during the last financial year and the way it 
will be implemented this forthcoming year.
The remuneration committee remains very 
mindful of investor interest in executive 
remuneration and has again sought to ensure 
that the remuneration policies and practices at 
Greene King drive appropriate behaviours by 
management that are in the long-term interests 
of the company and its shareholders.
Lynne Weedall
Chairman of the remuneration committee
Annual statement
As I explained in the annual statement introducing last year’s directors’ 
remuneration report, at our 2017 AGM we are required to resubmit our 
directors’ remuneration policy for approval by our shareholders as it has 
been three years since the policy was first approved at our 2014 AGM. 
Accordingly, at our 2017 AGM there will be two remuneration related 
resolutions presented:
 – the normal annual advisory vote on our directors’ remuneration 
report; and
 – the vote to approve our new directors’ remuneration policy, which 
will apply to all payments to be made to directors from the 2017 AGM 
and which (unless altered with shareholders’ approval) will apply for 
a period of three years.
Pay for performance in 2016/17
As described more fully in the strategic report, 2016/17 was another good 
year for Greene King. Revenue was up 6.9% whilst profit before exceptional 
and non-underlying items was up 6.6% to £273.5m. This performance 
was achieved against a difficult backdrop of increased costs, weaker 
consumer confidence and stronger competition.
Reflecting performance against the stretching targets set at the beginning 
of the year, bonus pay-outs for this year were 35.8% of eligible salary for 
the chief executive and 30.3% of eligible salary for the chief financial 
officer. In relation to the LTIP awards granted in 2013, which are due to 
vest in July this year, the core LTIP award will not vest as the performance 
targets were not met, whilst 18% of the growth LTIP award will vest. 
Our new remuneration policy
The directors’ remuneration policy which we are proposing at the 2017 
AGM has a high degree of consistency with our current policy, although 
we are proposing to make certain changes which we believe are appropriate 
and which will enable the policy to better support our overall strategy.
We are making no changes regarding our policy on base salaries. In addition, 
in 2017/18 our executive directors’ salaries will remain unchanged from 
the base salaries which were paid in 2016/17.
The changes being proposed to the current policy will adjust the mix of 
incentives at Greene King so that there is an equal weighting between the 
annual bonus plan and the LTIP, with the maximum opportunity under each 
plan set at 150% of base salary. Under the policy approved at the 2014 AGM, 
the maximum levels available under these plans were 100% of base salary 
for annual bonus and 200% of base salary for LTIP. Accordingly, the proposal 
involves a rebalancing of the incentives available within the policy. There is 
no increase in overall pay quantum as a result of these changes.
The reason for making this adjustment is that this revised structure is the 
most appropriate mechanism for introducing to our remuneration policy 
customer NPS in our Pub Company and employee team engagement, 
two of our existing KPIs which we do not currently apply as performance 
measures for incentive pay. These metrics, which will be included in the new 
annual bonus structure, relate directly to important pillars of our overall 
strategy: building strong and attractive brands; delivering industry-leading 
value, service and quality; and working with the best people. As a committee 
we believe it is important that these metrics are emphasised through their 
direct inclusion in our incentive plans – they reinforce that individuals’ 
experience of Greene King (both as customers and employees) is at the 
heart of what makes Greene King a successful business that is operated 
in a balanced and sustainable way. Annual report 2017 GREENE KING PLC 55
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
We also believe that applying these KPIs on a basis which is measured annually 
rather than over a three-year performance period is better as this gives the 
remuneration committee flexibility to set appropriate year-on-year growth 
targets. At the same time as making this change, we are also introducing 
other features which we believe are important balances against any risk 
of increased focus on short-term performance:
 – within the annual bonus plan, there is no increase in the amount of cash 
which can be earned. Any amounts earned over the previous annual bonus 
maximum level (100% of base salary) will be subject to deferral in shares;
 – in 2017/18, the level of attainment for annual bonus on-target performance 
(75% of base salary) will not be increased;
 – a holding period (three years vesting and two years holding) will apply 
to the executive directors’ LTIP awards from 2017 onwards; and
 – our share ownership guidelines have been increased to 200% of base 
salary (from 100% of base salary).
Along with the reduction of LTIP quantum to 150% of base salary, we 
have also revisited the balance of the measures which are to be applied 
for LTIP awards from 2017 onwards, and in 2017 we intend to introduce 
a free cash flow measure for part of the LTIP awards, whilst also retaining 
ROCE and EPS growth as LTIP performance measures. We regard free 
cash flow as one of most important measures for determining success at 
Greene King, and so we believe it is appropriate to increase the emphasis 
within our remuneration package for this measure. Details of the actual 
performance targets for the 2017 LTIP awards are not included within this 
report. Due to timing constraints and in particular the closed period which 
preceded the announcement of our annual results, we will be consulting 
our major shareholders on these performance targets in the coming weeks, 
and we will disclose details thereof when the awards are made in the 
autumn, provided that the new remuneration policy is approved by 
shareholders at the 2017 AGM. 
The remuneration committee consulted with its largest shareholders 
before proposing the changes reflected in the new remuneration policy 
and we are grateful for the constructive responses which we received 
in this process.
We are happy to receive feedback from shareholders at any time in relation 
to our remuneration policies and hope to receive your support for the 
resolutions referred to above at the forthcoming AGM.

Remuneration report continued
Policy report (unaudited)
The directors’ remuneration policy as set out in this section of the remuneration 
report will, if approved by shareholders, take effect for all payments made 
to directors from the date of the AGM on 8 September 2017.
Policy overview
The key objective of the company’s remuneration policy is to promote the 
long-term success of the company and to enable the achievement of the group’s 
strategic aims. The remuneration package is designed to be competitive 
but not excessive and to contain an appropriate balance between fixed 
and variable remuneration and, for the variable remuneration, between 
short-term and longer-term performance. 
The committee has considered whether there are any aspects of the 
policy which could inadvertently encourage executives to take inappropriate 
risk and is satisfied that this is not the case. The committee has also ensured 
that the incentive structure for executive directors and senior management 
does not raise environmental, social or governance risks by inadvertently 
motivating irresponsible behaviour.
Details of each element of remuneration, their purpose, their link to 
strategy and their operation and performance metrics are set out below. 
The table also shows where changes from the policy approved at the 
2014 AGM are being proposed.

Purpose and link

Changes from 
previous policy
Salary To recruit, reward 
and retain high 
calibre executives 
with an 
appropriately 
competitive 
base salary.
Base salaries are reviewed annually 
or when a change in responsibility 
occurs, to reflect the executive’s 
responsibilities, market value and 
sustained performance level. In 
setting pay levels, the committee 
considers current market practice 
and makes comparisons against 
a selection of other companies 
determined by reference to 
turnover, market capitalisation 
and operational details. 
When reviewing base salaries, 
the committee is mindful of the 
gearing effect that increases 
in base salary will have on the 
potential total remuneration 
of the executive directors.
The committee is guided by 
the general increase for the 
broader employee population 
but on occasion may need 
to recognise, for example, an 
increase in the scale, scope 
or responsibility of the role.
— No material 
changes. 
Annual 
performance 
bonus
To incentivise 
executive 
directors to 
deliver superior 
performance 
during the course 
of a year, and 
to promote 
retention and 
stability amongst 
the senior 
management 
team. 
Performance 
measures and 
targets are 
designed to 
reinforce 
strategic 
priorities for 
the year.
Performance measures and 
targets are set at the beginning 
of each financial year to ensure 
that the measures and weightings 
are appropriate and support 
the business strategy. Bonuses 
are payable after the end of each 
financial year, based on performance 
against those targets. Bonuses 
are non-pensionable. A clawback 
mechanism applies in the event 
of a material misstatement of 
the group’s accounts, error or 
gross misconduct. 
For the 2017/18 annual bonus 
and for the duration of this 
policy, any bonus outcomes 
achieved above 100% of salary 
will (after payment of taxes) 
be invested in shares by the 
executive director. The shares 
so acquired must be held for at 
least one year or, if longer, until 
share ownership guideline levels 
are attained.
A maximum of 150% of salary 
can be earned by the executive 
directors, with no bonus 
payable for below threshold 
performance. Each year the 
level of payment for on-target 
performance will be set by 
the Committee after having 
considered the level of challenge 
in the annual bonus targets 
for that year. 
Payment of bonuses is 
dependent on a mixture 
of financial targets, strategic 
targets and specific personal 
targets. In relation to the 
financial targets, awards are 
made on a straight-line basis 
for performance between 
threshold and target and on a 
separate straight-line basis for 
performance between target 
and maximum.
Performance is measured 
relative to challenging targets 
in key financial and strategic 
measures and to appropriate 
personal performance 
measures as set by 
the committee.
For the duration of this policy, 
financial measures will always 
have at least a two-thirds 
weighting of all of the 
performance measures 
applied in any year.
Details of measures and 
weightings for the 2016/17 
financial year, and of the 
proposed measures and 
weightings for next year’s 
annual bonus, are set out 
in the annual report on 
remuneration on pages 61 
to 67. An explanation of 
how the performance 
measures were chosen is 
given in the notes below.
The annual bonus remains 
a discretionary arrangement 
and the committee reserves 
discretion to adjust the 
outcomes achieved (from 
zero to any cap) under all 
performance measures 
should it consider that to be 
appropriate having considered 
overall performance in the 
year on a holistic basis.
Increase of 
maximum 
bonus to 
150% of base 
salary, but 
with deferral 
of any 
outcomes 
achieved 
above 100% 
of base 
salary in 
shares.
Confirms 
that for the 
duration of 
this policy, 
financial 
measures will 
have at least 
a two-thirds 
weighting for 
any year’s 
annual 
bonus. Annual report 2017 GREENE KING PLC 57

Changes from 
previous policy
Long term 
incentive plan 
(LTIP)
To incentivise 
the executive 
directors to 
deliver superior 
levels of 
long-term 
performance for 
the benefit of 
shareholders, 
thereby aligning 
their interests 
with those of 
our long-term 
shareholders.
The committee normally makes 
an annual LTIP award, usually in 
the form of nil-cost options. 
The awards are subject to suitably 
stretching performance conditions 
set by the committee, which are 
reviewed annually. Awards normally 
vest on the third anniversary of 
grant, subject to performance.
For awards made from the 2017 
AGM onwards, a post-vesting 
holding period will apply so that 
performance-vested LTIP 
awards will not be exercisable 
until the fifth anniversary of 
grant. After the holding period 
awards will be exercisable until 
the tenth anniversary of grant. 
A clawback mechanism applies 
in the event of a material 
misstatement of the group’s 
accounts, error or gross 
misconduct. 
A maximum of 150% of salary 
can be awarded each year. 
Dividend equivalents will be 
paid on any shares that vest 
and will continue to be 
accrued during any post-
vesting holding period. 
All LTIP awards will be 
subject to suitably 
stretching performance 
targets as selected by the 
committee. Performance 
will normally be measured 
over a three-year period.
The committee would expect 
to consult with its major 
shareholders if it proposed 
changing materially either 
the performance measures 
applied for LTIP awards 
made to executive directors 
or the relative weightings 
between these performance 
measures.
Vesting will generally be 
subject to continued 
employment. 
Maximum 
annual award 
reduced to 
150% of base 
salary.
Confirms the 
introduction 
of holding 
periods on 
LTIP awards.
Confirms 
that material 
changes to 
either the 
current 
performance 
measures or 
the relative 
weightings 
of such 
measures 
would be 
subject to 
consultation 
with major 
shareholders.
Shareholding 
policy
To align the 
interests of the 
executive 
directors with 
shareholders 
and to promote 
a long-term 
approach.
Executive directors are required 
to build and retain a shareholding 
of at least 200% of salary. To 
the extent that the shareholding 
requirement has not been met, 
executives will be expected to 
retain at least 50% of the net 
exercised LTIP awards until the 
requirement is met. Vested but 
unexercised awards including 
performance-vested LTIPs 
subject to a holding period 
(discounted for anticipated tax 
liabilities) can be credited towards 
the guidelines, as can shares 
acquired via bonus deferral.
— — Increase of 
shareholding 
guideline to 
200% of 
base salary. 
Confirms 
that vested but 
unexercised 
awards can 
be credited 
(on an 
anticipated 
net of tax 
basis).
Pension To offer 
market-
competitive 
levels of benefit.
The company contributes to 
defined contribution pension 
arrangements for the executive 
directors or provides cash in 
lieu where appropriate.
Current company contribution 
levels are 25% for the chief 
executive and 20% for the 
chief financial officer.
— No material 
changes.
Benefits To be 
appropriately 
competitive with 
those offered at 
comparator 
companies.
Benefits comprise the provision 
of company cars (or cash 
allowances in lieu thereof), fuel 
for company cars, life assurance, 
permanent health insurance and 
private medical insurance. 
Benefits are reviewed 
periodically in line with market 
practice and are not pensionable.
— No material 
changes.
All employee 
share 
schemes
All employees, 
including executive 
directors, have 
the opportunity 
to build their 
shareholding in a 
tax-efficient way 
by participating 
in the company’s 
HMRC-approved 
sharesave scheme.
Employees are invited to 
participate in the sharesave 
scheme in January each year 
provided that they have the 
requisite service.
The maximum saving under 
the sharesave scheme will be 
no more than HMRC-
approved limits, allowing 
employees to buy company 
shares at up to a 20% discount 
at the end of a three or 
five-year savings period.

changes. GREENE KING PLC Annual report 2017 58
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
Policy table continued
Notes:
1.  A description of how the company intends to implement the policy set out in this 
table for 2017/18 is set out in the annual report on remuneration on pages 61 to 67.
2.  The choice of performance metrics applicable to the annual bonus scheme reflects 
the committee’s belief that the compensation should be appropriately stretching, but 
achievable, and tied to both the delivery of profit growth, key financial metrics, 
strategic performance indicators and specific individual objectives. 
3. Reason for selection of LTIP targets
As explained in the remuneration policy table above, LTIP awards are subject to suitably 
stretching performance conditions set by the committee, which are reviewed annually. 
For 2017/18 the LTIP awards will be subject to three performance measures:
 – EPS growth will be applied on the basis that it will reward the delivery of growth in 
profits and is a widely understood profit-based measure across the business; 
 – ROCE will be applied as it ensures that management focuses on generating returns 
in excess of the cost of capital and because it clearly aligns with our strategy where 
capital needs to be applied appropriately in order to focus on developing our 
Pub Company and generating returns; and 
 – free cash flow will be applied as it aligns with our strategy to maintain a strong balance 
sheet and flexible capital structure. Cash generated enables the company to cover 
debt service obligations, our core capital expenditure and our dividend.
The performance targets for each metric will be set annually by the committee following 
a detailed review of the company’s projections and will be appropriately stretching.
4.  Differences between the policy on remuneration for directors 
from the policy on remuneration of other employees
When determining executive directors’ remuneration, the committee takes into account 
pay throughout the group to ensure that the arrangements in place remain appropriate. 
The group seeks to ensure that similar principles guide reward decisions for all group 
employees, including executive directors, although remuneration packages differ to take 
into account appropriate factors in different areas of the business: 
 – Fixed pay – the company seeks to ensure that each employee receives an appropriate 
level of fixed pay reflecting appropriate market rates. All employees are enrolled 
automatically into a qualifying workplace pension.
 – Annual bonus – the company seeks to ensure that annual bonus plans are a part of 
reward where this is appropriate. However, the quantum of reward available and the 
performance measures applied will vary between employees at different levels within 
the business and the business units in which they work.
 – LTIP – our most senior employees participate in the LTIP currently based on the 
same performance conditions as those for executive directors, although the committee 
reserves the discretion to vary the performance conditions for awards made to 
employees below the board for future awards.
 – All employee share plans – the committee considers it is important for all 
employees to have the opportunity to become shareholders in the company. The 
company offers an HMRC tax advantaged sharesave plan in which all UK employees 
can participate and acquire shares on a discounted and tax advantaged basis. 
5. Malus and clawback
Malus (being the forfeiture of unvested awards) and clawback (being the ability of the 
company to claim repayment of paid amounts as a debt) provisions apply to the annual 
bonus and LTIP. These provisions may be applied where the remuneration committee 
considers it appropriate to do so following: 
 – gross misconduct;
 – material misstatement of results; and
 – error in calculating the performance condition outcomes.
6. Travel and hospitality
While the committee does not consider it to form part of benefits in the normal usage of 
that term, it has been advised that corporate hospitality (whether paid for by the company 
or another) and certain instances of business travel (including any related tax liabilities 
settled by the company) for both executive and non-executive directors may technically 
come within the applicable rules and so the committee expressly reserves the right for it 
to authorise such activities within its agreed policies.
7. Discretions reserved in operating incentive plans
The committee will operate the annual bonus and LTIP according to their respective 
rules and the remuneration policy table on pages 56 and 57. The committee retains 
certain discretions, consistent with market practice, in relation to the operation and 
administration of these plans including:
 – the timing of awards and payments; 
 – the size of awards, within the overall limits disclosed in the policy table; 
 – the determination of performance measures and targets and resultant vesting 
and pay-out levels;
 – (as described in the service agreements and exit payment policy section on page 59) 
determination of the treatment of individuals who leave employment, based on the 
rules of the incentive plans, and the treatment of the incentive plans on exceptional 
events, such as a change of control of the company; and
 – the ability to make adjustments to existing awards made under the incentive plans in 
certain circumstances (e.g. rights issues, corporate restructurings or special dividends).
While performance conditions will generally remain unchanged once set, the committee 
has the usual discretions to amend the measures, weightings and targets in exceptional 
circumstances (such as a major transaction) where the original conditions would cease 
to operate as intended. Any such changes would be explained in the subsequent annual 
remuneration report and, if appropriate, be the subject of consultation with the 
company’s major shareholders.
8. Prior awards
Subject to the achievement of the applicable performance conditions, executive directors 
are eligible to receive payment from any award made prior to the approval and 
implementation of the remuneration policy detailed in this report.
Remuneration report continued Annual report 2017 GREENE KING PLC 59
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
Indicative total remuneration levels
The graphs below provide scenarios for the potential future reward opportunity for each executive director and the potential split between 
the different elements of remuneration, under three different performance scenarios – minimum, on-target and maximum.
Chief executive (£k) Chief financial officer (£k)
Notes:
1. Minimum relates to the value of the package assuming that current salary, benefits and pension alone are paid. 
2.  The on-target annual bonus opportunity is assumed to be 50% of the maximum award for the purposes of these illustrations. The actual on-target level may vary from year to year 
reflecting the performance scale applied.
3. The on-target vesting level under LTIP is assumed to be 50% of the maximum award.
4. The maximum scenario assumes full bonus pay-out and full vesting of LTIP awards. 
5. No assumption as to share price growth is made in either the on-target or the maximum scenarios.
Approach to recruitment and promotions
The remuneration package for a new executive director would be set in accordance with the terms of the company’s prevailing approved remuneration 
policy at the time of recruitment. In particular, the annual bonus potential will be limited to 150% of salary and awards under the LTIP will be limited to 
150% of salary.
In the case of an external hire, if required to secure an individual, the committee may offer additional cash and/or share-based elements, when it considers 
them to be in the best interests of the company, to take account of deferred remuneration forfeited by the new hire when leaving their former employer. 
Any such additional ‘buy-out’ payments would be one off in nature; would reflect where possible the nature, time horizons and performance requirements 
attaching to that forfeited remuneration; and would be limited to the value of the forfeited remuneration. For the avoidance of doubt, there is no formal 
limit on the value of any such buy-out awards. 
For an internal promotion to executive director level, any variable pay element awarded in respect of the prior role may be allowed to pay out in 
accordance with its terms, adjusted as relevant to take into account the appointment. In addition, any other ongoing remuneration obligations existing 
prior to appointment may continue, provided that they are put to shareholders for approval at the earliest opportunity. 
For both external and internal appointments, the committee may agree that the company may meet certain relocation and/or incidental expenses 
as appropriate.
Service agreements and exit payment policy
Newly appointed executive directors are offered a service agreement with a notice period of one year. In the event of the employment of an executive 
director being terminated, the committee would take into account the commercial interests of the company, pay due regard to best practice and apply 
usual common law and contractual principles, including the individual’s duty to mitigate their loss.
The payment of any annual bonus in respect of the year of termination is subject to the discretion of the committee, which may determine that an 
annual bonus is payable with respect to the period of the financial year served, but pro-rated for time served, and not paid until the normal due date 
for the payment of bonuses. 
The vesting of any LTIP awards will be governed by the rules of the LTIP. Awards will normally lapse unless the individual is considered a ‘good leaver’. 
An individual would generally be considered a ‘good leaver’ if they left the group’s employment by reason of death, injury, ill health, disability approved 
by the committee, or retirement, although the committee has the absolute discretion to treat any individual as a ‘good leaver’ for any other reason. 
In the case of a ‘good leaver’, payments would normally be scaled back to recognise the shorter period of service than the award was intended to cover 
and remain subject to outstanding performance conditions. If the individual terminates employment during a holding period for an LTIP award, the holding 
period will normally continue to apply in respect of the performance-vested shares, unless the committee thinks it is appropriate to allow the earlier 
release of shares in the particular circumstances.

Service agreements and exit payment policy continued
Rooney Anand, whose employment with the company commenced on 6 August 2001, is subject to a one-year notice period from the company. 
His terms of employment do not contain any additional terms relating to compensation for termination of employment. The terms of his appointment 
as chief executive were agreed and set out in a letter dated 24 December 2004.
Kirk Davis’ employment, which commenced on 3 November 2014, is subject to the terms of a contract dated 29 September 2014. His employment may 
be terminated by the company giving one year’s notice, without any additional terms relating to compensation for termination of employment.
The company has power to enter into settlement agreements with executives and to pay compensation to settle potential legal claims. In addition, and 
consistent with market practice, in the event of termination of an executive director, the company may pay a contribution towards the individual’s legal 
fees and fees for outplacement services as part of a negotiated settlement. Any such fees would be disclosed as part of the detail of termination 
arrangements. For the avoidance of doubt, the policy does not include an explicit cap on the cost of termination payments.
There are no obligations on the company contained within the existing directors’ contracts which would give rise to payments not disclosed in this report.
Non-executive director policy table
Non-executive directors are appointed pursuant to letters of appointment for three-year periods. The table below sets out, for each of the current 
directors, the start and expiry dates of their respective appointments.

Change from

Fee To recruit and retain 
appropriately qualified 
non-executive directors.
The chairman and non-executive 
director fees are typically reviewed 
every two years. Fees are 
benchmarked against similar 
roles in the sector and in other 
similar sized companies and reflect 
the time commitments and 
responsibilities of each role.
Non-executive director fees may 
include a basic fee and a fee for 
acting as a committee chairman or 
senior independent director. They 
are set at a level that is considered 
appropriately competitive in light 
of market practice.
— No material

External directorships
The company’s policy is to allow executive directors to take up one or more non-executive directorships in an external company, subject to board 
approval. Fees received for serving as a non-executive director of an external company are retained by the executive director. 
Consultation
The company engages regularly with shareholders on matters relating to its strategy and business operations. Where necessary, we also engage with 
shareholders and their representative bodies on matters relating to executive remuneration and it is the committee’s policy to consult with major shareholders 
prior to making any major changes to its executive remuneration structure. The committee consulted with its largest shareholders before proposing 
the changes reflected in this directors’ remuneration policy.
Consideration of conditions elsewhere in the group
As explained in the general policy section of the directors’ remuneration policy, the committee takes into account group-wide pay and employment conditions. 
The committee reviews the average group-wide base salary increase and is responsible for all discretionary and all employee share arrangements.
Consistent with normal practice, the committee did not consult with employees in preparing the directors’ remuneration policy.
The committee is cognisant of the requests from, amongst others, the Investment Association for companies to publish ratios comparing CEO pay to 
employee pay. The committee has not, however, published this data in the directors’ remuneration report given the absence of a common methodology 
for these comparisons; the company’s expectation is that it will publish ratios showing comparisons in future years when, as can be expected, UK regulations 
or guidance develop a common methodology.

Annual report on remuneration
This section of the report explains how Greene King’s remuneration policy has been implemented during the year.
The remuneration committee
The remuneration committee is appointed by the board. The members are Lynne Weedall (chairman), Mike Coupe, Gordon Fryett (from his appointment 
on 1 December 2016) and Rob Rowley. Ian Durant was also a member of the committee until his retirement on 8 September 2016. All of the committee 
members are regarded by the board as independent non-executive directors. 
The role of the committee, as set out in its terms of reference (which are available on the company’s website), includes determining the remuneration 
policy for the executive directors, the chairman and certain members of senior management. It agrees total individual remuneration packages, considers 
the granting of awards under the long-term incentive plan and determines bonuses payable to the executive directors and certain senior executives.
It approves the service contracts of the executive directors and any compensation arrangements arising from their termination. The committee is made 
aware of, and takes into account, the salary levels of the wider senior management team and the incentive arrangements operating throughout the company.
During the year there were three scheduled meetings of the committee. Attendance at these meetings is shown in the table on page 48.
Advisers to the remuneration committee
The committee has appointed FIT Remuneration Consultants LLP to provide advice on general remuneration matters and comparator information. 
The committee is satisfied that FIT Remuneration Consultants LLP are independent advisers to the committee as they do not provide any other services 
to the company. Fees paid during the year to FIT Remuneration Consultants LLP in respect of advice to the committee, generally charged on a time 
spent basis, were £41,530.
Rooney Anand, chief executive, attends meetings of the committee by invitation and provides advice to help the committee determine appropriate 
remuneration and incentive packages for the chief financial officer and other senior executives, but he leaves the meeting when his own remuneration 
is being discussed. The chairman of the board also attends meetings of the committee by invitation.
Shareholder voting at the 2014 and 2016 AGM

Notes:
1. Pension benefits for the executive directors comprised cash in lieu of pension contributions.
2.  Long-term incentives in 2016/17 comprised the value of the awards granted in July 2014, which will vest in July 2017 and which were subject to performance targets measured over 
the three years to May 2017. The value of the award has been calculated using £6.94, being the average share price for the last three months of the 2016/17 financial year, and also 
takes into account the value of the dividend equivalent shares which accrued on the award. It has been assumed that the 2014 core LTIP award will not vest due to failure to meet 
the minimum performance conditions and that 18% of the 2014 growth LTIP will vest. For the long-term incentives in 2015/16 the actual share price on the date of vesting has 
been used (restated from the estimate of £1,172k for Rooney Anand disclosed in the 2015/16 annual report). 
3. Ian Durant retired from the board on 9 September 2016.
4. Gordon Fryett was appointed to the board on 1 December 2016.
5. Tim Bridge retired from the board on 1 May 2016.
Details of the elements included in the table above are as follows:
Base salary
The base salaries for 2016/17 for Rooney Anand and Kirk Davis were £645,000 and £351,000 respectively. The base fee for the chairman was £250,000, 
whilst the base fees for the non-executive directors were £50,000 for Mike Coupe and Gordon Fryett and £60,000 for Ian Durant (as chairman 
of the audit committee), Rob Rowley (as senior independent director and chairman of the audit committee) and Lynne Weedall (as chairman 
of the remuneration committee). 
Taxable benefits
Taxable benefits were provided to directors in line with the policy table set out on pages 56 and 57.
Pension related benefits
Cash in lieu of pension contributions were in line with the policy table set out on pages 56 and 57.
Annual bonus
Executive directors may earn bonuses depending on the company’s performance and their own individual performance. Awards for 2016/17 for 
the chief executive were based 90% on financial performance and 10% on individual performance, whilst for the chief financial officer the respective 
percentages were 80% on financial performance and 20% on individual performance.
For both the chief executive and the chief financial officer, the financial performance measures were based on profit before tax and exceptionals (PBTE), 
free cash flow and the amount of synergies captured from the Spirit acquisition. The target ranges, outcome and awards (as a percentage of salary) 
are included in the tables below:

Notes:
1.  The personal target for Rooney Anand related to succession planning for members of the operating board. Following the remuneration committee’s assessment of the personal 
target and actual performance, 10% of salary was awarded against this metric.
2.  The personal targets for Kirk Davis included a like-for-like Pub Company sales growth (excluding brand swap sites benefiting from capex) target (15% weighting) and two personal 
targets relating to succession planning for the senior members of the finance function and his own personal development. As the like-for-like sales growth target remains commercially 
sensitive the target has not been disclosed but will be disclosed next year. Following the remuneration committee’s assessment of his personal targets and actual performance, 
12% of salary was awarded against these metrics.
3. As the precise outcome for the Spirit Pub Company synergies for 2016/17 remains commercially sensitive at this time, this has not been disclosed but will be disclosed next year.
Performance against the combined financial and individual targets resulted in bonuses being paid at £231k (35.8% of salary) for Rooney Anand 
and at £106k (30.3% of salary) for Kirk Davis. 
Disclosure of 2015/16 bonus targets
The majority of the 2015/16 financial bonus targets and the company’s performance against those targets were disclosed last year. However, Kirk Davis 
had a target relating to Pub Company like-for-like sales growth, details of which were not disclosed last year due to their commercial sensitivity, and are 
now set out below. The outcome set out below was disclosed last year.

Implementation of remuneration policy in 2017/18
Salary
Executive directors’ salaries are generally reviewed annually but there will be no increase for the 2017/18 financial year at the recommendation of the 
executive directors, reflecting their alignment with a focus on the control of costs. Their salaries with effect from 1 May 2017 (and previous year levels) 
are as follows:

in those pubs and restaurants) were 1.0%.
Pension and benefits 
The pension contributions and benefits will continue in line with the policy table on pages 56 and 57.
Annual bonus
The annual bonus opportunity for 2017/18 will, subject to the approval of the new remuneration policy at the 2017 AGM, be 150% of salary. 
The chief executive’s financial targets will be based primarily on group PBTE (maximum weighting 75% of salary) and free cash flow (maximum weighting 25%). 
In addition the chief executive will have two new strategic targets, with a maximum weighting of 15% each, relating to customer net promoter score in our 
Pub Company and employee engagement. Finally, a further 20% of his bonus will be based on personal targets relating to succession planning and values.
The chief financial officer’s financial performance targets will be based on PBTE (maximum weighting 62.5% of salary), free cash flow (maximum weighting 
12.5%), cost savings (maximum weighting 12.5%) and financing (maximum weighting 12.5%). He will have the two new strategic targets, with a maximum 
weighting of 15% each, relating to customer net promoter score in our Pub Company and employee engagement. A further 20% of his bonus will be 
based on personal targets which relate to succession planning and values. 
The committee has decided that the bonus targets should not be disclosed prospectively due to commercial sensitivity. The committee expects to 
publish the performance targets, once they have ceased to be commercially sensitive, in the 2017/18 annual report.

LTIP
Subject to the approval of the new remuneration policy at the 2017 AGM, the awards to be made in 2017 will be subject to a maximum of 150% of the 
executive director’s base salary, calculated by reference to the average closing prices on the three business days immediately prior to the date of the award.
The awards will vest three years after the date of the award, subject to continued employment within the group and dependent on performance over 
the three financial years to April 2020. There will then be a two-year holding period during which the executive directors will not be entitled to exercise 
their performance-vested awards.
The performance conditions applicable to the LTIP awards in 2017/18 will be based on return on capital employed (50% of total award), EPS (25% of 
total award) and free cash flow (25% of total award). All awards will be subject to an underpin performance condition whereby the committee may 
reduce the level of vesting awards (including to zero) if it is not satisfied regarding performance during the performance period for the LTIP awards.
The actual targets remain to be finalised and will be disclosed at the time of the granting of the awards, which will be following the 2017 AGM. 
In the meantime the committee will consult with major shareholders in relation to the proposed targets for the 2017 LTIP awards.

shares to enable it to do so. During the year 200,000 shares were 
acquired by the trustees of the EBT at a cost of £1.6m.
Purchase of own shares
In accordance with the company’s articles of association, authority was 
sought at the last AGM to purchase up to 10% of the company’s shares in 
issue as at 22 July 2016. The authority, which has not been exercised, was 
approved and remains exercisable until the next AGM or 8 December 2017, 
whichever is earlier. The directors have again sought approval for the 
authority to purchase the company’s own shares.
Voting rights
In a general meeting of the company, on a show of hands, every member 
who is present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote shall have one 
vote. On a poll every member who is present in person or by proxy shall 
have one vote for every share of which they are the holder. The AGM 
notice gives full details of deadlines for exercising voting rights in respect 
of resolutions to be considered at the meeting.
No voting rights will be exercised in respect of any own shares held 
by the company.
Transfer of shares
There are no restrictions on the transfer of shares in the company other 
than those which may from time to time be applicable under existing laws 
and regulations (for example under the Market Abuse Directive). 
In addition, pursuant to the Listing Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority, 
directors of the company and persons discharging managerial responsibility 
are required to obtain prior approval from the company to deal in the 
company’s securities and are prohibited from dealing during close periods.
Change of control
All of the company’s share incentive plans contain provisions relating 
to a change of control and full details of these plans are provided in the 
directors’ remuneration report. Outstanding options and awards would 
normally vest and become exercisable on a change of control, subject 
to the satisfaction of performance conditions, if applicable, at that time.
The group’s banking facility agreements contain provisions entitling the 
counterparties to exercise termination or other rights in the event of a 
change of control. Certain of the company’s trading contracts also contain 
similar provisions.
There is one employee who, on a change of control of the company 
resulting in the termination of their employment, would be entitled to 
compensation for loss of office. However, in the context of the company 
as a whole, this agreement is de minimis.

Directors’ statement as to disclosure of information 
to the auditor
The directors who were members of the board at the time of approving 
the directors’ report are listed on pages 44 and 45. Having made enquiries 
of fellow directors and of the company’s auditor, each of these directors 
confirms that:
 – to the best of each director’s knowledge and belief, there is no information 
relevant to the preparation of their report of which the company’s 
auditor is unaware; and
 – each director has taken all the steps a director might reasonably be 
expected to have taken to be aware of relevant audit information and 
to establish that the company’s auditor is aware of that information.
Going concern
The group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect 
its future development, performance and position, are set out in the 
chief executive’s review. The financial position of the group, its cash flows, 
liquidity position and borrowing facilities are described in the financial review. 
In addition, note 24 to the financial statements includes the group’s objectives, 
policies and processes for managing its capital; its financial risk management 
objectives; details of its financial instruments and hedging activities; and its 
exposure to credit and liquidity risk. 
The directors are of the opinion that the group’s forecast and projections, 
which take account of reasonably possible changes in trading performance, 
and its stress testing to take account of severe but plausible shocks to the 
business show that the group should be able to operate within its current 
borrowing facilities and comply with its financing covenants. 
After making enquiries, the directors have a reasonable expectation 
that the company and the group have adequate resources to continue 
in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, they 
continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the annual 
report and financial statements.
Auditor
Ernst & Young LLP has expressed its willingness to continue in office 
and a resolution to re-appoint the firm as the company’s auditor will 
be proposed at the AGM.
Annual general meeting 
The AGM will be held at 12.30pm on Friday 8 September 2017 at the 
Millennium Grandstand, Rowley Mile Racecourse Conference Centre, 
Newmarket, Suffolk. The notice of the AGM is set out in the separate 
circular to shareholders. 
The directors consider that all of the resolutions set out in the notice 
of AGM are in the best interests of the company and its shareholders as 
a whole. The directors will be voting in favour of them and unanimously 
recommend that shareholders vote in favour of each of them.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
Statement of directors’ responsibilities in respect 
of the financial statements 
The directors are responsible for preparing the annual report and the 
financial statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations. 
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for 
each financial year. Under that law the directors have elected to prepare 
the group financial statements in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union, and the 
parent company financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom 
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting 
Standards and applicable law), including Financial Reporting Standard 101 
Reduced Disclosure Framework (FRS 101). Under company law the 
directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied 
that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the group and 
the company and of the profit or loss of the group for that period. In 
preparing these financial statements the directors are required to:
 – select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
 – make judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
 – present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that 
provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable information;
 – in respect of the group financial statements, state whether IFRSs as 
adopted by the European Union have been followed, subject to any 
material departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements;
 – provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific 
requirements in IFRSs is insufficient to enable users to understand the 
impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the 
group’s financial position and financial performance; 
 – in respect of the parent company financial statements, state whether 
applicable UK Accounting Standards, including FRS 101, have been 
followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained 
in the financial statements; and
 – prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it 
is inappropriate to presume that the company and/or the group will 
continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records 
that are sufficient to show and explain the company’s and group’s transactions 
and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of 
the company and the group and enable them to ensure that the financial 
statements comply with the Companies Act 2006 and, with respect to 
the group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. They are 
also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the company and group 
and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection 
of fraud and other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations the directors are also responsible 
for preparing a strategic report, directors’ report, directors’ remuneration 
report and corporate governance statement that comply with that law 
and those regulations. The directors are responsible for the maintenance 
and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the 
company’s website. Legislation in the UK governing the preparation 
and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation 
in other jurisdictions.
Directors’ responsibility statement
The directors confirm, to the best of their knowledge:
 – that the consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance 
with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union give a true and fair view 
of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit of the company 
and undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole; 
 – that the annual report, including the strategic report, includes a fair 
review of the development and performance of the business and the 
position of the company and undertakings included in the consolidation 
taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal risks and 
uncertainties that they face; and
 – having taken into account all matters considered by the board and 
brought to the attention of the board during the year, the directors 
consider that the annual report, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and 
understandable. The directors believe that the disclosures set out in this 
annual report provide the information necessary for shareholders to 
assess the company’s performance, business model and strategy.

Overview of our audit approach
Materiality – Overall group materiality was £13.7m (2016: £12.4m), which represents approximately 5% of pre-tax profit before exceptional 
and non-underlying items. 
Audit scope – We performed an audit of the complete financial information of all of the trading components and the corporate centre which 
together represent 100% of the group’s results for the year.
 – We have obtained an understanding of the entity-level controls of the group which assisted us in identifying and assessing risks 
of material misstatement due to fraud or error, as well as assisting us in determining the most appropriate audit strategy.
Risks of material 
misstatement
 – Capital expenditure accounting.
 – Asset impairment considerations in relation to the trading estate.
 – Stamp duty land tax.
 – Revenue recognition, including fraud risks and risk of management override.
 – Complex customer and supplier arrangements including rebates.
 – Goodwill impairment.
What has 
changed
 – Our audit approach and assessment of areas of focus changed in response to changes in circumstances affecting the Greene King plc 
business and impacting the group financial statements. Since the 2016 audit we have made the following changes to our areas of focus:
 – Errors identified in prior periods of incorrect capitalisation of assets and assets being misclassified and assigned incorrect useful 
economic lives, together with the ongoing Greene King and Spirit estate integration and the more challenging trading 
environment, have resulted in this risk being raised to a significant risk this year. 
 – We have separated the trading estate impairment risk and goodwill impairment risk into separate risks to better reflect their 
respective risk profile and testing strategies.
 – We have also separated the significant risk related to complex customer and supplier arrangements from revenue recognition 
fraud risk in order to better reflect their respective risk profiles and testing strategies.
 – There is a new significant risk this year as a result of HMRC raising a protective assessment for a potential stamp duty land tax 
liability on a property group restructuring and where the outcome is highly judgmental and uncertain. 
 – We no longer consider the risk relating to uncertain tax positions (UTPs) as a risk of material misstatement as the material UTPs 
have now been settled with HMRC.
 – We no longer consider the risk relating to the deferred tax provision for rolled over gains and property revaluations to be a 
significant risk. This is due to the decreased level of deferred tax liability and improvements in management’s process following the 
implementation of a new software system to assist in the calculations.
 – Our performance materiality had been set to a lower threshold of 50% in 2016, due to the increased risk of material misstatement 
arising from the significant changes in the group following the acquisition of Spirit in that period. The integration is largely complete 
and therefore the risk was substantially reduced and performance materiality was set back at the normal level of 75%.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Our assessment of risk of material misstatement
We identified the risks of material misstatement described below as those that had the greatest effect on our overall audit strategy, the allocation of 
resources in the audit and the direction of the efforts of the audit team. This is not a complete list of all the risks identified in our audit. In addressing 
these risks, we have performed the procedures below which were designed in the context of the financial statements as a whole and, consequently, 
we do not express any opinion on these individual areas.
Details of why we identified these risks of material misstatements and our audit response are set out in the table below. This is not a complete list of all 
the procedures we performed in respect of these areas. The arrows in the table indicate whether we consider the financial statement risk associated 
with this focus area to have increased, decreased or stayed the same compared to 2016.

Risk direction
New
From our testing of additions for property, plant 
and equipment (PP&E) in prior year audits we 
had identified a small but increasing trend of 
(i) items being capitalised that were non-capital 
in nature and (ii) assignment of inappropriate 
UELs or residual values (RVs).
This was considered together with the ongoing 
Greene King and Spirit estate integration, and 
the more challenging trading environment 
this year.
Management performed their own analysis and 
testing of items capitalised in the year and made 
an adjustment for the errors identified.
We have identified capital expenditure 
accounting as a significant risk.
We verified the appropriateness of the group’s capital expenditure 
accounting principally through (but not limited to) the following 
key procedures:
 – We disaggregated the PP&E additions population by purchase 
order type and by value in order to identify homogeneous subsets 
exhibiting the same risk characteristics. From these sub-populations 
we selected both key-item and representative samples. We checked 
the supporting rationale for capitalisation against the 
recognition requirements of IAS 16.
 – The identified sample error rates were extrapolated over the 
homogenous sub-populations to estimate the overall error.
 – We compared our test results to those of management and 
assessed the reasons for the differences. Our respective test 
results were materially consistent.
 – We benchmarked the capitalisation policy with industry peers 
in order to confirm they were comparable.
 – For our sample we reviewed the useful economic lives (UELs) 
and RVs against an expectation based on historic actual UELs. 
 – We benchmarked the net impairment charges and 
depreciation expenses as a percentage of PP&E to peers 
in order to compare trends.
As a result of the procedures 
performed and after considering 
management’s corrections, 
we have concluded that PP&E 
additions have been recognised 
in accordance with IAS 16. 
Asset impairment considerations in relation to the trading estate
Refer to the audit committee report (page 51); accounting policies (page 85); and note 14 of the group financial 
statements (page 105)
Risk direction 
↔
The group has PP&E with a net book value 
of £3,622m relating to its trading estate 
as at 30 April 2017.
For the trading estate, impairments are 
considered on a site-by-site basis when an 
impairment indicator has been identified.
In assessing impairment, management 
estimates the recoverable value of each site 
by reference to the higher of its value in use 
(based on the group’s key assumptions in 
relation to forecast profits, growth rate and 
applied discount rate) and fair value less costs 
of disposal (FVLCD). As a result of the Spirit 
acquisition and the bond issue, external 
valuations were obtained in 2016 to 
determine the FVLCD. 
We obtained an understanding of the group’s process employed 
to identify indicators of impairment and to estimate appropriate 
impairments of PP&E at a cash-generating unit (CGU) level 
(site level). We then tested key elements of those processes. 
In particular:
 – We compared the profit growth rates in the cash flow 
forecasts to the budget, to external market growth estimates 
and to the rates applied by industry peers. We also compared 
them to recent actual profit growth rates over the last five-year 
period and corroborated explanations for any anomalies.
 – We used our valuation experts to assess the reasonableness 
of the discount rate applied to cash flows by benchmarking to 
comparator companies and market information.
 – We reperformed the group’s sensitivity calculations applied 
to the cash flows and considered the group’s judgment of how 
a reasonably possible change in assumptions would lead to an 
impairment based upon our knowledge of the group’s activities 
and industry knowledge.
 – We checked the arithmetical accuracy and integrity of 
the impairment models using formula consistency tools 
and reperformance.
We considered the reasonableness 
and appropriateness of the group’s 
estimates, noting that all significant 
assumptions fell within a range 
of acceptable outcomes. 
As a result of the procedures 
performed, we concluded that 
the group’s impairment indicator 
analysis and impairment 
assessment for the group’s 
CGUs had been carried out 
appropriately and in accordance 
with the accounting standards.  GREENE KING PLC Annual report 2017 74
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Risk Our response to the risk
Key observations communicated 
to the audit committee
Asset impairment considerations in relation to the trading estate continued
An update of certain property valuations in 
2017 was performed where necessary to 
support FVLCDs used. 
These processes have a high degree of 
judgment and therefore carry a higher level 
of inherent risk of material error.
 – We checked in the impairment model that the site’s recoverable 
amount (RA) was the higher of value in use (VIU) and FVLCD.
 – Where the FVLCD was required to support the recoverable 
value of a site, we evaluated the robustness and appropriateness 
of the valuation methodologies and the reasonableness of key 
assumptions and judgments made by the company’s experts. 
In addition for a sample of sites where the RA continued to be 
supported by the FVLCD and a decrease in VIU had been seen, 
we requested management obtain updated external valuations.
 – We evaluated the competence and independence of the 
experts used by the company by reference to their 
qualifications and experience.
 – Where impairment indicators existed but no impairment charge 
had been recognised due to management’s judgment being 
applied and manually overriding the model, we sought and 
corroborated explanations from management on the individual 
pubs to validate that no impairment charge was required.
 – We evaluated the appropriateness, sufficiency, and clarity of 
any impairment-related disclosures provided in the group 
financial statements, including the disclosure of key sensitivities. 
We concluded that the related 
disclosures in the group financial 
statements are appropriate.
Stamp duty land tax
Refer to the audit committee report (page 51); accounting policies (page 85); and note 25 of the group financial 
statements (page 117)
Risk direction 
New
We have identified a significant risk of a stamp 
duty land tax (SDLT) provision being materially 
misstated given the level of judgment involved in 
its estimation. This estimate is significant following 
HMRC raising a protective assessment on 
Greene King on the intra-group transfer of a 
property portfolio completed as part of a 
property reorganisation transaction in 2012.
We used our tax audit, stamp duty and tax controversy specialists 
to evaluate the group’s assessment of the provision required.
Our work included:
 – inspecting correspondence with HMRC and the advice 
received from the group’s own tax advisers, and performing 
our own assessment of the most likely outcome on the basis  
of our experience of similar scenarios.
As a result of the procedures 
performed, and in light of the 
information known to date, we 
have concluded that management’s 
estimate of the possible SDLT 
exposure is appropriate and 
in accordance with the 
requirements of IAS 37.
Revenue recognition, including fraud risks and risk of management override
Refer to the audit committee report (page 51); accounting policies (page 85); and note 3 of the group financial 
statements (page 93) 
Risk direction
↔
In accordance with International Standards on 
Auditing (UK and Ireland) there is a presumed 
fraud risk relating to revenue recognition. 
We consider that there is a higher level of risk 
associated with whether beer and liquor sales 
in the Brewing & Brands and Pub Partners 
divisions are recognised appropriately and in 
the correct accounting period. 
For food, liquor and accommodation sales in 
the Pub Company division, we consider these 
are low risk given that the transactions are 
routine, low value, and high volume with no 
estimation uncertainty. Accordingly, the fraud 
risk for such revenues is limited to manual 
journal entries and other adjustments made 
at the end of a reporting period.
We obtained an understanding of the processes for the recognition 
of revenue in each of the revenue streams, and separately for the 
recognition of retrospective discounts (please see below for 
details of their testing).
For food, liquor and accommodation sales in the Pub Company 
division we have focused our testing on manual journals posted 
to this revenue stream.
For beer and liquor sales in the Brewing & Brands and 
Pub Partners divisions:
 – we performed detailed transaction testing by agreeing a 
sample of individual revenue items to sales invoices, evidence 
of delivery and subsequent cash receipt; 
 – we performed sales cut-off testing immediately before and 
after the year end by testing sales invoices to evidence of delivery 
to ensure that revenue had been recognised in the correct 
accounting period; additionally we have performed similar 
detailed testing on credit notes to confirm that the credit note 
has been recognised in the appropriate accounting period; and
 – we conducted specific analytical procedures on revenue and 
credit notes recognised either side of the year end to test 
management’s conclusion that the related revenue had been 
recognised in the correct accounting period.
Please also see the procedures performed over the customer 
rebate payables detailed opposite.
As a result of the procedures 
performed, we have been able 
to conclude that revenue has 
been recognised in accordance 
with the revenue recognition 
policy and accounting standards.

Risk direction 
↓
We have identified a significant risk of 
material misstatement on customer and 
supplier arrangements which include complex 
retrospective rebate estimates which could 
include incorrect judgments or assumptions.
This risk is associated with the accuracy and 
completeness of retrospective discounts and 
rebates due to the area being more 
susceptible to management override. 
 – We obtained an understanding of the different rebate programmes, 
obtaining the standard terms of the most material programmes 
and arrangements and agreed them to managements’ calculation.
 – We checked that the revenue data used in management’s 
calculation was consistent with that which had been audited.
 – We completed analytical review procedures over the rebate 
programme investigating unusual movements period on period. 
 – We have tested and concluded that the correct revenue 
cut-off had been applied through our testing over revenue.
 – For the key rebates receivable recognised as due at the period 
end we have vouched material items to payments or credits 
received after the period end if payments had been received. 
For those key rebates where payments had not yet been received 
since period end we obtained contracts and vouched key rebate 
terms back to the period-end position in order to determine 
that the correct accounting treatment had been applied.
As a result of the procedures 
performed, we have been able 
to conclude that revenue, taking 
account of any due discounts 
payable, has been recognised in 
accordance with IAS 18. We also 
conclude that, from the procedures 
performed, the discounts 
receivable had been correctly 
recognised. We noted that in all 
cases management’s assumptions 
and estimates were reasonable.
Goodwill impairment
Refer to the audit committee report (page 51); accounting policies (page 85); and note 13 of the group 
financial statements (page 103)
Risk direction 
↓
As at 30 April 2017, the goodwill on the 
group balance sheet amounted to £1,108.8m 
(2016: £1,122m). 
Goodwill recorded by the group represents 
the purchase price in excess of the fair value 
of the net assets of businesses acquired. For 
Greene King, impairment is assessed at an 
operating segment level (i.e. Pub Company, 
Pub Partners and Brewing & Brands), being 
the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored.
In line with IAS 36, management reviews 
the goodwill allocated to its goodwill CGUs 
(carrying its operating segments) annually or 
more frequently if impairment indicators 
are present.
These processes have a high degree of 
judgment and therefore carry a higher level 
of inherent risk of material error.
We obtained an understanding of the group’s process employed to 
identify indicators of impairment and to estimate RA of the 
goodwill CGUs (at an operating segment level). We then tested 
key elements of those processes. In particular:
 – we challenged management’s assumptions by comparing the 
profit growth rates in the cash flow forecasts to the budget, 
external market growth estimates rates applied by industry 
peers and recent actual profit growth rates over the last five-year 
period, and corroborated explanations for any anomalies;
 – we tested the reasonableness of the discount rate applied to 
cash flows through benchmarking to comparator companies 
and market expectations; 
 – we reperformed the group’s sensitivities applied to the cash 
flows and considered the group’s judgment of how a reasonably 
possible change in assumptions would lead to an impairment 
based upon our knowledge of the group’s activities and factors 
in the sector;
 – we reviewed management’s determination of operating 
segments (as this is considered to be the lowest level at which 
management monitors and assesses goodwill). We noted that 
the Spirit divisions acquired in the prior year have been subsumed 
within the legacy divisional structure to match how 
management now operates the business;
 – we checked the arithmetical accuracy and integrity of the 
impairment models; and
 – we evaluated the appropriateness, sufficiency, and clarity of any 
impairment-related disclosures provided in the group financial 
statements, including the disclosure of key sensitivities. 
As a result of the procedures 
performed, we have been able 
to conclude and concur with 
management that no impairment 
should be recognised in accordance 
with IAS 36 given the significant 
headroom across all three 
operating divisions. We noted 
that in all cases management’s 
assumptions and estimates 
were reasonable.
As in all of our audits, we also addressed the risk of management override of internal controls, including evaluating whether there is evidence of bias 
by the directors that may represent a risk of material misstatement due to fraud. 
Our assessment of risk of material misstatement continued GREENE KING PLC Annual report 2017 76
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The scope of our audit
Tailoring the scope
Our assessment of audit risk, our evaluation of materiality and our allocation of performance materiality determine our audit scope for each entity 
within the group. Taken together this enables us to form an opinion on the group financial statements under International Standards on Auditing 
(UK and Ireland). We take into account size, risk profile, the organisation of the group and effectiveness of group-wide controls, changes in the business 
environment and other factors when assessing the level of work to be performed at each entity.
The group’s operations are based solely in the United Kingdom and therefore all audit procedures are completed by one audit team based in the head 
office location working across both the group and subsidiary financial statement audits. 
We performed an audit of the complete financial information of all of the trading components and the corporate centre which together represent 
100% of the group’s results for the year. We have obtained an understanding of the entity-level controls of the group which assisted us in identifying 
and assessing risks of material misstatement due to fraud or error, as well as assisting us in determining the most appropriate audit strategy.
Our application of materiality 
We apply the concept of materiality in planning and performing the audit, in evaluating the effect of identified misstatements on the audit and in forming 
our audit opinion.
As we develop our audit strategy, we determine materiality at the overall level and at the individual account level (referred to as our ‘performance materiality’).
 
MATERIALITY
£13.7m
PERFORMANCE 
MATERIALITY
£10.3m
REPORTING 
THRESHOLD
£700k
Materiality
The magnitude of an omission or misstatement that, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions 
of the users of the financial statements. Materiality provides a basis for determining the nature and extent of our audit procedures.
We determined materiality for the group to be £13.7m (2016: £12.4m), which is set at approximately 5% (2016: 5%) of pre-tax profit before exceptional 
and non-underlying items. Our materiality amount provides a basis for determining the nature and extent of risk assessment procedures, identifying and 
assessing the risk of material misstatement and determining the nature and extent of further audit procedures. Materiality is assessed on both quantitative 
and qualitative grounds.
How we determined materiality 
Starting basis
Profit before tax of £184.9m
Adjustment
Excluding exceptional items 
of £88.6m to determine the profit 
before tax and exceptional and 
non-underlying items of £273.5m
Materiality
£13.7m, being approximately 
5% of the profit before tax 
and exceptional and 
non-underlying items
Rationale for basis
We used pre-tax profit before exceptional and non-underlying items of £273.5m because it is a key performance indicator used in communications 
with investors, it is more reflective of underlying trading profitability and it is a key metric used by the group in the assessment of the performance of 
management. We also note that market and analyst commentary on the group uses pre-tax profit before exceptional and non-underlying items as a key 
metric. Therefore, in our view, we consider pre-tax profit before exceptional and non-underlying items to be the most appropriate performance metric 
on which to base our materiality calculation as we considered this to be the most relevant performance measure to the stakeholders of the entity.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Materiality continued
Performance materiality
The application of materiality at the individual account or balance level. It is set at an amount to reduce to an appropriately low level the probability that 
the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceeds materiality.
On the basis of our risk assessments, together with our assessment of the group’s overall control environment, the absence of changes in the business 
environment such as the acquisition of Spirit in 2016 and the number and monetary amounts of individual uncorrected misstatements identified in prior 
periods as well as the nature of the misstatements, our judgment was that the overall performance materiality for the group should be 75% (2016: 50%) 
of our planning materiality, namely £10.3m (2016: £6.2m). We have set our performance materiality to a higher threshold in 2017, reflecting the absence 
of significant changes in the group such as the acquisition of Spirit in 2016 which had, in that period, increased the risks of misstatement. Our objective 
in considering and adopting this approach was to ensure that the total of any detected and undetected audit differences do not exceed our materiality 
of £13.7m for the group financial statements as a whole. 
Audit work on individual components for the purpose of obtaining audit coverage over significant financial statement accounts is undertaken based on 
a percentage of total performance materiality. The performance materiality set for each component is based on the size of the component relative to 
the group as a whole and our assessment of risk of misstatement at that component. In the current year the range of performance materiality allocated 
to components was £2.7m to £8.1m (2016: £2.5m to £5.6m).
Reporting threshold
An amount below which identified misstatements is considered as being clearly trivial.
We agreed with the audit committee that we would report to them all uncorrected audit differences in excess of £0.7m (2016: £0.6m), which is set 
at 5% of planning materiality, as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. 
We evaluate any uncorrected misstatements against both the quantitative measures of materiality discussed above and in light of other relevant 
qualitative considerations in forming our opinion.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the 
financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting 
policies are appropriate to the group’s and the parent company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the 
reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and the overall presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read all 
the financial and non-financial information in the annual report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and to identify 
any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing 
the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the directors’ responsibilities statement set out on page 71, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial 
statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial statements 
in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing 
Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.

work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report 
and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the company and 
the company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1 Accounting policies
Corporate information
The consolidated financial statements of Greene King plc for the 52 weeks ended 30 April 2017 were authorised for issue by the board of directors on 
28 June 2017. Greene King plc is a public company limited by shares incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales. The company’s shares are listed 
on the London Stock Exchange.
Statement of compliance
The group’s financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the EU as they 
apply to the financial statements of the group for the 52 weeks ended 30 April 2017 (prior year 52 weeks ended 1 May 2016). 
Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies 
reporting under IFRS. They are presented in pounds sterling, with values rounded to the nearest hundred thousand, except where otherwise indicated.
A small number of minor changes have been made to reclassify exceptional and non-underlying items in the prior year.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of Greene King plc, its subsidiaries and its related parties, Greene King Finance plc 
and Spirit Issuer plc. Greene King Finance plc and Spirit Issuer plc are structured entities set up to raise bond finance for the group. As Greene King plc 
has full control over both entities they are fully consolidated. The financial statements of subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting year end as 
the parent company with adjustments made to their financial statements to bring their accounting policies in line with those used by the group.
The results of subsidiaries are consolidated from the date of acquisition, being the date on which the group obtains control, and continue to be consolidated 
until the date that such control ceases. Intercompany transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Going concern
The directors have, at the time of approving the financial statements, a reasonable expectation that the company and the group have adequate resources 
to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Thus they continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the 
financial statements. Further detail is contained in the viability statement included in the strategic report on page 37.
Changes in accounting policies
The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial year. New standards and interpretations which came into force 
during the year did not have a significant impact on the group’s financial statements.
Significant accounting policies
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost or deemed cost on transition to IFRS, less accumulated depreciation and any impairment in value.
Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset. 
Freehold land is not depreciated. Freehold and long leasehold buildings are depreciated to their estimated residual values over periods up to 50 years, 
and short leasehold improvements are depreciated to their estimated residual values over the shorter of the remaining term of the lease or useful life 
of the asset. 
There is no depreciable amount if residual value is the same as, or exceeds, book value.
Plant and equipment assets are depreciated over their estimated lives, which range from three to 20 years.
Residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation are reviewed for all categories of property, plant and equipment and adjusted, if appropriate, 
at each financial year end.
An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use. Profit or loss 
on derecognition is calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset, and is included in the income 
statement in the year of derecognition.
Intangible assets
Operating lease intangibles
The fair value attached to operating leasehold interests on acquisition are deemed to represent lease premiums and are carried as intangible assets. 
The operating lease intangible is amortised over the period of the lease.
Brand intangibles
Brand intangible assets recognised on acquisition are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives (15 years).
Business combinations and goodwill 
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate of the consideration transferred, 
measured at acquisition date fair value, and the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree. The choice of measurement of non-controlling 
interests, either at fair value or at the proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets, is determined on a transaction-by-transaction basis. 
Acquisition costs incurred are taken to the income statement.
When the group acquires a business, it assesses the financial assets and liabilities assumed for appropriate classification and designation in accordance 
with the contractual terms, economic circumstances and pertinent conditions as at the acquisition date. This includes the separation of embedded 
derivatives in host contracts of the acquiree.
Any contingent consideration to be transferred to the vendor is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. Subsequent changes to the fair value 
of the contingent consideration which are deemed to be an asset or a liability are recognised in the income statement.
If the contingent consideration is classified as equity, it should not be remeasured until it is finally settled within equity.

Business combinations and goodwill continued
Goodwill is initially measured at cost being the excess of the aggregate of the acquisition date fair value of the consideration transferred and the amount 
recognised for the non-controlling interest over the net identifiable amounts of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in exchange for the business 
combination. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed in transactions separate to the business combinations, such as the settlement of pre-existing relationships or 
post-acquisition remuneration arrangements, are accounted for separately from the business combination in accordance with their nature and applicable 
IFRSs. Identifiable intangible assets, meeting either the contractual-legal or separability criterion, are recognised separately from goodwill. Contingent 
liabilities representing a present obligation are recognised if the acquisition date fair value can be measured reliably. 
If the aggregate of the acquisition date fair value of the consideration transferred and the amount recognised for the non-controlling interest is lower 
than the fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities and the fair value of any pre-existing interest held in the business acquired, the difference 
is recognised in the income statement.
After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Impairment
Property, plant and equipment
Individual assets are grouped for impairment assessment purposes at the lowest level at which there are identifiable cash inflows independent of the cash 
inflows of other groups of assets.
An assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there is an indication of impairment. If an indication exists, the group makes an estimate of 
the recoverable amount of each asset group. An asset’s or cash-generating unit’s recoverable amount is the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal 
and value in use and is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from 
other assets or groups of assets.
An impairment loss is recognised where the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying value of assets. If there is an indication that any previously 
recognised impairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased, a reversal of the loss may be made only if there has been a change in the 
estimates used to determine the recoverable amounts since the last impairment loss was recognised. The carrying amount of the asset is increased to its 
recoverable amount only up to the carrying amount that would have resulted, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset 
in prior years.
Impairment losses and any subsequent reversals are recognised in the income statement.
Details of the impairment losses recognised in respect of property, plant and equipment are provided in note 14.
Goodwill
Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each of the group’s 
cash-generating units (or groups of cash-generating units) that are expected to benefit from the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or 
liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those units. Each unit or group of units to which goodwill is allocated represents the lowest level within the group 
at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes and cannot be larger than an operating segment before aggregation.
Impairment is determined by the recoverable amount of an operating segment. Where this is less than the carrying value of the operating segment 
an impairment loss is recognised immediately in the income statement. This loss cannot be reversed in future periods.
Where goodwill forms part of a cash-generating unit and part of the operation within that unit is disposed of, any goodwill associated with the operation 
disposed of is included in the carrying amount of the operation when determining the gain or loss on disposal of the operation. Goodwill disposed of in 
this circumstance is measured based on the relative values of the operation disposed of and the portion of the cash-generating unit retained.
Goodwill amortised prior to the conversion to IFRS on 3 May 2004 has not been reinstated and the net book value of goodwill at that date has been 
carried forward as the carrying value. Prior to May 1998, goodwill was written off to reserves. Such goodwill has not been reinstated and is not included 
in determining profit or loss on disposal.
Financial instruments
Financial instruments are recognised when the group becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument and are derecognised when the 
group no longer controls the contractual rights that comprise the financial instrument, normally through sale or when all cash flows attributable to the 
instrument are passed to an independent third party.
Financial assets
Financial assets are classified as either financial assets at fair value through the income statement, loans and receivables, held-to-maturity investments or 
available-for-sale financial assets. The group determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition and, where appropriate, re-evaluates 
this designation at each financial year end.
The group makes trade loans to publicans who purchase the group’s beer. Trade loans are non-derivative and are not quoted in an active market and 
have therefore been designated as ‘Loans and receivables’, carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Gains and losses are recognised 
in income when the loans and receivables are derecognised or impaired, as well as through the amortisation process.
The group assesses at each balance sheet date whether any individual trade loan is impaired. If there is evidence that an impairment loss has been incurred, 
the amount of loss is measured as the difference between the loan’s carrying amount and the expected future receipts, (excluding future credit losses 
that have not been incurred), discounted at the loan’s original effective interest rate. The loss is recognised in operating profit.
Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables are recorded at their original invoiced amount less an allowance for any doubtful amounts when collection of the full 
amount is no longer considered probable.

Inventories
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Raw materials are valued at average cost. Finished goods and work in progress 
comprise materials, labour and attributable production overheads where applicable, and are valued at average cost.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet comprise cash at bank and in hand and short-term deposits with an original maturity of three months or 
less. For the consolidated cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as defined above, net of outstanding bank 
overdrafts.
Property, plant and equipment held for sale
Property, plant and equipment is classified as held for sale only if it is available for sale in its current condition, management are committed to the sale 
and a sale is highly probable and expected to be completed within one year from the date of classification. Property, plant and equipment classified as 
held for sale is measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs of disposal and is no longer depreciated or amortised.
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings
All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at fair value of the consideration received, net of issue costs. After initial recognition, interest-bearing 
loans and borrowings are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Finance costs and income
Finance costs are expensed to the income statement using the effective interest method. Finance income is recognised in the income statement using 
the effective interest method.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting
The group uses interest rate swaps to hedge its exposure to interest rate fluctuations on its variable rate loans, notes and bonds.
Interest rate swaps are initially measured at fair value, if any, and carried on the balance sheet as an asset or liability. Subsequent measurement is at fair 
value and the movement is recognised in the income statement unless hedge accounting is adopted. For interest rate swaps where hedge accounting 
is not applied the fair value movement is analysed between pre-exceptional finance costs and exceptional finance costs. 
Pre-exceptional finance costs includes cash payments or receipts on the interest rate swaps so as to show the underlying fixed rate on the debt with 
the remaining fair value movement (which is generally the movement in the carrying value of the swap in the period) reflected as an exceptional item.
For derivatives acquired at a non-zero fair value (e.g. on acquisition) the amortisation of the initial fair value is recognised in pre-exceptional finance costs 
to offset the cash payments or receipts.
Hedge accounting
To qualify for hedge accounting the hedge relationship must be designated and documented at inception. Documentation must include the group’s risk 
management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge and formal allocation to the item or transaction being hedged. The group also documents 
how it will assess the effectiveness of the hedge and carries out assessments on a regular basis to determine whether it has been, and is likely to 
continue to be, highly effective.
Hedges can be classified as either fair value (hedging exposure to changes in fair value of an asset or liability), or cash flow (hedging the variability in cash 
flows attributable to an asset, liability or forecast transaction). The group uses certain of its interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges.
Cash flow hedge accounting
The effective portion of the gain or loss on an interest rate swap is recognised in Other comprehensive income (OCI), whilst any ineffective portion 
is recognised immediately in the income statement. 
Amounts recognised in the OCI are transferred to the income statement in the same period that the financial income or expense is recognised, unless 
the hedged transaction results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or liability whereby the amounts are transferred to the initial carrying amount 
of the asset or liability.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting, amounts previously recognised 
in OCI are held there until the previously hedged transaction affects the income statement. If the hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, 
the cumulative gain or loss recognised in OCI is immediately transferred to the income statement.
Trade payables
Trade payables are non-interest bearing and are stated at their nominal value.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, when it is probable that an outflow 
of resources will be required to settle the obligation, and when a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
Provisions are discounted to present value where the effect of the time value of money is material using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current 
market estimates of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. The amortisation of the discount is recognised as a finance cost.
Off-market contract liabilities
Off-market contract liabilities are recognised where contracts are at unfavourable terms relative to current market terms on acquisition. For leases 
where the current rentals are below market terms, the related asset is considered to be recognised as an operating lease in intangible assets. For other 
acquired pubs an off-market liability has been calculated as the difference between the present value of future contracted rentals and the present value 
of future market rate rentals. 
The liability unwinds against the rental expense so that the income statement charge reflects current market terms.
The off-market contract liability is increased by the unwinding of the discount at acquisition (using the effective rate applied in measuring the off-market 
contract liabilities at the date of acquisition) and decreased by utilisation which is unwound against rental expense in the income statement so that the 
income statement charge reflects current market terms. GREENE KING PLC Annual report 2017 88

Pensions and other post-employment benefits
Defined benefit pension schemes
The group operates two defined benefit pension schemes which require contributions to be made into separately administered funds. The cost of providing 
benefits under the schemes is determined separately for each plan using the projected unit credit actuarial method on an annual basis. The current 
service cost is charged to operating profit. Any remeasurement gains and losses are recognised in full in the group statement of comprehensive income 
in the period in which they occur.
When a settlement or curtailment occurs the obligation and related scheme assets are remeasured and the resulting gain or loss is recognised in the 
income statement in the same period.
Net interest on the net defined benefit liability/(asset) is determined by multiplying the net defined benefit liability/(asset) by the discount rate both as 
determined at the start of the annual reporting period, taking account of any changes in the net defined benefit liability/(asset) during the period as a 
result of contributions and benefit payments.
The defined benefit asset or liability recognised on the balance sheet comprises the present value of the schemes’ obligations less the fair value 
of scheme assets. Any surplus resulting from this calculation is limited to the present value of any economic benefits available in the form of refunds 
from the schemes or a reduction in future contributions to the schemes.
Defined contribution pension schemes
The cost of the group’s defined contribution pension schemes amounts to the value of contributions made. Contributions are charged to the income 
statement as they become payable.
Share-based payments
Certain employees and directors receive equity-settled remuneration, whereby they render services in exchange for shares or rights over shares. The fair 
value of the shares and options granted is measured using a Black-Scholes model, at the date at which they were granted. No account is taken in the fair 
value calculation of any vesting conditions (service and performance), other than market conditions (performance linked to the price of the shares of the company). 
Any other conditions that are required to be met in order for an employee to become fully entitled to an award are considered non-vesting conditions. 
Like market performance conditions, non-vesting conditions are taken into account in determining the grant date fair value. The fair value of shares and 
options granted is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity spread over the period in which the vesting conditions 
are fulfilled ending on the relevant vesting date. The cumulative amount recognised as an expense reflects the extent to which the vesting period has 
expired, adjusted for the estimated number of shares and options that are ultimately expected to vest. The periodic charge or credit is the movement 
in the cumulative position from beginning to end of that period.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest because non-market performance and/or service conditions have not been met. 
Where awards include a market or non-vesting condition, the transactions are treated as vested irrespective of whether the market or non-vesting 
condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance and/or service conditions are satisfied.
Own shares
Own shares consist of treasury shares and shares held within an employee benefit trust. The group has an employee benefit trust for the granting 
of shares to applicable employees. 
Own shares are recognised at cost as a deduction from shareholders’ equity. Subsequent consideration received for the sale of such shares is also 
recognised in equity, with any difference between the sale proceeds from the original cost being taken to retained earnings. No gain or loss is recognised 
in the performance statements on transactions in treasury shares.
Revenue
Generally, revenue represents external sales (excluding taxes) of goods and services, net of discounts. Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is 
probable that the economic benefits will flow to the group and is measured at the fair value of consideration receivable, excluding discounts, rebates, 
and other sales taxes or duty relating to brewing and packaging of certain products. Revenue principally consists of drink, food and accommodation 
sales, which are recognised at the point at which goods or services are provided, and rental income, which is recognised on a straight-line basis over the 
lease term and machine income, where net takings are recognised as earned. The accrued value for rebates payable is included within other payables.
Supplier rebates
Supplier rebates are included within operating profit as they are earned. The accrued value at the reporting date is included within other receivables.
Operating leases
Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and benefits of ownership are classified as operating leases. Lease payments are recognised 
as an expense in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
Lease premiums paid on entering into or acquiring operating leases represent prepaid lease payments and are held on the balance sheet as current 
(the portion relating to the next financial period) or non-current prepayments. These are amortised on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
The fair values attached to operating head leasehold interests on acquisitions are deemed to represent lease premiums, and are carried as intangible assets. 
These operating leases are capitalised at cost and amortised over the period of the lease.
See ‘Off-market contract liabilities’ for the accounting policy where the fair values of operating leases are a liability.

Finance leases
Leases of property, plant and equipment, where the group has substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership, are classified as finance leases. 
Finance leases are recognised at acquisition at the lower of the fair value of the leased asset and the present value of the minimum lease payments. 
The asset is then depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the lease term. A corresponding liability is included in the 
balance sheet as a finance lease obligation. Lease payments are apportioned between the finance charges and reduction of the lease liability to achieve 
a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance charges are recognised in finance costs.
Merger reserve
The merger reserve represents capital contributions received and amounts recognised on the acquisition of Spirit Pub Company Limited being the 
difference between the value of the consideration and the nominal value of the shares issued as consideration.
Taxes
Income tax
The income tax charge comprises both the income tax payable based on profits for the year and the deferred income tax. It is calculated using taxation rates 
enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and is measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities.
Income tax relating to items recognised in OCI and equity are recognised in OCI and equity respectively.
Deferred tax
Deferred tax is provided for using the liability method on temporary differences at the balance sheet date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
and their carrying values in the financial statements.
Deferred tax is recognised for all temporary differences except where the deferred tax arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset 
or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination that, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit 
or loss or, in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, where the timing of the reversal of the temporary 
differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences and carry forward of unused tax losses only to the extent that it is probable 
that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences and the carry forward of unused tax losses can be utilised.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient 
taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilised. Unrecognised deferred tax assets are reassessed at each balance 
sheet date and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profit will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured, on an undiscounted basis, at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the year when the asset is realised 
or the liability is settled, based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset income tax assets and income tax liabilities 
and they relate to the same taxable entity and same tax authority and when it is the intention to settle the balances on a net basis.
Deferred tax relating to items recognised in OCI and equity are recognised in OCI and equity respectively.
Uncertain tax positions
Provision for uncertain tax positions is based on an assessment of the tax treatment of certain transactions. Tax benefits are not recognised unless 
it is probable that the benefit will be obtained and tax provisions are made if it is probable that a liability will arise. The group reviews its uncertain 
tax positions each period in order to determine the appropriate accounting treatment.
Exceptional and non-underlying items and adjusted profitability measures
Management use a range of measures to monitor and assess the group’s financial performance. These measures include a combination of statutory 
measures calculated in accordance with IFRS and alternative performance measures (APMs). These alternative performance measures include the 
following adjusted measures of profitability:
 – operating profit before exceptional and non-underlying items;
 – profit before tax, exceptional and non-underlying items (PBTE);
 – profit attributable to equity holders before exceptional and non-underlying items; and
 – adjusted basic earnings per share.
We report these measures as we believe that they provide management and investors with useful additional information about the group’s performance.
The above measures represent the equivalent IFRS measures but are adjusted to exclude items that we consider would prevent comparison of the 
group’s performance both from one reporting period to another and with other similar businesses.
Exceptional and non-underlying items are not defined under IFRS. Exceptional items are classified as those which are separately identifiable by virtue 
of their size, nature or expected frequency and therefore warrant separate presentation. Non-underlying items are other items that we consider should 
be presented separately to allow a better understanding of the underlying performance of the business. Presentation of these measures is not intended 
to be a substitute for or to promote them above statutory measures.
The group’s income statement provides a reconciliation of the adjusted profitability measures, excluding exceptional and non-underlying items 
to the equivalent unadjusted IFRS measures. Exceptional and non-underlying items are then further detailed in note 5 to the financial statements. GREENE KING PLC Annual report 2017 90

Exceptional and non-underlying items and adjusted profitability measures continued
Items that are considered to be exceptional or non-underlying and that are therefore separately identified in order to aid comparability may include 
the following:
Exceptional items:
 – profits or losses resulting from the disposal of a business or investment;
 – costs incurred in association with business combinations, such legal and professional fees and stamp duty that are excluded from the fair value of the 
consideration of the business combination;
 – one-off restructuring and integration costs that are incurred either following a business combination or following a restructuring of the group’s 
support functions. These costs can be significant and would prevent year-on-year comparability of the group’s trading if not separately identified; 
 – impairment charges in respect of tangible and intangible assets as a result of restructuring, business closure, underperformance of sites or fire damage; 
 – finance costs or income resulting from gains or losses upon the settlement of interest rate swap liabilities. These amounts may be significant and are 
separately identified as the instruments they relate to would no longer form part of the group’s ongoing capital structure;
 – fair value gains and losses on the ineffective element of cash flow hedges and fair value movements in respect of derivatives held at fair value through 
profit and loss. Such items are separately presented as movements may be both significant and volatile; and 
 – significant and/or one-off tax settlements in respect of prior years (including any related interest), and the tax impact of the items identified above are 
included as exceptional items. These items are separately identified to allow management and investors to separately understand tax charges relating 
to in-year on-going activity and what relates to prior periods.
These amounts may be significant and are separately identified as the instruments they relate to would no longer form part of the group’s ongoing 
capital structure:
Non-underlying items may include:
 – profit or loss on the disposal of property, plant and equipment. The group disposes of properties that it no longer considers meet the ongoing needs 
of the business. These profits or losses could be significant and volatile and are not reflective of the group’s ongoing trading results; 
 – costs associated with property lease reversions and onerous leases. The group may incur costs and recognise liabilities in respect of leasehold properties 
where the terms of the lease make them onerous or leases that have previously been disposed of but revert to the group under privity of contract. 
Such costs may occur infrequently or could be significant and are not reflective of the group’s ongoing trade;
 – significant credits to the income statement resulting from the reversal of share-based payment charges recognised in prior year’s performance 
following the reassessment of the expected scheme;
 – gains or losses resulting from the settlement of liabilities in respect of the group’s pension schemes;
 – finance costs or income includes the recycling to the income statement of cumulative gains or losses relating to settled swaps previously taken 
to the hedging reserve;
 – the impact of changes in the statutory tax rates;
 – the impact of changes to the tax base cost of the group’s licensed estate and indexation; and
 – other adjustment in respect of prior periods’ tax arises from finalising the tax returns for earlier periods and rolled over gains on the licensed estate. 
New standards and interpretations not applied
As at the date of approval of the financial statements there are a number of standards and interpretations issued by the IASB and IFRIC with an effective 
date after the date of these financial statements and which have not been early adopted by the group. These are expected to be applied as follows:
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments was issued in July 2014 and is a replacement of IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement. 
IFRS 9 covers the classification, measurement and derecognition of financial assets and financial liabilities, together with a new hedge accounting model 
and the new expected credit loss model for calculating impairment. 
The new standard becomes effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018, subject to EU adoption. An initial assessment indicates 
that the adoption of IFRS 9 will not have a material impact on its consolidated results and financial position.
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers
The IASB issued IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers in May 2014. The new standard provides a single, five-step revenue recognition model, 
applicable to all sales contracts, which is based upon the principle that revenue is recognised when the control of goods or services is transferred to the 
customer. This standard replaces all existing revenue recognition guidance under current IFRS and becomes effective for annual periods beginning on or 
after 1 January 2018, subject to EU adoption. Initial assessments undertaken by the Group indicate that the adoption of IFRS 15 will not have material 
impact on its consolidated results and financial position, but is likely to result in additional disclosure requirements.
IFRS 16 Leases
The IASB issued IFRS 16 Leases in January 2016. The new standard provides a single lessee accounting model, requiring lessees to recognise assets and 
liabilities for all leases unless the lease term is 12 months or less or the underlying asset has a low value. The new standard will be effective for annual 
periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019, subject to EU adoption, and replaces the existing leasing standard, IAS 17 Leases. For lessors, there is little 
change to the existing accounting in IAS 17 Leases.
The group has determined that the application of IFRS 16 will have a material impact on its consolidated financial results and financial position. This includes 
recognition of interest and amortisation expense in place of fixed rental expense in the income statement and the recognition of right of use assets and 
lease liabilities for its operating lease portfolio on the balance sheet. There is no net cash flow impact on application of IFRS 16. The group will conduct 
a detailed assessment to determine the full impact of IFRS 16 on its consolidated results and financial position.

IAS 7 Disclosure Initiative – Amendment to IAS 7 
The IASB issued the amendment in January 2016. The improvements to disclosure relate to the statement of cash flows and require companies to provide 
information about changes in their financial liabilities. This amendment is a response to requests from investors for information that helps them better 
understand changes in a company net debt. The amendment will help investors to evaluate changes in liabilities arising from financing activities, including 
changes from cash flows and non-cash flows (such as foreign exchange gains and losses) and becomes effective for annual periods beginning on or after 
1 January 2017, subject to EU adoption. The group has determined that the impact of IAS 7 will be limited to disclosure and will have no impact on its 
consolidated results and financial position.
IFRIC 23 – Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments
The IASB issued IFRIC 23 – Uncertainty over income tax treatments in June 2017 to clarify application of recognition and measurement requirements in 
IAS 12 Income Taxes when there is uncertainty over income tax treatments, effective 1 January 2019. Given the timing of the release the group will assess 
the impact of this standard in the coming period.
Other standards and interpretations that are relevant to the group have been assessed as having no significant financial impact or additional disclosure 
requirements at this time.
 – IAS 12 Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for Unrealised Losses;
 – IFRS 2 Amendments to IFRS 2; and
 – the IASB’s annual improvement process, 2014–2016.
Significant accounting judgments and estimates
The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions in the application of accounting policies 
that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expense. The group bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and 
other factors deemed reasonable under the circumstances, including any expectations of future events. Actual results may differ from these estimates. 
The estimates and judgments considered to be significant are detailed below:
Taxation
Judgment is required when determining the provision for taxes as the tax treatment of some transactions cannot be finally determined until a formal 
resolution has been reached with the tax authorities. Assumptions are also made around the assets which qualify for capital allowances and the level of 
disallowable expenses and this affects the income tax calculation. Provisions are also made for uncertain exposures which can have an impact on both 
deferred and current tax. Tax benefits are not recognised unless it is probable that the benefit will be obtained and tax provisions are made if it is possible 
that a liability will arise. The final resolution of these transactions may give rise to material adjustments to the income statement and/or cash flow in 
future periods. The group reviews each significant tax liability or benefit each period to assess the appropriate accounting treatment. Refer to notes 5, 
10 and 25 for further details.
Share-based payments
Judgment is required when calculating the fair value of awards made under the group’s share-based payment plans. Note 8 describes the key assumptions 
and valuation model inputs used in the determination of these values. In addition estimates are made of the number of awards that will ultimately vest 
and judgment is required in relation to the probability of meeting non-market-based performance conditions and the continuing participation of 
employees in the plans.
Pension liabilities
The present values of pension liabilities are determined on an actuarial basis and depend on a number of actuarial assumptions which are disclosed in 
note 9. Any change in these assumptions will impact on the carrying amount of pension liabilities. Note 9 describes the key assumptions used in the 
accounting for retirement benefit obligations.
Impairment of goodwill
The group determines whether goodwill is impaired on at least an annual basis. Details of the tests and carrying value of the assets are shown in note 13. 
This requires an estimation of the value-in-use of the cash-generating units to which the goodwill is allocated. Value-in-use calculations require assumptions 
to be made regarding the expected future cash flows from the cash-generating unit and choice of a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the 
present value of those cash flows. If the actual cash flows are lower than estimated, future impairments may be necessary.
Impairment of property, plant and equipment
The group determines whether property, plant and equipment is impaired where there are indicators of impairment. This requires an estimation of the 
value-in-use and fair value less costs of disposal at an individual pub level. Value-in-use calculations require assumptions to be made regarding the expected 
future cash flows from the cash-generating unit and choice of a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value of those cash flows. 
Note 14 describes the assumptions used in the impairment testing of property, plant and equipment together with an analysis of the sensitivity to changes 
in key assumptions.
Residual values
Residual values of property are determined with reference to current market property trends. If residual values were lower than estimated, an impairment 
of asset value and reassessment of future depreciation charge may be required. Useful lives are reassessed annually which may lead to an increase or 
reduction in depreciation accordingly.
Property provisions
The group provides for its onerous obligations under operating leases where the property is closed or vacant and for properties where rental expense 
is in excess of income. The estimated timings and amounts of cash flows are determined using the experience of internal and external property experts. 
However, changes to the expected method of exiting from the obligation could lead to changes in the level of provision recorded. See note 25 for details. GREENE KING PLC Annual report 2017 92

Exceptional operating costs
Acquisition and integration costs are items of one-off expenditure, including legal and professional fees, the costs of dedicated integration project teams 
and redundancy costs, incurred in connection with the acquisition and integration of Spirit Pub Company.
During the period to 30 April 2017 the group has recognised a net impairment loss of £58.6m (2016: £32.2m). This is comprised of an impairment charge 
of £77.7m (2016: £79.5m) and reversal of previously recognised impairment losses of £19.1m (2016: £47.3m). £23.7m impairment has been recognised in 
respect of a small number of pubs and is driven by changes in the local competitive and trading environment at the respective sites, and £34.9m due to a 
decision taken to exit some sites during the financial year. Impairment reversals have been recognised following an improvement in trading performance 
and an increase in amounts of estimated future cash flows for previously impaired sites or increases to fair value less costs of disposal.
Non-underlying operating costs
The net profit on disposal of property, plant and equipment and goodwill of £3.4m (2016: £23.8m) comprises a total profit on disposal of £38.2m 
(2016: £50.6m) and a total loss on disposal of £34.8m (2016: £26.8m). 
The group incurred £3.7m of exceptional employee costs, which included restructuring costs and costs associated with changes to key management. 
In addition a share-based payment credit of £3.1m was recognised which resulted from the reversal of charges recognised in earlier years following a 
reassessment of expected scheme performance.
The group recognised a £1.6m non-underlying credit in relation to pension settlement following the completion of a flexible retirement offer 
and pension increase exchange during the period.
Exceptional and non-underlying finance costs
Following the issue of £300m secured bonds, a number of the group’s swap liabilities were settled at a discount recognising a £12.2m exceptional gain. 
The cash cost of settling this was £114.2m.
The swaps concerned were hedging cash flows relating to the Greene King A5 bond and floating rate bank loans. These cash flows are still expected 
to occur and therefore in accordance with IAS 39 the cumulative losses taken to the hedging reserve will be recycled to the income statement over the 
same period during which the hedged forecast cash flows affect profit or loss. A non-underlying charge of £11.8m has been recognised in respect of this 
during the period. 
During the prior period the group acquired as part of a business combination derivatives that are subsequently accounted for at fair value through 
profit and loss as opposed to existing derivatives which are designated in hedge relationships. An exceptional charge of £23.6m (2016: £39.1m) relates to 
the mark-to-market movement on these derivatives, excluding amortisation of fair value on acquisition which reduces the pre-exceptional finance costs 
that include interest paid (note 24). Mark-to-market movements are considered to be exceptional owing to their volatility and are shown separately to 
ensure pre-exceptional finance costs are more readily comparable each year. Fair value amortisation is deemed to be a pre-exceptional item as it adjusts 
swap interest to a market rate.

Exceptional tax
The exceptional tax credit in respect of the licensed estate relates to impairment.
On 6 June 2016 a formal agreement was reached with HMRC on a number of historical tax positions and on 22 July 2016 the Court of Appeal published 
its final decision on the Sussex case. As a result the group settled income tax of £20.7m and interest of £12.2m during the period. An income tax credit 
of £0.8m is included within adjustment in respect of prior periods (referred to below).
The remaining historical tax position is an internal property arrangement for which discussions with HMRC are at an early stage (see note 25). 
Non-underlying tax
The tax credit in respect of the licensed estate has arisen from movements in their tax base cost and indexation.
The Finance (No.2) Act 2015 reduced the rate of corporation tax from 20% to 19% from 1 April 2017 and the Finance Act 2016 further reduced the 
rate to 17% from 1 April 2020. Both these rate reductions were substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and are therefore included in these accounts. 
The net deferred tax asset has been calculated using the rates at which each temporary difference is expected to reverse. The effect of these rate 
reductions is to reduce the deferred tax asset by a net £0.6m comprising a credit to the income statement of £4.3m, a charge to the group statement 
of comprehensive income of £3.6m and a charge to the group statement of changes in equity of £0.1m.
The adjustment in respect of prior periods’ tax arises from finalising the tax returns for earlier periods and revaluation and rolled over gains on the 
licensed estate.

8 Share-based payment plans
The group operates three types of share-based payment arrangements: a senior management long-term incentive plan (LTIP/growth LTIP), a deferred 
share scheme for other management and a general employee share option plan (SAYE).
The general terms of the LTIP/growth LTIP are detailed in the directors’ remuneration report on pages 61 to 67. All are equity settled. 
The total charge recognised for the period arising from share-based payment transactions including National Insurance contributions is £0.8m (2016: £7.1m). 
A corresponding debit of £0.4m (2016: £6.2m credit) has been recognised in equity.
The fair value of the LTIP/growth LTIP issued since 2015 is considered to be equal to the share price on the date of issue. For the award granted in the 
2017 issue the fair value was 805p (2016: 863p) per share option. Future dividend payments have not been factored into the valuation as participants 
are entitled to dividend payments.
The fair value of previously issued LTIPs was estimated using a Black-Scholes model. 
The fair value of other equity-settled options is estimated using a Black-Scholes model. The fair value of the grants and model inputs used to calculate 
the fair values of grants during the period were as follows:
2017 
SAYE 
2016
SAYE 
Weighted average share price 682p 870p
Exercise price 574p 726p
Expected dividend yield 4.4% 3.9%
Risk-free rate of return 0.6% 0.6%
Volatility 22.5% 21.2%
Expected life (years) 3.3 3.3
Weighted average fair value of grants in the year 107p 140p
Risk-free rate of return is the yield on zero-coupon UK government bonds with the same life as the expected option life. Expected volatility is based on 
historical volatility of the company’s share price which assumes that the past trend in share price movement is indicative of future trends. Expected life 
of options has been taken as the mid-point of the relevant exercise period. This is not necessarily indicative of future exercise patterns. 
No other feature of the equity instruments granted was incorporated into the fair value measurement.

SAYE and LTIP
Options were exercised on a range of dates. The weighted average share price through the period was 748p in 2017 and 856p in 2016.
The rights outstanding at 30 April 2017 under the LTIP had an exercise price of £nil (2016: £nil) and a weighted average remaining contractual life 
of 1.4 years (2016: 1.4 years). 
The outstanding options for the SAYE scheme had an exercise price of between 387p and 726p (2016: 368p and 726p) and the weighted average 
remaining contractual life was 3.2 years (2016: 3.4 years).
9 Pensions
The group maintains three defined contribution schemes, which are open to all new employees, and two (2016: three) defined benefit schemes. 
During the year the assets and liabilities of the Belhaven Pension Scheme transferred into the Greene King Pension Scheme.
In the prior period the group also had a past service liability in relation to post-employment medical benefits previously offered to employees to cover 
any medical costs after employment. This benefit is no longer given to employees.
Defined contribution pension schemes
Member funds for the defined contribution schemes are held and administered by the Friends Life Group. The total cost recognised in operating profit 
for the period was £7.5m (2016: £6.7m). GREENE KING PLC Annual report 2017 98
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
9 Pensions continued
Defined benefit pension schemes and post-employment benefits
The group maintains the following defined benefit schemes which are closed to new entrants and are closed to future accrual. Only administrative costs 
and deficit recovery contributions are incurred going forward. All schemes have had full actuarial valuations in the last three years: Greene King Pension 
Scheme (last valued as at April 2015) and Spirit (Legacy) Pension Scheme (last valued April 2015).
Member funds for the defined benefit schemes are held in separate funds independently of the group’s finances and are administered by pension 
trustees. Pension benefits are related to members’ final salary at the earlier of retirement or closure to future accrual and their length of service.
Since the pension liability is adjusted for the changes to consumer price index, the pension plan is exposed to inflation, interest rate risks and changes 
in the life expectancy for pensioners. As the plan assets include significant investments in quoted equity shares of entities in the manufacturing and 
consumer product sector, the group is also exposed to equity market risk arising in the manufacturing and consumer products sector. The significant 
increase in equities and bonds is due to the acquisition of Spirit. The majority of the bonds relate to UK government and corporate bonds.
The total cost recognised in the income statement was:

Interest on pension scheme assets 26.3  26.5 
Interest on scheme liabilities (28.0) (28.4)
Net interest on net defined liability (1.7) (1.9)
The values of the schemes’ liabilities have been determined by a qualified actuary based on the results of the last actuarial valuation, updated to 30 April 2017 
using the following principal actuarial assumptions:
2017 2016
Discount rate 2.7–2.8% 3.4%
Expected pension payment increases 2.7% 3.4%
Rate of inflation (RPI) 3.3% 3.3%
Rate of inflation (CPI) 2.2% 2.3%
The mortality assumptions imply the following expectations of years of life from age 65:
Man currently aged 40 22.1  24.4 
Woman currently aged 40 23.5  26.5 
Man currently aged 65 23.9  22.2 
Woman currently aged 65 25.5  24.2 
Mortality assumptions are based on standard tables adjusted for scheme experience and with an allowance for future improvement in life expectancy.

There are no income tax consequences attaching to the payment of dividends by Greene King plc to its shareholders.
At 30 April 2017, the group had unused trading losses of £5.3m (2016: £12.6m) and unused capital losses of £809.7m (2016: £815.5m). A deferred tax 
asset of £1.1m (2016: £2.5m) has been recognised in respect of trading losses and a deferred tax asset of £5.5m (2016: £11.7m) in respect of capital losses 
where tax losses are expected to be utilised against future profits and gains. Current legislation allows all of the group’s tax losses to be carried forward 
for an unlimited period.
Factors that may affect future tax charges
The Finance (No.2) Act 2015 reduced the rate of corporation tax from 20% to 19% from 1 April 2017 and the Finance Act 2016 further reduced the 
rate to 17% from 1 April 2020. Both these rate reductions were substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and are therefore included in these 
accounts. The net deferred tax asset has been calculated using the rates at which each temporary difference is expected to reverse. The effect of these 
rate reductions is to reduce the deferred tax asset by a net £0.6m comprising a credit to the income statement of £4.3m, a charge to the group 
statement of comprehensive income of £3.6m and a charge to the group statement of changes in equity of £0.1m.

12 Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share has been calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity holders of £151.7m (2016: £190.9m) by the weighted average 
number of shares in issue during the period of 309.4m (2016: 296.2m). 
Diluted earnings per share has been calculated on a similar basis taking account of 0.8m (2016: 1.6m) dilutive potential shares under option, giving a 
weighted average number of ordinary shares adjusted for the effect of dilution of 310.2m (2016: 297.8m). There were no (2016: nil) anti-dilutive share 
options excluded from the diluted earnings per share calculation. The performance conditions for share options granted over 2.4m (2016: 1.6m) shares 
have not been met in the current financial period and therefore the dilutive effect of the number of shares which would have been issued at the period 
end has not been included in the diluted earnings per share calculation. 
Adjusted earnings per share excludes the effect of exceptional and non-underlying items and is presented to show the underlying performance of the 
group on both a basic and diluted basis.

Other intangibles consists of brand intangibles and operating lease intangibles both recognised as part of the acquisition made during the prior year 
(see note 17). Brand intangibles are amortised over the expected life of the asset (15 years). Operating lease intangibles are amortised on a straight-line 
basis over the length of the lease with a weighted average useful life of 26 years.
All goodwill was recognised as part of business combinations. As from 3 May 2004, the date of transition to IFRS, goodwill is no longer amortised but 
is subject to annual impairment testing.
Goodwill has been allocated to operating segments, the lowest group of cash-generating units in the group at which goodwill is monitored internally, 
based on the extent that the benefits of acquisitions flow to that segment.
The carrying amount of goodwill is allocated as follows:

Goodwill disposed of in the year is the amount of goodwill allocated to parts of operating segments disposed of during the year. The amount disposed 
is calculated based on the relative value of the operation disposed and the portion of the operating segment retained. GREENE KING PLC Annual report 2017 104

Pub Company 8.3 4.3

13.1 13.0 
The recoverable amount of each segment was determined on a value-in-use basis, using cash flow projections based on 1-year budgets approved by the 
board, and in all cases exceeded the carrying amount.
The key assumptions used in the value-in-use calculations are budgeted EBITDA, the pre-tax discount rate and the growth rate used to extrapolate cash 
flows beyond the budgeted period.
Budgeted EBITDA is based on past experience adjusted to take account of the impact of expected changes to sales prices, volumes, business mix and 
margin based on the current estate. 
Cash flows are discounted at 8.65% (2016: 8.65%) which is used as an approximation for the risk-adjusted discount rate of the relevant operating segment. 
As risk factors are considered to be similar in each of the group’s operating segments the same level of discount rate is applied to all. A growth rate of 
1.75% in Pub Company (2016: 1.75%), 2.50% in Pub Partners (2016: 2.50%) and 1.00% in Brewing & Brands (2016: 1.00%) has been used to extrapolate 
cash flows. The growth rate is below the long-term average growth rate for the operating segments and reflects trends in trading performance. 
Sensitivity to changes in assumptions
The calculation is most sensitive to changes in the assumptions used for budgeted cash flow, the pre-tax discount rate and the growth rate. Management 
considers that reasonably possible changes in assumptions would be an increase in discount of 1 percentage point, a reduction in growth rate of 1 percentage 
point or a 10% reduction in budgeted cash flow. As an indication of sensitivity, when applied to the value-in-use calculation in isolation or individually neither 
a 1% reduction in growth rate, a 10% reduction in budgeted cash flow, nor a 1% increase in the discount rate would have resulted in an impairment of 
goodwill in the period.

Valuation
The licensed estate properties were valued by the group’s own professionally qualified chartered surveyors, as at 20 December 2003, on the basis of existing 
use value, in accordance with the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors’ Appraisal and Valuation Standards. A representative sample of properties 
was also valued by external valuers Gerald Eve Chartered Surveyors and Property Consultants, who confirmed that the values were consistent with 
their appraisal. Frozen revaluation has been taken as deemed cost on the transition to IFRS; therefore, no historic cost analysis is provided.
Up to 1999 the brewery and depots were valued at depreciated replacement cost and other properties at open market value. These valuations have 
been retained but they have not been updated. Subsequent additions have been included at cost or, in the case of acquisitions, at fair value.
Charges over assets
Included in land and buildings are properties with a net book value of £1,593.8m (2016: £1,446.2m) and £1,522.4m (2016: £1,519.1m) over which there 
is a first charge in favour of the securitised debt holders of the Greene King secured financing vehicle and the Spirit secured financing vehicle respectively. 
See details in note 23. 
Assets held under finance leases
The group leases various licensed properties, offices and other commercial properties and other assets under finance leases. The leases have various

Impairment of property, plant and equipment
During the period to 30 April 2017 the group has recognised a net impairment loss of £58.6m (2016: £32.2m). This is comprised of an impairment 
charge of £77.7m (2016: £79.5m) and reversal of previously recognised impairment losses of £19.1m (2016: £47.3m). The recoverable amount for assets 
impaired was based on value in use of £13.1m (2016: £25.2m) and fair value less costs of disposal of £64.6m (2016: £47.3m). The recoverable amount 
for assets with impairment reversal was based on value in use of £9.4m (2016: £43.0m) and fair value less costs of disposal of £9.7m (2016: £4.6m).
These are analysed between the group’s principal reporting segments as shown below:

77.7 (19.1) 58.6 79.5 (47.3) 32.2 
The group considers that each of its individual pubs is a cash-generating unit (CGU). Each CGU is reviewed annually for indicators of impairment. 
When indicators of impairment are identified the carrying value of the CGU is compared to its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the 
higher of the CGU’s fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use.
The group estimates value in use using a discounted cash flow model. The key assumptions used are expected cash flow projections for the next year, 
the discount rate applied to those cash flows of 8.65% (2016: 8.65%) and the projected cash flows extrapolated using an average growth rate of 1.75% 
in Pub Company (2016: 1.75%) and 2.50% in Pub Partners (2016: 2.50%) which are below the long-term average growth rate for the operating segments 
and reflect trends in trading performance. As risk factors are considered to be similar in each of the group’s operating segments the same level of 
discount rate is applied to all. 
Cash flow projections relating to individual CGUs have been made based on historic trends adjusted for management’s estimates of medium-term 
trading prospects. 
Estimates of fair value less costs of disposal are based on an external valuation with the latest valuation being performed in 2016/17. The valuation 
considers assumptions such as current and future projected income levels, which take account of the location and quality of the pub. In addition recent 
market transactions in the sector and potential alternative use values have been considered. 
The valuation techniques applied are consistent with the principles in IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement. As they use significant unobservable inputs they 
are classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, as further explained in note 24. GREENE KING PLC Annual report 2017 106
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
14 Property, plant and equipment continued
Impairment of property, plant and equipment continued
The impairment charge recognised in relation to a small number of pubs was driven by changes in the local competitive and trading environment at their 
respective sites and decisions taken to exit some sites where current market values are lower than book values. 
The impairment reversals have been recognised following an improvement in trading performance and an increase in amounts of estimated future cash 
flows for previously impaired sites.
Sensitivity to changes in assumptions
The level of impairment is predominantly dependent upon judgments used in arriving at fair values, future growth rates and the discount rate applied to 
cash flow projections. The net impact on the impairment charge of applying different assumptions to fair values, the growth rates used to calculate cash 
flow projections and in the pre-tax discount rates would be as follows:
Increased net impairment resulting from:
A 10% reduction in fair 
value less cost of disposal
A 1% increase 
in discount rate
A 1% reduction 
in growth rate

Fair value of assets acquired continued
The fair value of properties acquired including operating leases was established following a review of properties that was carried out by external 
qualified surveyors. Properties have been revalued at their existing use value giving consideration to the highest and best use of the properties. 
The values of other current assets and liabilities have been adjusted to amounts to be realised or paid respectively.
Off-market contract liabilities of £312.7m were recognised upon acquisition where contracts are at unfavourable terms relative to current market terms. 
For leases where the current rentals are below market terms, an intangible asset has been recognised (see note 13). For other acquired pubs an off-market 
liability has been calculated as the difference between the present value of future contracted rentals and the present value of future market rate rentals 
(see note 25).
External qualified surveyors were engaged to provide a formal evaluation of current market rentals for the acquired leased pub assets. Rental growth 
rates of 2.0–2.5% were taken from market consensus forecasts for the retail sector and a discount rate of 5% was applied, being the estimated incremental 
borrowing costs of the acquired business, to arrive at the present value of market rentals.
Brand intangibles of £16.1m were recognised to the extent that a format provides a profit benefit versus similar unbranded pubs. Brand intangibles 
are being amortised over a useful economic life of 15 years.

Bank overdrafts
Overdrafts are utilised for the day-to-day management of cash. The group has facilities of £25.0m (2016: £25.0m) available with interest linked to base rate.
Bank loans – unsecured
In the year the group amended and extended its five-year revolving credit facility of £400m, of which £170m (2016: £315m) was drawn down at the 
year end with a carrying value of £168.3m (2016: £315.0m) which included £1.7m (2016: £nil) of fees.
Any amounts drawn down bear interest at a margin above LIBOR and the group is charged a utilisation fee based on the proportion of facility drawn. 
Commitment interest is charged on the undrawn portions. Interest is payable at each renewal date, which vary in maturity. Although any individual draw-downs 
are repayable within 12 months of the balance sheet date, the group expects to renew this funding and immediate renewal is available under the £400m 
facility until October 2021. Final repayment of the total drawn-down balance is due as one payment on the agreement repayment date.
Greene King secured financing vehicle
The group has issued various tranches of bonds in connection with the securitisation of pubs operated by Greene King Retailing Limited. The bonds are 
secured over the properties and their future income streams and were issued by Greene King Finance plc.
In May 2016 the group issued an additional £300m of secured loan notes with a fixed coupon of 4.06% (tranche A6) in connection with the securitisation 
of an additional 89 of the group’s pubs. GREENE KING PLC Annual report 2017 112

The Class A1, A2, A3, A4, A5 and A6 bonds rank pari passu in point of security and as to payment of interest and principal, and have preferential 
interest payment and repayment rights over the Class B bonds. The Class B1 and B2 bonds rank pari passu in point of security, principal repayment 
and interest payment.
The securitisation is governed by various covenants, warranties and events of default, many of which apply to Greene King Retailing Limited, a group 
company. These include covenants regarding the maintenance and disposal of securitised properties and restrictions on its ability to move cash to other 
group companies.
During the year the group settled mark-to-market liabilities in respect of the A5 swap and as a result the swap was re-couponed from a fixed rate 
of 5.26% to a market rate of 1.43%.
Liquidity facility
In 2014 the standby liquidity facility provider to the Greene King secured financing vehicle, the Royal Bank of Scotland, had its short-term credit rating 
downgraded below the minimum prescribed in the facility agreement and as such the group exercised its entitlement to draw the full amount of the 
facility and hold it in a designated bank account. The corresponding balance of £157.5m (2016: £157.5m) held in this bank account is included within cash 
and cash equivalents. The amounts drawn down can only be used for the purpose of meeting the securitisation’s debt service obligations should there 
ever be insufficient funds available from operations to meet such payments. As such these amounts are considered to be restricted cash.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
24 Financial instruments
The primary treasury objectives of the group are to identify and manage the financial risks that arise in relation to underlying business needs, and 
provide secure and competitively priced funding for the activities of the group. If appropriate, the group uses financial instruments and derivatives 
to manage these risks.
The principal financial instruments held for the purpose of raising finance for operations are bank loans and overdraft, secured bonds, cash and short-term 
deposits. Other financial instruments arise directly from the operations of the group, such as trade and other receivables, trade payables and trade loans.
Derivative financial instruments, principally interest rate swaps, are used to manage the interest rate risks related to the group’s operations and financing 
sources. No speculative trading in derivative financial instruments is undertaken.
The main risks from the group’s financial instruments are interest rate risk, liquidity risk and credit risk. The policy for managing each of these risks is set 
out below.
Interest rate risk
Exposure to changes in interest rates on the group’s borrowings is reviewed with regard to the maturity profile and cash flows of the underlying debt. 
The group uses a mixture of fixed and floating interest rate debt with exposure to market interest rate fluctuations primarily arising from the floating 
rate instruments. The group’s aim is that no less than 95% of the overall interest exposure should be at a fixed rate. The group enters into interest rate 
swaps to manage the exposure. Certain swaps are designated as cash flow hedges at the date of contract included within the accounts, and tested for 
effectiveness every 6 months.
In accordance with IFRS 7, the group has undertaken sensitivity analysis on its financial instruments which are affected by changes in interest rates. 
This analysis has been prepared on the basis of a constant amount of net debt, a constant ratio of fixed to floating interest rates, and on the basis of the 
hedging instruments in place at 30 April 2017 and 1 May 2016. The analysis relates only to balances at these dates and is not representative of the year 
as a whole. The following assumptions were made:
 – Balance sheet sensitivity to interest rates applies only to derivative financial instruments, as the carrying value of debt and deposits does not change 
as interest rates move.
 – Gains and losses are recognised within other comprehensive income or the income statement in line with the accounting policies of the group.
 – Cash flow hedges were assumed to be effective or ineffective on the same basis as those as at the year end. 
Based on the group’s net position at the year end, a 1% increase or decrease in interest rates would change the group’s profit before tax by 
approximately £47.8m (2016: £50.6m) and the group’s OCI by £65.4m (2016: £82.9m). An increase in interest rates would increase the group’s profit. 
Whilst cash flow interest rate risk is largely eliminated, the use of fixed rate borrowings and derivative financial instruments exposes the group to fair 
value interest rate risk such that the group would not significantly benefit from falls in interest rates and would be exposed to unplanned costs, such 
as break costs, should debt or derivative financial instruments be restructured or repaid early.
The percentage of net debt that was fixed as at the year end was 95.8% (2016: 96.1%), in line with the group’s target of fixing at least 95% of all net debt.
Liquidity risk
The group mitigates liquidity risk by managing cash generated by its operations combined with bank borrowings and long-term debt. The group’s 
objective is to maintain a balance between the continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of overdrafts and bank loans. The group also 
monitors the maturity of financial liabilities to avoid the risk of a shortage of funds.
The standard payment terms that the group has with its suppliers is 60 days following month end (2016: 60 days following month end).
Excess cash used in managing liquidity is placed on interest-bearing deposit with maturities fixed at no more than 1 month. Short-term flexibility 
is achieved through the use of short-term borrowing on the money markets under the group’s revolving credit facility.
The table below summarises the maturity profile of the group’s financial liabilities at 30 April 2017 and 1 May 2016 based on contractual undiscounted 
payments including interest.

Credit risk
Financial assets include trade loans, cash and cash equivalents and trade and other receivables. Credit risk is the risk of default by the counterparty 
to discharge their obligation and the maximum exposure of the group is the carrying amount of these instruments. The credit risk on cash and cash 
equivalents is limited by investment of surplus funds with banks and financial institutions with high credit ratings assigned by international credit agencies.
The policy for third party trading is that all customers who wish to trade on credit terms are subject to regular credit verification procedures. 
Receivable balances are also monitored on an ongoing basis and provided against where deemed necessary to limit the exposure to bad debts 
to a non-significant level.
There is no significant collateral held and there are no significant concentrations of credit risk within the group.
Financial instruments qualifying for hedge accounting
(i) Greene King secured financing vehicle
At 30 April 2017 the group held 4 (2016: 4) interest rate swap contracts for a nominal value of £500.7m (2016: £530.0m), which are designated cash 
flow hedges against £500.7m (2016: £530.0m) of variable rate bonds. These swaps are hedges of the A1, A3, A5 and B2 tranches, receiving a variable 
rate of interest based on LIBOR and paying a fixed rate of 5.155% on the A1 tranche, 4.837% on the A3 tranche, 1.426% on the A5 tranche and 4.837% 
on the B2 tranche. The weighted average fixed rate of the swaps was 3.3% (2016: 5.1%).
In addition, the group holds 1 (2016: 1) forward starting swap commencing when the B1 notes switch from fixed rate interest to floating rate in March 2020. 
This swap will receive a variable rate of interest based on LIBOR and pay a fixed rate of 5.155%.
The 5 interest rate swaps are held on the balance sheet at fair value of £146.6m (2016: £214.6m). The contract maturity dates range from September 2021 
to March 2036. Retrospective quantitative hedge effectiveness testing is performed and the bonds and related interest rate swaps have the same critical 
terms excluding credit risk.
Changes in cash flow hedge fair values are recognised in the hedging reserve to the extent that the hedges are effective. The interest rate swaps have 
been assessed as highly effective during the period and are expected to remain highly effective over their remaining contract lives. The ineffectiveness 
amounting to £0.2m loss (2016: £0.3m gain) has been recognised within finance costs/income.
(ii) Unsecured bank loans
At 30 April 2017 the group held no interest rate swap contracts for the unsecured bank loans. At 1 May 2016 the group held 2 interest rate swap 
contracts for a nominal value of £100m, designated as a hedge of the cash flow interest rate risk of the £315m drawn down from the revolving credit 
facility in the year. The interest rate swaps were held on the balance sheet as a fair value liability of £34.6m. The cash flows occurred quarterly based 
on a variable rate of interest based on LIBOR.
In the year, the group settled interest rate swap liabilities in respect of 2 swaps, one designated a hedge of the A5 secured bond and the other designated 
a hedge of the group’s unsecured bank loan. A loss of £11.8m was recycled from the hedging reserve to the income statement in respect of these swaps 
and the remaining losses recognised in the hedging reserve will be recycled over the period over which the hedged forecast cash flows affect profit or 
loss. The swap designated a hedge of the A5 bond was amended to reflect market terms and remained in place at the year end and the swap designated 
a hedge of the unsecured bank loan was cancelled.
In addition a swap held as a hedge of the unsecured bank loans matured in the year.
Financial instruments not qualifying for hedge accounting
At 30 April 2017 the group held 3 (2016: 3) interest rate swap contracts for a nominal value of £349.7m (2016: £376m). The swaps, which do not qualify 
for hedge accounting are in respect of the A1, A2, A3, A6 and A7 tranches of Spirit bonds, receive a variable rate of interest based on LIBOR and pay 
a fixed rate of 6.681% on class A1, A2 and A6 and 4.529% on class A3 and A7. The weighted average fixed rate of the swaps was 6.3% (2016: 6.2%).
The fixed rate payable on the interest rate swaps associated with the A1, A2 and A6 bonds increases to 6.791% from September 2018.
In addition, the group holds 2 (2016: 2) forward starting swap contracts commencing when the class A4 and A5 notes switch from fixed rate interest to floating 
rate in December 2018 and December 2028, respectively. The swaps will receive a variable rate of interest based on LIBOR and pay a fixed rate of 4.555%.
Upon the acquisition of Spirit Pub Company, the swaps were deemed ineffective hedges and therefore do not qualify for hedge accounting, with 
movements in their fair value being recognised in the income statement. The interest rate swaps are held on the balance sheet as a fair value liability 
of £198.1m (2016: £191.7m). The cash flows occurred quarterly based on a variable rate of interest based on LIBOR.
The fair value movement in the year splits into cash payments made of £21.0m (2016: £21.7m) recognised in pre-exceptional finance costs net 
of amortisation of fair value on acquisition of £13.9m (2016: £12.3m).  GREENE KING PLC Annual report 2017 116

Financial instruments not qualifying for hedge accounting continued
These amounts are included within pre-exceptional profits as they can be deemed to be the market rate of the acquired swaps. In the year, there was a 
partial break in the swaps resulting in a cash payment of £3.2m. The remainder of the fair value movement is recognised as a charge in exceptional finance 
costs amounting to £23.6m (2016: £39.1m) as it is considered to be more volatile and its inclusion in pre-exceptional profit would hinder year-on-year 
comparability of performance. 
Where the nominal value of the derivative exceeds that of the related secured note (for example, due to early repayment of floating rate notes) the 
group will seek to eliminate the over-hedging where this is financially practicable. At 30 April 2017, there are £2.9m (2016: £5.7m) of interest swaps 
outstanding on cancelled floating rate notes which relate to the Spirit secured debt. 
Fair values
Set out in the table below is a comparison of carrying amounts and fair values of all of the group’s financial instruments.
The fair values of the financial assets and liabilities are included at the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction 
between willing parties, other than in a forced liquidation or sale. The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair values:
 – Cash and cash equivalents (comprising cash at bank and in hand and short-term deposits) – approximates to the carrying amount stated in the 
accounts.
 – Trade receivables – approximates to the carrying amount because of the short maturity of these instruments.
 – Financial assets – these are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method and fair value is deemed to be the same as this.
 – Overdrafts – approximates to the carrying amount because of the short maturity of these instruments.
 – Long-term loans – based on quoted market prices in the case of the securitised debt; approximates to the carrying amount in the case of the floating 
rate bank loans and other variable rate borrowings.
 – Interest rate swaps – calculated by discounting all future cash flows by the market yield curve at the balance sheet date and adjusting for, where 
appropriate, the group’s and counterparty credit risk. The changes in credit risk had no material effect on the hedge effectiveness assessment for 
derivatives designated in hedge relationships.
 – Trade payables and accruals – approximates to the carrying amount because of the short maturity of these instruments.
 – Finance lease obligations and off-market contract liabilities (excludes off-market lease liability) – estimated by discounting future cash flows using rates 
currently available for debt on similar terms, credit risk and remaining maturities.

Hierarchical classification of financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value
IFRS 13 requires that the classification of financial instruments at fair value be determined by reference to the source of inputs used to derive fair value. 
The classification uses the following three-level hierarchy:
Level 1 – unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2 – other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly or indirectly.
Level 3 – techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable market data.
During the periods ending 30 April 2017 and 1 May 2016 there were no transfers between levels 1, 2, or 3 fair value measurements.
Capital risk management
The group aims to maximise shareholder value by maintaining a strong credit rating and a core level of debt which optimises the weighted average cost 
of capital (WACC) and shareholder value.
A number of mechanisms are used to manage net debt and equity levels (together referred to as capital) as disclosed on the balance sheet, as 
appropriate in light of economic and trading conditions. To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the group may adjust the dividend payment to 
shareholders, return capital to shareholders or issue new shares. No changes were made to the objectives, policies or processes during the period.
The group monitors capital using several measures including fixed charge cover, the ratio of net debt to EBITDA and free cash flow debt service 
coverage. All covenants in relation to the securitisation vehicles and bank loans have been fully complied with. The board’s dividend policy is to maintain 
a minimum dividend cover of 2 times adjusted basic earnings per share.

Off-market contract liabilities are recognised where contracts are at unfavourable terms relative to current market terms on acquisition. For acquired 
leases where the current rentals are below market terms, an operating lease intangible asset has been recognised (see note 13). For other acquired pubs 
an off-market liability has been calculated as the difference between the present value of future contracted rentals and the present value of future market 
rate rentals. The liability unwinds against the rental expense so that the income statement charge reflects current market terms over an average period 
of 18 years (2016: 19 years). The remainder of the balance held relates to an unfavourable guarantee contract. 
Property leases
The provision for property leases has been set up to cover operating costs of vacant or loss-making premises as well as dilapidation requirements. 
Payments are expected to be ongoing on these properties for an average of 15 years (2016: 15 years). GREENE KING PLC Annual report 2017 118

Indirect tax provisions
During a previous period the Greene King group received VAT refunds of £7.0m and prior to its acquisition the Spirit Pub Company group received 
VAT refunds of £17.9m from HMRC in respect of gaming machines following a ruling involving The Rank Group plc (Rank) that the application of 
VAT contravened the EU’s principle of fiscal neutrality. HMRC successfully appealed the decision in October 2013 and the Greene King group was 
therefore required to repay the VAT refund of £7.0m and associated interest of £1.7m. However, HMRC did not seek to recover the VAT refunded 
to the Spirit Pub Company of £17.9m and associated interest of £6.1m because it had accepted a guarantee that it would only repay this VAT if Rank’s 
litigation is finally determined in HMRC’s favour. Rank’s latest appeal was rejected by the Supreme Court in July 2015 and the group is currently 
awaiting the outcome of related litigation.
In addition the group has made a provision of £1.5m for stamp duty land tax (SDLT) that may arise as a consequence of settling the only other historical 
tax position with HMRC, an internal property arrangement implemented in 2012. Discussions with HMRC are at a relatively early stage and disclosing 
the range of possible outcomes may be prejudicial to the group’s position which it will continue to defend robustly.

Share premium account
Share premium represents the excess of proceeds received over the nominal value of new shares issued.
Merger reserve
The merger reserve represents capital contributions received and amounts recognised on the acquisition of Spirit Pub Company, being the difference 
between the value of the consideration and the nominal value of the shares issued as consideration.
Capital redemption reserve
Capital redemption reserve arose from the purchase and cancellation of own share capital, and represents the nominal amount of the share capital cancelled.
Hedging reserve
Hedging reserve adjustments arise from the movement in fair value of the group’s derivative instruments used as an effective hedge, in line with 
the accounting policy disclosed in note 1. Amounts recycled to income are included within finance costs in the income statement.
Own shares
Own shares relate to shares held in treasury, held by the employee benefit trust or purchased to fulfil awards made under the deferred share bonus scheme. 
At 30 April 2017 nil shares (2016: nil) were held in treasury, 0.1m shares (2016: 0.04m) were held by the employee benefit trust and nil (2016: nil) 
were held to fulfil awards under the deferred share bonus scheme. The market value at 30 April 2017 of the treasury shares was £nil (2016: £nil), of the 
shares held by the employee benefit trust was £0.2m (2016: £0.3m) and of the shares held for the deferred share bonus scheme was £nil (2016: £nil). 
The employee benefit trust is independently managed and has purchased shares in order to satisfy outstanding employee share options and potential 
awards under the long-term incentive plan.
At the year end nil (2016: nil) treasury shares and nil (2016: nil) shares in the employee benefit trust were allocated to meet awards under the long-term 
incentive plan.
A transfer of £1.6m (2016: £4.7m) from own shares to retained earnings has been made to reflect transfers to satisfy awards under the long-term 
incentive plan and options exercised under the executive share option plan and reflects the weighted average cost of own shares.
During the period nil (2016: nil) shares were repurchased at a cost of £nil (2016: £nil) to fulfil awards made under the deferred share bonus scheme 
with nil (2016: nil) shares transferred to individuals to satisfy awards. The employee benefit trust purchased 0.8m shares (2016: nil) at a cost of £1.6m 
(2016: £nil) and 0.74m (2016: 0.57m) shares were transferred to satisfy awards under the long-term incentive plan.
Goodwill
The cumulative amount of goodwill written off to retained earnings in respect of acquisitions made prior to May 1998 amounts to £89.7m.

34 Accounting policies
Basis of accounting and presentation
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable UK accounting standards.
The company meets the definition of a qualifying entity under FRS 100 Application of Financial Reporting Requirements as issued by the Financial 
Reporting Council (FRC). The financial statements have therefore been prepared in accordance with FRS 101.
The company has taken advantage of the following disclosure exemptions under FRS 101:
 – the requirements of IAS 7 Statement of Cash Flows;
 – the requirements of IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors; to disclose IFRSs issued but not effective;
 – the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-based Payments;
 – the requirements of IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures;
 – the requirements of IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurements;
 – the requirements of IAS 24 Related Party Disclosures, to present key management personnel compensation and intragroup transactions including 
wholly owned subsidiaries;
 – the requirements of IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements, to present certain comparative information and capital management disclosures; and
 – the requirements of IFRS 1 to present an opening statement of financial position when adopting FRS 101 for the first time.
The basis for all of the above exemptions is because equivalent disclosures are included in the consolidated financial statements of the group in which 
the entity is consolidated.
Greene King plc is a public company limited by shares incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales. The company’s shares are listed on the London 
Stock Exchange.
Investments
Investments in subsidiaries are recorded at cost less impairment and held as fixed assets on the balance sheet. The carrying value of investments is 
reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. On transition to FRS 101, the 
previous GAAP carrying amount at the date of transition was regarded as deemed cost.
Taxation
Corporation tax payable is provided on taxable profits using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance 
sheet date.
Financial instruments
Financial instruments are recognised when the company becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument and are derecognised when 
the company no longer controls the contractual rights that comprise the financial instrument, normally through sale or when all cash flows attributable 
to the instrument are passed to an independent third party.
Borrowings
All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at fair value of the consideration received, net of issue costs. After initial recognition, interest-bearing 
loans and borrowings are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting
The company uses interest rate swaps to hedge its exposure to interest rate fluctuations on its variable rate borrowings.
Interest rate swaps are initially measured at fair value, if any, and carried on the balance sheet as an asset or liability. Subsequent measurement is at fair 
value determined by reference to market values for similar instruments. If a derivative does not qualify for hedge accounting the gain or loss arising on 
the movement in fair value is recognised in the profit and loss account.
Hedge accounting
To qualify for hedge accounting the hedge relationship must be designated and documented at inception. Documentation must include the company’s 
risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge and formal allocation to the item or transaction being hedged. The company also 
documents how it will assess the effectiveness of the hedge and carries out assessments on a regular basis to determine whether it has been, 
and is likely to continue to be, highly effective.
Hedges can be classified as either fair value (hedging exposure to changes in fair value of an asset or liability), or cash flow (hedging the variability in cash 
flows attributable to an asset, liability or forecast transaction). The company uses its interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges.
For these cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised directly in other comprehensive income, 
while the ineffective portion is recognised in the income statement. Amounts taken to equity are transferred to the profit and loss account when the 
hedged transaction affects the income statement.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting, amounts previously recognised 
in equity are held there until the previously hedged transaction affects profit or loss. If the hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, 
the cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is immediately transferred to the income statement. GREENE KING PLC Annual report 2017 124
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
34 Accounting policies continued
Own shares
Own shares consist of treasury shares and shares held within an employee benefit trust. The company has an employee benefit trust for the granting 
of shares to applicable employees. 
Own shares are recognised at cost as a deduction from equity shareholders’ funds. Subsequent consideration received for the sale of such shares is also 
recognised in equity, with any difference between the sale proceeds and the original cost being taken to retained earnings. No gain or loss is recognised 
in the performance statements on transactions in treasury shares.
Share-based payments
Certain employees and directors receive equity-settled remuneration, whereby they render services in exchange for shares or rights over shares. 
The fair value of the shares and options granted is measured using a Black-Scholes model, at the date at which they were granted. No account is taken 
in the fair value calculation of any vesting conditions (service and performance), other than market conditions (performance linked to the price of the 
shares of the company). Any other conditions that are required to be met in order for an employee to become fully entitled to an award are considered 
non-vesting conditions. Like market performance conditions, non-vesting conditions are taken into account in determining the grant date fair value. The 
fair value of shares and options granted is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity spread over the period in which 
the vesting conditions are fulfilled ending on the relevant vesting date. The cumulative amount recognised as an expense reflects the extent to which the 
vesting period has expired, adjusted for the estimated number of shares and options that are ultimately expected to vest. The periodic charge or credit 
is the movement in the cumulative position from beginning to end of that period.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest because non-market performance and/or service conditions have not been met. Where 
awards include a market or non-vesting condition, the transactions are treated as vested irrespective of whether the market or non-vesting condition is 
satisfied, provided that all other performance and/or service conditions are satisfied.
Significant accounting judgments and estimates
The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions in the application of accounting policies 
that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expense. The company bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and 
other factors deemed reasonable under the circumstances, including any expectations of future events. Actual results may differ from these estimates. 
No estimates or judgments were considered to be significant.
35 Profit for the period
No income statement is presented for the company as permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006. The profit after tax for the period is 
£70.2m (2016: £22.7m).
36 Auditor’s remuneration
Auditor’s remuneration in respect of the company audit was £16,500 (2016: £16,500). The figures for auditor’s remuneration for the company required 
by regulation 5(1)(b) of the Companies Regulations 2008 are not presented here as the group accounts comply with this regulation on a consolidated basis.
37 Directors’ remuneration and employee costs
Details of directors’ remuneration are contained in the directors’ remuneration report on pages 61 to 67. The company has no employees other than 
directors and the directors are not remunerated through this company. Details of share options issued by the company are given in note 8.

Share premium account
Share premium represents the excess of proceeds received over the nominal value of new shares issued.
Merger reserve
The merger reserve represents capital contributions received and amounts recognised on the acquisition of Spirit Pub Company Limited being the difference 
between the value of the consideration and the nominal value of the shares issued as consideration.
Other reserve
The other reserve consists of a £3.3m (2016: £3.3m) capital redemption reserve arising from the purchase of own share capital and £90.6m (2016: £90.6m) 
arising from the transfer of revalued assets to other group companies and will only be realised when the related assets are disposed of by the group.
Hedging reserve
Hedging reserve adjustments arise from the movement in fair value of the company’s derivative instruments used as an effective hedge, in line with the 
accounting policy disclosed in note 34.
Own shares
Own shares relate to shares held in treasury and by the employee benefit trust. Movement in own shares is described in note 27.
43 Contingent liabilities
The company has provided a guarantee to the Greene King Pension Scheme in respect of the payment obligations to the scheme of its subsidiary

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The performance of the group is assessed using a number of alternative performance measures (APMs). 
The group’s results are presented both before and after exceptional and non-underlying items. Adjusted profitability measures are presented excluding 
exceptional and non-underlying items as we believe this provides both management and investors with useful additional information about the group’s 
performance and aids a more effective comparison of the group’s trading performance from 1 period to the next and with similar businesses. Adjusted 
profitability measures are reconciled to unadjusted IFRS results on the face of the income statement with details of exceptional and non-underlying 
items provided in note 5. 
In addition, the group’s results are described using certain other measures that are not defined under IFRS and are therefore considered to be APMs.
