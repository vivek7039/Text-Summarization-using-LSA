 Symphony is a world leader in controlled-life 
plastic, and supplies masterbatches and finished 
plastic products. Our d
2
w oxo-biodegradable 
(OBP) controlled-life masterbatch was the first 
technology of this type to be awarded an  
Eco-Label, distinguishing it from all similar 
products on the market.
 Plastic waste is a global problem which is now 
dominating the media and concentrating the 
minds of legislators, companies, NGOs and 
scientists around the world. Plastic is vital for 
our food chain because foods are safer and 
stay fresher when protected in plastic, and this 
reduces food waste. This is really significant, as 
one third of the food produced each year  
is wasted.  
 Opponents of plastic have yet to find a viable 
alternative which goes anywhere near performing 
as well as plastic for most applications, and have 
themselves raised concerns about food safety 
and food waste.  
 
d
2
w is fully consistent with the principles of 
“Reduce”, “Re-use” and “Recycle”. It is also the 
best technology available for our customers,  
for consumers and for the protection of  
the environment.
 
Symphony has also developed a range of plastic 
technologies under the d
2
p (designed to protect) 
brand, offering extra protection from bacteria, 
insects, fungi, algae, odour, fouling, and fire. In 
addition to these, we have recently developed 
a corrosion inhibitor and a range of products 
specifically designed for food packaging. These 
include an oxygen absorber, ethylene adsorber, 
odour-adsorber and a release-agent to prevent 
food sticking to the inside of packaging.  
 
Finally, our d
2
t tag and trace technologies 
give our customers the ability to check the 
authenticity of products of all kinds, helping  
to protect brand owners from counterfeits  
and fraud.
 
Our products are marketed through a network  
of distributors in nearly 100 countries worldwide.
Symphony develops 
and produces a wide 
range of technologies, 
to make plastic smarter.  FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS:

The addition of d
2
w turns ordinary polymer (at the end of its useful life and  
in the presence of oxygen) into a material which is biodegradable in the  
open environment. 
d
2
w is a masterbatch that is added to polymer during manufacture. It offers 
seamless integration into the manufacturing process and is added at only  
1%, which means little or no extra cost.
Plastic products incorporating d
2
w:
   •  can be made in existing plastic factories, with their existing workforce  
and machinery.
   •  meet all the relevant international standards, with proven performance in 
terms of degradation, biodegradation and eco-toxicity - i.e. British Standard 
8472, ASTM D6954, UAE 5009:2009, AFNOR AC T51-808 and  
SASO Standards.
   •  have (during their useful life) the same characteristics as conventional polymer  
i.e. it is waterproof, lightweight, strong and flexible.
   • are suitable for food contact according to FDA and EU food  
 contact regulations
   • can be recycled with conventional polymer and can be made from recyclate.
Products made with d
2
w also have the crucial advantage in that if they escape 
collection and end up in the open environment as litter, they will degrade and 
biodegrade until there is nothing left, in the same way as nature’s waste, only 
quicker and leaving nothing behind. No Toxic residues and No Microplastics
Several countries in Africa, Asia and the Middle East have already legislated  
to require everyday plastic items to be made with oxo-biodegradable 
technology, because it works.

DELIVERING 
TECHNOLOGY  
& PRODUCTS 
I am very pleased to report a 249.6% 
increase in profit before tax to 
£430,000 (2016: £123,000) together 
with £1.03 million cash generated from 
operations (2016: cash consumed 
£0.34 million). With the business 
now in a net cash position and with 
its technologies gaining increasing 
commercial traction, together with 
elevated political and media coverage, 
the Group has never been so well 
positioned in its key markets.
Symphony laboratory
Our d
2
w oxo-biodegradable plastic technology fits in 
perfectly with many governments’ core principles of the 
3 Rs, “reduce, re-use, recycle”. However, unlike ordinary 
plastics, a plastic upgraded with d
2
w technology does 
not cause the accumulation of microplastics in the 
environment, as it converts much more rapidly into 
biodegradable materials. 
In addition to making conventional plastic more 
environmentally friendly, d
2
w can be used in some  
bio-based plastics which would not otherwise degrade 
in the open environment. This flexibility makes d
2
w a 
vital insurance policy for many types of plastics, some  
of which inevitably end up in the open environment. 
Microplastics are the main concern today, and they  
are caused by ordinary plastics fragmenting on land 
and in the oceans. They need to be urgently upgraded 
with d
2
w technology, and this is already being done 
in the Middle East, Africa and Asia – most recently in 
Saudi Arabia. Symphony Environmental Technologies plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017  |  www.symphonyenvironmental.com 05
Over the years we have established a strong distribution 
network with 74 distributors worldwide. In the year 
ahead one of the Company’s objectives will be to 
increase its lobbying and marketing to make sure 
that everyone understands the huge benefits that 
Symphony’s d
2
w and d
2
p technologies can bring to 
the environment and human health. Our strategy, as 
previously reported, was to expand the product range 
with synergistic technologies which can be offered to 
the same customer base, and I am pleased to report 
that this is progressing well.
Revenues for the year increased by 21.6% to £8.27 
million (2016: £6.80 million), with gross profits increasing 
by 17.8% to £4.01 million (2016: £3.41 million). The 
improved revenue was due to increased sales of d
2
w 
oxo-biodegradable plastic additives in several markets. 
These markets include South America and the Far East, 
but momentum has been most apparent in the Middle 
East, and in particular Saudi Arabia, where legislation 
requires the use of oxo-biodegradable technology for 
everyday plastic items made in or imported into the 
country. Enforcement of the legislation commenced 
during 2017.
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS BUSINESS REVIEW CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
The overall results highlight the operational gearing of 
the Group. Additionally, the Group effectively removed 
borrowings from the balance sheet as at year-end which 
was further enhanced by the completion of a capital-
reduction during the second half of the year. This, 
along with the profit generated in the year, resulted in 
a consolidated retained-earnings position of £67,000 
(2016: deficit £3.97 million). 
I would like to thank the distributors, staff and Board  
for all their hard and effective work in 2017, and we  
look forward with confidence.

Michael Laurier
Symphony Environmental Technologies plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017  |  www.symphonyenvironmental.com 06
Although Europe is not currently an important market 
for d
2
w, we note that the EU Commission have taken an 
interest in oxo-biodegradable plastic and have asked the 
European Chemicals Agency (“ECHA”) to consider its 
environmental credentials. The Commission do not as 
yet understand that the purpose of oxo-biodegradable 
technology is not to produce microplastics but to ensure 
that if plastic does fragment in the open environment 
it will convert much more quickly into biodegradable 
materials. We therefore welcome the reference to 
ECHA. Symphony and the Oxo-biodegradable Plastics 
Association will be assisting ECHA with all necessary 
technical information, but we do not expect any 
conclusions for some time. 
The EU has been slow to realise the importance of this 
issue, as countries in the Middle East and other parts 
of the world have already legislated to require the use 
of oxo-biodegradable technology. These countries 
want plastic fragments to be dealt with quickly and 
automatically, and not to be left as a problem for  
future generations. 
In Saudi Arabia, the Saudi Standards, Metrology and 
Quality Organisation (“SASO”) started enforcing 
legislation requiring the use of oxo-biodegradable 
plastic for a range of locally manufactured and imported 
plastic products including carrier bags, packaging  
films and agricultural films. Symphony was the first 
company to be awarded the SASO Quality Mark for 
its d
2
w oxo-biodegradable additives and to achieve 
authorised-supplier status for the Saudi Arabian market.
This year saw the completion of two R&D projects for 
d
2
p; being anti-microbial household gloves and plastic 
water pipes. The anti-microbial gloves were launched 
into Wilko in the UK, and into several Italian retail outlets. 
An initial order was also received from the Middle East. 
As previously reported, we have many customer-led  
d
2
p development projects, with applications including 
anti-microbials, insecticide, flame retardant, odour  
and moisture adsorbers, rodent repellents and  
corrosion inhibitors.
Trading results
Group revenues increased by 21.6% to £8.27 million 
from £6.80 million in 2016. Gross profit margins slightly 
decreased to 48.5% from 50.1% in 2016. As a result, the 
contribution from gross profit increased by 17.8% to 
£4.01 million from £3.41 million in 2016. The majority of 
our revenues derive from d
2
w and are earned mainly 
outside of the EU and the United States.
Costs increased by 6.9% to £3.30 million (2016: 
£3.10 million) due mainly to increased investment in 
R&D, lobbying and marketing, with associated travel 
expenditure into our key operating markets. The  
Group expensed R&D costs of £625,000 in 2017  
(2016: £514,000).
EBITDA before R&D is a key metric for the Board, and it 
increased by 57.9% to £1.20 million (2016: £0.76 million), 
showing the underlying profitability of the business 
as it has moved from a net debt position to a net cash 
position, and its new technologies continue to  
be commercialised.
EXPANDING 
OUR PRODUCT 
OFFERING
I am pleased to report that the 
year under review saw a continued 
improvement in the Group’s 
financial performance. Our strategy 
throughout the year was to engage 
with governments, NGOs and media 
globally, explaining to them the 
benefits of using our growing range 
of technologies, and in particular, d
2
w 
oxo-biodegradable plastic, which 
can help to resolve the problem of 
persistent plastic pollution. Symphony Environmental Technologies plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017  |  www.symphonyenvironmental.com 07
During the second half of the year the Company 
completed a capital reduction, which eliminated £3.61 
million of share premium by transferring this to the 
credit of retained earnings. Together with the results for 
the year, the Group’s retained earnings were £67,000 
(2016: deficit £3.97 million) with Company retained 
earnings of £1.13 million (2016: deficit £2.71 million).
The Board has considered the possible effects of Brexit 
on the business and due to its global operations, is 
comfortable that this should not significantly affect  
the Group’s future prospects. 
Outlook
We expect to see an improving business environment 
where more countries legislate in favour of our type of 
technology, and with better enforcement in countries 
where legislation has already been passed.
The desire to find a solution to the plastics problem, and 
in particular microplastics, has reached tipping point. Our 
technology is proven, viable and does not significantly 
increase cost or disrupt the supply chain. This should 
make our entry into new markets and with new 
customers much easier than for disruptive technologies. 
Our strategy for 2018 is to drive sales through an 
increased level of communications on a global scale, 
increasing our social media presence, together with 
media campaigns, lobbying and direct selling. We will 
announce these to the market at the relevant times.
We will continue with our R&D programme and maintain 
progress in commercialising our technologies including, 
at the earliest opportunity, our d
2
p projects, some of 
which require regulatory clearances, and some require 
the completion of customer-led product trials.
I would also like to thank all the staff at Symphony and 
our extended family of distributors for their hard and 
effective work and their continued commitment to the 
Symphony vision of being world leaders in “making 
plastic smarter” technologies and products.
Michael Laurier 
Chief Executive Officer 
EBITDA before R&D is calculated as follows:
Due to the operational gearing of the Group, operating 
profit increased by 229.7% to £0.48 million from £0.15 
million in 2016. This resulted in a 249.6% increase in profit 
before tax of £0.43 million (2016: profit £0.12 million). 
The Group therefore reports a profit after tax for 2017 
of £0.43 million (2016: profit £0.17 million) with basic 
earnings per share of 0.28 pence (2016: 0.11 pence). 
The Group’s primary selling-currency is the US 
Dollar and therefore a strong dollar against sterling 
is beneficial for the Group. The Group self-hedges by 
purchasing goods in US Dollars, and utilises forward 
rate agreements to minimise exchange risk. As at 31 
December 2017, the Group had a net balance of US 
Dollar assets totalling $1.08 million (2016: $0.91 million). 
Balance sheet and cash flow
The Group had net cash in the bank of £0.63 million 
at the year-end (2016: net debt of £0.37 million) and 
had generated cash of £1.03 million from operations 
(2016: cash used £0.34 million). This was achieved by 
improving profits as detailed above, together with 
improved payment terms in one of its main markets. 
There was a minimal £2,000 hire purchase debt as at 
the year-end compared to £0.81 million of interest-
bearing debt at the end of 2016. The Group also has, 
if required, a £1.5 million trade finance facility and a 
further £0.50 million working capital facility with HSBC 
Bank. The Board do not envisage any working capital 
constraints as sales increase. 
Revenue increased  
by 21.6% to £8.27 million

In January of 2017 Symphony 
entered the household glove market 
with the launch of the UK’s first d
2
p 
antimicrobial household gloves. This 
innovative product, sold under the 
Protector Health and Hygiene brand, 
had been in development for two 
years prior to the launch in Wilko 
Stores nationwide.
Public awareness and concern about 
harmful bacteria and resistance 
to antibiotics, has generated an 
increase in antimicrobial household 
products, with further sales of 
antimicrobial household gloves 
made with d
2
p technology in Italy, 
Israel and the Middle East. There 
are also more products for 2018, 
including toothbrushes, water 
bottles, cling film and food bags.
Staying with d
2
p – Dadex Eternit 
Ltd in Pakistan, who are one of the 
world leading producers of plastic 
pipes, signed an exclusive five-year 
agreement with Business Dynamics, 
Symphony’s distributor in Pakistan, 
to produce a range of plastic 
pipes made with d
2
p antimicrobial 
technology - ensuring that the pipes 
will be free from the accumulation of 
harmful bacteria and fungi. 
The d
2
p suite of additives increased 
this year, and now includes a 
corrosion inhibitor and a range of 
products specifically designed for 
food packaging which includes an 
oxygen absorber, ethylene adsorber 
and a release agent to prevent food 
sticking to the inside of the plastic. 
In April 2017, the Saudi government 
announced changes to legislation, 
which require manufacturers and 
importers to prove that their plastic 
products are oxo-biodegradable. 
They must use masterbatches which 
have been approved by SASO 
(Saudi Standards, Metrology and 
Quality Organisation). 
Symphony Environmental Ltd were 
the first to be granted a licence by 
SASO under the new regulations 
and we are now working with 
many companies in Saudi Arabia 
and abroad to make sure that their 
products comply with the new rules, 
which cover an extensive list of 
short-life plastic products.
Around the world, the number of 
products benefitting from d
2
w 
oxo-biodegradable technology has 
also recently expanded to include 
plastic coffee capsules. These 
capsules were beginning to get a 
bad reputation by accumulating in 
the open environment, so much so 
that the German city of Hamburg 
banned their use completely in 
2016. However – a company in Brazil 
has developed coffee capsules 
made with d
2
w oxo-biodegradable 
plastic technology, giving their 
customers great coffee without the 
environmental problem.
Finally, the d
2
w logo pops up in all 
sorts of places as more and more 
companies and organisations are 
realising the benefit of making their 
plastic smarter. An eagle eyed visitor 
on a tour of the Barcelona Football 
stadium was pleasantly surprised to 
find d
2
w on the red tape, used by 
the famous football club to seal off 
areas around the football ground. 
It’s great to know that d
2
w is useful 
even for red-tape.

We are committed to recycling and 
have a dedicated member of staff  
to monitor our recycling activities,  
as well as following the principles  
of reduce, reuse and recycle 
whenever practicable.
We work (wherever possible)  
with paperless administration  
and use the best-practice 
document-management systems, 
utilising electronic communications 
and video conferencing to reduce 
postal costs and the need for 
business travel. 
Finally, we have production facilities 
in several locations around the world 
to minimise the need to transport 
supplies and to help reduce our 
carbon-footprint.
As an organisation we are 
committed to the wider community 
and regularly support charities 
and fundraisers. This year we held 
events to support the MacMillan 
cancer charity, and Noah’s Ark 
Children’s Hospice, as well as taking 
part in sponsored events and a 
beach clean-up in Ghana. We also 
support local schools with their 
work experience programmes and 
often welcome students into our 
laboratory and our administration, 
sales and accounts departments.
Like most modern businesses, 
we appreciate that our staff are 
our greatest asset, and that their 
success contributes to the success 
of the company. We are happy 
to encourage staff in their career 
development with training courses, 
seminars and conferences where 
appropriate and flexible working  
i.e. job sharing and working from 
home where possible. 
We currently have two staff 
members completing NVQ 
qualifications in Accountancy 
and Office Administration and 
two students gaining valuable 
experience in our laboratory as they 
complete their one-year placement 
which is an essential part of their 
science degree courses. We also 
support overseas students with  
similar placements whenever we 
can, and this year we welcomed 
students from Germany and Spain.
In addition to all this, we are keen 
to encourage our distributors 
around the world to develop 
and update their skills, regularly 
hosting conferences and webinars 
and the sharing of best practice 
via networking events and the 
distributor forum on the  
Symphony website.

Principal activities and business review
The primary business activities of the Group are the development and supply of environmental plastic products to a 
global market. The Group also supplies other flexible polythene and related conventional products.
A review of the business is given in the Chairman’s Statement on page 4 and 5 together with the Chief Executive’s 
Review on pages 6 and 7. Future developments are summarised in the Outlook section of the Chief Executive’s 
Review on page 7.
Key performance indicators
The Directors have monitored the progress of the overall Group strategy by reference to certain financial and non-
financial key performance indicators.
These are discussed within the Chairman’s Statement and the Trading Results section of the Chief Executive’s Review
Principal risks and uncertainties
The Directors have identified and continually monitor the principal risks and uncertainties of the Group. These 
may change over time as new risks emerge and others cease to be of concern. The principal risks of the Group are 
detailed below.
Foreign exchange risk
The Group sells products in many countries and generates revenues in US Dollars and Euros. Foreign exchange 
rates fluctuate and, as such, assets created in foreign currencies are liable to constant revaluations into their Sterling 
equivalent. The Group mitigates this risk by purchasing, where practicable, in currencies to match revenues. The 
Group also has exchange facilities with its bank to use as and when appropriate.
Competition risk
The Group faces competition from suppliers of similar products which could affect revenues and/or gross 
margins. The Group mitigates this risk by having a large number of distributors globally who can concentrate  
on any competition issues within their market, and also by differentiating the Group’s products by branding  
and marketing activities.
Raw material pricing and availability
The Group uses commodity and speciality materials in the make-up of its products. There is a risk of price volatility 
and material availability. The Group mitigates this risk by using more than one supplier of its products and continually 
researching separate supply alternatives for the materials used.

M Laurier – Chief Executive Officer
I Bristow, FCCA – Chief Financial Officer
M Stephen, LL.M – Commercial Director & Deputy Chairman

Directors’ responsibilities statement
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Chairman’s Statement, the Chief Executive’s Review, the Strategic 
Report, the Directors’ Report, the Remuneration Report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable 
law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law, the 
Directors have elected to prepare the Group annual report and accounts in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union (IFRSs). The parent Company’s own annual report and 
accounts continue to be prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice 
(United Kingdom Accounting Standards including FRS102 “The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK 
and Republic of Ireland”) and applicable laws. Under company law the Directors must not approve the annual report 
and accounts unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs and profit or loss of the 
Company and Group for that period. In preparing these annual report and accounts, the Directors are required to:
•  select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
•  state whether applicable IFRSs or UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material departures 
disclosed and explained in the annual report and accounts; and
•  prepare the annual report and accounts on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the 
Company and Group will continue in business. 
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the 
Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company 
and enable them to ensure that the annual report and accounts comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also 
responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and 
detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors confirm that:
•   so far as each Director is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the Company’s auditor is  
unaware; and
•  the Directors have taken all steps that they ought to have taken as Directors in order to make themselves aware of 
any relevant audit information and to establish that the auditor is aware of that information.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included 
on the Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of annual 
report and accounts may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions. 
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS BUSINESS REVIEW CORPORATE GOVERNANCE Directors’ Report continued
Symphony Environmental Technologies plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017  |  www.symphonyenvironmental.com 14
Going concern
Management have prepared a cash flow forecast for the ensuing twelve months from the approval of the annual 
report and accounts. Operating results for the start of 2018 have been in line with these forecasts. The Group 
anticipates sales growth in the forthcoming year after the significant investments made in previous years. Having 
reviewed the cash flow forecasts and the available headroom within existing facilities the Directors believe that the 
Group has sufficient cash resources to meet debt obligations as they fall due. For these reasons, the Directors are  
of the opinion that it is appropriate to continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing these annual report  
and accounts.
Corporate governance
The Group is committed to developing and adhering to high standards of corporate governance. As an AIM listed 
company, Symphony Environmental Technologies plc is not required to and does not apply the UK Corporate 
Governance Code as issued by the UK’s Listing Authority, however, it seeks to follow the principles of good 
governance as far as management believes it is practical for a Group of its size, nature and circumstances. 
Financial risk management policies
The Group’s financial risk management policies are detailed in note 3 to the annual report and accounts.
Auditor
A resolution to appoint Mazars LLP as auditor for the ensuing year will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS BUSINESS REVIEW CORPORATE GOVERNANCE Symphony Environmental Technologies plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017  |  www.symphonyenvironmental.com 16
Opinion 
We have audited the financial statements of Symphony 
Environmental Technologies plc (the ‘parent company’) 
and its subsidiaries (the ‘group’) for the year ended 
31 December 2017 which comprise the Consolidated 
Statement of Comprehensive Income, the Consolidated 
Statement of Financial Position, the Consolidated 
Statement of Changes in Equity, the Consolidated 
Cash Flow Statement, the Company Balance Sheet, the 
Company Statement of Changes in Equity and notes to 
the annual report and accounts, including a summary of 
significant accounting policies. 
The financial reporting framework that has been applied 
in the preparation of the group financial statements is 
applicable law and International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied 
in the preparation of the parent company financial 
statements is applicable law and United Kingdom 
Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice), including Financial 
Reporting Standard 102 “The Financial Reporting 
Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland”.
In our opinion:
•   the financial statements give a true and fair view of 
the state of the group’s and of the parent company’s 
affairs as at 31 December 2017 and of the group’s 
profit for the year then ended;
•  the group financial statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by  
the European Union; 
•  the parent company financial statements have 
been properly prepared in accordance with United 
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; 
and 
•  the financial statements have been prepared in 
accordance with the requirements of the Companies 
Act 2006.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with 
International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) 
and applicable law. Our responsibilities under those 
standards are further described in the Auditor’s 
responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements 
section of our report. We are independent of the 
company in accordance with the ethical requirements 
that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements 
in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical Standard and 
we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in 
accordance with these requirements. We believe that 
the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and 
appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Use of the audit report
This report is made solely to the company’s members 
as a body in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of 
the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been 
undertaken so that we might state to the company’s 
members those matters we are required to state to them 
in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the 
fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or 
assume responsibility to anyone other than the company 
and the company’s members as a body for our audit 
work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Conclusions relating to going concern 
We have nothing to report in respect of the following 
matters in relation to which the ISAs (UK) require us to 
report to you where:
•   the directors’ use of the going concern basis of 
accounting in the preparation of the financial 
statements is not appropriate; or
•  the directors have not disclosed in the financial 
statements any identified material uncertainties that 
may cast significant doubt about the group’s or the 
parent company’s ability to continue to adopt the 
going concern basis of accounting for a period of at 
least twelve months from the date when the financial 
statements are authorised for issue.
Key audit matters 
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our 
professional judgement, were of most significance in our 
audit of the financial statements of the current period 
and include the most significant assessed risks of material 
misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) we identified, 
including those which had the greatest effect on: the 
overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the 
audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. 
These matters were addressed in the context of our audit 
of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming 
our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate 
opinion on these matters.
Key audit matter – Revenue Recognition 
The group’s accounting policy in respect of revenue 
recognition is set out in the accounting policy notes on 
‘revenue’ on page 23.
Under this policy, revenue is recognised when the stated 
conditions have been satisfied. We have therefore 
considered revenue recognition in relation to cut off as  
a significant audit risk. 
Our response:
 our audit procedures included, but were not limited to:
•   assessing the related internal control environment; and 
•  Substantive test of detail, enquiry of management, and 
corroboration of explanations provided. 
   Substantive sampling procedures included, but were 
not limited to: 
 •  selection of sample of transactions pre and post year-
end;
 •  for each item selected assessing the right to and 
timing of consideration by reference to shipment or 
delivery documentation depending on the specific 
contractual terms.
Our response: 
No significant deficiencies in the operation of related 
controls were detected that required us to revise the 
nature and/or scope of planned audit procedures. On the 
basis of our audit procedures, we have not identified any 
misstatements in the level of revenue and recognised in 
the financial statements.
Independent Auditor’s Report
to the members of Symphony Environmental Technologies plc Symphony Environmental Technologies plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017  |  www.symphonyenvironmental.com 17
Our application of materiality 
We apply the concept of materiality in planning and 
performing our audit, in evaluating the effect of identified 
misstatements on the financial statements, and in forming 
our audit opinion. The level of materiality we set is based 
on our assessment of the magnitude of misstatements 
that, individually or in aggregate, could reasonably be 
expected to have influence on the economic decisions of 
the users of the financial statements.
We established materiality based on:
- For the consolidated accounts, group’s total revenue 
is considered appropriate as the group is still at an early 
stage of generating profits and as such the profit levels 
are low. We determined the range of financial statement 
materiality for the consolidated financial statements 
as a whole to be between £124,000 (representing 
approximately 1.5% of the group’s total revenue) and 
£86,800 (representing 70% of financial statement 
materiality).
The range of materiality allocated across components 
was between £83,360 and £119,090.
- For the parent statutory accounts, total equity is 
considered appropriate as the company is not meant to 
be trading and mainly hold investment in subsidiaries. 
We determined the range of financial statement 
materiality for the company’s financial statement 
as a whole to be between £71,000 (representing 
approximatively 4.5% of the total equity) and £50,000 
(representing 70% of financial statement materiality).
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would 
report to that committee all identified corrected and 
uncorrected audit differences in excess of £4,000 for 
the group and in excess of £2,000 for the company 
(representing 3% of financial statement materiality) 
together with differences below that threshold that, in 
our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.
An overview of the scope of our audit 
Our audit involved obtaining evidence about the 
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements 
sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the financial 
statements are free from material misstatement, 
whether caused by fraud or error. The risks of material 
misstatement that had the greatest effect on our audit, 
including the allocation of our resources and effort, are 
discussed under “Key audit matters” within this report. 
Our audit included an assessment of: whether 
accounting policies are appropriate to the group’s 
and parent company’s circumstances and have been 
consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the 
reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made 
by the Directors; and the overall presentation of the 
financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial 
and non-financial information in the annual report 
to identify material inconsistencies with the audited 
financial statements and to identify an information 
that is apparently incorrect, based on, or materially 
inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the 
course of performing the audit. If we become aware of 
any apparent material misstatement or inconsistencies 
we consider the implications for our report. 
Our audit scope included an audit of the group financial 
statements of Symphony Environmental Technologies 
plc. The group audit was scoped by obtaining an 
understanding of the group and its environment, 
including group-wide controls, and assessing the risks of 
material misstatement at the group level. Based on that 
assessment, all entities within the group were subject to 
full scope audit and was performed by the group audit 
team at the group’s main offices in Borehamwood. 
Other information 
The directors are responsible for the other information. 
The other information comprises the information 
included in the annual report and accounts, other 
than the financial statements and our auditor’s report 
thereon. Our opinion on the financial statements does 
not cover the other information and, except to the extent 
otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not 
express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, 
our responsibility is to read the other information and, 
in doing so, consider whether the other information is 
materially inconsistent with the financial statements 
or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise 
appears to be materially misstated. If we identify 
such material inconsistencies or apparent material 
misstatements, we are required to determine whether 
there is a material misstatement in the financial 
statements or a material misstatement of the other 
information. If, based on the work we have performed, 
we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this 
other information, we are required to report that fact.
We have nothing to report in this regard.
Opinions on other matters prescribed by the 
Companies Act 2006
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the 
course of the audit:
•   the information given in the Strategic Report and the 
Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the 
financial statements are prepared is consistent with 
the financial statements; and
•  the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report have 
been prepared in accordance with applicable legal 
requirements.
Matters on which we are required to report  
by exception 
In light of the knowledge and understanding of the 
group and the parent company and its environment 
obtained in the course of the audit, we have not 
identified material misstatements in the Strategic Report 
or the Directors’ Report.
We have nothing to report in respect of the following 
matters in relation to which the Companies Act 2006 
requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:
•   adequate accounting records have not been kept by 
the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit 
have not been received from branches not visited by 
us; or
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS BUSINESS REVIEW CORPORATE GOVERNANCE Symphony Environmental Technologies plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017  |  www.symphonyenvironmental.com 18
•  the parent company financial statements are not in 
agreement with the accounting records and returns; 
or
•  certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specific 
by law are not made; or
•  we have not received all the information and 
explanations we require for our audit.
Responsibilities of Directors
As explained more fully in the directors’ responsibilities 
statement set out on page 13, the directors are 
responsible for the preparation of the financial 
statements and for being satisfied that they give a 
true and fair view, and for such internal control as 
the directors determine is necessary to enable the 
preparation of financial statements that are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the directors 
are responsible for assessing the group’s and the 
parent company’s ability to continue as a going 
concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to 
going concern and using the going concern basis of 
accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate 
the group or the parent company or to cease operations, 
or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the  
financial statements 
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance 
about whether the financial statements as a whole 
are free from material misstatement, whether due to 
fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that 
includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high 
level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an 
audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will 
always detect a material misstatement when it exists. 
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are 
considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, 
they could reasonably be expected to influence the 
economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these 
financial statements.
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on 
the financial statements in accordance with applicable 
law and International Standards on Auditing (UK). 
Those standards require us to comply with the Financial 
Reporting Council’s Ethical Standard. 
A further description of our responsibilities for the 
audit of the financial statements is located on the 
Financial Reporting Council’s website at www.frc.org.uk/
auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of 
our auditor’s report.

1. General information
Symphony Environmental Technologies plc (‘the 
Company’) and subsidiaries (together ‘the Group’) 
develop and supply environmental plastic additives  
and products, and develop waste to value systems.
The Company, a public limited company, is the Group’s 
ultimate parent company. It is incorporated and 
domiciled in England (Company number 03676824).  
The address of its registered office is 6 Elstree Gate, 
Elstree Way, Borehamwood, Hertfordshire, WD6 1JD, 
England. The Company’s shares are listed on the AIM 
market of the London Stock Exchange.
2. Summary of significant accounting policies
These consolidated annual report and accounts have 
been prepared in accordance with the requirements of 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as 
adopted by the European Union and also as issued by 
the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).
These consolidated annual report and accounts have 
been prepared under the historical cost convention 
except as started in the accounting policies. Financial 
information is presented in pounds sterling unless 
otherwise stated, and amounts are express in thousands 
(£’000) and rounded accordingly.
The accounting policies have remained unchanged  
from the previous year.
Consolidation
The consolidated annual report and accounts 
incorporate those of Symphony Environmental 
Technologies plc and all of its subsidiary undertakings. 
Subsidiaries acquired during the year are consolidated 
using the acquisition method. Under the acquisition 
method, their results are incorporated from the date  
that control passes. The difference between the cost  
of acquisition of shares in subsidiaries and the fair value 
of the separable net assets acquired is capitalised as 
goodwill. All annual report and accounts are made up  
to 31 December 2017.
All intra-group transactions, balances and unrealised 
gains on transactions between group companies are 
eliminated on consolidation. Unrealised losses are also 
eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence 
of an impairment of the asset transferred. Where 
necessary, adjustments are made to the annual report 
and accounts of subsidiaries to bring the accounting 
policies used into line with those used by other  
members of the Group.
Going concern
Management have prepared a cash flow forecast for 
the ensuing twelve months from the approval of the 
annual report and accounts. Operating results for the 
start of 2018 have been in line with these forecasts. 
The Group anticipates sales growth in the forthcoming 
year after the significant investments made in previous 
years. Having reviewed the cash flow forecasts and 
the available headroom within existing facilities the 
Directors believe that the Group has sufficient cash 
resources to meet debt obligations as they fall due. 
For these reasons, the Directors are of the opinion that 
it is appropriate to continue to adopt the going concern 
basis in preparing these annual report and accounts.
Revenue
Degradable and non-degradable plastic goods, and 
associated products 
Revenue is stated at the fair value of the consideration 
receivable and excludes VAT and trade discounts.
The Group’s revenue is from sale of goods. Revenue 
from the sale of goods is recognised when all of the 
following conditions have been satisfied:
a)  ownership of the significant risks and rewards has 
been transferred to the buyer. The buyer may be one 
of the Group’s distributors or an end customer. This 
may be based upon shipment or delivery depending 
upon specific contractual terms, whereby the 
Group relies on INCOTERMs (a series of pre-defined 
commercial terms published by the International 
Chamber of Commerce) to assess this;
b)  the amount of revenue can be measured reliably 
whereby the Group sells goods after receipt of 
confirmed orders;
c)  it is probable that the economic benefits associated 
with the transaction will flow to the entity;
d)  the costs incurred or to be incurred in respect  
of the transaction can be measured reliably; and
e)  the entity retains neither continuing managerial 
involvement to the degree usually associated with 
ownership nor effective control over the goods sold.
Non-recurring items
Expenditure is classified as non-recurring where the 
cost is considered to be material, one-off, and will not 
continue in future.
Intangible assets
Research and development costs
Expenditure on research (or the research phase of an 
internal project) is recognised as an expense in the 
period in which it is incurred. 
Development costs incurred on specific projects are 
capitalised when all the following conditions are satisfied:
•   completion of the intangible asset is technically 
feasible so that it will be available for use or sale;
•   the Group intends to complete the intangible asset 
and use or sell it;
•   the Group has the ability to use or sell the  
intangible asset;
•   the intangible asset will generate probable future 
economic benefits. Among other things, this requires 
that there is a market for the output from the 
intangible asset or for the intangible asset itself, or, 
if it is to be used internally, the asset will be used in 
generating such benefits;
•   there are adequate technical, financial and other 
resources to complete the development and to use  
or sell the intangible asset; and
Notes to the Annual Report
and Accounts
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS BUSINESS REVIEW CORPORATE GOVERNANCE Symphony Environmental Technologies plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017  |  www.symphonyenvironmental.com 24
•   the expenditure attributable to the intangible asset 
during its development can be measured reliably.
Development costs not meeting the criteria for 
capitalisation are expensed as incurred.
The cost of an internally generated intangible asset 
comprises all directly attributable costs necessary to 
create, produce, and prepare the asset to be capable of 
operating in the manner intended by management. The 
nature of the Group’s activities in the field of development 
work renders some internally generated intangible assets 
unable to meet the above criteria at present.
Amortisation commences upon completion of the asset 
and is shown within administrative expenses and is 
included at the following rate:
Plastic masterbatches and other additives - 15 years 
straight line. 
Careful judgement by the Directors is applied when 
deciding whether the recognition requirements for 
development costs have been met. This is necessary 
as the economic success of any product development 
is uncertain and may be subject to future technical 
problems at the time of recognition. Judgements are 
based on the information available at each balance 
sheet date. All amounts disclosed within note 12 in 
development costs relate to plastic masterbatches  
and other additives.
Trademarks 
Trademarks represent the cost of registration and 
are carried at cost less amortisation. Amortisation is 
calculated so as to write off the cost of an asset, less its 
estimated residual value, over the useful economic life  
of that asset as follows:
Trademarks – 10 years straight line.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, net  
of depreciation and any provision for impairment.
The cost comprises of the purchase price of the asset 
plus directly attributable costs.
Depreciation is calculated so as to write off the cost of 
an asset, less its estimated residual value, over the useful 
economic life of that asset as follows:
Plant and machinery  20% reducing balance.
Fixtures and fittings   10% straight line.
Motor vehicles  25% reducing balance.
Office equipment  25% straight line.
The residual value and useful economic lives are 
reconsidered annually.
Impairment testing of intangible assets and property, 
plant and equipment
All individual assets are tested for impairment whenever 
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the 
carrying amount may not be recoverable.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount 
by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its 
recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the 
higher of fair value, reflecting market conditions 
less costs to sell, and value in use based on an 
internal discounted cash flow evaluation. All assets 
are subsequently reassessed for indications that an 
impairment loss previously recognised may no  
longer exist.
Inventories
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net 
realisable value, after making due allowance for obsolete 
and slow moving items. Cost is determined on the basis 
of purchase value plus all directly attributable costs 
of bringing the inventory to the current location and 
condition, on a first-in first-out basis. 
Leased assets
In accordance with International Accounting Standard 
(IAS) 17, the economic ownership of a leased asset is 
transferred to the lessee if the lessee bears substantially 
all the risks and rewards related to the ownership of the 
leased asset. The related asset is recognised at the time 
of inception of the lease at the fair value of the leased 
asset or, if lower, the present value of the minimum 
lease payments plus incidental payments, if any, to 
be borne by the lessee. A corresponding amount is 
recognised as a finance leasing liability. The interest 
element of leasing payments represents a constant 
proportion of the capital balance outstanding and is 
charged to statement of comprehensive income loss 
over the period of the lease.
All other leases are regarded as operating leases and the 
payments made under them are charged to statement of 
comprehensive income on a straight line basis over the 
lease term. Lease incentives are spread over the term of 
the lease.
Employee costs
Employee compensation
Employee benefits are recognised as an expense.
Termination benefits
Termination benefits are those benefits which are 
payable when employment is terminated before the 
normal retirement date, or whenever an employee 
accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for these 
benefits. The Group recognises termination benefits 
when it is demonstrably committed to either: terminating 
the employment of current employees according to a 
detailed formal plan without possibility of withdrawal; 
or providing termination benefits as a result of an offer 
made to encourage voluntary redundancy. 
Post employment obligations
The Group operates a defined contribution pension 
scheme for employees. The assets of the scheme are held 
separately from those of the Group. The pension costs 
charged against profits are the contributions payable to 
the scheme in respect of the accounting period.
Taxation
Current tax is the tax currently payable based on taxable 
profit for the year.
Deferred income taxes are calculated using the liability 
method on temporary differences. Deferred tax is 
Notes to the Annual Report
and Accounts continued Symphony Environmental Technologies plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017  |  www.symphonyenvironmental.com 25
generally provided on the difference between the 
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax 
bases. Tax losses available to be carried forward as well 
as other income tax credits to the Group are assessed 
for recognition as deferred tax assets, insofar as Group 
companies are entitled to UK tax credits on qualifying 
research and development expenditure, such amounts are 
recognised when received and presented in the income 
tax line within statement of comprehensive income. 
Deferred tax liabilities are provided in full, with no 
discounting. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the 
extent that it is probable that the underlying deductible 
temporary differences will be able to be offset against 
future taxable income. Current and deferred tax 
assets and liabilities are calculated at tax rates that 
are expected to apply to their respective period of 
realisation, provided they are enacted or substantively 
enacted at the balance sheet date.
Changes in deferred tax assets or liabilities are 
recognised as a component of tax expense in profit or 
loss, except where they either relate to items that are 
charged or credited directly to equity in which case the 
related deferred tax is also charged or credited directly 
to equity, or where they relate to items charged or 
credited in other comprehensive income the deferred tax 
change is recognised in other comprehensive income.
Foreign currencies
Monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are 
translated into Sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at 
the balance sheet date. Transactions in foreign currencies 
are translated into Sterling at the rate of exchange ruling 
at the date of the transaction. Exchange differences are 
taken into account in arriving at the operating result. The 
Group uses derivatives such as forward rate agreements 
to mitigate its current or future positions against foreign 
exchange rate risks. These derivatives are measured at 
fair value, determined by reference to observable market 
prices at the reporting date.
Financial assets
Financial assets held by the Group are divided into the 
following categories: loans and receivables and available-
for-sale financial assets. Financial assets are assigned 
to the different categories by management on initial 
recognition, depending on the purpose for which they 
were acquired. All financial assets are recognised when 
the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions 
of the instrument. Financial assets are initially recognised 
at fair value plus transaction costs. 
The Group currently has the following financial assets:
Trade and other receivables
Trade receivables are categorised as loans and 
receivables. Trade receivables are non-derivative 
financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that 
are not quoted in an active market. Trade receivables are 
measured subsequent to initial recognition at amortised 
cost using the effective interest method, less provision 
for impairment. Any change in their value through 
impairment or reversal of impairment is recognised in 
profit or loss.
Provision against trade receivables is made when there 
is objective evidence that the Group will not be able 
to collect all amounts due to it in accordance with the 
original terms of those receivables. The amount of the 
write-down is determined as the difference between 
the asset’s carrying amount and the present value 
of estimated future cash flows, discounted using the 
original effective interest rate. 
Available-for-sale financial assets
Available-for-sale financial assets are non-derivative 
financial assets that are either designated to this 
category or do not qualify for inclusion in any of the 
other categories of financial assets. 
The equity investments are measured at cost less 
any impairment charges, if their fair values cannot 
currently be estimated reliably. Impairment charges are 
recognised in the statement of comprehensive income. 
An assessment for impairment is undertaken at least at 
each balance sheet date.
A financial asset is derecognised only where the 
contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset 
expire or the financial asset is transferred and that 
transfer qualifies for derecognition. A financial asset is 
transferred if the contractual rights to receive the cash 
flows of the asset have been transferred or the Group 
retains the contractual rights to receive the cash flows 
of the asset but assumes a contractual obligation to 
pay the cash flows to one or more recipients. A financial 
asset that is transferred qualifies for derecognition if the 
Group transfers substantially all the risks and rewards 
of ownership of the asset, or if the Group neither retains 
nor transfers substantially all the risks and rewards of 
ownership but does transfer control of that asset.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and 
demand deposits, together with other short-term,  
highly liquid investments that are readily convertible  
into known amounts of cash and which are subject  
to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Financial liabilities
Financial liabilities are obligations to pay cash or  
other financial assets and are recognised when the 
Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions  
of the instrument. 
The Group’s financial liabilities include trade payables, 
other payables, bank overdraft, bank loans and other 
loans. These are classified as financial liabilities measured 
at amortised cost.Financial liabilities measured at 
amortised cost are initially recognised at fair values net 
of direct issue costs. 
Finance charges are charged to statement of 
comprehensive income, where applicable, on an accruals 
basis using the effective interest method and are added 
to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent 
they are not settled in the period in which they arose.
A financial liability is derecognised only when the 
obligation is extinguished, that is, when the obligation is 
discharged or cancelled or expires.
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS BUSINESS REVIEW CORPORATE GOVERNANCE Symphony Environmental Technologies plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017  |  www.symphonyenvironmental.com 26
Equity settled share-based payments
All share-based payment arrangements granted after 7 
November 2002 that had not vested prior to 1 January 
2007 are recognised in the annual report and accounts.
All goods and services received in exchange for the 
grant of any share-based payment are measured at 
their fair values. Where employees are rewarded using 
share-based payments, the fair values of the instrument 
granted are determined using the Black-Scholes model. 
This fair value is appraised at the grant date. The fair 
value is charged to statement of comprehensive income 
between the date of issue and the date the share options 
vest with a corresponding credit taken to equity.
Equity
Equity comprises the following:
•   “Share capital” represents the nominal value of  
equity shares;
•  “Share premium” represents the excess over nominal 
value of the fair value of consideration received for 
equity shares, net of expenses of the share issue and 
after capital reduction; and
•  “Retained earnings” represents non-distributed 
reserves.
Standards and interpretations adopted during the year
The adoption of the following mentioned amendments 
in the current year have not had a material impact on the 
Group’s/Company’s financial statements:
Standards and interpretations in issue but not  
yet effective
At the date of authorisation of these annual report 
and accounts, certain new standards, amendments 
and interpretations to existing standards have been 
published but are not yet effective, and have not been 
adopted early by the Group.
Management anticipates that all of the pronouncements 
will be adopted in the Group’s accounting policy for 
the first period beginning after the effective date of 
the pronouncement. Information on new standards, 
amendments and interpretations that are expected to 
be relevant to the Group’s annual report and accounts 
is provided below. Certain other new standards and 
interpretations have been issued but are not expected 
to have a material impact on the Group’s annual report 
and accounts.
IFRS 9 “Financial Instruments”
The IASB have released IFRS 9 following completion 
of the project to replace IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments: 
Recognition and Measurement’. The new standard 
introduces extensive changes to IAS 39’s guidance on 
the classification and measurement of financial assets 
and introduces a new ‘expected credit loss’ model for the 
impairment of financial assets. IFRS 9 also provides new 
guidance on the application of hedge accounting. IFRS 
9 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning 
on or after 1 January 2018 and has been endorsed by 
the European Union. The Group’s management have 
performed an impact assessment of the effects of 
IFRS 9 on the 2017 figures and do not expect there to 
be any material changes to the Group’s annual report 
and accounts. The main area that will be impacted is 
the measurement of the fair value of forward exchange 
contracts, which are immaterial in value and the credit 
risk is low.
IFRS 15, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers”
IFRS 15 presents new requirements for the recognition of 
revenue, replacing IAS 18 ‘Revenue’, IAS 11 ‘Construction 
Contracts’, and several revenue-related Interpretations. 
The new standard establishes a control-based revenue 
recognition model and provides additional guidance 
in many areas not covered in detail under existing 
IFRSs, including how to account for arrangements 
with multiple performance obligations, variable pricing, 
customer refund rights, supplier repurchase options, 
and other common complexities. IFRS 15 is effective 
for reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 
2018. This standard has been endorsed by the European 
Union. The Group’s management have performed an 
impact assessment of the effects of IFRS 15 on the 2017 
figures and do not expect there to be any change to the 
statement of comprehensive income as presented. The 
revenue recognition and related disclosures of the Group 
will remain unchanged as all performance obligations 
under IFRS15 are met at the same time as per the current 
revenue recognition policy as set out above. 
IFRS 16 “Leases” 
The IASB has published IFRS 16 ‘Leases’, completing 
its long-running project on lease accounting. The new 
Standard, which is effective for accounting periods 
beginning on or after 1 January 2019, requires lessees to 
account for leases ‘on-balance sheet’ by recognised a 
‘right-of-use’ asset and a lease liability. It will affect most 
companies that report under IFRS and are involved in 
leasing, and will have a substantial impact on the annual 
report and accounts of lessees of property and high 
value equipment. This standard has been endorsed by 
the European Union.
The Group’s management will carry out an impact 
review of the implementation of IFRS 16 and disclose the 
impact in next year’s annual report and accounts. We 
anticipate this will have a material effect on the Group’s 
balance sheet.

3. Financial risk management
The main risks arising from the Group’s financial instruments are liquidity risk, interest rate risk, currency risk and  
credit risk. The Directors review and agree policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below. 
These policies have remained unchanged from previous years. 
The Group’s financial assets and liabilities are summarised as follows:

Liquidity risk
The Group seeks to manage financial risk to ensure financial liquidity is available to meet foreseeable needs and  
to invest cash assets safely and profitability. Short term flexibility is achieved through trade finance arrangements  
and overdrafts.
Having reviewed the maturity of financial liabilities and the forecast cash flows for the forthcoming twelve month 
period, the Directors believe that sufficient cash will be generated from trading operations to meet debt obligations 
as they fall due. 
The maturity of financial liabilities as at 31 December 2017 is summarised as follows:

Interest rate risk
The Group seeks to reduce its exposure to interest rate risk where possible, but this is offset by the availability of trade 
finance arrangements which are transaction specific to meet liquidity needs and so have variable interest rate terms. 
Sensitivities have been looked at in the range of an absolute rate increase of 5% or a decrease of 1% which enable an 
objective calculation to be made depending on any interest rate changes in the future. Any rate changes would be 
outside the control of the Group.

Currency risk
The Group operates in overseas markets and is subject to currency exposure on transactions undertaken during  
the year. The Group hedges the transactions where possible by buying goods and selling them in the same currency. 
The Group also has bank facilities available for hedging purposes.
A summary of foreign currency financial assets and liabilities as stated in the statement of financial position together 
with a sensitivity analysis showing the effect of a 10% change in rate with Sterling is shown below:
Sensitivity shows the effect on equity and statement of comprehensive income. A 10% change is shown to enable an 
objective calculation to be made on exchange rates which may be assumed for the future.
As at 31 December 2017 the company had entered into forward foreign currency contacts which all matured within 
1 month of the year end and committed the Company to selling US Dollars 530,000 and to receive a fixed sterling 
amount (2016 : US Dollars 1,000,000).
The forward currency contracts are measured at fair value, which is determined using the valuation techniques 
that utilise observable inputs. The key inputs used in valuing the derivatives are the forward exchange rates for 
USD:GBP. The fair value of the forward-foreign currency contracts at 31 December 2017 is a profit of £16,000 (2016: 
loss £5,000).

The credit risk associated with the cash is limited as the counterparties have high credit ratings assigned by 
international credit-rating agencies. The principal credit risk arises therefore from trade receivables. The seven largest 
customer balances at the end of the year make up 65% (2016: 76%) of the above trade receivables.
In order to manage credit risk the Directors set limits for customers based on a combination of payment history, third 
party credit references and use of credit insurance. These limits are reviewed regularly.
The maturity of overdue debts and details of impairments and amounts written off are set out in note 16.

Capital requirements
Interest bearing loans and borrowings are monitored 
regularly to ensure the Group has sufficient liquidity 
and its exposure to interest rate risk is mitigated. 
Management consider the capital of the Group 
comprises the share capital and interest bearing loans 
and borrowings as detailed in note 25. The Company 
satisfies the Companies Act 2006 requirement to hold 
£50,000 issued and authorised share capital. The rule 
that 25% must be paid up is also satisfied, by reference 
to note 18.
4. Critical accounting estimates and judgements
Estimates and judgements are evaluated continually 
and are based on historical experience and other 
factors, including expectations of future events that 
are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. 
Although these estimates are based on management’s 
best knowledge of current events and actions, actual 
results may ultimately differ from those actions. Material 
changes to the estimates and judgements made in the 
preparation of the interim statements are detailed in  
the notes.
In preparing these accounts the following areas  
were considered to involve significant judgements 
and estimates:
Capitalisation of development costs
Judgements and estimates relating to the capitalisation 
of development costs are detailed in note 2. In particular, 
estimates are made in respect to future economic 
benefits based on market judgements at the time  
and over attributable internal staff time allocated to  
each product. 
Recoverability of capitalised development cost
Judgements and estimates relating to capitalised 
development costs are detailed in note 12. In particular, 
estimates are continued to be made in respect to  
future economic benefits and any changes to  
market conditions. 
Share option judgements
Judgements and estimates relating to share-based 
payment charges are detailed in note 2. Estimates  
are made on the fair value of the option using the  
Black-Scholes model. 
Going concern
Judgements and estimates relating to going concern  
are detailed in note 2. In particular, estimates are made 
as to future revenues expectations which derive cash 
flow projections. 
Bad debts
Provisions for bad debts are shown in note 16. Bad debt 
provisions are made when there is objective evidence of 
impairment. Where there is no provision then it is due to 
cash having been received since the end of the year, or 
adequate information exists to support the recoverability 
of the debt.
Recognition of deferred tax assets
Judgements and estimates relating to a deferred tax 
asset are detailed in note 9. In particular, estimates  
are made as to future revenues which derive profit and 
loss projections.
Functional currency
A significant proportion of the revenues generated by 
entities within the Group are denominated in United 
States Dollars (USD). The functional currency of the 
Company and of all individual entities within the Group 
has been determined to be Sterling. Identification of 
functional currencies requires a judgement as to the 
currency of the primary economic environment in which 
the companies of the Group operate. This is based on 
analysis of the economic environment and cash flows 
of the subsidiaries of the Group, which has determined, 
based upon the currency of funding and operating costs, 
that the functional currency continues to be Sterling.

5. Revenue information 
The Board has reviewed the requirements of IFRS 8 “Operating Segments”, including consideration of what results 
and information the Board reviews regularly to assess performance and allocate resources, and concluded that all 
revenue falls under a single business segment. The Directors consider the business does not have separate divisional 
segments as defined under IFRS 8. The Board assesses the commercial performance of the business based upon a 
single set of revenues, margins, operating costs and assets. 
The revenues of the Group are divided in the following geographical areas:

The group has not recognised a deferred tax asset in respect of losses available for use against future taxable profits. 
The group has tax losses of approximately £16,000,000 (2016: £16,000,000). These tax losses have no expiry date. 
The unrecognised deferred tax asset in respect of these losses based on latest profit projections is approximately 
£2,730,000 (2016: £2,733,000).
These brought forward losses will be subject to the new loss restriction rules introduced on 2 April 2017. Groups with 
more than £5m taxable profits per annum will only be able to utilise 50% of their brought forward losses against 
taxable profits exceeding the £5m cap. As Symphony does not expect its taxable profits to exceed £5m in the near to 
immediate term, it is not possible to quantify the impact of these changes at this moment in time.
The main rate of corporation tax was reduced from 20% to 19% from 1 April 2017. A further reduction in the UK 
corporation tax rate was substantively enacted on 6 September 2016 reducing the headline corporation tax rate from 
18% to 17% applicable from 1 April 2020. 
The group also has gross fixed asset temporary timing differences of £120,000 (2016: £87,000) which gives rise to a 
deferred tax liability of £20,000 (2016: £15,000). Other gross temporary timing differences of £19,000 (2016: £9,000) 
give rise to a deferred tax asset of £3,000 (2016: £2,000). The net deferred tax liability of £17,000 (2016: £3,000) is 
sheltered by the unrecognised deferred tax asset in respect of losses. 
The recognition of the deferred tax asset is based on sensitising management forecasts to estimate the future taxable 
profits against which the losses will be relieved. Judgements have been made in respect to profitability going forward 
based upon current sales leads and market receptiveness to anticipated product launches.

10. Earnings per share and dividends
The calculation of basic earnings per share is based on the profit attributable to ordinary shareholders divided by the 
weighted average number of shares in issue during the year. The calculation of diluted earnings per share is based on 
the basic earnings per share, adjusted to allow for the issue of shares on the assumed conversion of  
all dilutive options and warrants.
Reconciliations of the profit and weighted average numbers of shares used in the calculations are set out below:
Basic and diluted 2017 2016
Profit attributable to equity holders of the Company £430,000 £168,000

The Group relies on the continued development of its product range and in so doing is maintaining satisfactory goals 
in fulfilling its strategy (see Chairman’s Statement and Chief Executive’s Review). 
Development costs are capitalised in accordance with the policy set out in note 2. In capitalising these costs, 
judgements are made relating to ongoing feasibility and commerciality of products and systems being developed. 
In making these judgements, cashflow forecasts are used and these include significant estimates in respect to sales 
forecasts and future foreign exchange rates. 
The amortisation charge is included within administrative expenses in statement of comprehensive income.

The Company holds 30% of the ordinary share capital of Symphony Bin Hilal Plastics LLC, a company incorporated 
in the United Arab Emirates. The directors are of the opinion that this is an investment as the directors do not 
have significant influence because the Group has no representation on the board of directors of the investee, does 
not participate in policy making processes, and does not receive key financial or management information. A full 
impairment had been made against this in 2012 due to limited availability of financial information.
The Company holds 10% of the ordinary share capital of American Plastic Technologies plc, a company incorporated 
in the United States of America. The directors are of the opinion that this is an investment as the directors do not have 
significant influence because they have no financial or management control. The investment in American Plastics 
Technologies plc is measured at cost less impairment charges as the fair value cannot be estimated readily. The cost 
of this investment was £nil.
The Company holds c.5% of the ordinary share capital of Oxobioplast Inc., a company incorporated in the United 
States of America. The directors are of the opinion that this is an investment as the directors do not have significant 
influence because they have no financial or management control. The investment in Oxobioplast Inc. is measured at 
cost less impairment charges as the fair value cannot be estimated readily. The cost of this investment was £nil.
There is no collateral on the above amounts.

The maximum credit risk exposure at the balance sheet date equates to the carrying value of trade receivables. 
Further disclosures are set out in note 3.
Included in trade receivables at 31 December 2017 are debtors which are past due but where no provision has been 
made as there has not been a change in the credit worthiness of these debtors and the amounts are considered 
recoverable. As of 31 December 2017 trade receivables of £70,000 (2016: £15,000) were past due and not impaired. 
The ageing analysis of these trade receivables is as follows:

25. Capital management
The Group’s capital management objectives are:
•   to ensure the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern; and
•   to provide an adequate return to shareholders
The Group monitors capital on the basis of the gearing ratio calculated as net debt divided by total capital. Net 
debt is calculated as total borrowings as shown in the consolidated statement of financial position less cash and 
cash equivalents. Total capital is calculated as equity as shown in the consolidated statement of financial position 
plus net debt.
The Group’s goal in capital management is to maintain an optimal gearing ratio (the ratio of net debt over debt  
plus equity).
The Group manages the capital structure and makes adjustments to it in the light of changes in economic 
conditions and the risk characteristics of the underlying assets. In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, 
the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new 
shares, or sell assets to reduce debt.
The gearing ratios at 31 December 2017 and 2016 were as follows:

Notes to the Company
Balance Sheet
27. Principal accounting policies
Basis of accounting
Symphony Environmental Technologies plc (“The 
Company”), is a public limited company. It is 
incorporated and domiciled in England (Company 
number 03676824). The address of its registered 
office is 6 Elstree Gate, Elstree Way, Borehamwood, 
Hertfordshire, WD6 1JD, England. The Company’s 
shares are listed on the AIM market of the London 
Stock Exchange. 
The principal activity of the Company is to hold 
investments in subsidiaries which develop and supply 
environmental plastic additives and products, and 
develop waste to value systems.
The annual report and accounts have been prepared 
in accordance with United Kingdom accounting 
standards, including Financial Reporting Standard 102 
– ‘The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the 
United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland’ (‘FRS 102’), 
and with the Companies Act 2006. The annual report 
and accounts have been prepared on the historical 
cost basis.
The Company has taken advantage of section 408 of 
the Companies Act 2006 and has not included its own 
statement of comprehensive income in these annual 
report and accounts. 
The Company is considered a qualifying entity and 
has taken advantage of the FRS102 exemption not to 
include its own statement of cash flow in these annual 
report and accounts.
The annual report and accounts are presented in 
Sterling, the functional and presentational currency of 
the Company and are expressed in round thousands 
unless otherwise stated (£’000s).
Fixed assets
Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost, net of 
depreciation and any provision for impairment.
Depreciation is calculated so as to write off the cost  
of an asset, less its estimated residual value, over the 
useful economic life of that asset as follows:
Motor vehicles  25% reducing balance.
Taxation
Current tax is the tax currently payable based on  
taxable profit for the year.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing 
differences that have originated but not reversed at the 
balance sheet date where transactions or events have 
occurred at that date that will result in an obligation to 
pay more, or a right to pay less or to receive more tax, 
with the following exception: deferred tax assets are 
recognised only to the extent that the directors consider 
that it is more likely than not that there will be suitable 
taxable profits from which the future reversal of the 
underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis  
at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods 
in which timing differences reverse, based on tax rates 
and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the 
balance sheet date.
Foreign currencies
Monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies 
are translated into Sterling at the rates of exchange 
ruling at the balance sheet date. Transactions in foreign 
currencies are translated into Sterling at the rate of 
exchange ruling at the date of the transaction. Exchange 
differences are taken into account in arriving at the 
operating profit.
Investments
Investments in subsidiaries are accounted for at cost less 
impairment in the individual annual report and accounts.
Impairment of assets
At each reporting date fixed assets are reviewed to 
determine whether there is any indication that those 
assets have suffered an impairment loss. If there is 
an indication of possible impairment, the recoverable 
amount of any affected asset is estimated and 
compared with its carrying amount. If estimated 
recoverable amount is lower, the carrying amount is 
reduced to its estimated recoverable amount, and an 
impairment loss is charged immediately to statement of 
comprehensive income.
If an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carry 
amount of the asset is increased to the revised estimate 
of its recoverable amount, but not in excess of the 
amount that would have been determined had no 
impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior 
years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised 
immediately in statement of comprehensive income.
Financial instruments
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified 
according to the substance of the contractual 
arrangements entered into. An equity instrument is any 
contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets 
of the entity after deducting all of its financial liabilities.
Where the contractual obligations of the financial 
instruments (including share capital) are equivalent to  
a similar debt instrument, those financial instruments  
are classified as financial liabilities. Financial liabilities  
are presented as such in the balance sheet. Finance 
costs are calculated so as to produce a constant rate  
of return on the outstanding liability.
Where the contractual terms of share capital do not 
have any terms meeting the definition of a financial 
liability then this is classified as an equity instrument. 
Dividends and distributions relating to equity 
instruments are debited direct to equity.
Equity-settled share-based payments
Warrants and options granted to employees which 
relate to salary sacrifices of employees employed by 
this company are attributed a fair value by reference 
to the services provided. This fair value is charged to 
statement of comprehensive income when the service 
is provided with a corresponding credit taken to 
shareholders’ funds.
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS BUSINESS REVIEW CORPORATE GOVERNANCE Symphony Environmental Technologies plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017  |  www.symphonyenvironmental.com 46
Significant judgements and estimates
Preparation of the annual report and accounts requires 
management to make significant judgements and 
estimates. The items in the annual report and accounts 
where these judgements and estimates have been 
made include:
Judgements - impairment
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by 
which the asset’s or cash generating unit’s carrying 
amount exceeds its recoverable amount. To determine 
the recoverable amount, management estimates 
expected future cash flows from each cash-generating 
unit and determines a suitable discount rate in 
order to calculate the present value of those cash 
flows. In the process of measuring expected future 
cash flows management makes assumptions about 
future operating results. These assumptions relate 
to future events and circumstances. In most cases, 
determining the applicable discount rate involves 
estimating the appropriate adjustment to market risk 
and the appropriate adjustment to asset-specific risk 
factors. Details of assumptions made and impairments 
recognised in the period are given in notes 29 and 30.
