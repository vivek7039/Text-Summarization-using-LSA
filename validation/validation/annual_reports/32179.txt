FINANCIAL AND OPERATING HIGHLIGHTS 
* Financial years 2011 – 2014 are restated. Adjusted pre-tax profit and EPS exclude share incentive scheme charges and the amortisation of 
intangible assets. FY17 adjusted pre-tax profit (£53.3m) and EPS exclude share incentive scheme charges (£1.2m), amortisation of the energy 
supply contract intangible asset (£11.2m), and any contribution from the Company’s former 20% shareholding in Opus Energy Group Limited 
(‘Opus’) which was sold in February 2017; as a discontinued operation, and for ease of comparability, the contribution from Opus has therefore 
been excluded from profit before tax and EPS for FY17 and historic accounting periods. Telecom Plus PLC  Report and Accounts 2017 2

CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT 
I am delighted to report another successful year for the Company with adjusted profits, 
earnings and dividends all reaching record levels. Looking at the figures from continuing 
operations, adjusted pre-tax profits increased by 9.1% to £53.3m (2016: £48.8m), and 
statutory pre-tax profits reached £40.9m (2016: £35.1m), on revenue down by 0.6% to 
£740.3m (2016: £744.7m); adjusted earnings per share for the year rose by 7.2% to 53.3p 
(2016: 49.7p), and statutory EPS increased to 38.0p (2016: 32.8p).
This performance was achieved in the face of challenging market conditions, with the 
strong headwinds we have seen over the last few years persisting during the first half of the 
year. And while the record gap between standard variable energy tariffs and aggressively 
priced introductory deals started to narrow during the autumn, this happened too late to 
provide any positive impact on our service and customer numbers for Q3. 
As previously reported, we responded to this more favourable environment by making 
a change to our Partner compensation plan at the beginning of Q4; this gave Partners 
the opportunity to accelerate some of the residual income they would earn on new 
Members who switched all their utilities to us. 
This enhancement, combined with our more competitive market position, led to an 
increase in Partner activity as we progressed through Q4, taking full year customer and 
service numbers to 607,802 (2016: 598,613) and 2,288,918 (2016: 2,181,704) respectively 
– an increase of more than 107,000 services during the year. Within this total, there has 
once again been a significant improvement in customer quality, with 102,126 (2016: 
76,764) residential Members now taking all our core services (landline, broadband, 
mobile, gas and electricity).
We received a number of further endorsements from Which? during the year, 
recognising both the value we offer and the quality of service provided by our UK-based 
membership support teams. In addition to being ranked amongst the top suppliers 
for all our core services (Energy, Broadband/Telephony and Mobile) in each of their 
sector surveys, we received Recommended Provider awards for both our Broadband 
and Mobile services. Further to this, we were delighted to receive the accolade of Best 
Telecom Services Provider at the recent Which? 2017 Annual Awards ceremony. In 
addition, we received four awards from Moneywise, and were voted UK National Public 
Champion (and named as a finalist in the Business of the Year category for companies 
with a turnover of €150m or higher) in the European Business Awards. These third party 
independent endorsements are a testament to our customer-centric approach, our 
commitment to treating our members fairly, our ongoing mission to be the Nation’s 
most trusted utility provider, and the significant resources invested in delivering the best 
possible customer service.

RESULTS OVERVIEW
Our adjusted profit from continuing operations (i.e. excluding the contribution from Opus) reflects the 
continuing modest organic growth over the last two years in the number of services we are providing to 
our Members, an increased proportion of revenues from higher margin telephony services, and a one-off 
recovery of costs incurred in prior years relating to the smart meter roll-out programme under our energy 
supply agreement, counterbalanced by recurring customer acquisition costs which were higher this year 
(primarily due to Daffodil), continued investment in headcount and increased spending on IT. We also 
generated an exceptional profit of £62.3m during the year from the sale of our 20% shareholding in 
Opus (see below), taking our total post-tax profit to £95.0m (2016: £31.8m).
Revenues fell slightly due to lower average energy prices (following an industry wide reduction in retail gas 
prices during the spring of 2016, and an increasing proportion of our customer base taking our cheapest 
‘Double Gold’ tariffs), a reduction in average energy usage (reflecting the progressive impact of the energy 
efficiency measures that have been delivered by the industry over the last few years and the success of our 
own LED light bulb replacement service), partially offset by an increase in telephony revenues due to higher 
prices, more services, and a greater proportion of customers taking fibre broadband.
We received £71.1m in cash for our 20% stake in Opus Energy Group Limited (‘Opus’) following its 
acquisition by Drax Plc in February 2017; this transaction generated an exceptional profit of £62.3m 
which is included in our results for the year, alongside a contribution of £2.2m from our share of its profit 
up to the date of disposal.
Dividend
In line with previous guidance, we are proposing a final dividend of 25p (2016: 24p), bringing the total for 
the year to 48p (2016: 46p); this represents an increase of 4.3% compared with last year, and will be paid 
on 28 July 2017 to shareholders on the register at the close of business on 7 July 2017 subject to approval 
by shareholders at the Company’s AGM which will be held on 20 July 2017. We remain committed to a 
progressive dividend policy consistent with the underlying strong cash generation of our business.
Proposed Share Buyback
We previously announced our intention to carry out a tender offer this summer, under which we would seek 
to return to shareholders the cash we received from the sale of our stake in Opus; we have now decided to 
reduce the maximum size of this tender offer to £25m. 
This will provide greater flexibility for the Company to take advantage of the strategic opportunities that 
we expect to arise over the next few years, resulting from the rapidly changing political and regulatory 
environment for the services we supply.
Full details of the tender offer will be included with the AGM documents which will be sent to all 
shareholders shortly.  Telecom Plus PLC  Report and Accounts 2017 6
Churn
Our churn remains significantly below prevailing industry levels, and we are encouraged by the clear 
downward trend that has started to develop since last autumn. We attribute this to a combination of factors 
including a reduction in the gap between standard variable tariffs and introductory deals, increased 
investment by us in retention activities, and the steadily improving quality of our customer base. It is 
particularly encouraging that this has been achieved against an industry background which has seen 
record numbers of households switching their energy supplier over recent months.
Proposed Energy Price Cap
It is encouraging that both the major political parties included a commitment in their recent General Election 
manifestos to address one of the main issues within the energy industry, namely the practice by many large 
suppliers of using the higher margins earned on disengaged legacy customers to offer significantly cheaper 
deals which are only available to those who switch. If implemented, we believe these manifesto proposals will 
create a fairer energy market, with lower energy bills for millions of disengaged households who are currently 
paying more than they should, simply because (for whatever reason) they are not switching supplier on a 
regular basis.
In particular, we do not share the view widely expressed by some of the other large suppliers that a 
widespread cap on standard variable tariffs will be damaging to competition, as the wide choice of 
attractively priced tariffs from the vast majority of independent suppliers who do not exploit their customers 
in this way would remain available. Indeed, the only tariffs that might cease to be available will be the 
relatively small number which are being unfairly cross-subsidised by those who are shouting the loudest 
against this proposal.
In our view, the protection of disengaged consumers requires such an absolute cap to be retained over the 
medium term (albeit that it will need to be reviewed on a regular basis and set at a level which enables 
efficient suppliers not engaged in predatory pricing to earn a reasonable margin), or replaced in due 
course by a long-term relative price cap as suggested recently by John Penrose MP and endorsed by many 
independent suppliers.
BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT
We are encouraged by the results from the soft launch of our Home Insurance service. We anticipate 
volumes will start to improve from their current low levels as we start marketing this new service more 
pro-actively, and remain confident that Insurance has the potential to make a material contribution to the 
financial performance of the group in due course.
The downward trend in energy prices which has prevailed for over three years has started to reverse, with 
rising commodity prices being accompanied by higher regulatory, distribution and policy costs. This has 
led to higher retail prices for both standard variable tariffs and fixed price introductory deals, albeit that the 
gap between them has narrowed. Although undoubtedly positive for us, this gap still remains significantly 
wider than we would have liked, due partly to the continuing practice by some suppliers of simultaneously 
offering both an expensive Standard Variable Tariff (‘SVT’) and a cheap introductory fixed price deal, and 
also the decision by a number of new suppliers to price their energy at near zero gross margin in order to 
attract market share.
CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT 
CONTINUED  Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
 
Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2017 7
The energy market remains polarised between the ‘Big 6’, who are broadly maintaining or increasing 
profitability whilst losing customers, and a rapidly increasing number of independent suppliers at the 
other end of the spectrum, who are largely gaining market share but (almost without exception) incurring 
significant losses whilst doing so. All of these market participants are reliant on the same wholesale costs 
and use similar distribution channels (namely price comparison sites and bulk switching initiatives) to attract 
customers who generally choose their new supplier based predominantly on price and, in many cases, 
will switch again as soon as they reach the end of their introductory fixed-price period. And although new 
suppliers enjoy a significant initial cost advantage by being exempt from certain policy costs, these cease 
to apply as they gain scale. We find it difficult to understand how in the face of these market dynamics, this 
multitude of sub-scale competitors can develop a viable long-term business model.
Project Daffodil, our innovative free LED light bulb replacement service, has gathered momentum over the 
course of the year, and has now been provided in over 40,000 households. We are now installing free 
light bulbs in around 3,500 households each month; this is available to both new and existing Members 
who have switched their energy and telephony services to us. Daffodil reduces household electricity usage 
for the vast majority of Members receiving this benefit, which goes a long way towards narrowing the gap 
between our energy prices and the introductory tariffs available elsewhere; this has been a major factor 
behind the improvement in the quality of new Members joining the Club, as well as encouraging existing 
Members to add additional services in order to take advantage of this valuable benefit.
In March, we launched a number of films featuring Joanna Lumley as the new face of Utility Warehouse, 
explaining who we are and the benefits we provide to those looking to save money (by joining as a new 
Member) or make money (by becoming a Partner). These new tools were well received, and we have since 
seen an encouraging increase in the number of new Partners joining the business.
We have also taken steps to simplify our customer proposition, replacing the previous choice of benefits 
available to Double Gold Members with an extra 10% discount on the fixed monthly cost of their 
broadband (including landline rental) worth between £31.80 and £46.79 per year.
The mobile app we launched around 12 months ago has gained widespread acceptance, with around 
65,000 Members using it each month to submit meter readings, top-up their mobile and/or CashBack card, 
track their mobile usage, and find their nearest CashBack retail outlets; further functionality will be added in 
due course, including being able to manage their insurance cover.
Our smart meter roll-out programme has been hampered by the persistent failure of one of our meter 
operators (“MOP”) to meet their agreed service levels; in addition to slowing our rollout programme, this 
also affected our ability to install pre-payment meters in a significant part of the country during the second 
half of the year, leading to a temporary small rise in delinquency levels. Notwithstanding these challenges, 
we have now appointed a new MOP to take over this work, and successfully installed over 100,000 meters 
(around 10% of our current base).
We continue to increase our investment in IT and have completed a number of important IT projects during 
the year including strengthening our cyber-defences, PCI compliance, launching Home Insurance, and 
preparing for the mass rollout of smart metering. Telecom Plus PLC  Report and Accounts 2017 8
By virtue of our unique route to market and focus on treating our Members fairly, we have found a balance 
which combines sustainable growth in both service numbers and profitability, thus creating real long term 
value for all our stakeholders. We remain focussed on growing our business to one million households (and 
beyond) over the medium term.
ROUTE TO MARKET
Significant numbers of new Partners continued to join the business during the year, with an improvement 
in both the quality and quantity of new recruits since our annual sales conference in March. At the year 
end we had 41,717 registered Partners; this was below the level we reported 12 months ago largely due 
to our decision last autumn to start providing automatic refunds to many of those who join the business, 
but find themselves unable (for whatever reason) to take advantage of the opportunity we offer to build an 
attractive and secure part-time additional income. These early automatic refunds, combined with the natural 
underlying level of cancellations we would normally expect to see after 12 months, led to a larger reduction 
in the total number of registered partners over the period than would otherwise have occurred.
Whilst it is more challenging for Partners to gather new Members and build their Utility Warehouse 
businesses when there are such large pricing differentials in the energy markets, we have been pleased to 
see many of them still achieve significant success during the year by focussing on the unique strengths of 
our proposition and the exclusive benefits we offer. 
We have invested in providing them with new tools to help them meet this challenge, including the new 
suite of films featuring Joanna Lumley, as well as continuing to improve the personal development and 
training programmes we make available, free of charge, to both new and existing Partners. 
It is encouraging that despite the absence of ‘loss leader’ introductory deals for new Members, the combined 
impact of our improved training courses, effective Partner incentive structure, the unique multi-service 
proposition and attractive benefits we offer to our Members, means we are continuing to see a consistently 
high proportion of new Partners making a successful start to building their Utility Warehouse business. 
BOARD CHANGES
We were delighted to welcome Andrew Blowers as a new independent non-executive director, who joined 
the Board in November. Andrew is currently a non-executive director of AA PLC, the UK’s leading provider 
of roadside assistance, and of CETA Insurance Limited, a specialist online insurance provider. His career 
spans over 25 years in the UK financial services industry, including as founder and CEO of Swiftcover.com, 
Chairman of IIC NV, and an executive director of Churchill Insurance. He is already bringing a valuable 
new perspective to the Board.
As previously reported, Julian Schild, became Chairman of the Audit Committee following the retirement 
of Michael Pavia at last year’s AGM. Andrew Blowers has replaced Julian as Chair of the Remuneration 
Committee, and Beatrice Hollond has become Chair of the Nomination Committee. 
CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT

Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2017 9
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 
The UK Corporate Governance Code (the ‘Code’) encourages the Chairman to report personally on how 
the principles in the Code relating to the role and effectiveness of the Board have been applied.
As a Board we are responsible to the Company’s shareholders for delivering sustainable shareholder value 
over the long term through effective management and good governance. A key role of mine, as Executive 
Chairman, is to provide strong leadership to enable the Board to operate effectively. 
We believe that open and rigorous debate around key strategic issues and risks faced by the Company is 
important in achieving our objectives and the Company is fortunate to have non-executive directors with 
diverse and extensive business experience who actively contribute to these discussions. 
Further detail of the Company’s governance processes and compliance with the Code is set out in the 
Corporate Governance Statement. 
OUTLOOK
Recent Trading
Our annual sales conference took place on 18/19 March 2017, and was attended by over 5,000 Partners. 
At the event, we announced the launch of our Home Insurance service to Members, the introduction of new 
films featuring Joanna Lumley, and a simplification to our ‘Double Gold’ bundle making it more competitive 
and easier to promote. 
Since making these changes, the quality of new Members being gathered by Partners has remained 
exceptionally high, with over 50% switching all their services to us. The number of new Members is running 
slightly ahead of the levels we saw during the corresponding period last year, and we are also seeing 
encouraging numbers of new Partners joining the business.
Energy Prices
Following an extended period in which falling energy commodity prices outweighed the additional costs 
of renewing and extending the distribution network, replacing nuclear and coal-fired generating plants 
that are approaching the end of their useful lives, rolling-out smart meters, funding capacity incentives, 
and paying for the various renewable energy programmes which have been introduced, wholesale energy 
prices have increased significantly since last autumn. This has exerted significant upward pressure on retail 
energy prices, with both standard variable prices and the cheapest introductory deals having increased by 
around £90 and £140 respectively for a typical domestic customer.
It appears that the incoming Government is committed to introducing a widespread cap on standard 
variable tariffs. Whilst the timing of implementation, the level at which the cap would be set, and the 
specific details of whom it would affect are unclear, we strongly welcome this proposal as we believe it 
will create a fairer energy market and make it more difficult for suppliers with large legacy bases to use 
the profits they are earning from disengaged customers to fund cheap introductory deals to those who are 
switching. Whilst the gap between SVTs and the cheapest introductory deals is likely to narrow, the market 
will remain highly competitive, and there are many suppliers who will be unaffected by the proposed price 
cap who will be able to continue offering attractive tariffs to those looking to switch. Telecom Plus PLC  Report and Accounts 2017 10
Our wholesale arrangements, retail pricing structure and low cost base mean the impact of this price cap 
(when implemented) on our profitability is likely to be significantly less than other major suppliers.
Regulatory
The Competition and Markets Authority published their final report on the domestic energy market during 
the year. Whilst we welcomed their proposals to remove the current restrictions on discounts, bundling, and 
the number of tariffs each supplier can offer, we believe they are fundamentally misconceived in believing 
their proposed database of disengaged customers will achieve anything other than greater bureaucracy, 
more costs and increased confusion. We hope this proposal will be quickly abandoned once the mooted 
price cap on standard variable tariffs takes effect. 
Our programme to roll out smart meters for all our Members is well underway, with around 100,000 
(largely dual fuel) meters having been installed by the beginning of June 2017. The programme is expected 
to gather pace over the coming months and we anticipate making good progress this year towards the 
2020 target date. As previously highlighted, the financial benefits from this programme (excluding any 
timing differences which may arise between when costs are incurred and when they are recovered) will 
depend on the speed and efficiency of our roll-out relative to other suppliers. However, the continuing 
delays in finalising the specification of SMETS2 meters, in getting them certified, and in the smart Data 
Communications Company (‘DCC’) testing schedule, have led many commentators to question whether the 
original target completion date for this programme is still achievable, and the level of fulfilment costs (which 
will ultimately be borne by consumers) from trying to do so. 
We remain concerned at the high and increasing costs imposed on the industry in order to comply with 
government policy, much of which seems to be imposed with inadequate thought given to delivering such 
initiatives in a way that will minimise costs, which ultimately get passed on by suppliers to customers 
through higher bills. Examples include the current faster switching initiative, the Green Deal programme, the 
establishment of Smart Energy GB, the structure of the smart meter roll-out programme, the over-engineering 
of the specification for the DCC, and the unrealistic time-frames which are invariably adopted for any 
industry change. 
Regulation has an important role to play in ensuring the energy markets are operating in a transparent 
manner, creating a framework which encourages real competition, protecting the rights of consumers, 
and ensuring they receive a fair deal for their energy. However, it is not clear that the right balance has 
recently always been struck. There needs to be a clearer understanding of the need to reduce the burden of 
regulation which ultimately falls on those least able to afford it – namely domestic customers.
We are disappointed that deregulating the domestic water supply market was absent from the new 
Government’s manifesto; this would have created an exciting new opportunity for us to add the supply of 
water to the existing range of utilities we offer, further extending the benefits to consumers of our integrated 
multi-utility approach. We urge the Government not to miss the chance to introduce competition into this 
market, which would ultimately lead to more choice, lower prices and better service for over 27 million 
households who are currently forced to buy from a local monopoly water supplier.

Prospects
Successfully navigating the constant stream of changes flowing across all the sectors in which we operate is 
challenging, however our experienced senior management team have demonstrated a consistent ability to 
do so in a way which creates significant and growing value for all our stakeholders.
Our mobile proposition is currently more competitive than ever before, due to the imminent abolition of 
EU roaming charges, and the recent improvements we have made to data allowances for some Double 
Gold members. Combined with our recent award from Which? as the UK’s best provider of Broadband 
and Mobile services, these are expected to further reduce mobile churn and increase penetration over the 
coming year.
Sales of Home Insurance policies are expected to increase as we add further underwriters to our panel, 
and progressively start marketing this service to both new and existing Members over the course of the 
year. Whilst our ambitions for the current year are extremely modest, this service has the potential to make 
a material contribution to the business in due course.
Our strategy of achieving consistent high quality growth through delivering savings, simplicity and 
exceptional customer service continues to bear fruit. We have seen a significant improvement in the 
proportion of new Members who are switching all their services to us over the course of the last two years 
(from c.35% to over 50%); these better quality customers have the highest expected lifetime value, although 
they cost significantly more to acquire. Based on recent levels of Partner activity and membership churn, we 
anticipate the number of services we supply will increase by between 5% and 10% over the coming year. 
From a financial perspective, the modest growth in the number of services added over the last few 
years, combined with higher customer acquisition costs (due to both faster growth and better quality new 
Members), and an increasing investment in IT, mean that our adjusted pre-tax profits from continuing 
operations for the current financial year, as previously announced, are likely to be at a similar level to the 
year just ended. The benefit from faster organic growth will, if current trends continue, be reflected in our 
reported results for the following financial year.
In the meantime, and in the absence of unforeseen circumstances, the steadily improving quality of our 
membership base and the good visibility it provides over future revenues and margins, means that we 
expect to increase our dividend to 50p per share for the current year. Our intention going forward is 
to bring our dividend pay-out ratio back to around 85% of adjusted EPS over the medium term, whilst 
maintaining our progressive dividend policy.
It only remains for me to thank my boardroom colleagues for their support and all our staff and Partners for 
their loyalty and hard work during the past year, and to wish each and every one of them success in the 
years to come.

Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2015 12
MARKETS
We supply a wide range of essential services under the Utility Warehouse brand (gas, electricity, landline, 
broadband and mobile) to both domestic and small business Members throughout the UK; these are all 
substantial markets and represent a vast opportunity for further organic growth.
The markets we operate in are dominated by a relatively small number of former monopoly suppliers and 
other owners of infrastructure assets, although in each there are also a number of independent suppliers 
carving out their own niches, generally based on offering highly competitive introductory deals promoted 
through price comparison sites. 
BUSINESS MODEL
We have a fundamentally different business model to any other utility provider in the UK in three key respects:
•  we operate our business as a Discount Club; each of our customers becomes a Member, receiving a level 
of service commensurate with that status;
•  we are the only fully integrated provider of both energy and communications services in the country. This 
enables us to enjoy unparalleled levels of operating efficiency as we are able to spread a single set of 
overheads across the multiple revenue streams that we derive from each of our Members; and 
•  we have a unique route to market, with an ‘army’ of around 40,000 part-time self-employed Partners; 
rather than seeking to attract new Members through expensive advertising or price comparison sites, we 
instead benefit from personal recommendations by both our Partners and our existing Members.
Partners can earn a small percentage of the monthly revenues generated by any Members gathered, 
either personally, or by someone in their team. On a similar basis, we reward our existing Members with 
shopping vouchers when they introduce a new Member to the Club. 
We continue to follow a different strategy to that of our competitors in both the energy and communications 
markets, focussing on delivering an integrated multi-utility proposition that includes three key benefits: 
Savings (compared with the prices they were previously paying), Simplicity (just one convenient monthly bill 
making it easier to manage a significant part of their monthly household budget), and Service (delivered by 
our award-winning UK-based support teams). 
These benefits are supported by our commitment to treating our Members fairly, avoiding the typical 
marketing strategy adopted by our competitors of combining cheap introductory deals for new customers 
with much higher tariffs charged to their legacy customer bases. We believe their approach is not only 
fundamentally unfair on loyal customers, but less likely to create a sustainable long term business, as 
customers who have chosen to switch once based solely on the headline price on a comparison site will 
have a higher propensity to do so again when their introductory deal expires; this view is supported by 
recent switching data within the electricity market for domestic customers, where reported churn amongst 
small and medium suppliers (excluding ourselves) is now running at an annualised rate of over 30%. 
Our alternative approach is to focus on treating all our Members in a fair manner, and to give everyone 
consistently good value on all their services, rewarding loyalty and commitment with additional discounts 
and benefits available to our most valuable and long-standing Members. Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2015 13
The delivery of these core values is critical to our route to market, giving our Partners the confidence to 
promote our services to their friends and family – as well as generating recommendations from existing 
Members who in many cases also become advocates for our brand. The Net Promoter Scores (‘NPS’) of 
around 50 that we consistently achieve reflect our relentless focus on this goal, and are in stark contrast to 
the negative NPS scores prevalent within the utility and telecoms markets. 
Against a backdrop where most of our competitors seem focussed almost solely on price, we believe that 
genuinely earning the Trust of our Members is the key point of differentiation that will enable us to achieve our 
medium-term growth objectives and help us maximise long term shareholder value. By treating our Members 
fairly, as we would like to be treated ourselves, we aim to earn both their loyalty (which delivers long term, 
sustainable revenues) and their enthusiasm for our business model (which creates growth through referrals). 
Examples of this approach include not offering short-term discounts to new Members as an inducement 
to switch, and always allowing existing loyal Members to benefit from any new tariffs we introduce. And 
keeping our best deals and lowest prices for those who have switched the most services to us. 
We continue to invest in our IT systems, which enable us to integrate all the services we supply into a single 
monthly bill, supported by just one set of central overheads (including all administrative and membership 
support functions). This highly efficient cost base is a key factor in enabling us to offer attractive pricing 
and a wide range of valuable benefits to our Members, a secure residual income to our Partners, and a 
growing dividend stream to shareholders. We have embarked on a programme to enhance and update 
these systems over the course of the next three to five years, and look forward to the greater business 
efficiency and flexibility this will deliver in due course.
We have strong commercial relationships with all our key suppliers, who recognise the value of our unique 
route to market and the importance of maintaining our competitive market position. To this end, there 
are ongoing discussions with each of them about how the market dynamics for each of our services are 
changing, and the best way to ensure these are appropriately reflected in our wholesale pricing structure. 
We are extremely pleased with the further progress we have made this year in taking advantage of our multiple 
key points of differentiation, and towards securing our position as the Nation’s most trusted utility provider. 
STRATEGY
Our strategy is to progressively increase our share of the markets in which we operate through organic 
growth, and to build a robust, sustainable and profitable business.
We will achieve this by maintaining our focus on delivering best-in-class service and support to our 
Members, treating them fairly, and investing in our systems and staff. We will seek to simplify and, where 
possible, improve the competitiveness of our services even further, encouraging existing Members to talk 
about the unique benefits we offer to their friends and acquaintances, and making it easier for our Partners 
to promote our services more effectively.
We continue to explore the possibility of expanding our current range of core services into areas where 
we can build upon our existing strong relationship with our Members by offering them both a better 
experience and better value on services they currently obtain from other suppliers, whilst also delivering a 
satisfactory return for our shareholders. This approach is demonstrated by the recently announced launch of  Telecom Plus PLC  Report and Accounts 2017 14
our new Home Insurance service, which we anticipate will be accompanied by a range of other insurance 
products in due course; in the medium term we look forward to supplying water; and in the longer term, 
other potential new services might include television and home emergency cover (including boiler cover), 
and combining the national rollout of smart meters with other ‘connected home’ products and services to 
leverage our position as the only fully integrated multi-utility supplier in the country.
OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE AND NON-FINANCIAL KPIS
Despite a challenging competitive environment, our overall performance for the year has been encouraging 
in a number of key respects:
•  continuing strong organic growth with service numbers up by 107,214 (2016: 88,257)
•  materially higher proportion of Members taking our ‘Double Gold’ bundle
•  launch of our new Home Insurance service
•  successful rollout of Project Daffodil – our free LED light bulb replacement service
•  introduction of new films featuring Joanna Lumley
•  winner of 2017 Best Telecom Services Provider at annual Which? awards
•  Which? ‘Recommended Provider’ for Mobile April 2017
•  Which? ‘Recommended Provider’ for Broadband March 2017
•  consistently high Net Promoter Scores 
Against the background of a slow growing economy, and with household incomes remaining under 
pressure, our value-based consumer proposition and the part-time income opportunity we offer remain 
extremely attractive to both Members and Partners respectively.
Our continuing organic growth is underpinned by high levels of confidence amongst our Partners in 
our brand and financial strength, the good value we provide through our fair pricing policies, and our 
commitment to delivering best-in-class service and support to our Members.

TOTAL CLUB 607,802 598,613
Whilst we continue to regard our Business Club as an exciting long-term opportunity, the dynamics of this 
market make it extremely difficult to grow in the current energy wholesale pricing environment. Our focus 
will therefore remain on the domestic market, until market conditions become more favourable. 
Within the residential Club, there is a significant difference in average expected customer lifetimes between 
Members (and therefore in the revenues and profits they will generate), depending on whether they are an 
owner-occupier, and on the number of services we are providing to them. The most attractive category are 
owner-occupiers taking our ‘Double Gold’ bundle. 
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
CONTINUED  Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
 
Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2017 15
Our focus on attracting this type of Member has been reflected in an increasing proportion of new 
Members switching all their services to us (landline, broadband, mobile, electricity and/or gas) over the 
last two years as can be seen from the following figures:
PERCENTAGE OF NEW MEMBERS TAKING ‘DOUBLE GOLD’ BUNDLE

46.6% Q3 FY17
55.1% Q4 FY17
47.7% Q4 FY16
Individual energy supply point churn remained at around 1.1% per month, driven by collective switching 
initiatives and a record gap during the first half of the year between the introductory fixed price deals 
available from other suppliers and the range of tariffs we offer. In the context of higher levels of switching 
activity throughout the industry, it is pleasing that the proportion of energy customers leaving us remains on 
average significantly below other suppliers:

Services
The full range of services we offer includes landline telephony (calls and line rental), broadband, mobile, 
gas, electricity, and our CashBack card. At the year end, we supplied a total of 2,288,918 services to 
Club Members (2016: 2,181,704), an increase of 4.9% during the year.

TOTAL CLUB 2,288,918 2,181,704
All the core services we provide (landline, broadband, mobile, gas and electricity) grew during the year, 
with the highlight being a 19% rise in the number of mobile services. This increase means that penetration 
of mobile within our residential Club has now reached 35%, and is starting to catch up with our other 
services; this is due to a strategic decision to place mobile at the heart of our retail proposition, and to 
improve its competitive position.
We made 4G available to our Members last Autumn, and have just increased the data allowance for 
Double Gold members on our ValueMax+ tariff to 10GB at no extra cost.
CashBack
Our exclusive CashBack card has proven an important Member acquisition and retention tool. It gives our 
Members the opportunity to achieve additional savings of between 3% and 7% on their shopping at a wide 
range of participating retailers, which they receive as an automatic credit on their next monthly bill from us. 
Since launching the programme, the total value of CashBack funded by participating retailers and credited 
to Members now exceeds £33m (2016: £28m). 
We saw a 5% increase during the year in the number of cards in issue to 188,753 (2016: 179,639), with 
the c.50% of new residential Club Members gathered directly by our Partners applying for a card being 
partially offset by those with inactive cards choosing not to renew when their card expired. We believe this 
continuing strong demand demonstrates the attractiveness of this unique membership benefit, and would be 
even higher were it not for the difficulties faced by some new Members in funding the switch from paying in 
arrears on their credit card, to paying for their purchases in advance with our prepayment card. Telecom Plus PLC  Report and Accounts 2017 18
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
CONTINUED 
Many Members continue to use our online shopping portal to reduce their bills, receiving in aggregate 
around £0.5m of CashBack over the course of last year; this is in addition to any savings from using their 
CashBack cards. 
The CashBack that we pay to our Members each month is funded entirely by the retailers in the programme, 
and many Members achieve a reduction of 20% to 30% on the amount they pay for their utilities simply 
by using their CashBack card (instead of an alternative payment card) for most of their regular household 
shopping, and/or our online shopping portal.
Member Service and Support
We pride ourselves on delivering first-class service to our Members through a single support centre based 
in the UK. We try to ensure where possible that the first person a Member speaks to is able to resolve any 
issues they may have with their multi-utility account.
We have a relentless focus on improving the service experience we deliver to our Members; we readily 
invest in technology that we believe will genuinely achieve this objective, and continually assess the 
numerous qualitative and quantitative performance measurement tools that we employ to monitor all aspects 
of our Members’ interactions with us to improve the overall quality of their experience. 
We have been delighted at the consistently high ratings, awards and recognition we receive from 
Moneywise and in Which? magazine for the quality of the service and support provided to our Members, 
and the overwhelmingly positive feedback we receive from Members in our own surveys. 
We were particularly proud to win ‘Best Telecommunications Services Provider’ at the 2017 Which? 
Awards Ceremony a few weeks ago, alongside being voted UK National Public Champion in the European 
Business Awards. These are clear independent third party endorsements of our commitment to looking after 
our customers, and treating them as we would wish to be treated ourselves.
Partners
Our Partners are one of the key strengths of our business. In contrast to the routes to market adopted by 
other suppliers of similar household services, the alignment of financial interest provided by our revenue-
sharing model, the structure of our compensation plan, and the substantial number of Partners who hold 
equity or share options in the Company, incentivise them to focus their activities on finding creditworthy 
higher-spending Members who will reap the maximum savings from using our services, and will thus be 
least likely to churn; by doing so, they maximise their own long-term income. This ensures that cases of mis-
selling are both inadvertent and extremely rare.
We provide a variety of training and personal development courses, both online and classroom-based, 
designed to provide the skills and knowledge they need to gather Members and recruit other Partners 
effectively and successfully; all of these courses are free to attend. In addition, we offer a hire purchase 
scheme which gives Partners access to a Tablet so they can present the benefits of our unique Discount Club 
more effectively. Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
 
Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2017 19
We introduced a new Quick Income Plan on 1st January 2017, giving Partners the opportunity to 
accelerate some of their residual income. This has been well received, and enables any Partner who wants 
to develop their Utility Warehouse business on a full-time basis, to earn a full-time income whilst they do so. 
As such, it has the potential to transform the way potential new recruits look at this opportunity.
Our Car Plan, which provides eligible Partners with a subsidised Utility Warehouse branded BMW Mini 
(or in some cases a BMW X5), remains extremely popular with around 900 vehicles now delivered (2016: 
c.800). Owners inform us that they find these helpful in raising their local profile, resulting in enquiries from 
both potential new Members and Partners.
Smart Meter roll-out
We have installed around 100,000 smart meters to date notwithstanding operational challenges with one 
of our MOPs which meant we were unable to achieve the number of installations that we had forecast last 
year. Having addressed these issues, our rollout this year is currently running ahead of forecast. 
The industry anticipates the transition from first generation SMETS1 smart meters to second generation 
SMETS2 smart meters will occur this autumn, and we look forward to further accelerating our rollout 
programme thereafter.
In addition to much-debated efficiency benefits, smart meters have the potential to materially improve 
the relationship between customers and energy suppliers. We are therefore broadly supportive of the 
nationwide smart meter programme, albeit we remain concerned over the significant additional costs 
that are being incurred as a result of an ill-conceived and sub-optimum rollout strategy – a cost that will 
ultimately be met by consumers. 
IT Systems 
The journey we embarked on last year to start reviewing the systems and processes which have evolved 
over the course of the last 20 years, and to prepare for the introduction of new services, is gathering steam. 
And while this is creating significant additional costs in the short term, with benefits that may take many 
years to arrive, I am confident that making this investment is the right decision for the business. 
In the meantime, our operating costs remain lower than those of any of our peers on a like-for-like basis, 
and we look forward to the operating efficiencies and performance improvements which our new systems 
are expected to deliver in due course.

As a result of the relative size and historical volatility of share incentive scheme charges (£1.2m), these are excluded from adjusted 
profit before tax and adjusted basic EPS. In view of the size and nature of the charge as a non-cash item, the amortisation of the 
intangible asset (£11.2m) arising on entering into the energy supply arrangements with Npower in December 2013 has also been 
excluded from adjusted profit before tax and adjusted basic EPS. For ease of comparability, following the sale of the Group’s 20% 
shareholding in Opus Energy Group Limited (‘Opus’) in February 2017 (resulting in Opus becoming a discontinued operation), the 
contribution from Opus across all years and the profit from its sale in 2017 have been excluded in the above table. 
SUMMARY
The small decrease in revenue during the year has been driven mainly by lower average energy prices 
as a result of retail gas price reductions in the Spring of 2016, and reduced average energy usage due 
to the continuing impact of energy efficiency measures across the industry combined with a steadily 
increasing number of LED light bulbs installed in our Members’ homes following the progressive successful 
implementation of Project Daffodil (the provision of free LED light bulbs to multi-service Members). These 
negative factors were partly offset by an increase in telephony revenues, resulting from an increasing 
penetration of fibre broadband and some higher fixed monthly charges, and the overall increase in the 
number of services provided to Members. 
The improvement in adjusted pre-tax profits (continuing operations) of 9.1% mainly reflects the continuing 
modest organic growth over the last two years in the number of services we are providing to our Members, 
an increased proportion of revenues from higher margin telephony services relative to energy services, and 
a one-off recovery of £4.2m of costs incurred in prior years relating to the smart meter roll-out programme 
under our energy supply agreement (of which 70% was credited to cost of sales with the remaining 30% 
credited to administrative expenses). These are counterbalanced by recurring higher customer acquisition 
costs, increased investment in staff headcount and higher IT related charges. We also generated an 
exceptional profit of £62.3m during the year from the sale of our 20% shareholding in Opus (see below), 
taking our total statutory post-tax profit to £95.0m (2016: £31.8m).
Within our Customer Acquisition operating segment, losses increased to £18.3m (2016: £14.6m) primarily 
due to the inclusion of a full year of costs from Project Daffodil and an increase in the proportion of new 
Members switching all their services to us.
Distribution expenses reduced slightly to £21.1m (2016: £21.4m), mainly reflecting lower energy 
commissions (following the reduction in energy revenues previously highlighted), partly offset by increased 
commissions paid to Partners on the larger number of services being taken by our growing membership base.
FINANCIAL REVIEW Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
 
Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2017 21
Administrative expenses increased during the year by £2.8m to £55.2m (2016: £52.4m) mainly as a result 
of continued investment in growing staff headcount to sustain our current high standards of customer service 
as the business grows, and higher IT related charges.
Adjusted earnings per share (continuing operations) increased by 7.2% to 53.3p (2016: 49.7p), statutory 
EPS (continuing operations) 38.0p (2016: 32.8p). In accordance with previous guidance and our strong 
cash position, the Board is proposing to pay a final dividend of 25p (2016: 24p) per share, making a total 
dividend of 48p (2016: 46p) per share for the year.
MARGINS
Our overall gross margin for the year was 17.6% (2016: 16.6%) reflecting the shifting mix from energy 
towards higher margin telephony services, and the recovery of previously incurred smart meter rollout costs 
mentioned above. 
CUSTOMER MANAGEMENT 
We have continued to achieve steady growth in the number of services we are supplying, with an increase 
of over 107,000 services during the course of the year. This takes the total number of services provided 
within our Discount Club to almost 2.3 million – an increase of 4.9% compared with the previous year.
We continue to focus on making it easier for Partners to gather new Members by simplifying our processes, 
improving membership benefits, making our prices more competitive, and improving the quality of service 
and support we provide to our membership base. As a result, all our core services have continued to see 
organic growth in a challenging competitive environment.
Revenues decreased slightly overall due to reduced gas pricing and lower average consumption across 
both types of energy service, with growing revenues in all other service areas following increases in the 
number of services being provided:

TOTAL 722.8 727.9
CUSTOMER ACQUISITION
Our Customer Acquisition operating segment loss increased during the year to £18.3m (2016: £14.6m), 
mainly due to the inclusion of a full year of costs relating to Project Daffodil, our free LED replacement light 
bulb offer to multi-service Members, where the mass-rollout started in January 2016.  Telecom Plus PLC  Report and Accounts 2017 22
DISTRIBUTION AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES
Distribution expenses include the share of our revenues that we pay as commission to Partners, together 
with other direct costs associated with gathering new Members which are included as part of the Customer 
Acquisition Segment result for the year. These reduced slightly to £21.1m (2016: £21.4m), mainly 
reflecting lower energy commissions following the industry wide gas price reductions at the start of the 
financial year, partly offset by increased commissions paid to Partners from the increase in new Members 
and services. 
Within administrative expenses, the bad debt charge for the year fell slightly to 1.1% of revenues (2016: 
1.2%), falling in absolute terms to £7.8m (2016: £8.4m).
The number of prepayment meters we installed during the year, many of which were provided at the 
Member’s own request, fell to 5,357 (2016: 6,775), partly due to delays in fitting prepayment meters 
following service level issues with one of our meter operators (‘MOPs’) in the second half of the year; a new 
MOP has recently been appointed to take on this work. At the end of the year we had an installed base 
of 69,828 (2016: 71,026) prepayment meters, representing approximately 7.0% of the energy services 
we supply; this remains significantly below the average level of prepayment meters within the industry of

Delinquency (the proportion of Members who have at least two energy bills outstanding) has been on a 
steady downward trajectory over the last few years, although in the last year it has increased slightly to 
1.15% (2016: 1.09%). This increase is primarily due to a delay in fitting prepayment meters during the 
second half of the year, which resulted from operational challenges with one of our MOPs; this issue should 
be resolved over the coming months following the recent appointment of a new MOP.

The average number of employees increased from 908 to 1,049. This reflects our commitment to continue 
delivering the best possible experience to our Members (increasing numbers of which are taking multiple 
services from us), the additional services we are now supporting (such as Insurance, Daffodil and the 
smart meter roll-out) and a significant ongoing investment in strengthening both our IT resources and our 
management team. Personnel expenses (excluding the non-cash accounting cost of share incentive schemes) 
increased by 14.5% during the year to £35.3m (2016: £30.8m).
Overall, administrative expenses increased during the year by £2.8m to £55.2m (2016: £52.4m) mainly 
as a result of higher staff costs and increased investment in IT, partly offset by the recovery of previously 
incurred smart meter rollout costs mentioned above.
OPUS 
Our 20% stake in Opus Energy Group Limited (‘Opus’) was sold in February 2017, resulting in Opus 
becoming a discontinued operation. The sale resulted in the receipt of £71.1m of cash and an exceptional 
profit from the sale of £62.3m. As explained in the Chairman’s Statement above, we intend to undertake 
a tender offer this summer, through which we will be seeking to return up to £25m of these proceeds to 
shareholders; full details will be sent to shareholders alongside the forthcoming AGM documents. 
CASH, CAPITAL EXPENDITURE AND WORKING CAPITAL
During the year we received an exceptional cash inflow of £71.1m following the sale of our 
shareholding in Opus, paid the £21.5m deferred consideration to Npower, and fully repaid our 
revolving borrowing facilities pending the announced tender offer. We ended the period with no debt 
and a cash balance of £18.7m (2016: cash before borrowings of £35.3m).
As expected, our net working capital position showed a year on year cash outflow of £9.2m primarily 
due to timing differences related to our energy purchasing arrangements with Npower. 
Under the terms of our energy supply arrangements, Npower remains responsible for funding the working 
capital requirements associated with providing energy to Members who have chosen to pay on a Budget Plan.
BORROWINGS 
Our balance sheet at the year-end shows a net cash position of £18.7m with zero debt drawn down 
from our revolving borrowing facilities (2016: net debt of £56.3m), following receipt of the £71.1m 
proceeds from the sale of our shareholding in Opus. Following the return of cash to shareholders under the 
impending share tender offer, the Group’s Net Debt / EBITDA ratio would still remain below 1.0x. 
DIVIDEND 
The final dividend of 25p per share (2016: 24p) will be paid on 28 July 2017 to shareholders on 
the register at the close of business on 7 July 2017 and is subject to approval by shareholders at the 
Company’s Annual General Meeting which will be held on 20 July 2017. This makes a total dividend 
payable for the year of 48p (2016: 46p), an increase of 4.3% compared with the previous year. Telecom Plus PLC  Report and Accounts 2017 24
We believe our strong underlying cash flow, rising adjusted earnings and strong credit profile will enable us 
to refinance any remaining borrowings as they fall due, whilst maintaining a progressive dividend policy. 
In the light of the steadily improving quality of our membership base and the good visibility it provides over 
future revenues and margins, we expect to increase our dividend to 50p per share for the current year. Our 
intention going forward is to bring our dividend pay-out ratio back to around 85% of adjusted EPS over the 
medium term, whilst maintaining our current progressive dividend policy. 
SHARE INCENTIVE SCHEME CHARGES
Operating profit is stated after share incentive scheme charges of £1.2m (2016: £2.5m). These relate to an 
accounting charge under IFRS 2 Share Based Payments (‘IFRS 2’).
As a result of the relative size of share incentive scheme charges as a proportion of our pre-tax profits, 
we are separately disclosing this amount within the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income for 
the period (and excluding these charges from our calculation of adjusted profits and earnings) so that the 
underlying performance of the business can be clearly identified. Our current adjusted earnings per share 
have also therefore been adjusted to eliminate these share incentive scheme charges.
TAXATION
A full analysis of the taxation charge for the year is set out in note 4 to the financial statements. The tax 
charge for the year is £10.4m (2016: £8.9m). 
The effective tax rate for the year was 9.9% (2016: 21.9%), due to the sale of our 20% shareholding in 
Opus on which no tax will be paid as it is eligible for the substantial shareholding exemption. Excluding 
the sale of Opus and the share of profit from Opus in both years, the effective tax rates for 2017 and 2016 
would be 25.5% and 25.4% respectively.

FINANCIAL REVIEW
CONTINUED  Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
 
Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2017 25
BACKGROUND
The Group faces various risk factors, both internal and external, which could have a material impact on long-
term performance. However, the Group’s underlying business model is considered relatively low-risk, with no 
need for management to take any disproportionate risks in order to preserve or generate shareholder value.
The Group continues to develop and operate a consistent and systematic risk management process, which 
involves risk ranking, prioritisation and subsequent evaluation, with a view to ensuring all significant risks 
have been identified, prioritised and (where possible) eliminated, and that systems of control are in place to 
manage any remaining risks. 
A formal document is prepared by the executive directors and senior management team on a regular basis 
detailing the key risks faced by the Group and the operational controls in place to mitigate those risks; this 
document is then reviewed by the Audit Committee. No new principal risks have been identified during 
the period, and save as set out below, nor has the magnitude of any risks previously identified significantly 
changed during the period.
BUSINESS MODEL
The principal risks outlined below should be viewed in the context of the Group’s business model as a 
reseller of utility services (gas, electricity, fixed line telephony, mobile telephony, broadband and insurance 
services) under the Utility Warehouse and TML brands. As a reseller, the Group does not own any of the 
network infrastructure required to deliver these services to its membership base. This means that while the 
Group is heavily reliant on third party providers, it is insulated from all the direct risks associated with 
owning and/or operating such capital intensive infrastructure itself. 
The Group’s services are promoted using ‘word of mouth’ by a large network of independent Partners, who 
are paid solely on a commission basis. This means that the Group has limited fixed costs associated with 
acquiring new Members.
The principal specific risks arising from the Group’s business model, and the measures taken to mitigate 
those risks, are set out below.
REPUTATIONAL RISK
The Group’s reputation amongst its Members, suppliers and Partners is believed to be fundamental to the 
future success of the Group. Failure to meet expectations in terms of the services provided by the Group, 
the way the Group does business or in the Group’s financial performance could have a material negative 
impact on the Group’s performance.
In relation to the service provided to its membership base, reputational risk is principally mitigated through 
the Group’s recruitment processes, a focus on closely monitoring staff performance, including the use of direct 
feedback surveys from Members (Net Promoter Score), and through the provision of rigorous staff training. 
Responsibility for maintaining effective relationships with suppliers and Partners rests primarily with the 
appropriate member of the Group’s senior management team with responsibility for the relevant area. Any 
material changes to supplier agreements and Partner commission arrangements which could impact the Group’s 
relationships are generally negotiated by the executive Directors and ultimately approved by the full Board.
PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES  Telecom Plus PLC  Report and Accounts 2017 26
PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES 
CONTINUED
INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY RISK
The Group is dependent on its proprietary billing and membership management software for the successful 
operation of its business model. This software is developed and maintained in accordance with the 
changing needs of the business by a team of highly skilled, generally long-standing, motivated and 
experienced individuals. The Group relies on this software and any failure in its operation could negatively 
impact service to Members and potentially be damaging to the Group’s brand. 
All significant changes which are made to the billing and membership management software are tested as 
extensively as reasonably practicable before launch and are ultimately approved by the Chief Technology 
Officer and Billing departments in consultation with the Chief Executive as appropriate. 
Back-ups of both the software and underlying billing and membership data are made on a regular basis 
and securely stored off-site. The Group also maintains a disaster recovery facility in a warm standby state in 
the event of a failure of the main system, designed to ensure that a near-seamless service to Members can 
be maintained.
The Group has full strategic control over the source code behind its billing and membership management 
system, thereby removing any risk of future software development not being able to meet the precise 
requirements of the Group.
DATA SECURITY RISK 
The Group processes sensitive personal and commercial data during the course of its business. The 
Group looks to protect customer and corporate information and data and to keep its infrastructure secure. 
A significant breach of cyber security could result in the Group facing prosecution and fines, loss of 
commercially sensitive information, financial losses from fraud and theft, lost productivity from not being 
able to process orders and invoices, and unplanned costs to restore and improve the Group’s security. This 
could damage the Group’s brand and distributor confidence which might take an extended period of time to 
rebuild. Ultimately, individuals’ welfare could be put at risk in the event that the Group was not able to provide 
services or personal data was misappropriated. The Group uses high specification firewalling, network 
segmentation, and multifaceted network and endpoint anti-viral mitigation systems; external consultants are 
also used to conduct penetration testing of the Group’s internal and external IT infrastructure.
LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY RISK
The Group is subject to varying laws and regulations, including possible adverse effects from European 
regulatory intervention. The energy markets in the UK and Continental Europe are subject to comprehensive 
operating requirements as defined by the relevant sector regulators and/or government departments. 
Amendments to the regulatory regime could have an impact on the Group’s ability to achieve its financial 
goals and any failure to comply may result in the Group being fined and lead to reputational damage 
which could impact the Group’s brand. Furthermore, the Group is obliged to comply with retail supply 
procedures, amendments to which could have an impact on operating costs.
The Group is a licenced gas and electricity supplier, and therefore has a direct regulatory relationship with 
Ofgem. If the Group fails to comply with its licence obligations, it could be subject to fines or to the removal 
of its respective licences. Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
 
Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2017 27
Proposed regulatory changes such as the imposition of retail energy price caps, the rapid rollout 
programme of smart energy meters (with the potential for additional costs if existing meters must be 
replaced prior to the end of their planned lives), and the replacement of existing environmental and social 
policies, could all have a potentially significant impact on the sector, and the net profit margins available to 
energy suppliers. 
In general, the majority of the Group’s services are supplied into highly regulated markets, and this could 
restrict the operational flexibility of the Group’s business. In order to mitigate this risk, the Group seeks 
to maintain appropriate relations with both Ofgem and Ofcom (the UK regulators for the energy and 
communications markets respectively), the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (‘BEIS’), 
and the Financial Conduct Authority (‘FCA’). The Group engages with officials from all these organisations 
on a periodic basis to ensure they are aware of the Group’s views when they are consulting on proposed 
regulatory changes or if there are competition issues the Group needs to raise with them.
It should be noted that the regulatory environment for the various markets in which the Group operates is 
generally focussed on promoting competition; it therefore seems reasonable to expect that most potential 
changes will broadly be beneficial to the Group, given the Group’s relatively small size compared to the 
former monopoly incumbents with whom it competes, although these changes, and their actual impact, will 
always remain uncertain.
Political and consumer concern over energy prices and fuel poverty may lead to further reviews of the 
energy market which could result in further consumer protection legislation being introduced through energy 
supply licences with price controls for certain customer segments currently being proposed. In addition, 
political and regulatory developments affecting the energy and telecoms markets within which the Group 
operates may have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, results of operations and overall 
financial condition.
FINANCING RISK
The Group has debt service obligations which may place operating and financial restrictions on the Group. 
This debt could have adverse consequences insofar as it: (a) requires the Group to dedicate a proportion 
of its cash flows from operations to fund payments in respect of the debt, thereby reducing the flexibility of 
the Group to utilise its cash to invest in and/or grow the business; (b) increases the Group’s vulnerability to 
adverse general economic and/or industry conditions; (c) may limit the Group’s flexibility in planning for, 
or reacting to, changes in its business or the industry in which it operates; (d) may limit the Group’s ability 
to raise additional debt in the long term; and (e) could restrict the Group from making larger strategic 
acquisitions or exploiting business opportunities.
Each of these prospective adverse consequences (or a combination of some or all of them) could result in 
the potential growth of the Group being at a slower rate than may otherwise be achieved. Telecom Plus PLC  Report and Accounts 2017 28
FRAUD AND BAD DEBT RISK 
The Group has a universal supply obligation in relation to the provision of energy to domestic customers. This 
means that although the Group is entitled to request a reasonable deposit from potential new Members who 
are not considered creditworthy, the Group is obliged to supply domestic energy to everyone who submits 
a properly completed application form. Where Members subsequently fail to pay for the energy they have 
used (‘Delinquent Members’), there is likely to be a considerable delay before the Group is able to control its 
exposure to future bad debt from them by either switching their smart meters to pre-payment mode, installing 
a pre-payment meter or disconnecting their supply, and the costs associated with preventing such Delinquent 
Members from increasing their indebtedness are not always fully recovered.
Fraud and bad debt within the telephony industry may arise from Members using the services, or being 
provided with a mobile handset, without intending to pay their supplier. The amounts involved are 
generally relatively small as the Group has sophisticated call traffic monitoring systems to identify material 
occurrences of usage fraud. The Group is able to immediately eliminate any further usage bad debt 
exposure by disconnecting any telephony service that demonstrates a suspicious usage profile, or falls into 
arrears on payments.
More generally, the Group is also exposed to payment card fraud, where Members use stolen cards to obtain 
credit (e.g. on their CashBack card) or goods (e.g. Smartphones and Tablets) from the Group; the Group 
regularly reviews and refines its fraud protection systems to reduce its potential exposure to such risks. 
WHOLESALE PRICES RISK
The Group does not own or operate any utility network infrastructure itself, choosing instead to purchase 
the capacity needed from third parties. The advantage of this approach is that the Group is protected from 
technological risk, capacity risk or the risk of obsolescence, as it can purchase the amount of each service 
required to meet its Members’ needs. 
Whilst there is a theoretical risk that in some of the areas in which the Group operates it may be unable 
to secure access to the necessary infrastructure on commercially attractive terms, in practice the pricing of 
access to such infrastructure is either regulated (as in the energy market) or subject to significant competitive 
pressures (as in telephony and broadband). The profile of the Group’s Members, the significant quantities 
of each service they consume in aggregate, and the Group’s clearly differentiated route to market has 
historically proven attractive to infrastructure owners, who compete aggressively to secure a share of the 
Group’s growing business.
The supply of energy has different risks associated with it. The wholesale price can be extremely volatile, 
and Member demand can be subject to considerable short term fluctuations depending on the weather. The 
Group has a long-standing supply relationship with npower under which the latter assumes the substantive 
risks and rewards of hedging and buying energy for the Group’s Members, and where the price paid by 
the Group is set by reference to the average of the standard variable tariffs charged by the ‘Big 6’ to their 
domestic customers less an agreed discount; this may not be competitive against the wholesale prices paid 
by new and/or other independent suppliers. However, if the Group did not have the benefit of this long 
term supply agreement it would be exposed to the pricing risk of securing access to the necessary energy 
on the open market and the costs of balancing.
PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES 
CONTINUED Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
 
Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2017 29
COMPETITIVE RISK
The Group operates in highly competitive markets and significant service innovations or increased price 
competition could impact future profit margins. In order to maintain its competitive position, there is a 
consistent focus on ways of improving operational efficiency. New service innovations are monitored 
closely by senior management and the Group is generally able to respond within an acceptable timeframe 
by offering any new services using the infrastructure of its existing suppliers. The increasing proportion of 
Members who are benefiting from the genuinely unique multi-utility solution that is offered by the Group, 
and which is unavailable from any other known supplier, is considered likely to materially reduce any 
competitive threat.
The Directors anticipate that the Group will face continued competition in the future as new companies enter 
the market and alternative technologies and services become available. The Group’s services and expertise 
may be rendered obsolete or uneconomic by technological advances or novel approaches developed by 
one or more of the Group’s competitors. In the event that smaller independent energy suppliers were to 
experience financial difficulties as a result of increasing wholesale prices for instance, it is possible that 
customers could also have a loss of confidence in the Group, given that it is also an independent energy 
supplier. The existing approaches of the Group’s competitors or new approaches or technologies developed 
by such competitors may be more effective or affordable than those available to the Group. There can be 
no assurance that the Group will be able to compete successfully with existing or potential competitors or 
that competitive factors will not have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial condition 
or results of operations. However, as the Group’s membership base continues to rise, competition amongst 
suppliers of services to the Group is expected to increase. This has already been evidenced by various 
volume-related growth incentives which have been agreed with the Group’s three largest wholesale 
suppliers. This should also ensure that the Group has direct access to new technologies and services 
available to the market.
INFRASTRUCTURE RISK
The provision of services to the Group’s Members is reliant on the efficient operation of third party physical 
infrastructure. There is a risk of disruption to the supply of services to Members through any failure in 
the infrastructure e.g. gas shortages, power cuts or damage to communications networks. However, 
as the infrastructure is generally shared with other suppliers, any material disruption to the supply of 
services is likely to impact a large part of the market as a whole and it is unlikely that the Group would 
be disproportionately affected. In the event of any prolonged disruption isolated to the Group’s principal 
supplier within a particular market, services required by Members could in due course be sourced from 
another provider.
ENERGY INDUSTRY ESTIMATION RISK
A significant degree of judgement and estimation is required in order to determine the actual level of energy 
used by Members and hence that should be recognised by the Group as sales. There is an inherent risk that 
the estimation routines used by the Group do not in all instances fully reflect the actual usage of Members. 
However, this risk is mitigated by the relatively high proportion of Members who provide meter readings on 
a periodic basis, and the rapid anticipated growth in the installed base of smart meters resulting from the 
national rollout programme. Telecom Plus PLC  Report and Accounts 2017 30
GAS LEAKAGE WITHIN THE NATIONAL GAS DISTRIBUTION NETWORK
The operational management of the national gas distribution network is outside the control of the Group. 
There is a risk that the level of leakage in future could be higher than those historically experienced, and 
above the level currently expected.
KEY MAN RISK
The Group is dependent on its key management for the successful development and operation of its 
business. In the event that any or all of the members of the key management team were to leave the 
business, it could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s operations.
SINGLE SITE RISK
The Group operates from one principal site and, in the event of significant damage to that site through fire 
or other issues, the operations of the Group could be adversely affected.
ACQUISITION RISK
The Group may invest in other businesses, taking a minority, majority or 100% equity shareholding, or 
through a joint venture partnership. Such investments may not deliver the anticipated returns, and may 
require additional funding in future.

EMPLOYEES
We rely on the combined efforts of around 1,000 employees to manage relationships with both our 
Members and Partners, and deliver a consistently high quality of service at all times. We pay considerable 
attention to recruiting, developing and retaining people with appropriate skills.
We continue to recruit new members of staff through our own Assessment Centre designed to give the 
Company greater control over the recruitment process and to ensure we select the very best candidates for 
our positions. Once they have joined, new starters go through a structured training programme to ensure 
that they are fully equipped to resolve any queries from our membership and to provide the high level of 
service that we demand. Everyone who successfully completes this programme celebrates their achievement 
at a quarterly Academy graduation ceremony, where they are presented with a certificate and Champagne 
by the Chief Executive.
This year we have introduced our own Technical Advisor Apprenticeships, working with an accredited 
provider. This is proving to be very successful and we believe will play an important role in our long-term 
recruitment plans. 
The combination of valuing and developing our staff, our service-oriented culture and the day-to-day 
reinforcement of our core values are key competitive advantages in enabling us to attract and retain a 
motivated, talented and diverse workforce. 
We continue to invest in our people, evolving and refreshing our Manager and Team Leader development 
programmes, which are accompanied by selective executive coaching. We have recently launched a 
new online learning portal to assist in the development of all our employees; the content of which is under 
continual review. We promote from within where possible into both specialist and managerial roles. 
Our monthly employee recognition awards (known internally as ‘Piggy Awards’) enable the Company to 
celebrate and reward employees who have gone ‘over and above’ in the performance of their role. 
We actively seek to engage all our employees in changes that may concern them, rather than just a 
representative few on a committee. Focus groups are held on a continual basis to ensure that any changes 
we have introduced continue to encourage our staff to perform to their best. Regular lunches and teas are 
held with staff across the Company, hosted by members of the senior management team to ensure that they 
are kept abreast of employee concerns. We also keep employees informed on a regular basis of the financial 
performance of the business and other matters of potential concern to them, through the Company intranet, 
ad-hoc emails, the monthly Company newsletter and quarterly breakfast forums with the Chief Executive.
Our intranet ‘Babble’ provides a channel to communicate with staff as well as a platform for hosting 
communities and forums. Amongst our many communities we boast a Book Club, Film Club (with regular 
film showings in our auditorium), Guitar Club, Football Teams and an Art Club. We are particularly proud 
of our Art Club that curated an exhibition composed of works of art from members of our staff, which are 
exhibited across the Company.
PEOPLE AND ORGANISATION Telecom Plus PLC  Report and Accounts 2017 32
We operate an ‘open-door’ policy throughout the business and provide employees with various mechanisms 
for providing feedback and making suggestions. This year we continued our tradition and held our very 
own ‘Dragons’ Den’ competition, ‘The Piggies’ Pen’ to elicit innovative suggestions for improving our 
business from our staff, and were delighted with the high number of entries from both individuals and teams 
within the Company. 
We have an active staff social committee which organises a wide range of events, supported by the 
Company, including the annual summer and Christmas parties quiz nights and many other ad hoc fun 
events. This year we also hosted our first Santa’s Grotto and Panto for all our staff and their children. We 
also have a ‘Fun Fund’ set aside for individual departmental social events.
We promote staff wellbeing, through an employee assistance helpline, periodic at-desk massages, healthy 
meal options in the staff restaurant and a cycle to work scheme. Each September we run our ‘Fit Pig Week’ 
to promote health and well-being within the Company with a range of fun events and initiatives, such as 
offering well-being check-ups. We now have a nurse who comes in periodically to assist our staff with 
general well-being and health issues.
Our headquarters building has been designed to offer our staff a much-enhanced working environment. 
In addition to offering state of the art facilities, the offices include design features to inspire our staff and 
encourage collaboration. Spacious and light, there are break out rooms on all floors and a recreation suite 
that boasts a wide-screen TV lounge, pods for relaxing in, plenty of seating areas and a library area with 
table-tennis and pool tables. We host a brasserie style eatery, complete with its own Deli Bar. This subsidised 
restaurant is an ever-popular benefit for our staff and provides a great venue for the staff social events. With 
the exception of our logistics team, all our employees work together in Network HQ, our new Head Office 
building in London. We provide a wide range of other staff benefits including a discount on the services we 
provide, employee loans at preferential interest rates, a generous Christmas bonus scheme, Gourmet Society 
dining membership and recognition for 5, 10 and 15 years’ service.
The Company operates an HM Revenue and Customs approved employee share option plan, under which 
employees are granted options to purchase shares in the Company which are exercisable between three and 
ten years from the date of grant. The exercise price is the market price at the time of granting the option. Our 
policy is to issue options to all employees after the satisfactory completion of their probationary period, and 
additional options when 10 years’ service has been completed and in other appropriate circumstances (e.g. 
promotion). As at 31 March 2017 there were outstanding options over 2,325,716 shares which had been 
granted to staff, representing approximately 2.9% of the issued share capital of the Company. 
The Company also operates a Save As You Earn (SAYE) share scheme under which employees are offered 
the opportunity to participate in the future growth of the Company through share option arrangements. We 
were pleased that over 85 members of our staff participate in the scheme.
Employees returning from maternity leave with children less than 12 months old are able to benefit from a 
company contribution towards the cost of an external childcare service provider of their choice. We also 
provide facilities for staff to purchase childcare vouchers in a tax-efficient manner using a salary sacrifice 
scheme, in accordance with HM Revenue and Customs guidelines.

Participants can choose their own contribution level, which is matched by the Company within certain 
limits, depending on length of service. As a result of pension auto-enrolment the Company is contributing to 
the pension funds of virtually all employees, on a monthly basis.
We actively facilitate ‘Access to Work’ grants for employees who have a disability, health or mental health

ENVIRONMENT
We are conscious of the role we have to play in minimising the environmental impact of our activities.
We operate an energy efficiency helpline to provide advice to Members on how they can reduce their 
energy usage; we enable qualifying Members to access free home insulation; we actively promote Feed-In 
Tariffs; and we encourage Members to monitor their energy usage by providing regular meter readings.
Since moving to an online Member application process, we have increasingly reduced the amount 
of printed marketing materials we are using, and seen a significant increase in the proportion of new 
Members choosing not to receive a paper bill each month.
We participate in a waste paper recycling programme, with a certificated saving of 235 trees and 
43,710kg of CO2 during the year (2016: 337 trees and 45,720kg of CO2); we also recycle all of our 
cardboard, and use only fsc-certified paper. We recycle both mobile phones and toner cartridges.
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS STATEMENT
The greenhouse gas (‘GHG’) emissions statement below provides a summary of the Group’s greenhouse

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT
The Board is pleased to report that during the year and as at the date of this Annual Report the Company 
has applied the main principles and complied with the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code 
(“the Code”) issued by the Financial Reporting Council in September 2014, save in the limited instances 
explained below. Copies of the Code are available at www.frc.org.uk.
This report, together with the Director’s Report on pages 74 to 79 and the Directors’ Remuneration Report 
on pages 51 to 73, provides details of how the Company has applied the principles and complied with 
the provisions of the Code and where required explains the rationale for instances where the Company 
has not been compliant, namely: (i) the external facilitation of a Board evaluation exercise; and (ii) the 
requirement for share awards to be phased rather than being granted in blocks. Further detail in relation to 
the Company’s position regarding performance-related elements of remuneration is set out in the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report.
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS
The Board meets regularly to review the progress of the Company and to discuss the measures required for 
its future development. Directors are provided in advance with a formal agenda of matters to be discussed 
at each meeting, and with the detailed information needed to monitor the progress of the Company. 
Records of meetings and the decisions of the Board are maintained by the Company Secretary and are 
approved by the Board at the following meeting. All directors have access to the advice and services of the 
Company Secretary and, if required, are able to take independent advice at the Company’s expense in the 
furtherance of their duties. Any question of the removal of the Company Secretary is a matter for the Board 
as a whole. Whilst the members of the Board are all experienced and well qualified, the opportunity to 
receive further training at the Company’s expense is available to them. The non-executive directors attended 
such formal, externally facilitated courses as they considered relevant to their roles and responsibilities 
during the year.
BOARD DUTIES
The matters specifically reserved for decision by the Board are fully documented and include the following 
principal areas:
• reviewing and agreeing the Company’s strategy and long term objectives;
• assessing performance in the light of the Company’s strategy and objectives;
• ensuring an effective system of risk management and internal controls is in place;
•  approving changes to the structure, size and composition of the Board and reviewing its performance 
on an annual basis;
• reviewing the Company’s overall corporate governance arrangements; and
• approval of the Company’s financial statements prior to publication.
Matters that are specifically delegated to the committees of the Board are documented in the various Terms of 
Reference of each committee which are available on the Company’s website (www.utilitywarehouse.co.uk). Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements

Michael Pavia retired from the Board on 22 July 2016, Beatrice Hollond and Andrew Blowers were appointed to 
the Board on 26 September 2016 and 21 November 2016 respectively.
In accordance with provision A.4.2 of the Code, the non-executive directors also met without the executives 
present during the year.
BOARD EVALUATION
The directors recognise that the Code requires an external evaluation of the boards of FTSE 350 companies 
to be carried out at least every three years. However, the directors considered the position in relation to the 
current year and concluded that an external evaluation was not necessary. In reaching this conclusion the 
directors were mindful of the effective operation of the Board during the year and the results of the internal 
Board evaluation exercise detailed below. The Board considers it unlikely that an external evaluation will 
be conducted in the medium term.
An internal evaluation of the Board for the current year was conducted through the completion of formal 
detailed board, and board committee evaluation questionnaires by each director. In addition, a review 
involving each director (excluding those who had joined during the year), was carried out. This review 
was conducted by the Deputy Chairman and Company Secretary and principally covered the following 
areas: specific matters of concern arising from the board evaluation questionnaires, individual directors’ 
performances and key objectives for the coming year, and the identification of any specific training and 
development requirements. Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2017 40
The evaluation questionnaires were focussed on assessing effectiveness in the following key areas:
• the size and balance of the Board;
• the quality of board debates and its decision making processes;
• the individual contributions made by each director;
• the Chairman’s approach to leadership;
• the non-executive directors’ challenge of the executive directors;
• the Board’s approach to identifying and mitigating key business risks;
• the quality of the Company’s communications with key stakeholders; 
• the Board’s consideration of diversity and succession planning; and
• the induction and training of board members.
In accordance with provision B.6.3 of the Code and building on the results of the evaluation questionnaires, 
the Deputy Chairman led a separate evaluation of the performance of the Chairman. This evaluation 
principally comprised a review of the Chairman’s leadership style and tone in promoting effective decision-
making and ensuring constructive and sufficient debate took place around key issues. The results of this 
evaluation were entirely satisfactory.
The evaluation concluded that overall the Board and its Committees had operated satisfactorily during the 
year, with all directors making an effective contribution to the Board commensurate with their experience 
and responsibilities. However, the evaluation highlighted that communications between the full Board and 
the Company’s brokers could be improved; as a result it was agreed that key representatives from the 
Company’s brokers be invited to attend a full Board meeting in the autumn. 
BOARD BALANCE
The Board comprised three executive directors and four non-executive directors at the year end. Julian 
Schild acted as the Company’s Deputy Chairman and Senior Independent Non-Executive Director. 
Membership of each committee of the Board is set out in the table below:

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT
CONTINUED Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2017 41
As confirmed in last year’s Annual Report, Beatrice Hollond joined the Board in September 2016 as a new 
independent non-executive director. Ms Hollond has become a member of the Audit and Remuneration 
Committees and chairs the Nomination Committee of the Board. 
Mindful of the Code requirement to ensure a progressive refreshing of the Board, the Nomination 
Committee continued to implement its plan for non-executive director succession during the year. As such, 
Andrew Blowers was appointed to the Board as a new independent non-executive director in November 
2016. Mr Blowers has become a member of the Audit Committee and now chairs the Remuneration 
Committee of the Board. Further detail on the appointment of Mr Blowers is set out in the Nomination 
Committee report. 
As a result of his long service on the Board since appointment in late 2006, Melvin Lawson is no longer 
considered independent under the Code, and chose to step down from membership of the Audit and 
Remuneration Committees during the year. Nonetheless, the Board considers that the independence of Mr 
Lawson has not been negatively impacted by his long service on the Board and that he continues to provide 
robust constructive challenges to the executive directors on a regular basis by using his long-established 
knowledge of the Company. 
The Board believes that the addition of two new independent non-executive directors to the board during 
the year has strengthened the Company’s compliance with one of the key supporting principles of the 
Code in relation to the composition of the board, namely that the board should include an appropriate 
combination of executive and non-executive directors (and, in particular, independent non-executive 
directors) such that no individual or small group of individuals can dominate the board’s decision making.
BOARD DIVERSITY
The main objective of the Nomination Committee in considering the appointment of new directors to the 
Board remains to ensure that successful candidates are of the highest calibre and demonstrate the best 
possible combination of skills and experience. The Committee’s Terms of Reference further stipulate that 
candidates from a wide range of backgrounds shall be considered and that due regard will be given to the 
benefits of diversity on the Board.
The Code requires companies to set out any measurable objectives that exist in relation to board diversity. 
However, it remains the Committee’s strong view that it is not appropriate to stipulate the characteristics of any 
future directors, including gender, ahead of a full assessment of the particular requirements of each role at 
the time a candidate is being sought. The Committee will continue to adhere to the principles set out above in 
identifying and recruiting the best candidates for any future Board roles in a non-discriminatory manner.
Further detail regarding the Company’s position in relation to encouraging diversity within all layers of the 
organisation is set out in the ‘People and Organisation’ section of the Strategic Report on pages 31 to 33. Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2017 42
EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER
There is a clear division of responsibilities at the head of the Company with the Executive Chairman 
responsible for developing the strategic direction of the business and ensuring the effective operation of 
the Board, including compliance with principles of good corporate governance, and the Chief Executive 
primarily responsible for implementing strategy and running the Group’s operations on a day to day basis. 
As appropriate, and in order to ensure good corporate governance, the Executive Chairman is assisted 
by the Company’s independent non-executive Deputy Chairman in ensuring compliance with the effective 
operation of the Board. 
The division of responsibilities between the Executive Chairman and Chief Executive has been set out in 
writing and agreed by the Board in accordance with the Code (provision A.2.1).
SUPPLY OF INFORMATION
Information is supplied to the Board in a timely manner with board papers and accounts being provided in 
advance of meetings. When the Board requests additional information it is provided.
RE-ELECTION
The Company’s Articles stipulate that one third of all directors are required to retire by rotation at each 
Annual General Meeting and all newly appointed directors are required to offer themselves for election by 
the shareholders at the next Annual General Meeting. 
However, the Code requires that all directors of FTSE 350 companies be subject to annual re-election by 
shareholders. Therefore, all the directors will be submitted for re-election at the forthcoming Annual General 
Meeting in July. Acknowledging the Code requirement for a particularly rigorous review in circumstances 
where non-executive directors’ terms are being extended beyond six years, the Board has determined that 
all directors submitted for re-election continue to make a valuable contribution to the commercial success 
of the Company, with each bringing a complementary range of skills to the team. In particular, and as 
referred to above, the Board has considered the long service of Melvin Lawson and has determined that he 
continues to provide an extremely valuable independent contribution to the Board as a result of his deep 
historic knowledge of the business and its operations. 
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
The Board has a Remuneration Committee whose responsibility is to ensure that the remuneration 
of executive directors is sufficient to attract, retain and motivate people of the highest calibre. The 
Remuneration Committee comprises three independent non-executive directors, namely Andrew Blowers 
(Chairman of the Committee), Julian Schild and Beatrice Hollond. The Directors’ Remuneration Report, 
giving the details of the emoluments of each director, may be found on pages 51 to 73.
The Remuneration Committee has written terms of reference, available on the Company’s website  
(www.utilitywarehouse.co.uk), which describe the authority and duties which have been delegated to it by 
the Board.

AUDIT COMMITTEE
The Audit Committee comprises three independent non-executive directors, Julian Schild (Chairman of

The activities of the Audit Committee are set out on pages 47 to 50.
The Audit Committee has written terms of reference, available on the Company’s website  
(www.utilitywarehouse.co.uk), which describe the authority and duties which have been delegated to it

NOMINATION COMMITTEE
The Nomination Committee comprises Beatrice Hollond (Chairman of Committee), Julian Schild and Charles 
Wigoder and therefore has a majority of independent non-executive directors in compliance with the Code 
(provision B.2.1). The main purpose of the Nomination Committee is to make recommendations to the 
Board on the appointment of new directors.
The Nomination Committee has written terms of reference, available on the Company’s website  
(www.utilitywarehouse.co.uk), which describe the authority and duties which have been delegated to it  
by the Board. 
The activities of the Nomination Committee are set out on pages 45 to 46.
RELATIONS WITH SHAREHOLDERS
It is the policy of the Company to maintain a dialogue with institutional shareholders and to keep them 
informed about the objectives of the business. The Board considers that it is appropriate for the executive 
directors to discuss any relevant matters regarding company performance with major shareholders and this 
is undertaken primarily by the Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer. The Chief Executive provides 
feedback from major shareholders to the other directors, ensuring that Board members, and in particular 
non-executive directors, develop a balanced understanding of the views of major investors. The executive 
directors met with a number of the Company’s main shareholders during the year.
The Executive Chairman, Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer also have periodic discussions 
with the Company’s brokers and any issues are fed back to the Board as appropriate. When reports are 
received from the Company’s brokers following investor presentations, these are submitted to the Board for 
review. Additionally the non-executive directors have at least one opportunity each year to meet with the 
Company’s brokers to discuss any issues.
Responsibility for communication with key shareholders in relation to corporate governance and Board 
remuneration matters lies primarily with the Deputy Chairman and the Chairman of the Remuneration 
Committee who are assisted in this regard by the Company Secretary. Individual invitations to engage 
with the Deputy Chairman have previously been sent out to key shareholders and, where requested or 
considered necessary, certain matters have been discussed in more detail during the year. Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2017 44
ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING
Notice of the Annual General Meeting and related papers are sent to all shareholders at least 21 working 
days before the meeting. Separate resolutions are proposed for each matter including the adoption of the 
Report and Accounts, the approval of the Company’s Remuneration Policy, the Directors’ Remuneration Report 
and the appointment of the Group’s external auditor. Proxy votes are counted and the meeting is advised of 
the number of proxies lodged for and against each resolution. The chairmen of the Audit, Remuneration and 
Nomination committees and the remaining non-executive directors are normally available to answer questions. 
Shareholders who attend are invited to ask questions and take part in the meeting.
INTERNAL CONTROL
The Board acknowledges its responsibility for the Group’s systems of internal control and risk management. 
However it recognises that any system can only provide reasonable, and not absolute, assurance against 
material misstatement or loss. The principal risks faced by the Company and the measures taken to address 
these risks are set out in the Strategic Report on pages 25 to 30.
In conjunction with the Company’s senior management team, the executive directors regularly identify, 
review and evaluate the key risks faced by the Group and the effectiveness of the internal controls in 
place to mitigate these risks. The results of these reviews are recorded in a formal document which sets 
out a detailed evaluation of each risk and the associated internal control in place to mitigate that risk. The 
document is reported to the Audit Committee and the Company’s external auditor for review at least once 
per year.
The Board of directors has continued to review the internal controls of the Company (including financial, 
operational and compliance controls and risk management) and the principal risks which the Company 
faces during the year. No material weaknesses in internal controls were identified during the year. 
The disclosures regarding internal controls do not encompass the Company’s former investment in the 
associate Opus Energy Group Limited.
SHARE CAPITAL AND VOTING RIGHTS
Details of the Company’s share capital and substantial shareholdings can be found in the Directors’ Report 
under the capital structure and substantial shareholders sections on pages 76 and 77.

NOMINATION COMMITTEE REPORT 
INTRODUCTION
Following the retirement of Michael Pavia in July 2016, the chairmanship of the Committee was assumed 
by Beatrice Hollond following her appointment to the Board as a non-executive director. The other members 
of the Committee are Julian Schild and Charles Wigoder, which means that the Committee retains a 
majority of independent non-executive directors in compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code 
(“the Code”) (provision B.2.1).
The key responsibilities of the Nomination Committee include:
•  making recommendations to the Board on the appointment of new non-executive and executive directors, 
including making recommendations as to the composition of the Board generally and the balance 
between executive and non-executive directors;
•  giving consideration to succession planning for directors and other senior executives;
•  reviewing on an annual basis the time required from non-executive directors and assessing whether the 
non-executive directors are spending enough time to fulfil their duties;
•  reviewing the re-election by shareholders of directors under the annual re-election provisions of the Code; 
and
•  evaluating any matters relating to the continuation in office of any director including the suspension or 
termination of service of an executive director.
THE COMMITTEE’S ACTIVITIES FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2017
The Committee met informally on a number of occasions during the year and Committee matters were also 
discussed formally as part of certain full Board meetings. 
Recruitment of new independent non-executive director
The Committee’s principal activity during the year related to the identification and evaluation of a new 
independent non-executive director. As previously indicated, the Committee was keen to identify candidates 
with experience in the retail insurance industry given the Company’s plans to expand into this area in 
future. To meet this specific requirement, an external search consultancy, Korn Ferry, was instructed to draw 
up a shortlist of suitable candidates for consideration by the Committee.
From this shortlist, a small number of candidates were invited to meet the non-executive directors and 
Executive Chairman, acting on behalf of the Board, to evaluate their suitability for this role.
From these, Andrew Blowers was selected as the strongest candidate by the Committee. Mr Blowers is 
currently a non-executive director of AA PLC, the UK’s largest provider of roadside assistance, and of CETA 
Insurance Limited, a specialist online insurance provider. His career spans over 25 years in the UK financial 
services industry. He was the founder and CEO of Swiftcover.com and Chairman of IIC NV from 2004 
to 2009 and an executive director of Churchill Insurance before this. He also displayed a keen interest in 
joining the Board.
Andrew joined the Board in November 2016 and has become a member of the Audit Committee and 
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee. Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2017 46

Korn Ferry does not have any other connection with the Company.
Other activities
Other discussions concerning Committee matters during the year principally related to the appropriateness 
of the composition of the Board given the Company’s operations and medium-term strategic objectives, and 
succession planning for senior management. Aside from the appointment of Andrew Blowers described 
above, no other changes to the Board were deemed necessary during the year.

objectives that exist in this regard is included in the Corporate Governance Statement on page 41 of this

INTRODUCTION
Following the retirement of Michael Pavia in July 2016, independent non-executive Deputy Chairman Julian 
Schild became chairman of the Audit Committee (“the Committee”). The other members of the Committee 
include independent non-executive directors Beatrice Hollond and Andrew Blowers. In accordance with 
the UK Corporate Governance Code (“the Code”) (provision C.3.1) the Committee comprises three 
independent non-executive directors. Julian Schild is also identified as having recent and relevant financial 
experience. 
THE AUDIT COMMITTEE
Attendance at Committee meetings during the current year by Committee members is set out in the 
Corporate Governance Report on page 39 of this document. In accordance with best practice, the 
Committee has the opportunity, as required, to meet with the external auditor of the Company without the 
presence of any executive directors and has done so during the current year. 
The key responsibilities of the Committee include:
•  reviewing the appointment, re-appointment and removal of the external auditor and the direction of the 
external auditor to investigate any matters of particular concern;
•  assessing the effectiveness of the Company’s external auditor, including considering the scope and results 
of the annual audit; 
•  reviewing the independence and objectivity of the external auditor and assessing any potential impact on 
objectivity resulting from the provision of non-audit services by the external auditor;
•  monitoring the integrity of the financial statements of the Company and any formal announcements 
relating to the Company’s performance; and
•  reviewing the Company’s internal financial controls and other internal control and risk management 
processes.
The senior management team and executive directors periodically review the effectiveness of key internal 
control and risk management processes within the Company and report any changes in such activities to 
the Audit Committee and the external auditor for consideration. The review covers all material controls, 
including financial, operational and compliance controls. 
THE COMMITTEE’S ACTIVITIES FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2017
The Committee’s main activities during the year included a review of the financial statements involving a 
detailed evaluation of the significant accounting issues therein. 
AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2017 48
The actions taken by the Committee in regard to these issues are described in the table below. 
ISSUE ACTION TAKEN BY THE COMMITTEE
Operational accuracy of billing system Review of internal analysis and external auditor 
procedures.
Monitoring of regulator communications (Ofgem, BABT) 
and monthly monitoring of detailed call centre statistics 
which would indicate significant billing issues.
Revenue recognition in relation to energy services Monitoring of key assumptions underlying the recognition 
of energy revenues based on internal analysis.
Valuation of intangible assets Review of key assumptions underlying the value and 
recoverability of the intangible asset relating to the 
energy supply agreement entered into with Npower in 
December 2013.
Risk of management override of internal controls Review of significant accounting estimates and 
judgements in relation mainly to receivables balances.
Also, in conjunction with the Company’s external auditor, the Audit Committee has considered, amongst 
other matters, compliance with the provisions of the Code and accounting developments, the Company’s 
financial control environment and its risk management and control processes. As part of this process the 
Audit Committee has also considered the need for any special projects or internal investigations and 
concluded that no such additional projects or investigations have been required. 
In accordance with the Code (provision C.3.6), the Audit Committee has also considered the need for 
an internal audit function at the Company. In the light of the simplicity of the Group structure, its single 
country focus, its relatively straightforward financial model, the internal controls in place and the fact that 
management and the Board conduct regular financial reviews, the Committee has recommended to the Board 
that an internal audit function is not currently appropriate for the business. This decision will be kept under 
regular review and where appropriate extended assurance will also be sought in specific areas of concern. 
During the year the Audit Committee reviewed and approved the Company’s half year and annual financial 
statements. The Committee has advised the Board that the annual report and accounts taken as a whole 
provide a fair, balanced and understandable picture of the Company’s position and performance, business 
model and strategy. The Audit Committee has also been involved in discussions regarding the forthcoming 
implementation of IFRS 15: Revenue from contracts with customers, and the potential impact of the standard 
on the financial statements of the Company.
As detailed further below, the Audit Committee also reviewed the Company’s non-audit fee policy during 
the year.
EXTERNAL AUDITOR EFFECTIVENESS
The Company’s external auditor, KPMG, presented a detailed audit report to the Audit Committee following 
a review of the annual financial statements. Having regard to its review of the work performed by the 
external auditor during the year and its approach to key audit issues, the Audit Committee was satisfied 
with the effectiveness of KPMG as external auditor. 
AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT
CONTINUED Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2017 49
In reaching this conclusion, the Committee assessed:
•  the efficiency with which the audit team was able to understand the Company and its systems and 
processes;
• the experience and expertise of the audit team;
• the scope and eventual fulfilment of the detailed audit plan;
•  the robustness and perceptiveness of the audit team in their handling of key accounting and audit 
judgements; and
• the nature and quality of the content of the external auditor’s report.
The Committee has therefore recommended to the Board, for approval by shareholders at the AGM, the 
reappointment of KPMG as the Company’s external auditor for the coming year. 
EXTERNAL AUDITOR INDEPENDENCE 
The Audit Committee reviewed the Company’s non-audit fee policy during the year. In order to guard 
against the objectivity and independence of the external auditor being compromised, the provision of any 
significant additional services remains subject to the prior approval of the Audit Committee. 
In accordance with the new policy, the Committee would normally be likely to prohibit the provision of the 
following types of non-audit related work by the Company’s external auditor:
•  tax services relating to: (i) preparation of tax forms; (ii) payroll tax; (iii) customs duties; (iv) identification 
of public subsidies and tax incentives unless support from the external auditor in respect of such services 
is required by law; (v) support regarding tax inspections by tax authorities unless support from the 
external auditor in respect of such inspections is required by law; (vi) calculation of direct and indirect tax 
and deferred tax; and (vii) provision of tax advice;

REPORTING OF STAFF CONCERNS
Melvin Lawson, a long-standing non-executive director, is the primary point of contact for staff of the 
Company to raise, in confidence, concerns they may have over possible improprieties, financial or 
otherwise. All employees have been notified of this arrangement in the Staff Handbook and on the 
Company’s intranet website which sets out Melvin Lawson’s contact details (Code provision C.3.5). No 
such matters were raised by employees during the current year.

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT
ANNUAL STATEMENT
Dear Shareholder,
As newly appointed Chairman, and in accordance with best practice, I am pleased to provide my first 
introduction to the Remuneration Committee Report which appears in full on pages 51 to 73.
The Committee continues to believe that remuneration packages should be simple, competitive, align the 
interests of management with those of external shareholders, and both incentivise and reward superior long 
term performance in a highly transparent manner. 
As set out in last year’s Report, a new long term incentive plan (“LTIP 2016”) was duly approved at the 
Annual General Meeting in July 2016. The first LTIP 2016 awards were made in April 2017, with the 
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer each subscribing for 30,000 growth shares and 
simultaneously relinquishing their unexercised share options for no consideration. Growth shares under LTIP 
2016 were also issued to certain other senior employees.
The launch of LTIP 2016 required a material change to the Company’s Remuneration Policy which was 
approved by shareholders at the Company’s last AGM. The Committee will keep this new remuneration 
policy under review, in accordance with legislation and the principles of good corporate governance, and 
expects to submit an updated version to the AGM to be held in 2019.
Executive directors’ salaries are reviewed annually. During the year covered by this Report, the Executive 
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer each received an increase of 1.25% taking their salaries to £431,629 
and £467,598 respectively; this percentage increase was in line with the Company’s standard increase 
for employees generally. The Chief Financial Officer received an increase from £406,000 to £456,000 
reflecting his growing knowledge and experience of the Company and the increasing scope of his role.
 
For the year to 31 March 2018, the Executive Chairman will receive an increase of 2% on his salary to 
£440,262; this is in line with the Company’s average cost of living increase. The Chief Executive Officer 
and Chief Financial Officer will receive increases to their salaries of 13.3% and 16.2% respectively to 
£530,000 each for the period. Whilst these increases are higher than the Company’s average level 
of increase, the Committee believes that they are fully justified by reference to the relevant competitor 
benchmarks, the strong performance of both the Company and the individuals, and the absence of any 
bonus element in their remuneration structure. 
The Committee continues to believe that the provision of competitive base salaries together with market 
price equity incentives (including the awards made under the LTIP 2016), are the best way to ensure a 
clear alignment of interest between management and shareholders, combined with long term retention and 
motivation of the individuals involved.
In conclusion, and on behalf of both myself the former Committee Chairman, I would like to thank 
shareholders for their continued engagement on remuneration matters during the year.

REMUNERATION POLICY
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
The Remuneration Committee (‘the Committee’) is responsible for reviewing and making recommendations 
to the Board regarding the policy relating to the total remuneration paid to the executive directors and 
members of senior management of the Company. It meets regularly to review and set all elements of the 
remuneration paid to the executive directors of the Company, including pension rights, and monitors the 
level and structure of remuneration for other senior management of the Company. It also exercises all the 
powers of the Board in relation to the operation of the Company’s share incentive schemes, including the 
grant of options and the terms of those grants.
The Committee met formally three times during the year and details of attendance at these meetings are 
provided in the Corporate Governance Statement on page 39.
The Committee’s principal activities during the year included:
• reviewing and approving executive director remuneration packages;
• monitoring senior management remuneration packages;
•  reviewing and approving the issue of share options to certain employees and independent distributors of 
the Company; and
• overseeing the implementation of the new LTIP 2016 following shareholder approval.
REMUNERATION POLICY INTRODUCTION
The Company’s overall remuneration policy remains to ensure that the executive directors and other senior 
managers are fairly and responsibly rewarded for their individual contribution to the overall long term 
performance of the Company, in a manner that ensures that the Company is able to attract, motivate, and 
retain executives of the quality necessary to ensure the successful management of the Company. 
The Company’s remuneration policy will continue to be based on the principle that the fortunes of the 
directors and senior management should be directly aligned with those of external shareholders. The 
Committee believes this is best achieved by using share-based incentives granted at market value, and that 
issuing growth shares under LTIP 2016 provides a far more transparent method of directly aligning each 
director’s interests with all shareholders compared with paying annual cash bonuses linked to short/medium 
term performance measures. In view of the weight placed by the company on long term performance 
as part of its remuneration structure, the Committee continues to believe it is more appropriate to grant 
meaningful share awards in blocks rather than using a phased approach as set out in the Corporate 
Governance Code.
The proposed remuneration policy described in this part of the report was prepared in accordance with 
the requirements of Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium–sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and 
Reports) Regulations 2008 (as amended in August 2013). The existing policy was duly approved by 
the Company’s shareholders at the AGM on 22 July 2016 and is intended to apply for the three years 
beginning on that date. The Committee will continue to review the amended remuneration policy annually 
to ensure it remains appropriate for the Company’s requirements and consistent with market practice. Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements

Grants are expected to be 
made in a single tranche 
following adoption of the 
plan (although new joiners 
or promoted individuals 
may be invited to join at a 
later stage).
Grant value of the growth 
shares will be based on 
their market value on the

participants, and assuming 
maximum dilution (i.e. 
each growth share is 
equivalent to 10 ordinary 
shares in the Company).
Awards will vest over 3 to 
10 years, and the growth 
shares will accrete value 
subject to the achievement 
of defined hurdles.
Participants will only 
share in the growth of the 
value of the Company 
if the initial share price 
increases to at least £20, 
or (if the Committee so 
determines) adjusted EPS 
has increased by at least 
100%. Maximum dilution 
will only occur if the share 
price exceeds £50, or 
(if the Committee has so 
determined) adjusted EPS 
has increased to at least 
3.5x the current level.
The Committee may 
require forfeiture of shares 
comprised in an award 
in the event of a material 
error or mis-statement in 
the accounts, or a material 
failure in risk management 
(“Malus and Clawback”).

Service conditions must be 
met over vesting periods 
of 3, 5, 7 or 10 years, 
each in relation to 25% of 
the total number of growth 
shares issued to each 
participant. 
The basis on which value 
accretes to the growth 
shares is determined by 
reference to increases 
in share price or (at the 
discretion of the Commit 
earnings per share.
In respect of the shares 
which become convertible

immediately following 
the announcement of the 
results for the Company for 
the year ended 31 March 
2019 (i.e. slightly under

CHOICE OF PERFORMANCE MEASURES
The Committee chose the performance measures described in the table above as these are deemed to 
align directly the executive directors’ interests with those of all shareholders in an easily understood and 
transparent manner. 
Share Incentive Schemes (excluding LTIP 2016)
The performance measures comprise a combination of relative total shareholder return (‘TSR’), Adjusted 
EPS (excluding share incentive scheme charges and amortisation of intangible assets) and service number 
growth measures. Adjusted EPS is considered appropriate as a key strategic objective of the Company 
if it is to drive profitable growth in each year. It also provides a balance to relative TSR, which considers 
shareholder value creation and reflects market expectations of future performance, and absolute service 
number growth which, when achieved responsibly, will also drive long-term value creation. 
The use of relative TSR and Adjusted EPS growth measures provides a combined focus on the Company’s 
financial performance and shareholder value creation. Targets for Adjusted EPS are set by reference to 
internal budgeting plans and external market expectations. TSR targets are set on a standard practice, 
median to upper quartile ranking range. Only 30% of share incentive awards vest for threshold levels of 
performance.
The Committee wishes to retain the ability to change the composition of performance conditions for future 
grants to directors should this be required in order to reflect appropriately the strategic responsibilities of 
the particular director concerned.
LTIP 2016
The Committee has chosen growth in the Company’s share price as the primary measure for LTIP 2016 
because it directly links the rewards received by participants with the value that has been created 
for shareholders. However, the Committee recognises that share price is not in the control of senior 
management, and periods of stock market volatility may coincide with the dates on which growth shares 
issued under the plan are due to vest. An alternative stretching growth metric of adjusted earnings per share 
(for the purposes of determining the number of ordinary shares in the Company received by participants on 
each vesting date) has therefore been included at the discretion of the Committee. Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2017 60
ILLUSTRATIVE APPLICATION OF REMUNERATION POLICY
The bar chart below seeks to illustrate the potential rewards available under the proposed remuneration 
policy for the coming financial year under varying levels of performance in relation to the LTIP 2016. The 
illustration reflects the issue of 30,000 growth shares each to Andrew Lindsay and Nick Schoenfeld on 4 
April 2017, and that no annual cash bonuses are paid. The amounts for pensions and benefits included 
in the fixed remuneration figure have been calculated on the same basis as payments made for the year 
ended 31 March 2017.
The potential rewards available under the LTIP 2016 reflect the annual equivalent value of the awards over 
the 10 year life. The ‘on–target’ and ‘maximum’ performance under the LTIP 2016 have been based on a 
Company share price of £20 and £50 respectively at vesting.

REMUNERATION POLICY
CONTINUED Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2017 63
APPROACH TO RECRUITMENT REMUNERATION
The Committee’s approach to recruitment is to pay a sufficient amount necessary to attract the best 
candidates to the particular role. In determining these amounts the Committee will be mindful of, inter 
alia, prevailing market rates, the chosen candidate’s skills, knowledge and experience, and their existing 
location and position.
Where the candidate has variable remuneration arrangements with a previous employer that will be lost 
on leaving employment, the Company will consider offering a sign-on award in compensation for the value 
foregone, either as an award under an existing share incentive scheme or a bespoke award under the 
Listing Rules exemption available for this purpose. The face and/or expected values of the award(s) offered 
will not materially exceed the value ascribed to the award(s) foregone, and would normally follow the same 
vesting timing and form (i.e. cash or shares) save that the Committee may award the whole of the value 
in shares, at its discretion. The application of performance conditions would be considered and, where 
appropriate, the awards could be made subject to claw-back in certain circumstances. For material amounts 
the Committee would, where practicable, consult with key institutional shareholders ahead of committing 
to make any such sign-on awards, and in any event a full explanation of any amounts awarded, an 
explanation of why it was necessary and a breakdown of the awards to be made will be announced to the 
markets at the time of granting. For the avoidance of doubt, should a new director be internally promoted 
from the Company’s senior management team they will not be expected to give up or amend any element 
of remuneration granted to them prior to becoming a director which is inconsistent with the remuneration 
policy set out above.
Any new executive director’s remuneration package would include the same elements, and be subject to the 
same constraints, as those of the existing executive directors as outlined in the above policy table.

To attract non-executive 
directors who have

Non-executive directors’ 
fees are set by the Board 
as a whole and aligned 
with the responsibilities of 
each director.
Annual fees are paid in 12 
equal monthly instalments 
during the year.
Non-executive directors’ 
fees are periodically 
reviewed by the Board in 
the light of any changes in 
role and prevailing market 
rates for Non-executive 
directors in similarly sized

STATEMENT OF CONSIDERATION OF SHAREHOLDER VIEWS
The Chairman of the Committee engages with certain of the Company’s largest shareholders who have 
expressed an interest in being consulted in relation to remuneration matters to understand their expectations 
and monitor any changes in their views. 
STATEMENT OF CONSIDERATION OF EMPLOYMENT CONDITIONS ELSEWHERE IN THE GROUP
The Committee considers pay levels across the organisation when setting remuneration for all directors 
(both executives and non-executives). However this review is undertaken against a background of ensuring 
that the prevailing market rates for all levels of employee in the organisation are taken into account in order 
to attract, retain and motivate the best employees at each level. In relation to directors, specific account 
is taken of any change in the level of responsibility of the director (whether through a change in role or 
the increased size of the Company) or an increase in experience and knowledge of the Company and its 
markets which may not be relevant to roles elsewhere in the Company. 
The Company does not deem it appropriate to formally consult with employees regarding the determination 
of the directors’ remuneration policy as the broad remuneration structure for directors mirrors that of all 
employees, i.e. the payment of a base salary, benefits and share incentive scheme awards at market price 
and/or LTIP 2016 awards. However, employees have the opportunity to make comments on any aspect 
of the Company’s activities through an employee survey and any comments made which are relevant to 
directors’ remuneration would be considered by the Committee.

ANNUAL REPORT ON REMUNERATION
This report, which has been prepared in accordance with the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code (“the Code”) issued by the Financial Reporting Council in September 2014 and Schedule 8 of the 
Large and Medium–Sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 (as amended 
in August 2013) (“the Regulations”), has been approved by the Board of directors for submission to 
shareholders for approval at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting. The sections under the headings 
“Single Total Figure of Remuneration”, parts of “Share Incentive Schemes” and “Pension Schemes” have 
been subject to external audit.
SINGLE TOTAL FIGURE OF REMUNERATION
The Committee recommended increases to the annual base salaries of Executive Chairman Charles Wigoder, 
Chief Executive Andrew Lindsay and Chief Financial Officer Nick Schoenfeld during the year as follows:
•  Charles Wigoder - increased from £426,300 to £431,629;
•  Andrew Lindsay - increased from £461,825 to £467,598; and
•  Nick Schoenfeld - increased from £406,000 to £456,000.
These increases for Charles Wigoder and Andrew Lindsay broadly reflected the average increase in the 
base salaries of the majority of the Company’s employees. Nick Schoenfeld received an increase from 
£406,000 to £456,000 reflecting his increased knowledge and experience of the Company following 
joining the Board in January 2015.
The non-executive directors receive fees for their services, the details of which are described below. The 
level of these fees for the existing non-executive directors was unchanged during the year. Andrew Blowers 
and Beatrice Hollond joined the Board during the year on annual salaries of £40,000 each.

Only Andrew Lindsay held share incentive awards where final vesting was determined as a result of 
performance conditions relating to a period ending in the financial year to 31 March 2017. However, as 
set out in the Chairman’s Annual Statement above, these awards were relinquished for no consideration 
by Mr Lindsay after the year end on 4 April 2017 and therefore no amount has been included in the table

The amounts relating to benefits received relate principally to the provision of private health insurance and

SHARE INCENTIVE SCHEMES 
The Company has two conventional share option plans and the LTIP 2016. The first share option plan and 
the LTIP 2016 are available to employees, and the second share option plan is available to the Company’s 
independent distributors. The Company also has a Save As You Earn share option plan (“the Employee SAYE 
Share Option Plan”) for employees.
The Employee Share Option Plan
Subject to serving the requisite probationary period, all employees are eligible to participate in the 
Company’s employee share option plan and be issued with market price options over shares in the Company, 
the number of shares being related to their seniority and length of service.
The Committee recognises that the collective contribution of all employees is critical to the success of the 
Company and continues to believe that the granting of share options at all levels within the organisation 
generates employee loyalty and helps to ensure that staff turnover is kept to a minimum and below the levels 
seen across the industry for employees passing their probationary periods.
ANNUAL REPORT ON REMUNERATION
CONTINUED Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2017 67
The LTIP 2016
The LTIP 2016 comprises the issue to participants of a class of ‘growth’ shares, which potentially become 
convertible into ordinary shares in the Company over a period of typically 3-10 years following the 
achievement of stretching targets. If these targets are not achieved, then the growth shares lapse with no value 
to participants. The first awards of growth shares were made to initial participants in the scheme on 4 April 
2017; these included the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of the Company.
The intention behind introducing LTIP 2016 was to reward the creation of significant shareholder value, 
therefore the following hurdles have been chosen, with no value accruing to participants unless either:  
(i) the share price has risen to at least £20; or (ii) the adjusted earnings per share of the Company has at 
least doubled. 
The initial participants have been set further stretching targets of growing the share price and adjusted EPS; 
as each of these hurdles is achieved, the conversion ratio of growth shares to ordinary shares in the Company 
increases as follows: 
SHARE PRICE EPS GROWTH CONVERSION 
RATIO
<£20 <2.0x Nil
£20 to £24.99 2.0x to 2.24x 2.5x
£25 to £29.99 2.25x to 2.49x 3.75x
£30 to £34.99 2.5x to 2.74x 5.0x
£35 to £39.99 2.75x to 2.9x 6.25x
£40 to £44.99 3.0x to 3.24x 7.5x
£45 to £49.99 3.25x to 3.5x 8.75x
£50+ >3.5x 10.0x
For initial participants, the awards vest progressively over approximately a 9 year period with 25% vesting 
after approximately 2 years, 25% after approximately 4 years, 25% after approximately 6 years, and the 
final 25% vesting after approximately 9 years; in all cases, conversion is subject to the relevant hurdles having 
been achieved on the conversion date. In addition, transfer restrictions will apply on a proportion of the 
shares for up to two years, to ensure the interests of management and shareholders remain aligned. 
For any future LTIP 2016 grants, stretching targets will be set by the Committee that will not be below those 
which apply to initial participants.
One of the key drivers behind the introduction of LTIP 2016 is the retention of key individuals over the longer 
term, therefore any growth shares issued to a participant will generally lapse if they cease to be employed by 
the Company before they have vested. In accordance with best practice, both malus and clawback provisions 
have been included.
A summary of the principal terms of the LTIP 2016 was included in the Appendix to the 2016 AGM circular 
sent to all shareholders. Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2017 68
The Employee SAYE Share Option Plan
The Employee SAYE Share Option Plan enables employees of the group to acquire shares in the Company 
in a tax efficient manner using monies saved from salary over a three or five year period. A summary of the 
principal terms of the Employee SAYE Share Option Plan were set out in the Appendix to the 2015 AGM 
circular sent to all shareholders.
The Networkers and Consultants Share Option Plan
The Networkers and Consultants Share Option Plan exists to provide incentives and rewards to those 
distributors who have been most successful in gathering new Members for the Company. These distributors, 
whilst not being employees of the Company, are nevertheless essential to its future growth, and it is the 
opinion of the Committee that this plan can in some cases be an important factor in their motivation. 
Statement of Directors’ Shareholding and Share Interests (audited)
Details of the directors’ shareholdings are set out in the Directors’ Report on page 75. As set out in the Future 
Remuneration Policy Table of the Company’s Remuneration Policy, a target level of share ownership is not 
stipulated for directors, however, subject to personal circumstances and existing shareholdings they are 
encouraged to retain 25% of shares issued as a result of the exercise of share incentive awards.

in previous annual reports. However, Mr Lindsay relinquished these options for no consideration after the 
year end on 4 April 2017 and therefore no benefit will accrue to Mr Lindsay from this award.

On 13 July 2015 300,000 share options were awarded to Mr Schoenfeld under the terms of the Employee 
Share Option Scheme. These options were made subject to performance conditions which were described

PERFORMANCE GRAPH SHOWING TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN
The following graph shows the Company’s performance measured by total shareholder return compared 
with the performance of the FTSE All Share Telecommunications Index and the FTSE 350 for the period 2 
April 2012 to 31 March 2017. As noted in previous years, the FTSE All Share Telecommunications Index 
was initially selected at a time when a larger proportion of the Company’s revenues related to the supply 
of telephony services; only approximately 18% of the Company’s revenues are now generated from such 
telephony services.
The FTSE 350 Index is included as a further comparator in the light of the fact that there are no sector 
specific indices containing directly comparable quoted companies supplying a broad range of services 
similar to that provided by the Company.

STATEMENT OF IMPLEMENTATION OF REMUNERATION POLICY IN THE FOLLOWING FINANCIAL YEAR
Base Salaries
The Committee recommended increases of 13.3% and 16.2% be made to the base salaries of the Chief 
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer for the forthcoming year ended 31 March 2018, with effect 
from 1 April 2017, taking each of their salaries to £530,000. Whilst these increases are above the 
Company’s normal cost of living increase, the Committee believes that they are fully justified by reference 
to the relevant competitor benchmarks, and the strong performance of the Company and both individuals. 
In setting these increases the Committee also took into account the fact that the executive directors do not 
receive annual cash or share bonuses.
The Committee also recommended an increase of 2.0% to the Executive Chairman’s salary to £440,262, in 
line with the Company’s average cost of living increase.
Employee and distributor share option schemes
The Company’s existing employee and distributor share option schemes were put in place in August 
2007 and have a 10 year life. As such two new share option plans will be submitted for approval by 
shareholders at the forthcoming AGM in July. The new schemes will be proposed based on substantially the 
same terms and conditions as the existing plans.
LTIP 2016
In line with the intention of the Company as set out in last year’s Annual Report, on 4 April 2017 Andrew 
Lindsay and Nick Schoenfeld each subscribed to 30,000 growth shares in accordance with the rules of LTIP 
2016 set out above. 
Other benefits
Directors’ remuneration in relation to pension contributions and other benefits for the year will be made in 
accordance with the Remuneration Policy.
SHAREHOLDER VOTE AND SHAREHOLDER ENGAGEMENT
As set out in the Remuneration Policy, the Committee encourages dialogue with the Company’s major 
shareholders regarding remuneration matters and will endeavour to consult with these shareholders ahead 
of any significant future changes to the remuneration policy.

In addition to the above there were 15,525, 947,974 and 944,327 votes withheld for each vote above

The Committee noted the high number of votes cast against the Remuneration Policy and the proposed 
introduction of the LTIP 2016. However, the Committee firmly believes that LTIP 2016 was in the best 
interests of the Company and that its implementation was in the best long-term interests of the Company. 
THE UK CORPORATE GOVERNANCE CODE
The Committee acknowledges the requirement set out in the Corporate Governance Code issued by the 
FRC in September 2014 (“the Code”) for companies to put in place arrangements that will enable them to 
recover or withhold variable remuneration when appropriate to do so. 
The Committee therefore included provisions to withhold or recover such remuneration in the event of fraud 
or malus committed by a director in the recent LTIP 2016 awards.

The directors have pleasure in presenting their report and the audited financial statements for the year to 31 
March 2017.
PRINCIPAL ACTIVITIES AND BUSINESS REVIEW
A full review of the development of the business is contained in the Strategic Report on pages 1 to 35.  
A summary of the financial risk management objectives and policies is contained in note 19 to the 
financial statements. 
This Directors’ Report, together with the information in the Strategic Report forms the management report for 
the purposes of DTR 4.1.8R.
RESULTS AND DIVIDENDS
The profit for the year after tax of £94,960,000 (2016: £31,774,000) has been transferred to reserves. 
An interim dividend of 23p per share (2016: 22p) was paid during the year. A final dividend of 25p per 
share (2016: 24p per share) is proposed. 
On 20 April 2017 the Board announced that it expected adjusted profit before tax from continuing 
activities to be around £53 million for the year ended 31 March 2017. The actual adjusted profit before 
tax for the year ended 31 March 2017 from continuing activities was £53.3 million. 
GROUP REORGANISATION
On 1 April 2017 the trading activities, the majority of the assets and liabilities, and the employees of 
Telecom Plus PLC, as well as all its subsidiaries, were transferred to Utility Warehouse Limited a 100% 
subsidiary of Telecom Plus PLC under a group reorganisation. The reorganisation was designed to provide 
the Group with a more conventional legal structure in line with other large publicly-listed entities, and to 
facilitate the launch of the LTIP 2016 detailed in the Remuneration Committee report. The reorganisation will 
not have any impact on the consolidated trading results of the Group going forward.

directors are contained within the Articles. The Articles provide that Directors may be appointed by an 
ordinary resolution of the members or by a resolution of the Directors, provided that, in the latter instance, 
a director appointed in that way retires at the first Annual General Meeting following their appointment. In 
addition, shareholders with in excess of 20% of the shares in the Company are entitled under the Articles to 
appoint a director and remove any such director appointed. 
In accordance with current best practice, all Board directors will be retiring at the forthcoming AGM and 
will then offer themselves for re-election. Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2017 76
DIRECTORS’ CONFLICTS OF INTEREST
The Directors have a statutory duty to avoid situations where they have, or could have, a direct or indirect 
interest that conflicts, or possibly may conflict, with the Company’s interests. The Companies Act 2006 and 
the Company’s Articles allow the Board to authorise such conflicts of interest should this be deemed to be 
appropriate.
The Board has put in place effective procedures for managing and, where appropriate, approving 
conflicts or potential conflicts of interest. Under these procedures, the Directors are required to declare 
all directorships or other appointments to companies which are not part of the Group, as well as other 
situations which could give rise to a potential conflict. The Board will, where appropriate, authorise a 
conflict or potential conflict, and will impose all necessary restrictions and/or conditions where it sees fit. 
The Company maintains a register of directors’ interests which is reviewed regularly by the Board.
DIRECTORS’ AND OFFICERS’ LIABILITY INSURANCE
The Company maintains appropriate insurance to cover directors’ and officers’ liability and has provided 
an indemnity, as permitted by the Companies Act 2006, in respect of all of the Company’s directors which 
was in force throughout the financial year and remains in force. Neither the insurance nor the indemnity 
provides cover where a director has acted fraudulently or dishonestly.
EMPLOYEES
The requirements of the Companies Act 2006 in respect of employees are set out in the Strategic Report on 
pages 31 to 33.
SUBSTANTIAL SHAREHOLDERS
As at 12 June 2017, in addition to the directors, the following have notified the Company of their 
substantial shareholdings as detailed below: 
SHAREHOLDER NUMBER OF SHARES PERCENTAGE OF ISSUED 
 SHARE CAPITAL
Standard Life Investments Ltd 7,453,001 9.3%

CAPITAL STRUCTURE
Restrictions on the transfer of shares
The Company only has ordinary shares in issue. Other than as set out below, there are no restrictions 
on the transfer of the ordinary shares, except where a holder refuses to comply with a statutory notice 
requesting details of those who have an interest and the extent of their interest in a particular holding of 
shares. In such cases, where the identified shares make up 0.25% or more of the ordinary shares in issue, 
the directors may refuse to register a transfer of any of the identified shares in certificated form and, so far 
as permitted by the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001, a transfer of any of the identified shares 
which are held in the electronic share dealing system CREST, unless the directors are satisfied that they have 
been sold outright to an independent third party.
Other than as set out below and so far as the directors are aware, there were no arrangements at 31 
March 2017 by which, with the Company’s co-operation, financial rights carried by securities are held 
by a person other than a holder of securities, or any arrangements between holders of securities that are 
known to the Company and which may result in restrictions on the transfer of securities or on voting rights.
Executive Chairman Charles Wigoder entered into an agreement to charge 325,000 of his shares in the 
Company as security for a loan from Barclays Bank on 3 December 2013. The loan enabled him to apply 
for 57,142 ordinary shares as part of his open offer entitlement which resulted from funding the Company’s 
entering into of the new energy supply arrangements with Npower on 20 December 2013. Under the terms 
of the charge, title to the 325,000 shares can be transferred, sold or otherwise dealt with by Barclays 
following the occurrence of a failure to pay any amount due and payable under the loan. 
In addition, certain members of senior management have loans secured against some or all of their 
shareholdings in the Company which restrict their ability to transfer these shares prior to repayment of the 
loans.
The Company established a Joint Share Ownership Plan (“the JSOP”) on 30 March 2011. As part of the 
JSOP an employee benefit trust was established to jointly hold shares with the participants in the plan 
(“the JSOP Share Trust”). As at 31 March 2017 the JSOP Share Trust held 252,638 shares. All voting and 
dividend rights attached to these shares have been waived.
Takeovers
There are no significant arrangements to which the Company is party that take effect, alter or terminate 
upon a change of control of the Company following a takeover bid, save in relation to the arrangements 
with Npower and EE for the supply of energy and mobile telephony respectively, or any agreements 
between the Company and its directors or employees providing for compensation for loss of office or 
employment (whether through resignation, purported redundancy or otherwise) that occurs because of a 
takeover bid.
Authority for purchase of own shares
At the last AGM held on 22 July 2016, the Company obtained authority to purchase up to 8,025,835 
ordinary shares representing approximately 10% of the issued ordinary share capital (excluding treasury 
shares) as at 17 June 2016. The Company intends to renew this authority at this year’s AGM.  Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2017 78
During the year the Company did not repurchase any ordinary shares. As previously announced, the 
Company intends to use certain of the proceeds from the disposal in February 2017 of its investment in 
Opus Energy Group Limited to undertake a tender offer open to all shareholders. Details of the tender offer 
are set out in a circular sent to shareholders along with this document.
Treasury shares
The Company held 60,000 ordinary shares in treasury as at 31 March 2017 (2016: 60,000).
DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION
Each of the directors has confirmed that so far as he is aware, there is no relevant audit information of 
which the Company’s auditor is unaware, and that he has taken all the steps that he ought to have taken 
as a director in order to make himself aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the 
Company’s auditor is aware of that information.
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
The Company’s position in relation to compliance with the requirements of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code issued by the Financial Reporting Council is set out in the Corporate Governance Statement on pages 
38 to 44.
RISK, CONTROL AND VIABILITY 
In accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code, the Directors have assessed the viability of the 
Group over a three year period, taking into account the Group’s current position and the potential impact 
of the principal risks and uncertainties set out on pages 25 to 30. Based on this assessment, the directors 
confirm that they have a reasonable expectation that the company will be able to continue in operation and 
meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period to March 2020.
The directors have determined that a three year period to 31 March 2020 constitutes an appropriate 
period over which to provide its viability statement. This is the period focussed on by the Board during the 
strategic planning process.
Whilst the directors have no reason to believe the Group will not be viable over a longer period, given the 
inherent uncertainty involved we believe this presents users of the Annual Report with a reasonable degree 
of confidence while still providing a longer-term perspective.
In making this statement, the Board carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the Group, 
including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity.
The Board considers annually and on a rolling basis, a three year strategic plan. The output of this plan is 
used to perform central debt and headroom profile analysis, which includes a review of sensitivity to ‘business 
as usual’ risks, such as profit growth and working capital variances and severe but plausible events.
The Board also considers the ability of the Group to raise finance and deploy capital. The results take 
account of the availability and likely effectiveness of the mitigating actions that could be taken to avoid or 
reduce the impact or occurrence of the underlying risks.
DIRECTORS’ REPORT
CONTINUED Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2017 79
Under the revised energy supply arrangements which were effective from 1 December 2013, Npower 
continues to be responsible for funding the principal working capital requirements relating to the supply of 
energy to the Company’s Members. This includes funding the Budget Plans of Members who pay for their 
energy in equal monthly instalments and pre-funding the payment of certain energy network charges.
The Group has from Barclays Bank PLC and Lloyds Bank PLC total revolving credit facilities of £150 million 
for the period to 14 December 2020. As at 31 March 2017, £18.7 million of cash was held on the 
balance sheet with no debt outstanding following the receipt of proceeds from the sale of the Company’s 
shareholding in Opus Energy Group Limited in February 2017. The Company has announced that it 
intends to return £25 million of these proceeds via a share tender offer in July 2017.
The Company has considerable financial resources together with a large and diverse retail and small 
business membership base and long term contracts with a number of key suppliers. As a consequence, the 
directors believe that the Company is well placed to manage its business risks.
Whilst this review does not consider all of the risks that the Group may face, the directors consider that this 
stress-testing based assessment of the Group’s prospects is reasonable in the circumstances of the inherent 
uncertainty involved.

the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
WEBSITE PUBLICATION
The directors are responsible for ensuring the annual report and the financial statements are made available 
on a website. Financial statements are published on the Company’s website in accordance with legislation

OPINIONS AND CONCLUSIONS ARISING FROM OUR AUDIT
1 Our opinion on the financial statements is unmodified 
We have audited the financial statements of Telecom Plus PLC for the year ended 31 March 2017 set out 
on pages 88 to 126. In our opinion: 
•  the Financial Statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the Parent Company’s 
affairs as at 31 March 2017 and of the Group’s profit for the year then ended; 
•  the Group Financial Statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union (IFRSs as adopted by the EU); 
•  the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as 
adopted by the EU and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and
•  the Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 
2006; and, as regards the Group Financial Statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.

2 Our assessment of risks of material misstatement
In arriving at our audit opinion above on the financial statements, the risks of material misstatement 
that had the greatest effect on our audit, in decreasing order of audit significance, were as follows 
(unchanged from 2016):
THE RISK OUR RESPONSE
Energy revenue recognition Use of estimates Our procedures included: 
Refer to page 48 (Audit Committee 
Report), page 95 (critical accounting 
estimates), page 97 (accounting 
policy) and page 103 (financial 
disclosures).
Revenue recognised in relation to the 
supply of gas and electricity includes 
estimates of the value of the energy 
supplied to customers between the 
date of the last meter reading and the 
year end. The method of estimating 
such revenues is complex and 
judgmental, requiring estimates and 
assumptions to be made to assess the 
volume of energy supplied, which is 
sensitive to a number of factors, one 
of which includes any volatility in 
weather patterns.
The risk of misstatement is that the 
accounting for the Group’s estimated 
revenues does not appropriately 
reflect the underlying actual delivery 
of gas and electricity as at 31 March 
2017 and as a result revenues may 
be misstated. 
•  Control design: testing the design, 
implementation and operating 
effectiveness of the Group’s controls 
which include monitoring the 
accuracy of the billing systems 
estimation of energy usage; 
•  Test of detail: for a sample of 
customers analysing the accuracy 
of the energy usage estimate 
at the year end by comparing 
actual usage, obtained from meter 
readings received between 15 
March 2017 and 2 April 2017, 
with the billing system generated 
estimated usage for the same 
period;
•  Test of detail: assessing the volume 
and nature of customer complaints 
received in relation to estimated 
meter readings in order to identify 
whether any indicators exist of an 
underlying issue with the Group’s 
estimation of energy usage; and
•  Assessing transparency: considering 
whether the critical accounting 
estimates, judgements and 
assumptions, and accounting policy 
disclosures properly reflect the 
judgements and estimates inherent 
in recognising revenue. Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2017 84
THE RISK OUR RESPONSE
Energy supply agreement  
intangible asset
Valuation of the energy supply 
agreement intangible asset
Our procedures included:
(£187.1m; 2016: £198.4m)
Refer to page 48 (Audit Committee 
Report), page 95 (critical accounting 
estimates), page 99 (accounting 
policy) and page 108 (financial 
disclosures).
An intangible asset is held on the 
Group’s balance sheet at cost less 
amortisation, representing an energy 
supply agreement to supply gas and 
electricity to the Group.
Wholesale energy prices are 
volatile, and there are high levels 
of competition in the energy supply 
market, leading to challenging 
market conditions with increased 
customer churn and price 
competitiveness. In that context, the 
external market conditions have 
led to the identification of a market 
indicator of impairment. 
Recoverability of the intangible asset 
is subject to judgement in terms of 
the assumptions used in the Group’s 
discounted cash flow model, in 
particular in respect of customer 
growth and the discount rate. Due 
to the inherent uncertainty involved 
in forecasting and discounting future 
cash flows, which are the basis of the 
assessment of recoverability, this is 
one of the key judgemental areas that 
our audit is concentrated on. 
•  Methodology choice: assessing 
the appropriateness of the design 
and implementation of the Group’s 
discounted cash flow model in 
particular the appropriateness of the 
cash flows used in the model;
•  Historical comparisons: assessing 
the reasonableness of the Group’s 
forecasting by comparing actual 
performance for the year against 
forecasts for the same period in the 
prior year model; 
•  Benchmarking assumptions: 
evaluating the Group’s assumptions 
included within the discounted cash 
flow forecasts by comparing key 
inputs such as projected growth, 
cost inflation and discount rates to 
internally and externally derived 
data; 
•  Sensitivity analysis: performing 
sensitivity analysis on the 
assumptions; and
•  Assessing transparency: considering 
whether the Group’s disclosures 
about the sensitivity of the outcome 
of the impairment assessment to 
changes in key assumptions.
3 Our application of materiality and an overview of the scope of our audit
Materiality for the Group financial statements as a whole was set at £1.65m (2016: £1.9m). The 2017 
materiality has been determined with reference to a benchmark of group profit before tax from continuing 
operations of £40.8m, normalised to exclude a recovery of £4.2m of previously incurred costs relating to 
the smart meter roll-out programme, of which it represents 4.5% (2016: 4.7%).
We reported to the Audit Committee any corrected or uncorrected identified misstatements exceeding 
£82,500 (2016: £95,000), in addition to other identified misstatements that warranted reporting on 
qualitative grounds.
Five (2016: four) components were subjected to full scope audits, all conducted by the Group team, with 
a component materiality ranging from £35,000 to £1,237,500 (2016: £90,000 to £1,500,000). These 
components accounted for 100% of total Group revenue; 98% of Group profit before taxation and 100% 
of total Group assets.
In both 2017 and 2016 the Group audit team also performed specified risk-focused procedures over the 
share of profit of associate prior to its disposal, covering the revenue recognition policy and estimation of 
supply of energy to customers.

Group’s position and performance, business model and strategy; or
•  the Audit Committee Report does not appropriately address matters communicated by us to the Audit 
Committee.

  Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2017 94
GENERAL INFORMATION
Telecom Plus PLC (the ‘Company’) is a company domiciled in the United Kingdom. The consolidated 
financial statements of the Company for the year ended 31 March 2017 comprise the Company and its 
subsidiaries (together referred to as the ‘Group’) and the Group’s interest in associates. 
The financial statements were authorised for issue by the directors on 12 June 2017. 
PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
As a result of the relative size and historical volatility of share incentive scheme charges it has been decided 
to separately disclose the amounts on the face of the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
In view of the size and nature of the charge as a non-cash item, the amortisation of energy supply 
contract intangible asset has also been separately disclosed on the face of the Consolidated Statement of 
Comprehensive Income for the period. More information regarding the intangible asset is set out in note 6 
of these financial statements.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
(a) Statement of compliance 
The financial statements of the Group and the Company have been prepared in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’) and International Financial Reporting Interpretations 
Committee (‘IFRIC’) interpretations as endorsed by the EU and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 
applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
(b) Basis of preparation 
The Company’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, 
performance and position are set out in the Strategic Report on pages 1 to 35. The financial position 
of the Company, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are described in the Financial 
Review on pages 20 to 24 and within notes 12 and 19 to the financial statements. In addition, notes 15 
and 19 include the Company’s objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital; its financial risk 
management objectives; details of its financial instruments; and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk.
Under the revised energy supply arrangements which were effective from 1 December 2013, Npower 
continues to be responsible for funding the principal working capital requirements relating to the supply of 
energy to the Company’s Members. This includes funding the Budget Plans of Members who pay for their 
energy in equal monthly instalments and pre-funding the payment of certain energy network charges.
The Company has from Barclays Bank PLC and Lloyds Bank PLC total revolving credit facilities of £150.0 
million for the period to 14 December 2020 of which £Nil was drawn down as at 31 March 2017 (2016: 
£71.2 million drawn down).
The Company has considerable financial resources together with a large and diverse retail and small 
business membership base and long term contracts with a number of key suppliers. As a consequence, the 
directors believe that the Company is well placed to manage its business risks.
On this basis the directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company has adequate resources to 
continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. The annual financial statements have therefore 
been prepared on a going concern basis in accordance with the FRC’s Going Concern and Liquidity Risk: 
Guidance for Directors of UK Companies 2009 issued in October 2009.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2017 95
(b) Basis of preparation (continued) 
The accounting policies set out below have been consistently applied to both years presented, unless 
otherwise stated. The financial statements have been prepared on a historical costs basis.
Post balance sheet events
On 1 April 2017 the trading activities, the majority of the assets and liabilities, and the employees of 
Telecom Plus PLC, as well as all its subsidiaries, were transferred to Utility Warehouse Limited a 100% 
subsidiary of Telecom Plus PLC under a group reorganisation. The reorganisation was designed to provide 
the Group with a more conventional legal structure in line with other large publicly-listed entities. The 
reorganisation will not have any impact on the consolidated trading results of the Group going forward.
Critical accounting estimates, judgements and assumptions
In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, which are described below, the Directors have 
made judgements, estimations and assumptions regarding the future. The judgements, estimations, and 
assumptions that have the most significant impact on the amounts recognised in the financial statements are 
detailed below.
Estimates and judgements are evaluated based on historical experience and other factors, including 
expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. In future, actual 
results may differ from these estimates and assumptions.
(i) Revenue recognition
Revenue relating to the sale of energy includes an estimate of the value of electricity or gas supplied to 
customers between the date of the last meter reading and the year end. This will have been estimated by 
using historical consumption patterns, prevailing weather data and other industry information. 
Whilst the estimation routines are currently considered appropriate, a significant change in historical 
consumption patterns and/or a failure to maintain the accuracy of the estimation routines could impact the 
amount of revenue recognised.
(ii) Intangible assets – Energy Supply Contract
The Group energy supply contract intangible assets relate to the entering into of the energy supply 
arrangements with Npower on improved commercial terms through the acquisition by the Company of 
Electricity Plus Supply Limited and Gas Plus Supply Limited from Npower Limited having effect from 1 
December 2013. The valuation of intangible assets represents a significant area of judgment as certain 
key assumptions are required in relation to the future financial performance of the assets. Further detail 
regarding intangible assets is set out in note 6. 
(iii) Trade receivables 
Trade receivables largely represent customers who have energy debt assigned to a prepayment meter, 
or are in the process of having such a meter installed. This requires the Directors to make estimates and 
judgements as to the expected level of eventual debt recovery from these customers based on historical 
experience. While the provisions are currently considered to be appropriate, changes in estimation basis 
or in economic and regulatory conditions could lead to a change in the level of provisions recorded and 
consequently on the charge or credit to the statement of comprehensive income.
(iv) Share incentive scheme charges 
The Group has a conventional share option scheme for employees and Directors. The fair value of 
share options is estimated by using the Binomial valuation model on the date of grant based on certain 
assumptions. The assumptions used in the valuations are described in note 18 and include, amongst others, 
the dividend yield, expected volatility, expected life of the options and number of options expected to vest. 
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)  Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2017 96
(v) Metering contracts
In 2017, as part of the smart meter rollout, the Group renewed rental arrangements with third-parties. The 
Group assessed that these are not leases because it does not have the right to physically or operationally 
control the smart meters, other parties also take a significant amount of output from the assets, and when 
customers switch energy supplier, the responsibility for paying the third parties transfers to the new supplier.
By virtue of section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 the Company is exempt from presenting a statement of 
comprehensive income. The Company made a profit for the year of £104,426,000 (2016: £54,389,000 
including dividends received from subsidiary companies of £20,000,000).
The following standards and interpretations have become mandatory for the Group during the current 
accounting period, but where relevant to the Group they have not had a material impact on the financial 
statements:
• Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2012-2014 Cycle.
• Amendments to IAS 1: Presentation of financial statements, related to the disclosure initiative.
(c) Basis of consolidation
(i) Subsidiaries 
The Group’s financial statements consolidate the financial statements of Telecom Plus PLC and its 
subsidiaries. Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control transfers to the Group and are 
included until the date on which the Group ceases to control them. 
Control is recognised where an investor is expected to receive, or has rights to, variable returns from its 
investment in the investee and has the ability to affect these returns through its power over the relevant 
activities of the investee. Transactions between Group companies are eliminated on consolidation.
(ii) Associates
An associate is an entity over which the Group has significant influence and that is neither a subsidiary nor 
an interest in a joint venture. Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating 
policy decisions of the investee but is not control or joint control over those policies.
The results, assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in these financial statements using the equity 
method of accounting. Under the equity method, investments in associates are carried in the consolidated 
balance sheet at cost and adjusted for post-acquisition changes in the Group’s share of the net assets of the 
associate, less any impairment in the value of individual investments. Losses of an associate in excess of the 
Group’s interest in that associate are not recognised. The Company’s investment in associate Opus Energy 
Group Limited was sold during the year.
(iii) Employee Benefit Trusts
In accordance with IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements, the assets and liabilities of employee 
benefit trusts are consolidated in the Group financial statements. Employee benefit trusts are treated as 
a legal entity separate from the Company but as subsidiaries of the Company. Any loans made by the 
Company to employee benefit trusts are accounted for as loans in accordance with the relevant terms. 
When the trust transfers shares to employees to satisfy share incentive scheme awards, this is considered to 
be, in substance, two transactions: a distribution of the shares from the employee benefit trust back to the 
Company as treasury shares, followed by a distribution of those shares to the employees.

(d) Revenue
Overview
Revenue is the value of goods and services supplied to external customers and independent distributors 
excluding value added tax and other sales related taxes. For each of the Group’s main income streams from 
the provision of fixed line telephony, broadband, mobile telephony, gas and electricity services, transactions 
are recorded as sales in the month when the provision of those services or the supply of goods takes place. 
The Group’s customers are invoiced in the month following that in which the services are provided. 
The Group also generates revenue as a result of providing bill payment protection and accidental death 
cover to customers for a monthly fee. The Group does not retain the insurance risk for these services.
Tariffs are set by Member, by service, and these can vary depending on the number of services provided. 
Each element of any package is priced independently to arrive at the total package price.
Revenue recognition – Energy services
The recognition of revenue associated with the provision of gas and electricity services to customers by 
the Group relies on estimates of usage where meter readings are not available. These estimates are 
based on historical usage information adjusted for known factors such as variations in weather. Revenue 
is recognised during the period in which the services are supplied and any unbilled revenue is accrued at 
each period end.
Revenue recognition – Telephony services
The Group principally generates revenue from providing the following telecommunications services: (i) fixed 
telephony line rental, call and broadband data charges; and (ii) mobile telephony call and data charges, 
and mobile handset sales. Revenue is recognised during the period in which the services are supplied and 
any unbilled revenue is accrued at each period end. Revenue for mobile handset sales are recognised 
when the devices are delivered to the end customer and the sale is considered complete.
Revenue recognition – Other services
The Group also generates revenues from providing Members with bill protection cover, and CashBack 
cards. In addition the Group generates revenues from providing services to its network of independent 
distributors. Revenue is recognised during the period in which the services are supplied and any unbilled 
revenue is accrued at each period end. 
(e) Distributor commissions
The Group’s independent distributors earn commissions mainly on the introduction of new customers to the 
Group and on the ongoing monthly use of the Group’s services by the customers they have introduced. 
Commissions are recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income as they are earned by distributors 
on an accruals basis. In relation to certain multi-service customers, distributors are able to bring forward 
the payment of a limited number of future monthly commission payments expected to be due on the usage 
of customers they have introduced. These advanced commission payments are held on the Balance Sheet 
as prepayments and are amortised on a straight-line basis through the Statement of Comprehensive Income 
over the period during which they are earned and would otherwise have been paid had the payment not 
been brought forward. 
(f) Financial income and expenses
Financial income comprises interest income and is recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income 
as it accrues, using the effective interest rate method. Financial expenses comprise bank interest and non-
utilisation fees associates with the Company’s debt facilities.
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)  Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2017 98
(g) Leases
Payments on operating leases are charged to the Statement of Comprehensive Income on a straight line 
basis over the lease term.
(h) Hire purchase agreements
Hire purchase agreements relate to leases of assets where the Group has passed on substantially all the 
risks and rewards of ownership and are therefore classified as finance leases. When assets are leased out 
under finance leases, the present value of the minimum lease payments is recognised as a receivable.
(i) Taxation 
The tax charge for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Taxation is recognised in the Statement of 
Comprehensive Income except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which 
case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or 
substantially enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of  
previous years.
Deferred tax is recognised, based on the balance sheet liability method, on temporary differences between 
the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for 
taxation purposes. The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or 
settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted 
at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be 
available against which the asset can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no 
longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.
(j) Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less a provision for depreciation. Depreciation is calculated 
so as to write off the cost less estimated residual value of the assets in equal instalments over their expected 
useful lives. No depreciation is provided on freehold land. Depreciation is provided on other assets at the 
following rates:
Freehold buildings 50 years
Freehold and leasehold improvements 3 to 25 years
Plant and machinery 15 years
Fixtures, fittings and office equipment
- Fixtures and fittings
- Computer and office equipment
7 to 10 years
3 to 5 years
Motor vehicles 4 years
The carrying amounts of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment when there is an 
indication that they may be impaired.
(k) Investment properties
Investment properties are properties which are held either to earn rental income or for capital appreciation 
or for both. Investment properties are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Rental income from 
investment properties is accounted for on an accruals basis.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)  Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2017 99
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED) 
(l) Intangible assets
Intangible assets which arise (e.g. on the entering into of significant commercial contractual arrangements) 
are capitalised and amortised over the shorter of their useful life and the term of any contractual 
arrangement or, where appropriate and an indefinite life is chosen, made subject to an annual impairment 
review.
IT, software and web development costs are capitalised as intangible assets to the extent that certain 
projects can be separately identified and involve the production of new and/or enhanced systems that the 
Company will use over the medium term. It must also be considered probable that the asset will generate 
future economic benefits, and the development cost can be measured reliably. Where these conditions are 
not met, development expenditure is recognised as an expense in the year in which it is incurred. Directly 
attributable costs that are capitalised include employee and external costs specifically incurred in the 
development of the intangible asset. These costs are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated 
useful economic lives of up to 5 years when each system is brought into use by the Company.
(m) Goodwill
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of a business, representing the difference between the fair value of 
consideration and the fair value of the separable net assets acquired is capitalised and is subject to impairment 
review, both annually and when there are indications that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. 
(n) Impairment
The carrying amounts of the Group’s assets, other than inventories and deferred tax assets, are reviewed at 
each balance sheet date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication 
exists, the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. The recoverable amount of assets is the greater of their 
fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit 
exceeds its recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive 
Income.
An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the 
recoverable amount. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does 
not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, if no impairment 
loss had been recognised.
(o) Investments
In the Company’s accounts, investments in subsidiary and associated undertakings are initially stated 
at cost. Provision is made for any impairment in the value of these investments. In the Group accounts 
investments in associated undertakings are shown at cost plus accumulated profits less any dividends 
received from the associated undertakings.
(p) Inventories
Inventories principally include mobile telephones, LED light bulbs and other electronic equipment and are 
valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is measured on a first in, first out basis. Net 
realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be 
incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
(q) Financial instruments
The Group classifies financial instruments, or their component parts, on initial recognition as a financial 
asset, a financial liability or an equity instrument in accordance with the substance of the contractual 
arrangement. Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2017 100
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED) 
Financial instruments are recognised on the trade date when the Group becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions of the instrument. Financial instruments are recognised initially at fair value plus, in the case of a 
financial instrument not at fair value through profit and loss, transactions costs that are directly attributable 
to the acquisition or issue of the financial instrument.
Financial instruments are derecognised on the trade date when the Group is no longer a party to the 
contractual provisions of the instrument.
(r) Trade receivables
Trade receivables are stated at their nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated 
irrecoverable amounts. The interest that would be recognised from discounting future cash receipts over the 
short credit period is not considered to be material.
(s) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and deposits with banks and, for the purposes of the 
Cash Flow Statement, short term revolving credit facilities.
(t) Borrowings
Short and long term borrowings comprise revolving credit facilities and bank loans. The fees associated 
with entering into borrowing facilities are capitalised and netted off against borrowings and amortised over 
the term of the borrowings.
(u) Trade payables
Trade payables are stated at their nominal value, as the interest that would be recognised from discounting 
future cash payments over the short payment period is not considered to be material.
(v) Share based payments
The fair value at the date of grant of share based remuneration, principally share options, is calculated using 
a binomial pricing model and is charged to the Statement of Comprehensive Income on a straight line basis 
over the vesting period of the award. The charge to the Statement of Comprehensive Income takes account of 
the estimated number of shares that will vest. All share option based remuneration is equity settled. 
(w) Segmental reporting
Financial information on operating segments that corresponds with information regularly reviewed by the 
chief operating decision maker, Chief Executive Mr Andrew Lindsay, is disclosed in note 1 to the accounts.
(x) Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event, and it is 
probable that the Group will be required to settle that obligation. Provisions are measured at the directors’ 
best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date, and are 
discounted to present value where the effect is material.
(y) Pensions
The Group makes contributions to certain employees’ personal pension plans. These are charged to the 
Statement of Comprehensive Income in the year in which they become payable.
(z) Dividends
Final dividend distributions to the Company’s shareholders are recognised as a liability in the Group’s 
financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the Company’s shareholders. 
Interim dividends are recognised when paid. Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements

The Group has not yet applied the following standard as it is not yet effective in the consolidated Group 
financial statements and remains subject to endorsement by the EU:
• IFRS 16: Leases, effective for the year ending 31 March 2020.
The following standards are not yet effective in the consolidated Group financial statements but have been 
endorsed by the EU: 
• IFRS 9: Financial instruments, effective for the year ended 31 March 2019; and
• IFRS 15: Revenue from contracts with customers, effective for year ended 31 March 2019.
IFRS 15: Revenue from contracts with customers
IFRS 15 was issued in May 2014 and subsequent amendments, “Clarifications to IFRS 15”, were issued 
in April 2016. IFRS 15, as amended, is effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 
2018; it has not yet been adopted by the EU.
The impact of IFRS 15 on the Group’s reporting of revenue and costs is currently being assessed. Initial 
work has indicated that the following areas, inter alia, may also be impacted by IFRS 15:
•  Under IFRS 15, certain incremental costs incurred in acquiring a contract with a customer may be 
deferred on the balance sheet and amortised as revenue is recognised under the related contract; this 
could generally lead to the later recognition of charges for certain commissions payable to third party 
independent distributors.
•  Certain costs incurred in fulfilling customer contracts may be deferred on the balance sheet under IFRS 
15 and recognised as related revenue is recognised under the contract. Such deferred costs could be 
related to the provision of deliverables (other than mobile handsets) to customers that do not qualify as 
performance obligations and for which revenue is not recognised; currently such costs are generally 
expensed as incurred.
The Group is continuing to assess the impact of these and other accounting changes that will arise under 
IFRS 15; however, the changes highlighted above may have an impact on the consolidated income 
statement and consolidated statement of financial position after the Group adopts IFRS 15 on 1 April 2018.
When IFRS 15 is adopted, it can be applied either on a fully retrospective basis, requiring the restatement 
of the comparative periods presented in the financial statements, or with the cumulative retrospective impact 
of IFRS 15 applied as an adjustment to equity on the date of adoption; when the latter approach is applied 
it is necessary to disclose the impact of IFRS 15 on each line item in the financial statements in the reporting 
period. 
In respect of IFRS 9 and IFRS 16 exercises are underway to assess the impacts that these standards will 
have on the Group’s assets and liabilities.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
1. SEGMENT REPORTING 
The Group’s reportable segments reflect the two distinct activities around which the Group is organised:
• Customer Acquisition; and
• Customer Management.
Customer Acquisition revenues mainly comprise sales of equipment including mobile phone handsets 
and wireless internet routers to customers. Customer Management revenues are principally derived from 
the supply of fixed telephony, mobile telephony, gas, electricity, internet services and home insurance to 
residential and small business customers.
The Board measures the performance of its operating segments based on revenue and segment result, which 
is referred to as operating profit. The Group applies the same significant accounting policies across both 
operating segments.

Reductions in the UK corporation tax rate from 20% to 19% (effective from 1 April 2017) and to 17% 
(effective 1 April 2020) were substantively enacted on 26 October 2015 and 6 September 2016 
respectively. This will reduce the Company’s future current tax charge accordingly. The deferred tax liability  
at 31 March 2017 has been calculated based on these rates. 
The gain on disposal of Opus is not taxable income for tax purposes as it is eligible for the substantial 
shareholding exemption.

The operations of the Company were transferred into newly refurbished head offices at Merit House in 
2015 and the former head office building, Southon House, was vacated. Southon House is therefore now 
held as an investment property and separately disclosed on the balance sheet of the Company. 
An independent valuation of Southon House was conducted at 30 September 2015 in accordance with 
RICS Valuation – Professional Standards UK January 2014 (revised April 2015) guidelines. The independent 
market value of Southon House was determined to be £10.2 million and has been categorised as a Level 
3 fair value based on the inputs to the valuation technique used. The valuation was prepared on a Market 
Value basis as defined in the Valuation Standards and was primarily derived from using comparable market 
transactions carried out on an arm’s length basis. These inputs are deemed unobservable.
The directors believe that there have not been any material changes in circumstances that would lead to a 
significant change in the market valuation of Southon House since 30 September 2015.

The Energy Supply Contract intangible asset relates to the entering into of the new energy supply 
arrangements with Npower on improved commercial terms through the acquisition by the Company of 
Electricity Plus Supply Limited and Gas Plus Supply Limited (‘the Companies’) from Npower Limited having 
effect from 1 December 2013 (‘the Transaction’). 
The total consideration for the Transaction comprised a payment to Npower of £196.5 million on 20 
December 2013, a deferred amount of £21.5 million paid in December 2016 and a payment of £2.5 
million made in January 2014 for the net assets acquired in the Companies which comprised cash and 
short term working capital balances.
The addition to intangible assets of £221.6 million in 2014 therefore represented the total consideration 
paid and payable to Npower, excluding the payment for net assets acquired in the Companies, plus 
certain transaction costs of £3.6 million which in accordance with the relevant accounting standards were 
recognised as a cost of acquisition. 
The intangible asset is being amortised evenly over the 20 year life of the new energy supply agreement 
reflecting the period over which the Company will benefit from the agreement.
The Board regularly monitors the carrying amount of the intangible assets. A review was undertaken at 
31 March 2017 to assess whether the carrying amount of intangible assets was supported by their value 
in use determined by the net present value of the future cash flows derived from the assets using cash flow 
projections based on current levels of profitability. 
A post-tax discount rate of 7.0% was used which was considered appropriate given the expectation 
that, for term of the contract, the Group will continue to derive significant value from supplying energy to 
its customers. The result of the review undertaken at 31 March 2017 indicated that no impairment was 
necessary. No reasonably possible change in the assumptions used in the impairment calculation would 
give rise to an impairment of intangible assets.
The IT Software and Web Development intangible asset relates to the capitalisation of certain costs 
associated with the development of new IT and web systems. Approximately £1.3 million of the additions 
during the year relate to IT systems which remain under construction.

Goodwill relates to the Company’s subsidiary Telecommunications Management Limited (‘TML’) cash 
generating unit, which is included within the Customer Management operating segment. 
The Group regularly monitors the carrying amount of its goodwill. A review was undertaken at 31 March 
2017 to assess whether the carrying amount of assets was supported by their value in use determined by 
the net present value of the future cash flows derived from the assets using cash flow projections based on 
current levels of profitability. 
A post-tax discount rate of 10% into perpetuity was used which was considered appropriate given the 
relatively small size of the business and the expectation that, for the foreseeable future, TML will continue 
to operate as a going concern. However, no growth has been assumed in the review given the relative 
maturity of the business. The result of the review undertaken at 31 March 2017 indicated that no 
impairment was necessary. No reasonably possible change in the assumptions used in the impairment 
calculation would give rise to an impairment of goodwill.

8. INVESTMENTS 
Fixed asset investments
The investment in the associate represented the cost of purchasing a 20% (2016: 20%) equity interest in the 
ordinary share capital of Opus Energy Group Limited (‘Opus’), together with the Group’s share of retained 
reserves. The Company’s 20% investment in Opus was sold on 10 February 2017 for £71,102,650. 
The Group profit on disposal of Opus was £62,317,458 and the share of Opus profit for the period 
up to disposal was £2,200,000; these figures have been presented as discontinued operations in the 
Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income given the nature of Opus, as a supplier of energy to the 
corporate market, being substantially different to the continuing operations of the Company. No tax will be 
paid on the disposal as it is eligible for the substantial shareholding exemption.

from the JSOP Share Trust does not bear interest and is repayable on demand. There is no current 
expectation that the loan will be recalled by the Company within the next 12 months. Unamortised bank 
loan arrangement fees have been reclassified to non-current assets as the RCF facility was fully repaid as at 
31 March 2017. It is expected that amounts will be withdrawn from the facility in the coming 12 months.

In December 2015 the Group entered into new five-year £150,000,000 revolving debt facilities with 
Barclays Bank PLC and Lloyds Bank PLC (‘the Revolving Debt Facilities’). Interest is charged on the facilities 
in accordance with the schedule set out in the table below. As at 31 March 2017 the interest rate was 
LIBOR + 1.40%.

All bank loans are secured through a floating charge on the assets of the Group.
The Revolving Debt Facilities, when drawn down, are stated net of unamortised arrangement fees of 
£860,000 (2016: £1,089,000) on the face of the Balance sheet. These costs have been capitalised and 
are being amortised over the term of the Revolving Debt Facilities. At the year end the Revolving Debt 
Facilities were not drawn down and therefore the unamortised arrangement fees have been shown in non-
current assets as set out in note 10.
In addition, as at 31 March 2017 the Company had letters of credit in place relating to certain energy 
distribution charges with a total value covered of £15,585,500 (2016: £12,340,500).

15. CAPITAL AND RESERVES (CONTINUED) 
Capital management
The Group’s overall objective when managing capital is to continue to provide attractive returns to 
shareholders. 
Total shareholder equity at 31 March 2017 was £257.7 million (2016: £198.3 million). 
The Group’s current capital management strategy is to retain sufficient working capital for day to day 
operating requirements. In addition, as a result of the entering the energy supply arrangements with 
Npower in December 2013, and the consequent drawdown of transaction debt facilities, the Group’s 
capital management strategy is also to ensure that interest costs are minimised.
Under the revised energy supply arrangements which were effective from 1 December 2013, Npower 
continues to be responsible for funding the principal working capital requirements relating to the supply of 
energy to the Company’s customers. This includes funding the Budget Plans of customers who pay for their 
energy in equal monthly instalments and pre-funding the payment of certain energy network charges.

The Directors have proposed a final dividend of 25p per ordinary share totalling approximately £20.1 
million, payable on 28 July 2017, to shareholders on the register at the close of business on 7 July 2017. 
In accordance with the Group’s accounting policies the dividend has not been included as a liability as at 
31 March 2017. This dividend will be subject to income tax at each recipient’s individual marginal income 
tax rate.

 Adjusted basic and diluted EPS for continuing operations exclude share incentive scheme charges and the amortisation of the 
intangible asset recognised as a result of the new energy supply arrangements entered into with Npower in December 2013.
It has been deemed appropriate to present the analysis of adjusted EPS excluding share incentive scheme 
charges due to the relative size and historical volatility of the charges. In view of the size and nature of the 
charge as a non-cash item the amortisation of intangible assets arising from the energy supply agreement with 
Npower has also been adjusted.

Operating lease commitments
The Group is committed to make payments in respect of operating leases for land and buildings as follows: 
Company and Group 
2017 2016 
£’000 £’000
Amounts payable:
Less than one year 103 117
Between one and five years 68 193
171 310
The principal lease arrangements relate to office premises.
Capital commitments
At 31 March 2017 the Company had capital commitments of approximately £76,000 (2016: £285,000).
Energy supply arrangements
The Group entered into a 20 year energy supply agreement with Npower (‘the SSA’) on 20 December 2013. 
In the event that the SSA is terminated by Npower in certain circumstances, including on a material breach by 
the Group or on the insolvency of the Company, additional consideration of up to £187 million may become 
payable by the Company to Npower. Full details of the termination provisions of the SSA were set out in 
paragraph 4 of Part VIII on page 38 of the prospectus issued to shareholders on 20 November 2013. 
However, given the energy supply agreement termination rights are either, in the directors’ view, very unlikely 
to occur or entirely within the control of the Group, the directors believe the likelihood of this type of termination 
event is remote. 
The amount of the additional consideration reduces from £187 million to £11 million over the remaining life 
of the supply agreement. Furthermore, depending on the circumstances giving rise to a termination event, 
the additional consideration (if payable) may be spread over the unexpired term of the supply agreement. 
Following any such termination event, the Group would have direct access to the wholesale energy markets 
and the opportunity to earn additional margin from sourcing energy directly for the Group’s customer base.
18. SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS 
The Company has two share option plans, one of which is available to employees, the other to distributors of 
the Company. The Company has also established a Save As You Earn share option plan (‘the 2015 Employee 
SAYE Share Option Plan’) for employees.
All new employees who have passed the requisite probationary period are issued with market price options 
over shares in the Company, further options are also granted to existing employees depending on their 
seniority and length of service (‘The Telecom Plus PLC 2007 Employee Share Option Plan’). The 2015 
Employee SAYE Share Option Plan enables employees of the group to acquire shares in the Company in a tax 
efficient manner using monies saved from salary over a three or five year period. A summary of the principal 
terms of the SAYE Share Option Plan were set out in the Appendix to the 2015 AGM circular sent to all 
shareholders.

The distributor scheme (‘The Telecom Plus PLC 2007 Networkers and Consultants Share Option Plan’) exists to 
provide incentives to the people who are most successful in gathering new customers for the Company. As it is 
not possible to measure directly the benefit received from these activities, the fair value of the benefit received 
has been measured by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments granted.

19. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
Treasury activities take place under procedures and policies approved and monitored by the Board. They 
are designed to minimise the financial risks faced by the Group which primarily arise from credit, interest 
rate and liquidity risks.
Carrying amounts of financial instruments
All financial assets, which include cash, trade and other receivables and accrued income, are classified as 
loans and receivables with a total value for the Group of £155,336,000 (2016: £169,444,000) and for 
the Company of £43,637,000 (2016: £65,201,000). 
All financial liabilities, which include trade and other payables and accrued expenditure, are held at 
amortised cost with a total value for the Group of £135,421,000 (2016: £227,857,000) and for the 
Company £51,099,000 (2016: £140,930,000).
Credit risk 
All customers are invoiced monthly and approximately 90% pay by direct debit; accordingly credit risk 
in respect of trade receivables is considered low due to the large number of customers supplied, each of 
whom represents an insignificant proportion of total revenue. 
The Company has a universal supply obligation in relation to the provision of energy to domestic customers. 
This means that although the Company is entitled to request a reasonable deposit from a potential new 
customer who is not considered creditworthy, the Company is obliged to supply domestic energy to anyone 
who submits a properly completed application form. Where such customers subsequently fail to pay for 
the energy they have used (‘delinquent customers’), there is likely to be a delay before the Company 
is able to eliminate its exposure to future bad debt from them by either installing a pre-payment meter 
or disconnecting their supply, and the costs associated with preventing such delinquent customers from 
increasing their indebtedness are not always fully recoverable. 
The Group has identified specific balances for which it has provided an impairment allowance on a line by line 
basis across all ledgers, in both years. No general impairment allowance has been provided in either year.
The allowance accounts in respect of trade receivables are used to record impairment losses unless the 
Group is satisfied that no recovery of the amount owing is possible; at that point the amounts considered 
irrecoverable are written off against the financial asset directly.
The maximum credit risk for the Group is £155,336,000 (2016: £169,444,000) and for the Company 
£43,637,000 (2016: £65,201,000).
Interest rate risk 
The Group finances its day to day operations primarily through cash generated within the business. Cash 
surpluses are placed on deposit with Barclays Bank PLC and Lloyds Bank PLC at money market rates to 
maximise returns. 
The Group’s profit and equity for the current year will not be significantly affected by changes in the UK 
base rate of +/- 1% from current levels. 
Commodity price risk
The Group is not materially exposed to any fluctuations in commodity prices due to the nature of the 
agreements with wholesale providers of telephony and energy services and its ability to pass the effect of 
any such fluctuations through to its customers.

rates above Base Rate.

guarantee with the Company’s subsidiaries Electricity Plus Supply Limited, Gas Plus Supply Limited, Utilities 
Plus Limited and Telecommunications Management Limited. Further details of the facilities are set out in note 
12 of these financial statements.
Fair values
There is not considered to be any material difference between the fair value of any financial instruments 
and their net book amount due to the short-term maturity of the instruments.
