STRATEGIC REPORT 
AT A GLANCE
Strong cash generation and investment to 
deliver rollout of both the Revolución de Cuba 
and Revolution brands.
Our Revolution bars have been trading since 
1996 and are a destination of choice for 
customers who value a premium drinks and 
food-led offering.
Each Revolution bar has its own character, 
individual design and layout, with bar interiors 
tailored on a site-by-site basis to utilise the 
space available and the best attributes of the 
architecture of each bar.
The success of our Revolution brand is driven by 
our customers’ desire to be entertained outside 
of their homes in highly invested, exciting, quality, 
contemporary environments. The principal 
revenue streams are generated from our wide 
range of premium cocktails and drinks and our 
lunchtime and evening food offerings.
New Revolución de Cubas at Harrogate, Aberdeen, Reading and Glasgow were 
opened in the first half of the period, and were followed by two new Revolutions 
in Southend and Torquay in the final quarter.
The bar design differs from the Revolution 
concept, with Revolución de Cuba bars being 
characterised by their 1940s Cuban-inspired 
style, with dark woods, traditional bar counters, 
antique tiles, vintage furniture, Havana-style 
ceiling fans and original Cuban artwork and 
photographs, with each bar tailored to give 
it an individual character.
The success of our Revolución de Cuba brand 
is driven by the Cuban-inspired premium 
proposition offering cocktails, food and live music 
to a wide range of customers. The principal 
revenue streams are generated from our rum-led 
cocktail range coupled with a Spanish and 
Mexican-based tapas-inspired food menu and 
authentic live Latin music and entertainment.

03 Our results
Our reported results show good progress 
against the prior period, with sales growth 
of +9.2 per cent and even stronger growth in 
adjusted EBITDA *** at +16.0 per cent against 
the restated figure for the prior period. We 
consider adjusted EBITDA *** to be the key 
measure that best represents the business’ 
underlying performance as it excludes 
exceptional items and bar opening costs 
that are a function of the timing of the new 
venue development programme rather 
than the underlying trade. Last year’s 
adjusted EBITDA*** has been restated from 
£15.6 million to £13.0 million. Operating 
profit was £3.7 million (2016 Restated*: 
£5.3 million) but this was after charging 
exceptional items of £4.3 million (2016 
Restated*: £1.4 million).
During the year, there was significant change 
within our finance team. This included the 
Chief Financial Officer, Sean Curran, and the 
Group Financial Controller, who had both 
been with the business for over ten years, 
both leaving the Group. Chris Chambers 
replaced Sean in the autumn of 2016 but 
resigned shortly thereafter in February 2017 . 
Mike Foster joined the business in March 
2017 , initially as interim Finance Director, 
before being appointed to the Board and 
as the Group’s Chief Financial Officer in 
early June 2017 . 
The new team’s initial focus was to assess 
the forecast results for the current period. 
This review resulted in the trading update 
that was released on 19 May 2017. The 
current finance team has strengthened 
and upgraded the systems and processes 
of the finance function. Additionally, a 
detailed review has been undertaken of 
the application of the Group’s accounting 
policies and practices. This review has 
resulted in a restatement of the prior 
period’s results.
Summary
STRATEGIC REPORT 
CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
The clear and focused strategy, the quality of our sites and proposition, and the talent 
within the Group leave the business well placed for further growth in 2018. 
The scale and strength of our new venue pipeline and the excellent returns achieved 
by new venues opened in the last two years mean that the business can be confident 
about achieving its growth targets going forward.
>  The Board paid an interim dividend 
this year of 1.65 pence per share 
(2016: 1.5 pence per share).
>  Subject to approval at the 
Company’s annual general 
meeting, we will pay a final 
dividend of 3.3 pence per share 
(2016: 3.3 pence per share).
As the Chairman of Revolution Bars 
Group plc, it is my privilege to introduce 
this, our third annual report and accounts 
for the 52 weeks ended 1 July 2017. 
Our business
The strategy of the Group is to provide 
high-quality retail brands in the leisure sector. 
Our business comprises two strong brands: 
Revolution, which is focused on young adults, 
and Revolución de Cuba, which is focused on 
a broader age range. Whilst both businesses 
are wet-led, food is an important part of our 
growth and of our appeal to both customer 
groups. Our strategy for growing the business 
is to be customer focused, continually striving 
to provide a better experience both in terms 
of product offering, ambience and facilities 
leading to repeat visits and driving like-for-like 
sales. The Group is additionally focused on 
growing its footprint and number of premium 
bars by seeking new sites in good locations, 
and investing capital to deliver good returns. 
This year we opened six new venues, four of 
which were Revolución de Cubas. Two years 
ago, Revolución de Cuba traded from only 
five venues but, including Belfast, which 
opened shortly after the period end, the 
brand now trades from 14 venues and has 
the potential for further significant growth 
in the number of trading units.
At the beginning of the period, the Group 
operated from 62 venues (53 Revolutions 
and nine Revolución de Cubas). During the 
reporting period there were six openings and 
we temporarily closed one venue in May but 
reopened it in September 2017 , and therefore 
the Group traded from 67 venues at the end 
of the reporting period.

Annual Report and Accounts 2017
04 Recommended cash offer for 
the Group 
Following the Group’s trading update in 
May 2017 updating investors on lower than 
anticipated profitability for the full year ended 
1 July 2017, and the resulting drop in the 
Group’s share price, Stonegate Pub Company 
Limited (“Stonegate”) made an approach to 
acquire the Group. On 24 August 2017 , the 
Board recommended Stonegate’s cash offer 
of 203 pence per share, which represented 
a 62.4 per cent premium to the share price 
prior to the commencement of the offer 
period on 31 July 2017. It is expected that 
the Group’s shareholders will vote on the 
recommended cash offer from Stonegate 
on 17 October 2017 .
The Board is also engaged with Deltic 
Group plc (“Deltic”) as a possible offeror 
for the Group. Deltic has outlined a merger 
proposal, which the Board has rejected due 
to significant concerns regarding both value 
and deliverability. Deltic has indicated that, 
in order to put forward its merger proposal 
and discuss it with the Group’s shareholders, 
it will in due course publish its own profit 
forecast and a quantified financial benefits 
statement in respect of a merger. In parallel, 
Deltic has also stated that it continues 
to evaluate a possible cash offer for the 
Group. The Takeover Panel announced on 
21 September 2017 that Deltic must either 
announce a firm intention to make an offer 
for the Group under Rule 2.7 of the City Code 
on Takeovers and Mergers, or announce 
that it does not intend to make an offer, 
by 5.00 p.m. on 10 October 2017. Deltic 
is continuing to perform due diligence on 
the Group, and the Board is committed to 
ensuring that the interests of shareholders 
are best served.
Our Board
As previously noted, Chris Chambers 
resigned from the Board in February 2017 . 
Mike Foster was appointed as Chief Financial 
Officer (and to the Board) in early June 2017 . 
We also welcomed Jemima Bird as a 
Non-executive Director in December 2016.
Our dividend
T o date, the Board has adopted a progressive 
dividend policy reflecting the cash flow 
*  Restated – see Note 1(b) of the consolidated financial statements for an explanation and analysis of the prior year adjustments included in respect of the profit for the 53 weeks ended 2 July 2016.
** Like-for-like sales are defined as total retail sales from bars that have been trading continuously for at least 12 months.
*** Adjusted EBITDA excludes exceptional items and bar opening costs (see reconciliation table on page 18 of the Financial Review).
generation and long-term earnings potential 
of the Group whilst retaining sufficient capital 
to fund investment to grow the business. 
However, in light of the restatement of profits 
relating to earlier periods and the lower level 
of underlying earnings for the current period 
relative to original expectations, the Board is 
proposing a final dividend of 3.3 pence per 
share (2016: 3.3 pence). This will result in the 
dividend for the full year being at 4.95 pence 
per share, an interim dividend of 1.65 pence 
per share (2016: 1.5 pence) having been 
paid on 6 April 2017 .
The final dividend is subject to approval at 
the Company’s annual general meeting and 
would ordinarily be expected to be paid on 
7 December 2017 . However, if the Stonegate 
acquisition of the Group completes prior to 
the annual general meeting taking place, the 
dividend will not be payable. 
Stonegate will have the right to reduce 
the amount of consideration payable for 
each Revolution share by the amount of 
any dividend (or other distribution) which 
is paid or becomes payable by Revolution 
to Revolution shareholders before the date on 
which the proposed scheme of arrangement 
becomes effective, which is expected to 
be on or about 23 October 2017. Based 
on the expected timetable, therefore, it is 
not anticipated that any dividend (or other 
distribution) will be paid or that the offer 
price will be reduced. 
If Stonegate does exercise its right to reduce 
the amount of consideration payable for 
each Revolution share by the amount of any 
dividend (or other distribution) that has not 
been paid, Revolution shareholders will be 
entitled to receive and retain that dividend 
(or other distribution). 
Our people
The Group has a skilled workforce as 
well as experienced senior and regional 
management teams with proven credentials 
in the industry. Strong cohesive teams have 
been built across our businesses with a 
focus on staff training and development to 
continuously improve individual capabilities 
and trading performance. I would like 
to recognise the commitment and the 
substantial effort of all our employees 
and thank them for their contribution to the 
Group’s performance. It is their continued 
dedication and commitment to the business 
together with a clear strategic plan that is 
integral to our achievements.
Our future
Given the recommended cash offer for 
the business from Stonegate, it is likely that 
the ownership of the Company will change 
in the next few weeks. However, such an 
event is not certain and, whatever the 
outcome of the potential transactions, 
the business is well placed to succeed.
We have two strong brands that are trading 
well in a challenging market. In the first 
quarter of the new period, like-for-like** 
sales are +0.3 per cent and our first new 
opening this year in Belfast has achieved 
the best initial sales levels of all 12 openings 
in the last two years, averaging £80k per full 
week since opening. 
The sector is facing some well-publicised 
and significant cost headwinds: minimum 
wage and living wage rate increases, the 
introduction of the apprenticeship levy 
and substantial increases in general rates 
following the 2017 revaluation. Staffing 
and recruitment may now also come under 
pressure due to Brexit-related issues. 
However, now that we have dealt with 
the historical financial reporting issues, 
and have improved reporting and controls 
in place, we are better placed to be able 
to rise to these challenges.
The scale and strength of our new venue 
pipeline and the excellent returns achieved 
by new venues opened in the last two years 
mean that the business can be confident 
about achieving its growth targets going 
forward. The clear and focused strategy, the 
quality of our sites and proposition, and the 
talent within the Group leave the business 
well placed for further growth in 2018.

05 I can report that the business has made 
good operational progress during the 
last reporting period. At the heart of that 
progress is our focused strategy to:
 > build customer loyalty, ensuring 
that all visits to our venues are an 
excellent experience;
 > drive continued profit improvement 
from existing sites; and
 > expand the estate into new 
profitable locations.
Building customer loyalty
Customer loyalty is determined by many 
factors. We do not take anything for 
granted with employees in all areas of our 
business contributing fully to this goal.
 > Our drinks purchasing team is 
continuously seeking new products 
and looking to premiumise, innovate 
and evolve our customer proposition 
through new products, service quality 
and brand support. Cocktails, which 
comprise 23 per cent of our total drink 
sales by value, are a good demonstration 
of the success of this team’s approach. 
Our two brands currently list in the 
region of 100 different cocktails and 
change menus four times per annum to 
ensure that there is always something 
new. Last year we introduced more than 
130 new serves.
 > Our food development team is always 
seeking to innovate with new dishes 
and ways in which to make the service 
delivery faster and more consistent. We 
regularly introduce specials to determine 
whether a new dish could become part 
of the regular menu. In a small number 
of venues, we are currently trialling a 
reduced number of menu options with 
encouraging results, delivering important 
benefits such as reduced wastage, labour 
savings and purchasing economies.
 > Our people development teams are 
continually enhancing training and 
recruitment programmes to ensure 
that we have front line staff capable of 
providing outstanding customer service.
 > Our sales and marketing teams promote 
our proposition particularly well. By 
getting close to and understanding our 
customers, through both social media 
and in our venues, they ensure that 
our customers’ needs are fulfilled. 
Our pre-booked revenue, which has 
grown consistently year on year, is a 
key driver of like-for-like sales. In the 
reporting period, £17.1 million of our 
income was pre-booked. We also monitor 
standards very closely through customer 
feedback scores and a “mystery visitor” 
programme, and results are reviewed 
weekly by the Senior Management T eam.
 > Our operations teams are ultimately 
responsible for the business delivery, 
and have to plan and co-ordinate the 
right resources to ensure the customer 
enjoys an excellent experience.
STRATEGIC REPORT 
CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S STATEMENT
Customer loyalty is determined by many factors. We do not take anything for granted 
with people in all areas of our business contributing fully to this goal.
Driving profit improvement from existing sites requires a focus on both sales and costs, 
which is integral to the way that all our teams are managed.
Six openings are planned for the new financial period: three Revolutions 
and three Revolución de Cubas.
Summary
  >  Positive set of results for the 
financial year ended 1 July 2017.
  >  Existing site portfolio achieving 
positive like-for-like sales** of 
+1.5 per cent.
  >  Six new bars opened in the 
reporting period and are 
trading strongly.

06 Driving profit improvement from 
existing sites
Driving profit improvement from existing 
sites requires a focus on both sales and 
costs, which is integral to the way that all 
our teams are managed. 
 > Premiumisation of our drink and food 
offerings and strong brand identities 
differentiate our business model and 
customer offer. We are conscious that, 
in a challenging marketplace, we do 
not overprice and therefore monitor 
competitor prices very closely to ensure 
we continue to be competitive and take 
advantage of our premium positioning.
 > Driving sales is the most important 
activity of our sales and marketing 
teams, which constantly produce new 
campaigns and work with brand owners 
to build promotions to drive footfall and 
to encourage customers to increase 
spend. For example, cocktail master 
classes are very popular – in the last 
year we achieved £4.7 million of 
incremental sales and have recently 
launched an online retail option for our 
flavoured vodkas. During the year, we 
recruited two corporate sales managers 
to also develop this part of the market. 
Their early results are encouraging and, 
in particular, our Christmas bookings for 
2017 are significantly ahead of last year. 
 > Our finance and IT teams play a critical 
role in providing the systems and 
reporting to facilitate running an efficient 
business. Significant IT developments 
have been undertaken in the year to 
support the sales, operations and people 
development teams. Our finance team 
has had much to contend with in the 
last year and it is now very clear that 
our accounting systems and processes 
were in need of upgrading. Improvements 
have been made, and will continue to 
be made, in this area to provide a more 
robust financial infrastructure and in 
so doing bring additional benefits.
*  Restated – see Note 1(b) of the consolidated financial statements for an explanation and analysis of the prior year adjustments included in respect of the profit for the 53 weeks ended 2 July 2016.
** Like-for-like sales are defined as total retail sales from bars that have been trading continuously for at least 12 months.
*** Adjusted EBITDA excludes exceptional items and bar opening costs (see reconciliation table on page 18 of the Financial Review).
 > As ever, it is the operations team at the 
“sharp end” of the business which drives 
sales through outstanding operating 
standards and marketing effectively to its 
customers at a local level. Payroll is our 
biggest cost and it has risen significantly 
in recent years as a result of the increases 
to minimum wage and living wage. Our 
efforts to meet these structural challenges 
have not been quick enough, but we are 
introducing new systems that will result in 
improved labour scheduling and better 
control of this significant cost.
Expansion of our estate
Our property team is driving significant 
value through its site selection and 
property development activities. During 
the reporting period, we opened two 
Revolutions in Southend and T orquay and 
four Revolución de Cubas in Harrogate, 
Aberdeen, Reading and Glasgow. 
Revolution in Macclesfield closed at 
the end of May 2017 but reopened in 
September 2017 after the period end. 
Shortly after the period end we opened 
a Revolución de Cuba in Belfast and 
now trade from 69 venues (55 Revolutions 
and 14 Revolución de Cubas).
Sales levels at the new sites have been 
excellent. Our primary objective at opening 
is to ensure that we provide an outstanding 
customer experience and our venues are 
resourced accordingly. Newly trained staff 
are unable to achieve full efficiency initially, 
but this strategy aims to ensure good 
feedback scores and good word of mouth 
marketing and achieve significant repeat 
business. Additionally, there are significant 
marketing costs associated with a launch, 
and therefore new sites do not make a full 
contribution in their first year of trading 
(and, in some cases, can take a full year 
to reach normal operating maturity and 
efficiency). We believe this is the right 
approach for the long-term health and 
viability of these new venues, a belief 
which is being borne out in practice by 
the achievement of very strong returns 
in the second year of trading.
Six openings are planned for the new 
financial period: three Revolutions and 
three Revolución de Cubas. Belfast 
Revolución de Cuba opened in July and 
new Revolutions are planned to open 
before Christmas in Inverness, Solihull and 
Putney. Two further Revolución de Cubas 
are expected to open in the second half.
The property team has built a very strong 
pipeline with three further sites that could 
potentially open in the second half of the 
current financial period, but given that our 
developments are primarily funded from 
internally generated cash resources, they 
are planned for early in the 2018/19 financial 
period. The pipeline being developed 
beyond that is considerable and we would 
expect to be able to open at least six sites 
per annum for several years onwards.
Results
The year-on-year growth in total revenue 
of +9.2 per cent and adjusted EBITDA*** 
of +16.0 per cent reflects good progress 
despite the absorption of significant cost 
headwinds affecting the whole sector. 
Operating profit was £3.7 million (2016 
Restated*: £5.3 million) but this was after 
charging exceptional items of £4.3 million 
(2016 Restated*: £1.4 million).
Employees and management teams
I would like to acknowledge the dedication 
and commitment demonstrated by all 
our employees.
The results of the Group represent a 
collective effort and I would like to thank all 
of our employees for their support during the 
year and for their contribution to our results.

OUR MARKETS
Significant growth in pipeline with 
six openings confirmed for FY18
Market overview
With their combination of premium drinks, food 
and entertainment, both of the Group’s brands, 
Revolution and Revolución de Cuba, are well 
placed to take advantage of market trends.
The market is moving towards premium products 
with discerning customers willing to pay a little bit 
more for premium brands and handmade cocktails 
as a key element of their “night out”. With premium 
spirits now accounting for half of all spirit sales 
and with cocktails, as a category, forecast to continue 
strong growth through 2018, the premium positions 
of the Group’s brands are clearly aligned with 
market trends.
The Group seeks to operate, through both of its 
brands, at the premium end of each local market it 
serves. Use of branded products, premium pricing 
and a highly invested, quality environment appeals 
to aspirational customers, particularly females.

Aberdeen Underlying cause of risk Response and mitigation
DEPENDENCE ON KEY SITES
The Group operates throughout the UK and therefore 
has income sources from a geographically diverse estate. 
Notwithstanding that, certain sites deliver more profit than 
others and the Group’s profits are sensitive to this. A decline 
in profitability in a key site would have an adverse impact on 
Group profits and, in some cases, this could be material.
There are two mitigating actions to this risk. Firstly, 
operational teams are focused on the maintenance of 
profits of economically significant sites. Secondly, growing 
the business, through the addition of new sites, enhances 
the portfolio effect and reduces the Group’s exposure to the 
fortunes of any particular site. 
ACQUISITION OF NEW SITES
The Group’s strategy is based on growth through the 
acquisition of new sites. Market expectations rely on the Group 
sourcing and developing a number of suitable sites per annum. 
Failure to identify the sites or to develop them commercially 
would impact growth rates.
The development team has been expanded to ensure that 
all pipeline opportunities are pursued. A wide selection of 
property agents has also been briefed. Public company status 
is seen as attractive to potential landlords, enhancing the 
Group’s covenant, as is the Group’s low-debt balance sheet.
CONSUMER DEMAND
The eating-out and drinking-out markets are dependent on 
consumers’ disposable income. Macroeconomic factors, such 
as employment levels, interest rates and consumer confidence, 
can be important influences on disposable income. Declines in 
disposable income in the Group’s target market could adversely 
impact the levels of demand and, hence, profitability.
The Group retains the ability to tailor its offering to respond to 
macroeconomic influences. Pricing, discounting, marketing and 
promotions can all be adjusted quickly to respond to pressures. 
Furthermore, the Group’s proposition is not based solely on 
price. A more affluent demographic is targeted and, in so 
doing, there is some down-side protection against adverse 
macroeconomic factors impacting on disposable income and 
consumer demand. 
DISCOUNTING
The Group operates in a market that is sensitive to the balance 
between supply (licensed premises and related capacity) and 
demand (from consumers). Imbalances can lead to competitive 
discounting in local marketplaces and this can place competitive 
pressures on the Group’s pricing structures. Should the Group 
feel compelled to respond through discounting, operating 
margins could be affected.
The risk of entering into a competitive discounting environment 
is mitigated by the fact that the appeal of the Group’s brands 
is not based on price. Environment, use of premium products, 
innovative serves and entertainment all combine to attract 
those customers who are willing to spend more. The risk of 
discounting is therefore transferred, at least in part, to other 
operators within the sector.
The Group believes that the principal risks and uncertainties faced 
by the business are captured in the table below. Occurrence of any 
of these risks or a combination of them may significantly impact 
the business or impair the achievement of our strategic goals.
STRATEGIC REPORT 
PRINCIPAL RISKS
Revolution Bars Group plc  
Annual Report and Accounts 2017
14 Underlying cause of risk Response and mitigation
HEALTH AND SAFETY
The Group’s venues are open to the public and the Group 
has a duty of care to look after its customers. Failure to do so 
through failure to operate the Group’s policies and procedures 
effectively could lead not only to financial loss, but also to 
negative associations with the brands.
The Group’s policies and procedures manual covers all aspects 
of operations. Adherence to these is strictly enforced both through 
internal operational line management and through external 
third-party audits. Incidents are followed up and lessons are 
reflected in the manual, which is updated from time to time.
LEASEHOLD RENTS
All of the Group’s operating sites are held on leases. Typically, 
the rents under these leases are determined every five years 
for each five-year period by reference to open market rents 
prevailing at the time of the review. Most leases stipulate 
upward-only increases. Increases in market rents coinciding 
with rent reviews could impair the net profitability of the 
relevant site, which could damage returns.
Market rents in each location are beyond the control of the 
Group. To mitigate this risk, the Group employs specialist rent 
review advisers, who deal only with tenant reviews. Further 
mitigation is offered by the fact that rent reviews are spread 
out geographically and in terms of timing, meaning that on 
average one-fifth of the estate reviews are concluded each 
year. This minimises the exposure to any rental market in 
any specific location or at any point in time.
SUPPLIER CONCENTRATION
The drinks distribution market is dominated by one 
significant business, Matthew Clark, which supplies the 
Group. If Matthew Clark were to face business difficulties 
or otherwise change its arrangements or pricing, then the 
Group’s operations could be disrupted.
The proposed strategy is to tolerate the risk, principally based on 
the Group’s assessment that Matthew Clark represents the best 
supplier. Matthew Clark operates nationwide whereas other drink 
wholesalers do not; it has a long history and good service record 
with the Group; and the Group is an important customer. 
Mitigation is in place through a four-year deal (signed April 2015) 
giving continued surety of supply. Further mitigation is provided 
through the Group’s principal commercial deals being with brand 
owners and not, therefore, dependent on the identity of the 
distributor. The Group has in place a contingency plan if required.
NATIONAL MINIMUM/LIVING WAGE
A significant proportion of venue-based staff, at any point in time, 
are affected, directly or indirectly, by wage legislation. Above 
inflation increases in wage rates could impair site profitability.
Whilst there have been wage increases above rates of inflation, 
recent increases have been more in line with inflation and have 
therefore been covered by increases in the sales prices paid by 
the customer. Future increases in wage costs are expected to 
be covered in the same way.
Revolution Bars Group plc  
Annual Report and Accounts 2017
15 Prior period adjustments
Towards the end of the reporting period, 
and following a thorough internal financial 
review, it has come to light that certain 
marketing expenditures were incorrectly 
capitalised as short-life assets, and that 
there had been an over-accrual of supplier 
rebates at previous period ends. As a result, 
the Board engaged PwC to undertake a 
detailed independent review and report 
on these items. This report was delivered 
to the Board in August 2017. The correction 
of these two items has resulted in a 
restatement of the accounts for the 53-week 
period ended 2 July 2016. In parallel with 
the PwC work, the Audit Committee of the 
Board decided that, ahead of the completion 
of the consolidated financial statements for 
the reporting period, a thorough review 
should also be undertaken of the 
application of the Group’s accounting 
policies and practices. This has resulted in 
the identification of a number of adjustments 
that are required to be made in prior period 
accounts. Many of these relate to 2016, 
although some relate to earlier periods. 
The adjustments are outlined in notes 
to the announcement. In aggregate, the 
effect of the prior period restatement is 
to reduce net assets at 27 June 2015 by 
£2.5 million. The cumulative effect of the 
restatements was to reduce profit after 
tax for the period ended 2 July 2016 by 
£1.7 million, and to reduce net assets as 
at 2 July 2016 by £3.3 million.
Throughout this report, the 2016 
comparatives are described as "Restated", 
which means they are adjusted for prior 
period adjustments.
Summary
STRATEGIC REPORT

Revenue increases comprised part-year contributions from the six new sites opened during 
the period, the annualisation of the five new sites opened in the prior period, as well 
as an increased contribution from established sites. 
Improvement in operating margin
1
 has been predominantly driven by improvements in profit 
conversion from the five openings in the prior period and improved terms on a number 
of product supply arrangements, which helped gross margin improve by 0.8 per cent.
The five venues opened in the prior period generated EBITDA in the current period 
of £2.3 million, producing a return on capital of 32 per cent.

16 Results
Revenue for the year was £130.5 million 
(2016: £119.5 million), a +9.2 per cent 
increase compared with the prior period. 
The revenue increase comprised part-year 
contributions from six new sites opened 
during the period and the annualisation of 
five new sites opened in the prior period 
as well as an increased contribution from 
established sites. Revenue from like-for-like** 
venues increased on the prior period by 
1.5 per cent. 
Operating profit was £3.7 million (2016 
Restated*: £5.3 million) but this was after 
charging exceptional items of £4.3 million 
(2016 Restated*: £1.4 million).
The underlying result, as measured 
by adjusted EBITDA*** was £15.1 million 
(2016 Restated*: £13.0 million), an increase 
of 16.0 per cent. This reflects an adjusted 
EBITDA*** margin of 11.6 per cent of 
revenue compared with 10.8 per cent in the 
prior period (Restated*). This improvement 
has been predominantly driven by 
improvements in profit conversion from 
the five openings in the prior period and 
improved terms on a number of product 
supply arrangements, which helped gross 
margin improve by 0.8 per cent. This was 
notwithstanding that food sales, where 
margins are lower, increased their share 
of total revenue from 13.6 per cent to 
14.3 per cent due to the accelerated 
expansion of the Group’s Revolución de 
Cuba branded venues, where food sales 
are a higher proportion of total revenue. 
The improvements in gross margin are 
also testament to our policy of offering a 
premium drinks range and the introduction 
of many new brands with significant 
support from the brand owners.
The table below shows how adjusted EBITDA*** has moved forward in the constituent 
parts of the estate.

Adjusted EBITDA from venues 22.2 20.0
Central support costs (7.1) (7.0)
Adjusted EBITDA 15.1 13.0
Despite like-for-like** sales growth and 
improvements in gross margin, adjusted 
EBITDA*** in the older estate has reduced 
by £0.5 million, predominantly reflecting 
the 53rd week in the 2016 period and on 
an underlying basis with revenue growth 
and margin improvements offsetting higher 
than inflation cost increases on wages 
and overheads.
Of the five venues opened in the prior 
period, three opened in the first half and 
two towards the end of the second half 
(and the profit maturity at these sites is 
very encouraging). Adjusted EBITDA*** 
excludes bar opening costs, meaning the 
improvement is due to a combination of 
annualisation of revenue, sales growth 
post-anniversary of opening (included in 
like-for-like** sales increase) and maturing 
EBITDA conversion. As referred to in the 
Chief Executive Officer’s report, our 
primary objective at opening is to ensure 
outstanding customer experience, and it 
is entirely expected that revenue growth 
is achieved post-anniversary and that 
operating efficiencies improve significantly 
over time. Average revenue per venue 
for these five venues in the period was 
£2.5 million, with adjusted EBITDA*** 
equating to 18.4 per cent of revenue. We 
anticipate seeing further profit improvements 
at these sites in the coming period and, 
ultimately, for adjusted EBITDA*** 
conversion to exceed 20 per cent.
Six venues opened in the current period, 
four Revolución de Cubas in the first half 
and two Revolutions towards the end of the 
second half. All have traded well achieving 
total revenue in the year of £5.6 million 
and adjusted EBITDA*** of £0.8 million, 
which equates to 14.2 per cent of revenue. 
Clearly this group of sites has yet to reach 
full maturity, but we expect improvements 
in the coming year that should also 
approach an adjusted EBITDA*** 
conversion of 20 per cent.
Central costs represent 5.4 per cent revenue 
compared to 5.9 per cent in the prior period.
The Group’s reported pre-tax profit 
reduced to £3.6 million (2016 Restated*: 
£5.1 million). The reported result for the 
period has been significantly impacted by 
exceptional items and bar opening costs 
for new venues of £5.7 million (2016 
Restated*: £2.3 million).

STRATEGIC REPORT 
FINANCIAL REVIEW CONTINUED
Exceptional items and bar 
opening costs
Exceptional items, by virtue of their 
size, incidence or nature, are disclosed 
separately in order to allow a better 
understanding of the underlying trading 
performance of the Group. Costs of 
£4.3 million (2016 Restated*: £1.4 million) 
were associated with the changes in 
Chief Financial Officer, additional 
resourcing to support the accounting 
review, a fixed assets impairment charge, 
an increase in the provision for onerous 
leases and charges relating to the Long 
Term Incentive Plan. The prior period costs 
principally related to professional fees 
associated with an aborted acquisition. 
Bar opening costs refer to costs incurred 
in getting new sites fully operational and 
primarily include costs incurred before 
opening and in preparing for the launch.
The Board believes that the performance 
measures, adjusted EBITDA***, adjusted 
operating profit*** and adjusted pre-tax 
profit***, give a clearer indication of the 
underlying performance of the business 
as they exclude exceptional items and 
bar opening costs that are a function 
of the timing of the new venue 
development programme rather 
than the underlying trade. 
Finance cost
Finance costs of £0.2 million (2016: £0. 1 million) 
relate to borrowings under the Group’s 
committed revolving credit facility and also 
include commitment fees relating to any 
undrawn element of the facility and 
the amortisation of arrangement fees 
over the life of the facility. During the year, 
the Group increased its credit facility to 
£25 million to provide greater flexibility in 
managing the timing of capital investments 
so that good opportunities are not foregone 
and also to provide headroom against 
unforeseen short-term trading issues. 
At the end of the period, loans of £7 .5 million 
(2016: £0.5 million) were outstanding on 
the revolving credit facility.
Taxation
The current period shows a tax credit 
of £0.6 million (2016 Restated*: charge 
of £0.7 million) due to credits from earlier 
periods more than offsetting the current 
year tax charge. The corporation tax payable 
on profits in the current period amounts 
to £0.9 million (2016 Restated*: £1.1 million) 
but is offset by a net deferred tax credit 
arising from timing differences and 
adjustments to prior periods of £1.4 million. 
Capital expenditure and returns 
on invested capital
The Group invested £12.8 million (2016 
Restated*: £11.9 million) in total during 
the period, of which £8.6 million (2016 
Restated*: £6.5 million) related to new 
venues and £4.2 million (2016 Restated*: 
£5.4 million) related to developing and 
maintaining the existing estate. £1.5 million 
of the expenditure on new venues related 
to the new Revolución de Cuba in Belfast 
that did not open until the third week of 
July 2017, just after the period end.
The five venues opened in the prior 
period generated adjusted EBITDA *** in 
the current period of £2.3 million. The capital 
development cost for these five venues was 
£7.1 million producing a return on capital 
of 32 per cent during the current reporting 
period (adjusted EBITDA *** divided by capital 
cost). As indicated in the results section, 
some of these venues opened at the end 
of the prior period and their current period 
performance does not reflect full maturity 
of either sales or EBITDA conversion. Further 
improvements in both sales and profit are 
being achieved at these venues that will 
drive the returns higher. The six venues 
opened in the current year are following 
a similar trading and maturity profile to 
date and similar returns are expected.
Operating cash flow and net debt
The Group generated net cash flow 
from operating activities in the period 
of £10.0 million, £3.2 million less than the 
prior period (Restated*). This was mainly 
attributable to negative movements on 
working capital and the payment of tax 
of £1.1 million (2016 Restated*: £nil). Capital 
investments of £12.8 million (2016 Restated*: 
£11.9 million) and dividend payments of 
£2.5 million (2016: £1.6 million) resulted in a 
net cash outflow in the period of £5.4 million 
(2016 Restated*: £0.4 million) and an opening 
net cash position of £2.3 million moving to a 
closing net debt position of £3.2 million. 
Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share for the period 
was 8.2 pence (2016 Restated*: 8.8 pence). 
Adjusting for exceptional items and bar 
opening costs results in an adjusted 
earnings per share for the year of 
14.2 pence (2016 Restated*: 11.7 pence), 
an increase of 2.5 pence per share. 
Dividend
The Board has recommended a 
final dividend of 3.3 pence per share 
(2016: 3.3 pence), which is to be proposed 
at the Company’s annual general meeting 
on 30 November 2017.

centre, followed up by pairing them with a 
dedicated mentor and regular reviews with 
their General Manager. All management 
groups within the operations team have 
their own dedicated annual conference. 
The purpose of these conferences is to 
set the directive for the year to come, 
to create a strong network amongst 
peers and to ensure that the purpose, 
vision and values of the business are 
embedded into the actions taken on 
the back of the events. 
Using a blend of in-house and third-party 
provision, the Group ran around 100 days 
of classroom-based management 
development training courses during 
FY17, providing access to full-day training 
courses to over 1,200 people. This was 
supplemented by e-learning programmes. 
The Company is committed to equal 
opportunities and the elimination of 
discrimination, harassment and victimisation 
of employees. Of our workforce, 42 per 
cent are female and 58 per cent are male. 
In addition to competitive pay rates, it 
creates a suite of reward and incentive 
schemes, investing around 1 per cent of 
turnover annually. Further, all employees 
are able to join the Group’s stakeholder 
pension plan, as well as obtain tax-efficient 
childcare vouchers. All team members are 
entitled to a 50 per cent discount on food 
and drink purchased within our bars.

20 Responsible drinks retailing
The Group supports practices which 
promote responsible drinking and has 
established its own “Responsible Alcohol 
Retailing Policy”, supported by staff training 
and monitoring. The Group’s pricing models 
are set so as to avoid deeply discounting 
products. Events are promoted responsibly 
and are accompanied by individual risk 
assessments. A number of bars enter local 
“Best Bar None” schemes (run by local 
authorities and the police to encourage 
good behaviour in town centres), promoting 
a safe and secure environment.
Food information and quality
The Group continuously aims to improve 
the quality of its food offering and provide 
customers with the required information 
about its product range to allow them 
to make informed decisions about their 
food consumption. This includes providing 
allergen and calorie information for all 
dishes via our website. Products not 
containing gluten or meat are advertised 
on the printed menu. Full training is provided 
to bar teams to enable them to deal with 
customer queries and prevent cross-
contamination. The Group sets out strict 
specifications for all products so that high 
standards of quality are met.
Charity
The Group has a programme designed 
to promote charitable activity within its 
workforce. The scheme, called “You raise 
it, we match it”, rewards funds raised by 
staff for various charities and matches what 
they have raised. During the reporting period, 
the Group matched £10,000 of fundraising.
Environment
The Group endeavours to conduct its 
business in a way that is sympathetic to 
the environment. Where possible, glassware 
and bottles are recycled as is cardboard 
packaging. In developing our sites, we are 
making increasing use of energy-efficient 
devices and our use of energy when 
operating our sites is monitored by smart 
meters and reviewed by management. 
Indirect emissions have been calculated 
using the Carbon Reduction Commitment 
("CRC") Energy Efficiency Scheme factor 
and cover the period 1 April to 31 March. 
These emissions totalled 14,225 tonnes 
of CO 2 (2016: 14,015 tonnes).
Human rights
Even though the Group does not have a 
formal human rights policy, it is committed 
to conducting business with integrity 
and fairness.

Introduction from the Chairman
This is the Company’s third 
Governance Report.
The Board recognises the importance 
of, and is committed to, high standards 
of corporate governance, and all Directors 
are fully aware of their duties and 
responsibilities under the UK Corporate 
Governance Code 2016 (the “Code”), the 
Disclosure Guidance and Transparency 
Rules (“DTRs”) and the Listing Rules. 
Save as set out in this report, the Board 
considers that the Group has complied 
with the requirements of the Code 
throughout its existence and through 
to the end of the reporting period.
The Group continues to implement a 
robust governance structure to ensure 
compliance with the Code. The following 
are some key highlights:
 > the Board consists of three independent 
Non-executive Directors, including me 
as Non-executive Chairman (deemed 
independent on appointment), and two 
Executive Directors;
 > each Non-executive Director has 
a proven track record in business 
at a high level and has expertise 
of relevance to the Company;
 > the interests of the Group’s Executive 
Directors as shareholders are aligned 
closely with those of other shareholders;
 > the Board and its Committee structure, 
as required for a listed company, have 
been implemented. The Non-executive 
Directors have provided critical challenge 
and support to the areas of the Group 
which they believe are of particular 
importance; and
 > we will review regularly, and implement 
as necessary, any developments in 
corporate governance best practice 
and seek to apply them appropriately.
A formal process to identify suitable 
independent Non-executive Directors 
was undertaken prior to listing and 
Michael Shallow and I were appointed 
at that time. Michael Shallow serves as 
an independent Non-executive Director 
and Chair of the Remuneration and Audit 
Committees. Jemima Bird was appointed 
as our third independent Non-executive 
Director on 1 January 2017.
Each Director has been chosen to bring 
the range of public company, commercial 
and industry skills required to drive the 
business forward. The Board continues to 
take appropriate advice on governance 
matters from our external advisers.
The Group continues to implement the 
advised remuneration policy consistent 
with advice taken prior to listing from New 
Bridge Street (a trading name of Aon plc). 
This remuneration policy for both Executive 
and Non-executive Directors is set out 
within the Remuneration Report, which 
starts on page 30. 
I am well aware that the Group has faced 
substantial challenges during the past year, 
with financial performance falling short of 
our expectations. The Board has taken 
decisive action in the following areas:
 > we moved quickly to appoint 
a successor to Chris Chambers. 
Mike Foster, who has considerable 
experience in this industry, joined the 
business in March 2017 on a short-term 
basis to provide interim cover but was 
appointed as Chief Financial Officer on 
a permanent basis on 2 June 2017; and
 > we have completed a comprehensive 
review of our accounting policies and 
balance sheet, and the appropriate 
write-downs and prior year adjustments 
have been made.
Further details are in the Chairman’s 
Statement on pages 4 and 5.
Significant steps have been implemented 
to strengthen the finance team and 
financial disciplines, which will lead to 
greater transparency in external reporting. 
The challenges of the past year are behind 
us, and the Board can now look forward to 
delivering shareholder value in the years 
to come.
The Group has the principles of transparency 
and openness at the heart of its culture 
and we are committed to high standards 
in corporate governance. We firmly believe 
that corporate governance structures 
and processes will help our business to 
perform in a more efficient and competitive 
way in the marketplace and will lead to strong 
relationships with all our stakeholders.

Viability statement 
In accordance with provision C.2.2 of 
the 2014 UK Corporate Governance Code, 
the Board has assessed the prospects 
for the Group over a period of three 
years from the date of approval of the 
financial statements. 
The Board believes that a three-year 
period is appropriate as it is aligned with 
the Group’s strategic planning process. 
The latest three-year plan was reviewed 
by the Board in May 2017 and covers the 
three-year period to the end of June 2020. 
This plan provided the basis for setting the 
detailed budget for the 52 weeks ending 
30 June 2018 and also for understanding 
the Group’s long-term funding term 
requirements ahead of agreeing a new 
funding facility with the Group’s bankers.
The Group’s three-year plan is based on 
up to date trading data and built up in a 
spreadsheet model comprising segments 
for the like-for-like mature estate, immature 
venues (those opened within the current 
financial year and the previous financial 
year), committed future openings and 
other projected openings. This information 
is then overlaid with a series of 
assumptions in respect of sales growth, 
known cost increases including rent 
reviews and general rate increases, and 
cost saving initiatives as well as available 
market data and trend analysis on matters 
such as economic outlook, inflation 
forecasts and other government imposed 
costs such as minimum wage and living 
wage, property rates revaluations, 
apprenticeship levy, and changes in excise 
duties and other tax rates. The three-year 
plan model comprises a fully integrated 
profit and loss account, balance sheet and 
cash flow statement analysed into quarter 
years. The model also includes financial 
covenant tests consistent with the Group’s 
banking facilities allowing the covenants 
to be stress tested against different 
trading scenarios.
Following the Board’s review of the 
three-year plan, a new increased revolving 
credit facility was agreed with the Group’s 
bankers, NatWest. This £25 million facility 
runs to 31 December 2021 and provides 
liquidity to cover normal monthly and 
seasonal cash flows, a safety net for the 
business to ride out short-term downturns 
in trade, and potentially to facilitate an 
acceleration of expansion plans if good 
site acquisition opportunities are identified 
in excess of the Company’s stated target 
of a minimum of five new sites per annum.
As detailed on pages 14 and 15, the Board 
has conducted a robust assessment of the 
principal risks facing the Company. This 
includes consideration of strategic risks, 
economic and market risks, operational 
and people risks, regulatory risks and 
financial risks. The resilience of the Group 
to the impact of these risks has been 
assessed by applying significant but 
plausible sensitivities to the cash flow 
projections based on past experience. 
This includes modelling the effect of 
reduced consumer confidence and 
spending, a failure to maintain and 
develop compelling customer offers 
and the impact of increased regulation. 
Taking account of the Group’s current 
position, the principal risks to normal levels 
of trading and the potential mitigating 
actions that the Company would take in 
response to a downturn in trade, and the 
experience that the Group has in adapting 
the business to change, the Board has a 
reasonable expectation that the Company 
will be able to continue in operation and 
meet its liabilities as they fall due over 
the three-year period of assessment.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT
Overview
This report sets out the Group’s 
governance structure and how it complies 
with the UK Corporate Governance Code 
2016 (the “Code”), published in April 2016 
by the Financial Reporting Council, and 
also includes items required by the 
Disclosure Guidance and Transparency 
Rules (“DTRs”). The Code is available on 
the Financial Reporting Council website 
at www.frc.org.uk. The Code sets out 
standards of good practice in relation 
to Board leadership and effectiveness, 
accountability, remuneration and 
relations with shareholders.
The disclosures in this report relate 
to our responsibilities for preparing the 
annual report and accounts, including 
compliance with the Code to the extent 
required, our report on the effectiveness 
of the Group’s risk management and 
internal control systems and the 
functioning of our Committees.
The Directors consider that the Group 
has complied with those provisions of the 
Code applicable to companies of its size, 
other than in terms of Board composition 
for the first half of the period.
Compliance with the Code: Board 
composition
Prior to the appointment of Jemima Bird 
as an independent Non-executive Director 
on 1 January 2017, the Board did not have 
a “senior” independent Director. With effect 
from that date Michael Shallow was 
designated as the “senior” independent 
Director to lead annual (and other) 
meetings of Non-executive Directors, 
other than the Chairman, to appraise 
the Chairman’s performance and to provide 
a sounding board for the Chairman and 
to serve as an intermediary to the other 
Directors when necessary.
Michael Shallow was performing these 
functions prior to 1 January 2017 before 
his designation as “senior” independent 
Director and he has also been and is 
available to shareholders if they have 
concerns with contact through the normal 
channels of Chairman, Chief Executive 
Officer or other Executive Directors where 
their issues have failed to be resolved, or 
for which such contact is inappropriate.
Compliance with the Code
In considering compliance with the 
provisions of the Code, the Board has 
undertaken an evaluation of its own 
performance, Committees, individual 
Directors who served during the period to 
1 July 2017 and Chairman. The Chairman 
has confirmed to shareholders in the 
Notice of the Annual General Meeting 
that he and the Board believe that the 
performance of each Director, Committee 
and Non-executive Director continues to 
be effective and demonstrates 
commitment to the role.
Board governance
The Board is appointed by shareholders, 
who are the owners of the Group. The 
Board’s principal responsibility is to act 
in the best interests of shareholders 
as a whole, within the legal framework 
of the Companies Act 2006. It is also 
collectively responsible to shareholders 
for the long-term success of the Group. 
It agrees the strategic direction and 
governance structure that will help 
achieve this long-term success and 
deliver shareholder value. The Board 
oversees areas such as strategy, financial 
policy and maintaining a sound system 
of internal control, and focuses primarily 
on strategic policy and governance 
issues. The Board’s main responsibilities 
are included in a schedule of matters 
reserved for the Board, as set out below.
The matters reserved for the 
Board include:
 > agreeing the Group’s strategy 
and objectives;
 > changing the structure and capital 
of the Group;
 > approving the annual budget;
 > approving the annual report and 
accounts, half-yearly reports and 
interim management statements;
 > approving the Group’s dividend policy 
and declaration of dividends;
 > approving the Group’s treasury policy;
 > reviewing the effectiveness 
of the Board;
 > reviewing the effectiveness of risk 
identification and management and 
internal controls. Risks identified 
by the Directors are outlined on

Group’s objectives through Board 
reports, which include updates 
from the Chief Executive Officer, 
the Chief Financial Officer and 
other functional heads of key 
departments; and
 > considering and continually updating 
a rolling agenda of items that includes 
any current issues or matters as 
they arise.
The Board has carried out a robust 
assessment of the principal risks 
facing the Company, including those 
that would threaten its business model, 
future performance, solvency or liquidity. 
A description of these risks, together with 
an assessment of how they are being 
managed or mitigated, is included 
on pages 14 and 15.
The Board has carried out a review 
of the effectiveness of the Group’s 
risk management and internal control 
systems. Towards the end of the reporting 
period, following several changes in key 
personnel in the finance department, 
it became evident that internal control 
systems regarding financial forecasting 
and budgeting were not of the quality 
expected and that certain accounting 
policies and practices were not being 
properly applied. The Board moved 
quickly in terms of recruiting additional 
financial resources and also in engaging 
external independent support from PwC 
in order to investigate these issues. In the 
short term, the resultant actions have been 
largely reactive to ensure that reporting 
deadlines were met and that the Company 
could respond appropriately to two 
approaches regarding possible offers for 
the Group. The Board recognises that the 
Group’s risk management and internal 
control systems have not operated to the 
high standard expected in this area of 
the business and that it will remain a 
significant focus for the Board in the 
coming months.
The Board has delegated certain 
responsibilities to Committees to assist 
it with discharging its duties. The Committees 
play an essential role in supporting the 
Board to implement its strategy and provide 
focused oversight of key aspects of the 
business. The full terms of reference for 
each Committee are available on the Group’s 
website, www.revolutionbarsgroup.com.
Board balance and independence
The Code recommends that a group 
outside the FTSE 350 (such as the Group) 
should have at least two independent 
non-executive directors, being individuals 
determined by the board to be independent 
in character and judgement and free from 
relationships or circumstances which may 
affect, or could appear to affect, the 
directors’ judgement. It also recommends 
that a non-FTSE 350 group’s remuneration 
and audit committees should comprise 
at least two independent non-executive 
directors, and that its nomination committee 
should comprise a majority of independent 
non-executive directors. The Group 
complies with these recommendations. 
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
The Group has established a clear division 
between the respective responsibilities of 
the Non-executive Chairman of the Board 
and the Chief Executive Officer.
The Non-executive Chairman is 
Keith Edelman and he is responsible 
for the effective operation, leadership 
and governance of the Board, leading 
the Board’s discussions and its decision 
making. The Chairman promotes a culture 
of openness and debate by facilitating the 
effective contribution of Non-executive 
Directors in particular and ensuring 
constructive relations between Executive and 
Non-executive Directors. The Chief Executive 
Officer is Mark McQuater, who, through 
delegation from the Board, is responsible 
for leading the Group’s business 
organisation and performance and the 
day-to-day management of the Group.
This separation of responsibilities between 
the Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer, 
coupled with the schedule of reserved 
matters, ensures that no individual has 
unfettered powers of decision making. 
The Board is committed to the highest 
standards of corporate governance. 
The Board comprises a Non-executive 
Chairman, two Executive Directors and 
two other Non-executive Directors.
Non-executive Directors 
and independence
The independence of each Non-executive 
Director was considered at the time of their 
appointment. The Group’s Non-executive 
Directors provide a broad range of skills 
and experience to the Board which 
assists both in their roles in formulating 
the Group’s strategy and in providing 
constructive challenge to the Executive 
Directors. The Group considers that 
Keith Edelman, Michael Shallow and 
Jemima Bird were independent at the 
time of their appointments and continue 
to be independent for the purposes 
of the Code. Revolution Bars Group plc

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT CONTINUED
Board meetings
The Board’s intention is to meet six 
to eight times per year for structured 
Board meetings, covering all aspects 
of the business. During the 52 weeks 
to 1 July 2017 the Board had such 
meetings eight times. 
Agendas for the Board meetings are 
set out in advance of each meeting. 
All Directors receive papers in advance 
of Board meetings. These include a 
business report with updates from the 
Chief Executive Officer and the Chief 
Financial Officer. Members of the Group’s 
Senior Management Team may also be 
invited to present at Board meetings, 
as appropriate, so that Non-executive 
Directors keep abreast of developments 
in the Group.
Appointment and tenure
The Board believes that all Directors 
are effective, are committed to their roles 
and have sufficient time available to 
perform their duties. Accordingly, all 
members of the Board will be offering 
themselves for election at the Group’s 
annual general meeting to be held on 
Thursday 30 November 2017. All of the 
Directors have service agreements 
or letters of appointment and the 
details of their terms are set out in 
the Directors’ Remuneration Report. 
The service agreements and letters of 
appointment are available for inspection 
at the Group’s registered office during 
normal business hours.
No other contract with the Company 
or any subsidiary undertaking of the 
Company in which any Director was 
materially interested subsisted during 
or at the end of the financial period.
Evaluation and effectiveness
Evaluations of the performance of 
the Board, its Committees, individual 
Directors and the Chairman have taken 
place during the 52 weeks ended 
1 July 2017. The conclusion from these 
evaluations is that the Board is 
operating effectively and in the best 
interests of shareholders. 
In addition, the Chairman continues to 
meet with the Non-executive Directors 
at least once a year without the Executive 
Directors present to discuss Board balance, 
monitor the powers of individual Executive 
Directors and raise any issues between 
themselves as appropriate.
Development
In line with the Code, the Group will 
ensure that any new Directors joining the 
Board will receive appropriate support 
and are given a comprehensive, formal 
and tailored induction programme 
organised through the Company 
Secretary, including the provision of 
background material on the Group, 
briefings with senior management and 
accompanied operational visits. Each 
Director’s individual experience and 
background will be taken into account 
in developing a programme tailored to 
his or her own requirements. Any new 
Director will also be expected to meet 
with major shareholders if required. 
This process has been implemented. 
Directors’ conflicts of interest
Directors have a statutory duty to avoid 
situations in which they have or may 
have interests that conflict with those 
of the Group, unless that conflict is first 
authorised by the Board. This includes 
potential conflicts that may arise when a 
Director takes up a position with another 
company. The Company’s Articles of 
Association allow the Board to authorise 
such potential conflicts, and there is 
a procedure in place to deal with any 
actual or potential conflict of interest. 
The Board deals with each appointment 
on its individual merit and takes into 
consideration all the circumstances. 
All potential conflicts approved by the 
Board are recorded in a conflicts of 
interest register, which will be reviewed 
by the Board on a regular basis to ensure 
that the procedure is working effectively.
External directorships
The service agreements of the Executive 
Directors do not permit them to accept 
external commercial non-executive director 
appointments. Where Non-executive 
Directors have external directorships, 
the Board is comfortable that these do 
not impact on the time that any Director 
devotes to the Group and we believe 
that this experience only enhances the 
capability of the Board.
Information and support available 
to Directors
All Board Directors have access to the 
Company Secretary, who advises them 
on governance matters. The Chairman 
and the Company Secretary work 
together to ensure that Board papers 
are clear, accurate, delivered in a timely 
manner to Directors, and of sufficient 
quality to enable the Board to discharge 
its duties. Specific business-related 
presentations are given by senior 
management when appropriate. As well 
as the support of the Company Secretary, 
there is a procedure in place for any 
Director to take independent professional 
advice at the Group’s expense in the 
furtherance of their duties, where 
considered necessary.
Shareholder engagement
Responsibility for shareholder relations 
rests with the Chairman, the Chief Executive 
Officer and the Chief Financial Officer. They 
ensure that there is effective communication 
with shareholders on matters such as 
governance and strategy, and are responsible 
for ensuring that the Board understands 
the views of major shareholders. The 
Board aims to present a balanced and 
clear view of the Group in communications 
with shareholders and believes that being 
transparent in describing how we see the 
market and the prospects for the business 
is extremely important. Revolution Bars Group plc  
Annual Report and Accounts 2017
29
The Board communicates with shareholders 
in a number of different ways. The full 
and half-year reporting is followed by 
presentations and investor meetings 
in locations where we have institutional 
shareholders. We also regularly meet 
with existing and prospective shareholders 
to update them on our latest performance 
or to introduce them to the Group. 
Periodically, we arrange visits to the 
business sites to give analysts and major 
shareholders a better understanding of 
how we manage our business. These visits 
and meetings are principally undertaken 
by the Chief Executive Officer and the 
Chief Financial Officer, although other 
senior management are present from time 
to time. Any relevant material resulting 
from such meetings is uploaded to the 
Group’s website so that it is available to 
all shareholders. The Board receives 
regular updates on the views of its 
shareholders from the Chief Executive 
Officer, the Chief Financial Officer and 
Company brokers, which are a feature 
of each Board meeting.
The Group’s corporate website is 
also regularly updated with news and 
information, including this annual report 
and accounts, which sets out our strategy 
and performance together with our plans 
for future growth.
Auditor
Towards the end of the current year 
external audit, and therefore after the end 
of the reporting period, the Committee 
reviewed the effectiveness of the audit. 
Annual General Meeting
The annual general meeting (“AGM”) of the 
Group will take place on 30 November 2017. 
All shareholders have the opportunity to 
attend and vote, in person or by proxy, 
at the AGM. The Notice of AGM can be 
found in a circular which is being posted 
at the same time as this annual report and 
accounts. The Notice of AGM sets out the 
business of the meeting and explanatory 
notes on all resolutions. Separate resolutions 
are proposed in respect of each substantive 
issue. The Chairman, the Chairman 
of each of the Committees and both 
Executive Directors will be present at the 
AGM and will be available to answer 
shareholders’ questions.
Remuneration Committee Report
This report is set out on pages 30 to 45. The 
report provides details of the remuneration 
policy for the Company’s Directors, describes 
how the remuneration policy is implemented 
and discloses the amounts paid to Directors 
during the 52 weeks ended 1 July 2017. Revolution Bars Group plc

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
REMUNERATION REPORT 
for the 52 weeks ended 1 July 2017
Dear shareholder
I am pleased to present, on behalf 
of the Board, the Remuneration Report 
of the Remuneration Committee. 
The Group’s remuneration policy aims 
to promote a strong and sustainable 
performance culture, to incentivise 
high growth and to align the interests 
of Executive Directors and other senior 
managers with those of shareholders. 
In promoting these objectives, the policy 
has been structured so as to adhere to 
the principles of good corporate governance 
and appropriate risk management.
In determining remuneration levels, the 
Committee has taken account of market 
conditions, the performance of the Group 
and its responsibility to shareholders.
Performance and reward in relation 
to the 52 weeks ended 1 July 2017
The Group made good progress on its 
strategic objectives with like-for-like sales 
growth of 1.5 per cent, the opening of six 
new venues in the year that are trading 
well, and the five new openings of the prior 
year proven to be delivering excellent 
returns on investment. However, financial 
performance has been constrained by the 
discovery that the Group’s accounting policies 
and practices have not historically been 
applied in accordance with best practice. 
Consequently, a number of prior period 
adjustments have been made to the 
consolidated financial statements which 
have reduced the previously reported 
results of those prior periods and the 
correct application of those accounting 
policies and practices have suppressed 
profits in the reporting period under 
review relative to market expectations at 
the beginning of the year. Performance 
against the adjusted EBITDA and adjusted 
profit before tax bonus threshold targets 
were not met and no bonuses are payable 
to any of the Executive Directors or to 
senior management.
The Committee also decided that due 
to the shortfall in underlying profitability 
relative to market expectations as at the 
beginning of the period and the reduction 
in prior period profits, it was not appropriate 
to undertake salary reviews in July 2017 
for the Executive Directors or Senior 
Management Team. 
The Committee was required to determine 
the package afforded to Chris Chambers 
who commenced work with the Group 
on 31 August 2016. His salary on 
appointment was agreed at £245,000 
with the remainder of his package set 
in line with our policy. 
Mike Foster, who was immediately 
available, initially joined the Group on 
a short term contract in March 2017 as 
interim Finance Director to enable the 
Group to conduct a proper search of the 
market for a suitable replacement for the 
Chief Financial Officer position. However, 
given the accounting matters that came 
to light shortly after Mike Foster’s interim 
appointment, culminating in the market 
announcement and given the approach 
from Stonegate Pub Company Limited 
(“Stonegate”) to potentially make an 
offer for the Group, we moved quickly 
to secure Mike Foster’s services on a 
permanent basis. The terms agreed 
with Mike Foster are in certain respects 
less than our stated remuneration policy 
for new directors but were considered 
appropriate given that he did not 
have significant experience as a 
Chief Financial Officer of a listed 
business and also because the approach 
had already been received from Stonegate 
to potentially make an offer for the 
Group. Permission to appoint Mike Foster 
to the Board had to be sought from and 
was granted by the Takeover Panel as it 
could potentially have been regarded as 
a frustrating action under the Takeover 
code. The terms were agreed with that 
in mind. For the same reason, no awards 
were made to Mike Foster under the 
Long Term Incentive Plan.
The Committee has also met to consider 
whether outstanding awards under the 
Long Term Incentive Plan should vest 
contingent upon the Board recommended 
offer for the Group from Stonegate. 
The Committee has confirmed that time 
pro-rating will be applied and will be 
calculated on a monthly basis in each case 
in accordance with the rules of the relevant 
employee scheme plan and, performance 
conditions will be applied. All performance 
conditions are to be tested in accordance 
with their terms. On this basis, the Group 
currently forecasts that 62,222 options will 
vest should the Stonegate offer complete 
at the offer price of 203 pence per share.
Shareholder feedback
The Committee welcomes any feedback 
on this report and the remuneration policy 
in general. On behalf of the Board, I would 
like to thank shareholders for their continued 
support and I look forward to your approval 
of our report at the 2017 AGM.

Directors’ remuneration policy
This part of the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report sets out the remuneration policy for 
the Company and has been prepared in 
accordance with the Companies Act 2006, 
Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium-sized 
Companies and Groups (Accounts and 
Reports) Regulations 2008 (as amended) 
and the UKLA’s Listing Rules. The policy 
has been developed taking into account 
the principles of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code 2016 and the voting 
guidelines of UK institutional investors.
The Group’s remuneration policy was 
put to a formal and binding vote at the 
2015 AGM. As set out at that time, the 
policy is expected to continue to apply 
until 30 June 2018. The Annual Report on 
Remuneration will be put to an advisory 
vote at the 2017 AGM.
The Committee’s key objectives 
relate to the determination of specific 
remuneration packages for each of 
the Executive Directors and certain 
Senior Executives of the Group, including 
pension rights and any compensation 
payments, recommending and monitoring 
the level and structure of remuneration for 
senior management and the implementation 
of share schemes and any other 
performance-related schemes. 
The Remuneration Committee meets 
at least twice a year.
The Committee reviews the remuneration 
policy and, in particular, performance-related 
pay scheme structures on an annual basis 
to ensure that they continue to operate 
within the agreed risk framework of the 
Group. The Committee also ensures that 
an effective system of control and risk 
management is in place with regards to 
remuneration, which includes access to 
the Audit Committee to discuss matters of 
operational and financial risk. The Committee 
is satisfied that the proposed policy does 
not encourage or reward undue risk taking.
The Committee ensures that 
performance-related pay structures 
will not raise environmental, social or 
governance (“ESG”) risks by inadvertently 
motivating irresponsible behaviour. 
More generally, with regard to the overall 
remuneration structure, there is no 
restriction on the Committee that prevents 
it from taking into account corporate 
governance on ESG matters.
The policy, in relation to subsequent years, 
will be kept under review to ensure that it 
reflects any changing circumstances. Revolution Bars Group plc

Policy table
Element Operation Opportunity Performance metrics
Base salary
To attract and 
retain key 
individuals.
To reflect the 
relevant skills 
and experience 
in the role.

reviewed annually against 
performance, experience, 
responsibilities, relevant market 
information and the level of 
workforce pay increases.
The current salaries are 
set out in the Annual Report 
on Remuneration.
Annual increases will usually 
be commensurate with those 
of the wider workforce.
Further increases may 
be considered if there 
are significant changes in 
responsibility or scope, or a 
sustained increase in the size 
of the business, or if there are 
significant market movements.
New joiners, where pay is 
initially set below market levels, 
may benefit from larger increases 
as their salary is progressed 
towards the market rate based 
on their development in the role.
A broad-based assessment 
of individual and Company 
performance is considered 
as part of any salary review.
Pension

subject to the achievement 
of stretching performance 
conditions based on financial 
performance of the Group 
and personal strategic 
objectives which reflect key 
business drivers. The majority 
(if not all) of any bonus will 
be determined by financial 
measures with only a 
minority being paid for 
achieving threshold 
performance levels.

for 2017/18 are described 
in the Annual Report on 
Remuneration starting on

Company Share Option Plan (“CSOP”)
To incentivise 
and recognise 
service over the 
longer term.
The Company operates a share 
option plan under which it may 
grant share options with an 
exercise price as determined 
by the Committee on grant. The 
terms on which an award vests 
are determined by the Committee 
on grant and, once vested, options 
are exercisable up to ten years 
from the date of grant.
For Executive Directors with 
PSP awards, any grant of CSOP 
awards will be linked to the grant 
of PSP awards, which will be 
reduced accordingly to reflect 
the value received under any 
CSOP award.
Aggregate value of any PSP 
and CSOP award granted will not 
normally exceed normal awards 
of 200% of salary (300% of salary 
in exceptional circumstances), 
with PSP grant levels in the same 
year taken into consideration 
and reduced accordingly.
For Executive Directors, 
performance conditions 
will be linked to those used 
under the corresponding 
PSP award.
Executive share ownership
To align 
Executive 
Directors’ and 
shareholders’ 
interests.
All Executive Directors are 
expected to hold an investment 
of at least 100% of base salary in

awards under the Company’s 
PSP to achieve the shareholdings, 
if required.

of the Board, excluding the 
Non-executive Directors.
The Non-executive Chairman’s 
fee and Non-executive fees are 
set out in the Annual Report

The Committee operates the annual 
bonus plan and long-term incentive plans 
according to their respective rules and 
consistent with normal market practice, 
the Listing Rules and HMRC rules where 
relevant, including flexibility in a number 
of regards. These include:
 > timing of awards and payments;
 > the size of an award (within the limits 
noted in the table above) and when 
and how much should vest;
 > who receives an award or payment;
 > dealing with a change of control or 
restructuring of the Group;
 > determining whether a participant is 
a good/bad leaver for incentive plan 
purposes and whether and what 
proportion of awards vest;
 > any adjustments required to awards 
in certain circumstances (e.g. rights 
issues, corporate restructuring, 
events and special dividends); and
 > the weightings, measures and targets 
for the annual bonus plan, PSP and 
CSOP from year to year.
The Committee retains the discretion 
to adjust the targets and/or set different 
measures and alter weightings for the 
annual bonus plan and to adjust targets 
for the PSP and CSOP if events occur 
(e.g. a major acquisition or disposal) 
which cause it to determine that the 
conditions are unable to fulfil their 
original intended purpose and if the 
change would not be materially less 
difficult to satisfy.
Existing awards
The Committee intends to honour any 
commitments, including the outstanding 
PSP awards, on the terms applicable 
at the time each such commitment was 
made. The relevant outstanding awards 
are described in the Annual Report 
on Remuneration.
Executive Directors’ service 
agreements including policy 
on contracts of service
Mark McQuater
On 27 February 2015, Mark McQuater 
(Revolution’s Chief Executive Officer) 
entered into a service agreement with 
Revolution, under which he is currently 
entitled to receive an annual base 
salary of £367,500. The appointment 
(as Revolution Director) is subject to 
annual re-election by the Revolution 
shareholders. If he is not re-elected 
as a Director, his employment continues 
in accordance with the terms of his 
service agreement. 
Under the terms of the service 
agreement, Mark McQuater is entitled 
to an annual car allowance of 10 per cent 
of his basic salary, permanent health 
insurance, private health insurance for 
himself, his spouse and his family, life 
insurance and a pension contribution 
of 15 per cent of basic salary, which was 
increased to 17.5 per cent effective at the 
beginning of the current reporting period.
The service agreement is terminable 
by Mark McQuater or Revolution on not 
less than 12 months’ prior written notice. 
Revolution can, however, terminate 
Mark McQuater’s service agreement 
immediately, provided that such 
termination is effected together with 
payment of a cash sum in lieu of notice 
equivalent to the basic salary, pension 
allowance, car allowance and the value 
of his insured benefits to which he would 
have been entitled for the remainder 
of his notice period. 
The service agreement is terminable 
with immediate effect without notice 
in certain circumstances.
Mike Foster
On 31 May 2017, Mike Foster 
(Revolution’s Chief Financial Officer 
and Company Secretary) was sent an 
offer letter by Revolution, under which 
he is currently entitled to receive an 
annual base salary of £200,000. The 
offer letter had been approved by the 
Revolution Board on 29 May 2017. No 
service agreement has yet been entered 
into by Mike Foster and Revolution and 
he is currently performing his duties on 
the basis of the terms of the offer letter.
The offer letter entitles Mike Foster 
to receive an annual car allowance 
of £15,000, as well as private health 
insurance for himself and his spouse. 
Mike Foster’s employment is terminable 
by him or Revolution on not less than 
six months’ prior notice.
The Executive Directors are eligible to 
participate in such bonus arrangements 
as Revolution may specify from time to 
time. The Revolution Board retains absolute 
discretion to determine whether or not 
a bonus should be paid to an Executive 
Director and, if a bonus is to be paid, 
the amount of such bonus. 
Copies of Mark McQuater’s service 
contract and Mike Foster’s appointment 
letter are available for inspection, on 
request to the Company Secretary, 
at the Company’s registered office.
On cessation of an Executive Director’s 
employment, the treatment of any 
outstanding share awards will be governed 
by the rules of the appropriate plan. In the 
normal course, awards will lapse. If a 
participant is treated as a good leaver (for 
reasons of death, injury, permanent ill health 
or disability, redundancy, the employing 
entity ceasing to be a member of the Group, 
the business being transferred outside of 
the Group, or any other reason the Committee 
determines at its discretion) the award will 
normally vest on the normal vesting date to 
the extent that the performance conditions 
have been achieved and pro-rated for 
the service period rendered (unless the 
Committee decides to vest awards at 
cessation and/or disapply time pro-rating).
The Non-executive Directors have letters 
of appointment which provide for notice 
by either party giving to the other not 
less than six months’ notice in writing 
for the Chairman and three months’ notice 
in writing for other Non-executive Directors. 
The Company may also terminate by 
making a payment in lieu of notice.
None of the employment contracts 
or letters of appointment of the 
Directors contain special contractual 
termination provisions. Revolution Bars Group plc

REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED
for the 52 weeks ended 1 July 2017
Other employees’ pay
The Committee does not consult with employees directly on matters of Executive remuneration. However, the Committee is aware 
of the disconnect which may be created if Executive Director remuneration is set in isolation and therefore is updated during the 
year with details of the pay and employment conditions in the wider workforce. In particular, the Committee is made aware of 
general salary increases, general benefit provision and the proposed level of annual bonuses. The Committee is also responsible 
for reviewing the proposed participants of the PSP and the CSOP.
Remuneration policy across the Group
The remuneration policy described in this report is broadly consistent with the policy used for other Senior Executives of the 
Company. A significant proportion of remuneration remains performance related, although lower quantums will operate.
The majority of employees will participate in an annual bonus or incentive scheme, although the limits and performance metrics 
will vary according to the seniority and location of the role. Participation in the PSP and the CSOP is targeted at senior 
management and key staff who are more able to influence overall Group performance.
The majority of new senior employees are eligible to join a defined contribution pension plan.
Policy on Executive Director recruitments/promotions
In relation to external Executive recruitment or internal promotion, the Committee will follow the principles outlined in the table below:
Element of remuneration
Base salary
Salary levels will be set based on:
 > the particular experience, knowledge and skills of the individual;
 > market rates for comparable positions in companies of a similar size and complexity; and
 > internal Company relativities.
Where considered appropriate, the Committee may wish to set the initial salary below the perceived market rate (e.g. to 
reflect an individual’s limited experience at a public limited company board level) but with the view to make phased increases, 
potentially above those of the wider workforce as a percentage of salary, to achieve the desired market positioning over time. 
Any increases would be subject to the individual’s continued development and performance in the role.
Benefits
A new appointment would be offered the same or a similar benefits package (or equivalent, in line with local market practice) 
as that provided to current Executive Directors.
Where considered necessary, the Committee may be required to pay certain relocation expenses, legal fees and other costs 
incurred by the individual in relation to their appointment.
Pension
A defined contribution or cash supplement (or equivalent, in line with local market practice) at the level provided to current 
Executive Directors may be provided. Revolution Bars Group plc  
Annual Report and Accounts 2017
37
Element of remuneration continued
Annual bonus
The Committee would envisage the annual bonus for any new appointment operating as set out in the policy table for current Executive 
Directors. The annual bonus maximum, as a percentage of salary, would be limited to that of the current Chief Executive Officer.
However, the Committee may consider it necessary (depending on timing and the nature of the appointment) to set different tailored 
performance measures for the initial bonus year.
Long-term incentives
Ongoing LTIP awards will be made on the same terms as current Executives’, albeit possibly with different performance periods 
depending on the timing of the appointment. The maximum ongoing award, as a percentage of salary, will be no higher than 
that of the current Chief Executive Officer. An award may be made shortly after an appointment.
For internal promotions, existing awards will continue over their original vesting period and remain subject to their terms as at 
the date of grant.
Buy-out awards
To facilitate external recruitment, it may be necessary to buy out remuneration which would be forfeited on the appointee 
leaving their previous employer. When determining the quantum and structure of any buy-out awards, the Committee will, 
where possible, use a consistent basis, taking into account the form of remuneration (cash or shares), timing horizons and 
the application of any performance criteria.
Buy-out awards, if used, will be granted using the Company’s existing share plans to the extent possible, although awards 
may also be granted outside of these schemes if necessary and as permitted under the Listing Rules. Revolution Bars Group plc

Shareholder engagement
The Committee considers an open and constructive dialogue with investors to be vitally important to establishing a successful 
remuneration policy that is considered fair and transparent by both Executives and shareholders. Therefore, the Committee will 
consult with major investors whenever material changes to the policy are proposed. The Committee also welcomes investor 
feedback and will consider views raised at the AGM and regular meetings throughout the year when establishing the overall policy.
Reward scenarios
The charts below illustrate the level and mix of remuneration based on the current remuneration policy, updated to reflect current 
salary levels depending on the achievement of threshold, target and maximum performance of the Executive Directors. These charts 
are indicative as share price movement and dividend accrual have been excluded. All assumptions made are noted below the chart.

3.  Minimum performance assumes no bonus, on-target performance assumes 60 per cent of the maximum bonus potential 
and maximum performance assumes 100 per cent of salary for the annual bonus.
4.  Although there is no plan to grant PSP awards to Executive Directors in 2017/18, the charts show the grant levels for the initial 
PSP awards for the Chief Executive Officer, annualised over a three-year period. Target levels of 50 per cent of maximum have 
been used.
5.  For illustrative purposes only, a grant of PSP awards to the new Chief Financial Officer in line with policy at 200 per cent of 
salary has been included. However, no award has yet been granted and the Committee has not yet determined whether to 
make any award.

Annual Report on Remuneration
The Committee’s terms of reference are 
available from the Company Secretary 
and can be found on the Company’s 
website at www.revolutionbarsgroup.com.
During the 52 weeks ended 1 July 2017, 
the Committee met formally on three 
occasions, with all members attending.
The key activities of the Committee during 
the 52 weeks ended 1 July 2017 have been:
 > approval of the bonus outcome and 
pay-out in respect of the financial reporting 
period for the 53 weeks ended 2 July 2016, 
confirming that the calculation had 
been made in accordance with the 
agreed mechanism;
 > determination and approval of 
the bonus scheme in respect of the 
financial reporting period for the 52 
weeks ended 1 July 2017 in line with 
the policy and provisions set out here;
 > to review the salary and pension 
arrangements for Mark McQuater;
 > determination of the financial terms 
of the leaver arrangements for Sean 
Curran and Chris Chambers; and
 > determination of an appropriate 
remuneration structure for Mike Foster 
as incoming Chief Financial Officer.
Subsequent to the end of the reporting 
period, the Committee has met to 
determine the calculations to be applied 
to the vesting of shares under the Long 
Term Incentive Plan in connection with 
the recommended Board offer from 
Stonegate Pub Company Limited.
Composition of the Remuneration 
Committee (unaudited)
The Committee currently consists of 
Michael Shallow (Chairman), Keith Edelman 
(Non-executive Chairman) and Jemima Bird 
(Non-executive Director). None of the 
Committee has any personal financial 
interest (other than as a shareholder), 
conflicts of interest from cross-directorships, 
or day-to-day involvement in the running 
of the business.
The Chief Executive Officer is invited 
to attend meetings, although is not 
present when matters affecting his 
own remuneration are discussed. 
The Company Secretary or their nominee 
acts as secretary to the Committee.
The Committee retains independent 
remuneration consultants, New Bridge 
Street (“NBS”) (a trading name of Aon plc), 
to advise on aspects of Executive 
remuneration. NBS is a member of the 
Remuneration Consultants Group and has 
signed up to its code of conduct. NBS has 
no connection with Revolution Bars Group 
plc other than in the provision of advice 
on Executive remuneration. The terms 
of engagement with NBS are available 
from the Company Secretary on request. 
The fees payable to NBS during the 
52 weeks ended 1 July 2017 were 
£8,924 (2016: £11,471). 
During the year the Company also used 
Macfarlanes LLP to provide advice on 
termination arrangements relating to 
Sean Curran and Chris Chambers.
The Committee reviews its relationships 
with external advisers on a regular basis and 
believes that no conflicts of interest exist.
Implementation of the 
remuneration policy in the 
52 weeks ending 30 June 2018 
(unaudited)
Basic annual salary
Each Executive Director’s basic salary 
is normally reviewed and determined 
by the Committee annually, taking into 
account the individual’s performance and 
experience. The Committee also, from 
time to time, makes use of independent 
benchmark data provided by external 
remuneration consultants, takes due 
account of market data in separate 
comparator groups based on sector, size 
and complexity, and is aware of the level 
of salary increases awarded to other 
employees within the Group. 
Salaries were not reviewed at the normal 
review date at the beginning of July 2017 
consistent with the decision not to review 
the salaries of the Senior Management 
Team. The Committee agreed an initial 
salary for Mike Foster that is below that 
of his predecessor but consistent with his 
experience levels. Current salaries are 
summarised as follows:
 > Mark McQuater, Chief Executive 
Officer, £367,500 per annum 
(2016: £367,500); and
 > Mike Foster, Chief Financial Officer, 
£200,000 per annum (2016 for 
Chris Chambers: £245,000).
Performance-related bonus
The maximum bonus potential for the 
Chief Executive Officer and the Chief 
Financial Officer for the 52 weeks ending 
30 June 2018 is 100 per cent of basic 
salary earned in the reporting period. 
For each Executive Director, their 
performance-related bonus is based 
80 per cent on an annual scorecard of 
financial performance metrics and 20 per cent 
on personal strategic objectives that reflect 
key drivers of the business, such as new 
openings, customers, quality and staff. An 
underpin applies to the annual bonus award, 
which gives discretion to the Remuneration 
Committee to reduce the award. 
For the 52 weeks ended 1 July 2017, 
no award was allotted to any qualifying 
participants by the Committee, due to the 
shortfall in the Group’s profit performance 
measures relative to the targets set at the 
beginning of the period. 
For the 52 weeks ending 30 June 2018, 
the financial targets will be measured based 
on adjusted EBITDA and adjusted profit 
before tax (“PBT”). Further detail about 
such strategic and personal objectives 
is considered commercially sensitive and 
will therefore not be disclosed prospectively. 
This bonus will also be wholly payable in 
cash and subject to recovery provisions 
for three years from date of payment.
Long-term incentive awards
The Committee believes that share 
ownership and the granting of share-
based incentives strengthen the link 
between Executives’ personal interests 
and those of the shareholders. The Company 
has two long-term share plans in place, 
being a Company Share Option Plan (“CSOP”) 
and a Performance Share Plan (“PSP”). Revolution Bars Group plc

Long-term incentive awards continued
It is not the Committee’s current intention to grant any awards in the coming period given the Board recommended offer for the 
Group. No awards were made to Mike Foster given that the Group was already in discussions regarding a potential offer for the 
Group at the time of his appointment to the Board.
Policy on Executive share ownership
The Board has adopted a formal policy in respect of Executive share ownership, pursuant to which all Executives are expected to invest in 
the Company to a level of at least 100 per cent of annual salary over time, save that under such policy Executives may build to this level using 
50 per cent of net awards under the Company’s long-term incentive plans. Details of current share ownership levels are set out on page 34.
Non-executive Directors’ fees and incentives
The fees of the Non-executive Directors are set by the Board following a review against fee levels operated in companies of a 
comparable size and after taking into account the anticipated time commitment of each role. The Non-executive Directors do not 
participate in any incentive, pension or benefit schemes of the Company.
Details of each Director’s remuneration for the 52 weeks ended 1 July 2017 are given below.

Performance-related bonus
For the 52 weeks ended 1 July 2017, a discretionary annual bonus plan was operated for the Executive Directors and other senior 
management. A percentage of each individual’s base salary was payable, based on the attainment, on a sliding scale, of adjusted 
EBITDA and adjusted profit before tax targets, as well as on the achievement of personal objectives. 
For each measure a bonus pool was created once a threshold target level of adjusted EBITDA or adjusted profit before tax had 
been achieved. For achieving threshold target performance, a pool of £258,000 would be allocated to be shared by all participants. 
Up to an additional £514,000 would be allocated to the pool for performance between threshold target and budget, with up to a 
further £256,000 of EBITDA (or PBT) allocated to the pool for performance above budget. 
EBITDA performance
Actual adjusted EBITDA performance for the 52 weeks ended 1 July 2017 did not achieve the threshold target and consequently 
no bonus payment became payable.
PBT performance
Actual adjusted profit before tax performance for the 52 weeks ended 1 July 2017 did not achieve the threshold target and 
consequently no bonus payment became payable.
Full details of the performance outcome are set out in the table below:
Financial objectives
Performance measure Target Stretch

Adjusted profit before tax (£’000) 9,805 11,130 9,296 40% 0%
80% 0%
A bonus of up to 20 per cent could also be earned based on personal objectives but the Committee decided that due to profit 
performance in the reporting period falling significantly short of target and given the restatement of prior year earnings it was not 
appropriate to make such awards.
The table below summarises the overall bonus result:
Individual Total bonus: % salary payable
Chief Executive Officer 0% of salary payable
Acknowledging that the bonus mechanism is in line with the remuneration policy, the Committee is comfortable that the level 
of bonuses paid to Executive Directors reflects both the Company and individual performance during the year.
Pension arrangements
The Company contributed into defined contribution schemes or made cash payment equivalents for Executive Directors at the 
following percentages of basic salary:
Mark McQuater  17.5 per cent

Chris Chambers Performance share 0.1 410,000 300% of salary £735,000 25 30.06.20
1 Face value was determined based on the share price of 179.3 pence at the date of the grant of the awards.
Awards granted to Chris Chambers as consideration for a buyout of previous awards forfeited, in granting these awards the 
Committee considered the value, time horizon and form of the award being forfeited. These awards lapsed at the date of his 
departure, the performance conditions are outlined below. 
In connection with the awards held by Mark McQuater, 70 per cent of the awards are based upon an adjusted EPS target (Part A) 
and 30 per cent of the awards are based upon a TSR target (Part B).
The performance conditions are tested over three overlapping three-year performance periods:
 > the first tranche (50 per cent of the award) will be tested over the period from 1 July 2015 to 30 June 2018 for Part A and 
18 March 2015 to 30 June 2018 for Part B and will vest in 2018 to the extent it satisfies the conditions;
 > the second tranche (25 per cent of the award) will be tested over the period from 1 July 2016 to 30 June 2019 and will vest in 
2019 to the extent it satisfies the conditions; and
 > the third tranche (25 per cent of the award) will be tested over the period from 1 July 2017 to 30 June 2020 and will vest in 
2020 to the extent it satisfies the conditions.
Part A – EPS targets
The vesting of Part A of each such award will be dependent on the Group’s EPS performance over the fixed periods listed above. 
No portion of Part A will vest unless the Group’s EPS growth is at least equal to a compound annual growth rate of 7 per cent; 
thereafter the following vesting schedule will apply:
The Company’s EPS compound growth Extent of vesting of Part A
At least 7% per annum 25%
Between a minimum of 7% per annum and 13% per annum Pro-rata between 25% and 100%
At least 13% per annum 100%
For the IPO LTIP Award, EPS performance will be tested using a pro-forma EPS figure for the year ended FY15 as a base point. 
Adjusted EPS for such purposes thereafter will be disclosed in due course at the time of vesting in the Remuneration Report.
Part B – TSR targets
The vesting of Part B of each such award will be dependent on the Group’s TSR over the fixed periods listed above relative to the 
TSR of the constituents of the peer group of other UK-listed restaurant and bar sector companies over the same period.
No portion of Part B will vest unless the Group’s TSR performance at least matches the median of the TSR performance within the 
comparator Group; thereafter the following vesting schedule will apply:
The Company’s TSR performance against the TSR of the comparator companies Extent of vesting of Part B
Median 25%
Between median and upper quartile Pro-rata between 25% and 100%
Upper quartile (or better) 100%
For the IPO LTIP Award, the offer price (200 pence) will be used as the base point from which TSR is measured for the Company. 
For the FY16 LTIP Award and the FY17 LTIP Award a three-month average prior to the start of the performance period will be used. 
For all awards the end point will be averaged over the last three months of the respective performance period.
Expected volatility has been estimated by considering historical average share price volatility for the Company or similar 
companies. Staff attrition has been assessed based on historical retention rates. Revolution Bars Group plc

Directors’ share-based incentives
Aggregate emoluments do not include any amounts for the value of share-based incentives to acquire Ordinary Shares in the 
Company granted to or held by the Directors. 
The number of Ordinary Shares that may be issued under the PSP and any other share plan may not exceed 5 per cent of the 
Ordinary Shares in issue in any ten-year period. However, the Initial Awards shown above do not count for the purposes of this limit.
Payments made for loss of office and payments to past Directors (audited)
As described in last year’s Annual Report on Remuneration, Sean Curran stepped down from the Board on 31 August 2016. 
He remained on garden leave until 10 May 2017 during which time he received his normal pay and benefits. No bonus payments 
were made to Sean during the reporting period and all share awards under the Long Term Incentive Plan have lapsed.
Chris Chambers stepped down from the Board on 6 May 2017; he continued to receive his normal pay and benefits until 6 May 2017. 
Payments totalling £77,342 in lieu of notice were paid in three equal instalments, the last of which was after the end of the reporting 
period. No bonus payments were made to Chris during the reporting period and all share awards under the Long Term Incentive

All Executive Directors are expected to hold an investment of at least 100 per cent of base salary in Company shares. This 
requirement can be achieved over a period of time using 50 per cent of net awards which vest under the Company’s LTIPs. 
The table above shows shareholdings as at both the start and end of the reporting period and the percentage of the guideline 
currently met as at 1 July 2017.
Total shareholding, which counts towards the measurement of the guideline, is calculated on the basis of legally owned 
shares. The percentage of guideline met is based on the annual base salary and the higher of the acquisition cost of the total 
shareholding or the current market value of the total shareholding. Once an Executive Director meets the required holding, 
the Executive Director is only required to purchase additional shares equivalent to the value of any increase in base salary. 
Performance graph and Chief Executive Officer remuneration table (unaudited)
The graph below illustrates the Company’s total shareholder return (“TSR”) performance relative to the FTSE Fledgling Index.

AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT
Dear shareholder
I am pleased to introduce the report of 
the Audit Committee for the 52 weeks 
ended 1 July 2017. 
The Code recommends that all members 
of the Committee be Non-executive 
Directors, independent in character and 
judgement and free from any relationship 
or circumstance which may, could or 
would be likely to, or appear to, affect 
their judgement and that at least one such 
member has recent and relevant financial 
experience. Accordingly, the Committee 
comprises all three independent Non-
executive Directors with me as Committee 
Chairman, considered by the Board 
to have recent and relevant financial 
experience due to my previous experience 
in senior financial roles. As such, the 
Committee complies with the Code 
recommendations. Regular Committee 
meetings are also normally attended 
by the Chief Financial Officer and the 
external auditor. The Chief Financial 
Officer, who is also the Company Secretary, 
acts as secretary to the Committee. Other 
members of management, particularly 
senior financial managers, are invited 
to attend depending on the matters 
under discussion.
The Committee also meets at least twice 
per annum with the external auditor with 
no members of management present. 
The Committee was set up by the Board 
to assist it with its responsibilities in 
respect of financial reporting, including 
reviewing annual and half-year results, 
external auditing and internal controls, 
and advising on the independence and 
appointment of the external auditor. 
The Committee also routinely examines 
significant accounting treatments facing 
the Group and will focus on those 
matters raised by KPMG LLP, which they 
consider to be of significant audit risk. 
The Committee meets at least twice a 
year at the appropriate times in the 
reporting and audit cycle.
The Committee has this year strongly 
supported the new finance team following 
the departure of a long-standing Chief 
Financial Officer in August 2016 and 
subsequently his replacement in May 2017 
as well as a long-standing Group Financial 
Controller in December 2016. Our current 
Chief Financial Officer, Mike Foster, joined 
the business in an interim role in March 2017 
and together with the new team initially 
focused on understanding the reliability of 
the Group’s forecasts and this resulted in 
the market announcement on 19 May 2017. 
The new team also identified that the 
application of our accounting policies 
required updating, particularly in two 
key areas:
 > Certain items of marketing expenditure, 
including menus and branded collateral 
which were being capitalised as 
short-life assets. The appropriate 
treatment for such expenditure is 
to expense the cost as incurred.
 > Certain policies relating to income 
from supplier rebates and listing fees 
were not applied correctly, resulting in 
over-statements of accrued income as 
at 2 July 2016 and 27 June 2015. 
Corrections in relation to these two items 
have led to prior period adjustments that 
are set out in Note 1b to the consolidated 
financial statements.
When these matters came to the attention 
of the Audit Committee, the Committee 
engaged PwC to undertake a full 
independent review relating to these two 
issues to confirm the amounts involved 
and the appropriateness of the accounting 
treatment. In parallel, the new team was 
asked to review the application of all key 
accounting policies and practices and this 
identified several other issues also 
requiring adjustments to prior periods. 
These are also detailed in Note 1b to 
the consolidated financial statements.
The Committee has closely reviewed 
the PwC report, which was delivered 
in mid-August 2017, and the other 
findings of the finance team and 
their recommended adjustments. The 
Committee’s main goal at this time 
has been to ensure that the material 
judgements and estimates used this 
financial year are the most appropriate 
to present a fair and balanced view of 
the financial affairs of the Group as at 
1 July 2017 and the progress made 
during the course of the year.
During the year, the Directors continued 
to assess the following key areas:
 > Board governance, including the 
Committee and the procedure for 
assessing the Group’s key risks;
 > management accounting processes 
and the quality of information provided 
to the Board;
 > external financial reporting 
procedures and audit arrangements 
and reporting standards;
 > complex transactions, potential 
exposure and risk;
 > information systems; and
 > budgeting and forecasting procedures 
and controls.

The Directors recognise the need 
to maintain the financial reporting 
procedures, review them on a continuing 
basis and adapt them to changing 
circumstances. Their review forms 
part of the Committee’s agenda going 
forward together with its wider role 
and responsibilities, which are set out 
in more detail in this report. Based on 
its performance during the 52 weeks 
ended 1 July 2017, the Committee will 
be recommending that KPMG LLP be 
re-appointed as auditor at the 2017 
annual general meeting (“AGM”). I look 
forward to meeting with shareholders 
at the AGM to answer any questions 
on the work of the Audit Committee.
Ensuring external auditor 
independence 
During the year the value of non-audit 
services provided by the external auditor 
amounted to £0.02 million (2016: £0.4 million). 
New EU legislation on permitted non-audit 
services came into effect from 17 June 2016 
which introduced a permitted non-audit 
services fee cap of 70 per cent of the 
average audit fee over a consecutive 
three-year period. This cap will come into 
effect for the Group in the financial year 
ending 30 June 2019. A significant 
proportion of non-audit services delivered 
during 2017 related to reviewing the 
Group’s half-year reporting, which is a 
service incidental to the role as auditor. 
The Committee is satisfied that, in relation 
to services provided, KPMG LLP has taken 
actions to ensure that any potential 
conflicts of interest are properly managed. 
KPMG was appointed as auditor of the 
Group by the Directors on 18 March 2015. 
The period of total uninterrupted 
engagement is the three years ended 
1 July 2017. Prior to that KPMG was also 
auditor to the Group’s previous Parent 
Company, but which, being unlisted, was 
not a public interest entity. Under the EU 
audit regulation, the Company is required 
to undertake a tender for audit services 
at least every ten years (being for the 
period commencing July 2024). In light 
of the Board recommended offer for the 
business, there are currently no plans 
to undertake a tender.
Role and responsibilities
The Committee’s terms of reference 
can be found on the Group’s website 
or alternatively can be obtained from the 
Company Secretary. The primary function 
of the Audit Committee is to assist the 
Board in fulfilling its responsibilities to 
protect the interests of shareholders 
with regard to the integrity of financial 
reporting, audit, risk management and 
internal controls. This comprises:
 > monitoring and reviewing the Group’s 
accounting policies, practices and 
significant accounting judgements; and
 > receiving the annual and half-yearly 
financial statements and any public 
financial announcements and advising 
the Board on whether the annual 
report and accounts is fair, balanced 
and understandable in relation to the 
external audit:
 > approving the appointment and 
recommending the re-appointment 
of the external auditor and its terms 
of engagement and fees;
 > considering the scope of work to be 
undertaken by the external auditor 
and reviewing the results of that work;
 > reviewing and monitoring the 
independence of the external auditor; 
 > reviewing the effectiveness of the 
external auditor;
 > reviewing compliance with the UK 
Corporate Governance Code;
 > overseeing the Group’s procedures 
for its employees to raise concerns 
through its whistleblowing policy as 
set out in the code of conduct and 
business principles policy;
 > monitoring the effectiveness of the 
risk management systems and 
processes; and
 > assessing and advising the Board on 
the internal financial, operational and 
compliance controls.
Meetings and attendance
During the 52 weeks ended 1 July 2017, 
the Audit Committee met formally on three 
occasions, with all members attending 
the meetings. In addition, at two of the 
meetings, the Audit Committee had 
access to the external auditor without 
management present. 
Following the end of the reporting 
period, the Committee met formally 
on two further occasions prior to the 
approval of the consolidated financial 
statements. In addition to the Committee’s 
work associated with the accounting 
review referred to on the previous page, 
other work performed by the Committee 
during the year has included:
 > reviewing and approving the external 
audit plan for the 52 weeks ended 
1 July 2017;
 > agreeing the Committee’s rolling agenda 
for the 52 weeks to 30 June 2018 and 
the associated financial calendar;
 > reviewing the annual report and accounts 
for 2017 and recommending to the 
Board its adoption as fair, balanced and 
understandable. In fulfilling this task, 
the Committee reviewed the process 
undertaken to produce the annual report 
and accounts 2017, which included 
internal verification processes and 
content approval procedures;
 > reviewing the pre-close statement in 
July 2017;
 > receiving the external auditor’s reports 
to the Committee;
 > reviewing the Group’s accounting 
policies and key accounting judgements;
 > considering the risk assessment, 
mitigation actions and assurance 
activities produced by management; Revolution Bars Group plc

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT CONTINUED
Meetings and attendance continued
 > reviewing the independence and 
objectivity of the external auditor, 
together with its effectiveness, and 
recommending its re-appointment to 
shareholders at the AGM;
 > reviewing compliance with and 
explaining any exceptions from the 
UK Corporate Governance Code; and
 > reviewing the internal financial, 
operational and compliance control.
Internal audit
The Group does not have an internal 
audit function and considers that the 
key risks to the business are covered by 
a combination of resources including its 
compliance department, stock-takers 
and area managers.
The Group’s compliance department 
is responsible for managing many of 
the principal risks facing the business 
concerning licensing and health and 
safety. Its work is supported by external 
consultants on both of these matters and 
as part of these arrangements annual 
contracts are in place to provide at least 
two audit visits per annum by fully 
qualified health and safety advisers.
The Group also employs four full-time 
stock-takers who are checking stocks 
and various other related compliance 
matters such as cash counts on a risk 
assessed basis. Site stocks are counted 
on average between eight and ten times 
per annum. Stock-take results are 
reviewed by both operational and 
finance staff immediately that they 
are made available.
An important element of the area 
manager’s role is to perform spot checks 
on cash, stocks, licensing and health and 
safety matters as part of their regular site 
visits. The area manager assessments 
are used, amongst other things, to rate 
general managers and poor scores 
relating to these standards will reduce 
their bonus earnings potential.
Significant accounting matters
In reviewing the financial statements with 
management and the external auditor, 
the Committee has discussed and debated 
the critical accounting judgements and 
key sources of estimation uncertainty 
as set out in Note 1 to the consolidated 
financial statements. There has been 
particular emphasis this year on the matters 
giving rise to the prior period adjustments.
As a result of its review, the Committee 
has identified the following issues that 
require particular judgement or have 
significant impact on the interpretation of 
the annual report and accounts for 2017:
 > Accrued rebates from suppliers: 
rebates are usually invoiced on a 
monthly or quarterly basis based on 
supplied volumes and whilst-these 
can usually be quickly assessed 
post-period, judgements are also 
sometimes required as to whether 
longer-term contractual thresholds 
will be met. The Committee is satisfied 
that appropriate judgements have 
been made.
 > Carrying value of fixed assets: the 
Group keeps the carrying value of 
its fixed assets under review. Formal 
procedures are used in each external 
reporting period to make assessments 
of the appropriateness of carrying 
values within the balance sheet.
 > Capitalisation of property, plant 
and equipment: the Committee has 
reviewed capitalisation policies and in 
particular the capitalisation of internal 
costs in relation to property development 
and IT systems development and is 
satisfied that its policies and the 
amounts capitalised are appropriate.
 > Accounting for and the disclosure 
of prior period errors: the Committee 
has reviewed each of the items and 
is satisfied that they constitute prior 
year adjustments.
 > Exceptional items: exceptional items 
on a pre-tax basis of £4.3 million 
(2016 Restated*: £1.4 million) represent 
a material item in the profit and loss 
account. The charge comprises fees 
associated with the resignation of the 
Chief Financial Officer, fees associated 
with the accounting review, an increase 
in the provision for onerous leases, 
a fixed assets impairment charge and 
charges relating to the Long Term 
Incentive Plan (see Note 3 to the 
consolidated financial statements). The 
Committee reviewed the constituent 
elements of this cost and was satisfied 
that they were exceptional in nature.
The Committee reviewed reports 
presented by KPMG LLP that detailed 
key audit findings in relation to the above 
accounting matters.

Dear shareholder
I am pleased to introduce the report 
of the Nomination Committee for the 
52 weeks ended 1 July 2017. 
Responsibilities
The Committee’s terms of reference, 
which can be found on the Group’s 
website and can be obtained from the 
Company Secretary, deal with such 
issues as membership and frequency of 
meetings, together with the requirements 
for quorum and notice procedure and the 
right to attend meetings. The responsibilities 
of the Committee covered in its terms 
of reference include reviewing Board 
composition, appointing new Directors, 
re-appointment and re-election of 
existing Directors, succession planning 
taking into account the skills and expertise 
that will be needed on the Board in the 
future, reviewing time required from 
Non-executive Directors, determining 
membership of other Board Committees 
and ensuring external facilitation of the 
evaluation of the Board. As part of its 
activities the Committee also considers 
the diversity of the Board.
Composition
The Code recommends that a majority 
of the members of the Nomination 
Committee should be independent 
Non-executive Directors. The Committee 
is chaired by me, and its other members 
are Michael Shallow, Jemima Bird and 
Mark McQuater, of whom Michael and 
Jemima are independent Non-executive 
Directors. Consequently, the Committee 
complies with the Code recommendation. 
By invitation, the meetings of the Committee 
may be attended by the Chief Financial 
Officer, although this did not happen 
during the year under review. 
Meetings and attendance
During the 52 weeks ended 1 July 2017, 
the Nomination Committee met formally 
on two occasions with all members 
attending the meetings. The Committee 
will continue to meet formally at least 
once a year and at such other times as 
the Board or the Committee Chairman 
requires. The Committee has access 
to sufficient resources to carry out its 
duties, including the services of the 
Company Secretary. Independent 
external legal and professional advice 
can also be taken by the Committee if 
it believes it is necessary to do so.
Election of Directors
On the recommendation of the 
Committee and in line with the Code, 
all of the Group’s Directors will stand 
for election at the forthcoming AGM 
and will subsequently offer themselves 
for re-election on an annual basis.
The biographical details of the Directors 
can be found on page 24. Following 
performance evaluations conducted 
during the year, the Committee is 
satisfied that the Directors, who served 
during the 52 weeks ended 1 July 2017, 
performed effectively and demonstrated 
a commitment to their roles. This will 
continue to be monitored going forward 
with further formal performance reviews 
taking place during the 52 weeks ending 
30 June 2018.
Diversity
The Committee supports the aims, 
objectives and recommendations 
outlined in Lord Davies’ report “Women 
on Boards” and is aware of the need to 
increase the number of women on the 
Board, to which it is committed over time. 
Within this overriding commitment, we 
will make appointments based on merit 
and against objective criteria to ensure 
we appoint the best individual for each 
role. The Committee and the Board 
understand the importance of a diverse 
Board membership as well as throughout 
the Group, and recognise that diversity 
encompasses not only gender but also 
background, ethnicity and disability. The 
Committee believes that appointments 
should be made on merit, the key criterion 
being whether or not the appointee can 
add to or complement the existing range 
of skills and experience on the Board.
Jemima Bird was appointed to the 
Board during the reporting period 
and two of the seven members of the 
Senior Management Team are women 
(29 per cent). Across our business of 
approximately 2,743 employees, female 
employees represented approximately 
42 per cent of the workforce as at 
15 July 2017. The Group is committed 
to continuing to develop the potential 
of its female employees through its 
training programmes and its corporate 
development pipeline.
I look forward to meeting with shareholders 
at the AGM to answer any questions on 
the work of the Nomination Committee.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT
Introduction
The Directors present their annual report 
and the audited financial statements of 
the Company and Group for the 52 weeks 
ended 1 July 2017. This Directors’ Report 
includes additional information required 
to be disclosed under the Companies 
Act 2006, the Code, the DTRs and the 
Listing Rules of the Financial Conduct 
Authority. Certain information required to 
be included in the Directors’ Report is 
included in other sections of this annual 
report as follows, which is incorporated 
by reference into this Directors’ Report:
 > the Strategic Report on pages 1 to 21 
which sets out a review of the business 
of the Group during the 52 weeks ended 
1 July 2017 and the financial position of 
the Group at the end of that period to 
enable shareholders to assess how the 
Directors have performed their duty 
under section 172 of the Companies 
Act. The review also describes the 
principal risks and uncertainties facing 
the Group, and provides a fair review 
of the Group’s business at the end of 
the financial year and an indication of 
likely future developments in the business;
 > the Corporate Governance Statement 
on pages 26 to 29; and
 > related party transactions as set 
out in Note 24 to the consolidated 
financial statements.
This Directors’ Report together with the 
Strategic Report set out on pages 1 to 21 
represents the “Management Report” 
for the purpose of compliance with the 
DTR 4.1.5R.
Results and dividend
The Group’s results for the year are 
shown in the statement of comprehensive 
income on page 60. The Directors intend, 
subject to sufficient distributable reserves 
being available, that there will be a final 
dividend in respect of the 52 weeks 
ended 1 July 2017 of 3.3 pence per share 
(2016: 3.3 pence per share). The Group 
paid an interim dividend of 1.65 pence per 
share during the period (2016: 1.5 pence 
per share), taking the total dividend in 
relation to the 52 weeks ended 1 July 2017 
to 4.95 pence per share (2016: 4.8 pence 
per share). Payment of the dividend is 
subject to shareholder approval at the 
annual general meeting. See also the 
post balance sheet events note below.
Share capital and related matters
The Company has only one class of 
share and the rights attached to each 
share are identical. Details of the rights 
and obligations attaching to the shares

also be found on the Company’s website, 
www.revolutionbarsgroup.com, under 
investor relations and shareholder 
information. The Ordinary Shares are 
listed on the official list and are traded 
on the London Stock Exchange. The 
Company may refuse to register any 
transfer of a share which is not a fully 
paid share. At a general meeting of the 
Company, every member has one vote 
on a show of hands, and on a poll one 
vote for each share held. Details of the 
voting procedure, including deadlines for 
exercising voting rights, are set out in 
the Notice of Annual General Meeting 
2017. As at 1 July 2017, the issued share 
capital of the Company was 50,000,000 
Ordinary Shares of £0.001 each. Details 
of the share capital as at 1 July 2017 are 
shown in Note 19 to the consolidated 
financial statements.
Powers of the Directors
The Directors may exercise all the 
powers of the Group including, subject 
to obtaining the required authority from 
the shareholders in general meeting, 
the power to authorise the issue of 
new shares and the purchase of the 
Company’s shares. During the year, the 
Directors have not exercised any of the 
powers to issue or purchase shares in 
the Company.
Restrictions on transfer
There are no general restrictions 
on the transfer of Ordinary Shares in 
the Company other than in relation to 
certain restrictions that are imposed 
from time to time by laws and regulations 
(for example insider trading laws). 
Pursuant to the Listing Rules, Directors 
and certain officers and employees of 
the Group require the approval of the 
Company to deal in the Ordinary Shares 
of the Company.
The Company has in place certain share 
incentive plans and details can be found

on 1 July 2017 and up to the date of this 
report, no awards have been granted 
to the Company’s new Chief Financial 
Officer, Mike Foster. During the reporting 
period, 1,190,000 awards lapsed and 
692,500 awards have been granted. Revolution Bars Group plc

Directors of the Company against 
liabilities arising from or in connection 
with the execution of their duties or 
powers to the extent permitted by law.

indemnity insurance in place in respect 
of each of the Directors. The Group has 
entered into a qualifying third-party 
indemnity (the terms of which are in 
accordance with the Companies Act 
2006) with each of the Directors. Neither 
the indemnity nor insurance provides 
cover in the event that a Director or 
officer is proved to have acted fraudulently.
Transactions with related parties
Details of the transactions entered 
into by the Group with parties who are 
related to it are set out in Note 24 to 
the consolidated financial statements. 
There were no material transactions 
with related parties during the 52 weeks 
ended 1 July 2017. 
Change of control
The provisions of the Group’s share 
incentive plans may cause options and 
awards granted to employees under 
such plans to vest on a change of 
ownership of the Group. The Group does 
not have agreements with any Director 
that would provide compensation for loss 
of office or employment resulting directly 
from a change of its ownership.
Amendment to the Company’s 
Articles of Association
The Company may alter its Articles of 
Association by special resolution passed 
at a general meeting of shareholders.
Political donations

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
DIRECTORS’ REPORT CONTINUED
Post balance sheet events
On 24 August 2017, the Company 
announced that the Board was 
recommending an offer for the Company 
from Stonegate Pub Company Limited at 
an offer price of 203 pence per share. It 
is expected that the Group’s shareholders 
will vote on the recommended cash offer 
by Stonegate on 17 October 2017.
The Board is also engaged with Deltic 
Group plc (“Deltic”) as a possible offeror 
for the Group. Deltic has outlined a merger 
proposal, which the Board has rejected 
due to significant concerns regarding 
both value and deliverability. Deltic has 
stated that, in order to put forward its 
merger proposal and discuss with 
shareholders, it will in due course publish 
its own profit forecast and a quantified 
financial benefits statement in respect 
of a merger. In parallel, Deltic has also 
stated that it continues to evaluate a 
possible cash offer for the entire issued 
and to be issued share capital of 
Revolution. The Takeover Panel 
announced on 21 September 2017 
that Deltic must either announce a firm 
intention to make an offer for the Group 
under Rule 2.7 of the City Code on 
Takeovers and Mergers, or announce 
that it does not intend to make an offer, 
by 5.00 pm on 10 October 2017. Deltic 
is continuing to perform due diligence 
on the Group, and the Board is committed 
to ensuring that the interests of the 
shareholders are best served.
The final dividend of 3.3 pence per share 
is subject to approval at the Company’s 
annual general meeting on 30 November 
2017 and would ordinarily be expected to 
be paid on 7 December 2017. However, 
if the Stonegate acquisition of the Group 
completes prior to the annual general 
meeting taking place, the dividend will 
not be payable. 
Stonegate will have the right to reduce 
the amount of consideration payable 
for each Revolution share by the amount 
of any dividend (or other distribution) 
which is paid or becomes payable by 
Revolution to Revolution Shareholders 
before the date on which the proposed 
scheme of arrangement becomes 
effective, which is expected to be on 
or about 23 October 2017. Based on 
the expected timetable, therefore, 
it is not anticipated that any dividend 
(or other distribution) will be paid or 
that the offer price will be reduced. 
If Stonegate does exercise its right to 
reduce the amount of consideration 
payable for each Revolution share by the 
amount of the dividend that has not been 
paid, Revolution Shareholders will be 
entitled to receive and retain that dividend.
Going concern
The Directors have reviewed the Group’s 
trading forecasts. These forecasts 
demonstrate that the Group has adequate 
financial resources, including its £25 million 
revolving credit facility which is committed 
until December 2021, to continue in 
operational existence for a period of at 
least 12 months from the date of approval 
of the financial statements.
The Group is forecast to remain compliant 
with the terms of the revolving credit facility 
and the financial covenants attached to it, 
which are tested quarterly. The Directors 
expect to utilise the revolving credit facility 
for cash flow management and general 
business purposes as required.
The revolving credit facility contains 
a change in control clause and, should 
this clause be invoked, the Directors are 
confident that replacement facilities 
could be obtained from either the 
purchaser of the business or from 
alternative financial providers. For this 
reason the Directors continue to adopt 
the going concern basis in preparing the 
consolidated financial information.
Annual general meeting
The annual general meeting (“AGM”) 
of the Company will take place on 
30 November 2017. The Notice of 
Annual General Meeting is set out

The Directors are responsible for 
preparing the annual report and the 
Group and Parent Company financial 
statements in accordance with applicable 
law and regulations. 
Company law requires the Directors 
to prepare Group and Parent Company 
financial statements for each financial 
year. Under that law they are required to 
prepare the Group financial statements 
in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards as adopted by the 
European Union (IFRSs as adopted by the 
EU) and applicable law and have elected 
to prepare the Parent Company financial 
statements on the same basis. 
Under company law the Directors must 
not approve the financial statements 
unless they are satisfied that they give 
a true and fair view of the state of affairs 
of the Group and Parent Company and 
of their profit or loss for that period. In 
preparing each of the Group and Parent 
Company financial statements, the 
Directors are required to: 
 > select suitable accounting policies 
and then apply them consistently; 
 > make judgements and estimates that 
are reasonable, relevant and reliable; 
 > state whether they have been 
prepared in accordance with IFRSs 
as adopted by the EU; 
 > assess the Group and Parent 
Company’s ability to continue 
as a going concern, disclosing, 
as applicable, matters related to 
going concern; and 
 > use the going concern basis of 
accounting unless they either intend 
to liquidate the Group or the Parent 
Company or to cease operations, 
or have no realistic alternative but 
to do so.
The Directors are responsible for keeping 
adequate accounting records that are 
sufficient to show and explain the Parent 
Company’s transactions and disclose 
with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the Parent Company 
and enable them to ensure that its financial 
statements comply with the Companies Act 
2006. They are responsible for such 
internal control as they determine is 
necessary to enable the preparation 
of financial statements that are free from 
material misstatement, whether due 
to fraud or error, and have general 
responsibility for taking such steps as are 
reasonably open to them to safeguard the 
assets of the Group and to prevent and 
detect fraud and other irregularities. 
Under applicable law and regulations, 
the Directors are also responsible for 
preparing a Strategic Report, Directors’ 
Report, Directors’ Remuneration Report 
and Corporate Governance Statement that 
complies with that law and those regulations. 
The Directors are responsible for 
the maintenance and integrity of the 
corporate and financial information 
included on the Company’s website. 
Legislation in the UK governing the 
preparation and dissemination of financial 
statements may differ from legislation 
in other jurisdictions. 
Responsibility statement of 
the Directors in respect of the 
annual financial report 
We confirm that to the best of 
our knowledge: 
 > the financial statements, prepared 
in accordance with the applicable set 
of accounting standards, give a true 
and fair view of the assets, liabilities, 
financial position and profit or loss of 
the Company and the undertakings 
included in the consolidation taken 
as a whole; and 
 > the Strategic Report and Directors’ 
Report includes a fair review of the 
development and performance of the 
business and the position of the issuer 
and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole, 
together with a description of the 
principal risks and uncertainties that 
they face.
We consider the annual report and 
accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, 
balanced and understandable and 
provides the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the Group’s 
position and performance, business 
model and strategy.

ANNUAL REPORT AND THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  Revolution Bars Group plc

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT
to the members of Revolution Bars Group plc
1. Our opinion is unmodified
We have audited the financial statements of Revolution Bars 
Group plc (the “Company”) for the period ended 1 July 2017 
which comprise the consolidated statement of profit and loss, 
the consolidated statement of other comprehensive income, the 
consolidated statement of financial position, the consolidated 
statement of changes in equity, the consolidated statement of 
cash flows, the Company statement of financial position, the 
Company statement of changes in equity, the Company statement 
of cash flows and the related notes, including the accounting 
policies in Note 1. 
In our opinion: 
 > the financial statements give a true and fair view of the 
state of the Group’s and of the Parent Company’s affairs 
as at 1 July 2017 and of the Group’s profit for the period 
then ended; 
 > the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as 
adopted by the European Union (“IFRSs as adopted by the EU”); 
 > the Parent Company financial statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and 
as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies 
Act 2006; and 
 > the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with 
the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the 
Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
Basis for opinion 
We conducted our audit in accordance with International 
Standards on Auditing (UK) (“ISAs (UK)”) and applicable law. 
Our responsibilities are described below. We believe that the 
audit evidence we have obtained is a sufficient and appropriate 
basis for our opinion. Our audit opinion is consistent with our 
report to the Audit Committee. 
We were appointed as auditor by the Directors on 18 March 2015. 
The period of total uninterrupted engagement is the three years 
ended 1 July 2017. Prior to that we were also auditor to the 
Group’s previous parent company, but which, being unlisted, 
was not a public interest entity. We have fulfilled our ethical 
responsibilities under, and we remain independent of the 
Group in accordance with, UK ethical requirements including 
the FRC Ethical Standard as applied to listed public interest 
entities. No non-audit services prohibited by that standard 
were provided.

2. Key audit matters: our assessment of risks of material misstatement
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in the audit of the financial 
statements and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) identified by us, 
including those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing 
the efforts of the engagement team. We summarise below the key audit matters in decreasing order of audit significance, in arriving 
at our audit opinion above, together with our key audit procedures to address those matters and, as required for public interest 
entities, our results from those procedures. These matters were addressed, and our results are based on procedures undertaken, 
in the context of, and solely for the purpose of, our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion 
thereon, and consequently are incidental to that opinion, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
The risk Our response
Recoverability of property,  
plant and equipment 
(£58.7 million; 2016: £52.9 million) 
Impairment charge £1.5 million; 
2016: £nil 
Refer to page 48 (Audit Committee Report), 
page 65 (accounting policy) and Note 11 
(financial disclosures).
Forecast-based valuation:
The Group’s statement of financial 
position includes a significant 
property, plant and equipment 
(“PP&E”) balance, principally in 
relation to its portfolio of 68 bars. 
The estimated recoverable amounts 
are subjective due to the inherent 
uncertainty involved in forecasting 
and discounting future cash flows 
on a bar-by-bar basis.
Our procedures included: 
 > control design: evaluating the Group’s budgeting 
procedures and methodology upon which the 
forecasts are based;
 > benchmarking assumptions: challenging 
assumptions used by the Group based on 
externally derived data as well as our own 
assessment, using knowledge of the Company 
and sector or using our own valuation specialist 
where applicable, of key inputs such as projected 
economic growth, cost inflation and discount rate;  
 > sensitivity analysis: performing break-even analysis 
to understand the sensitivity of the conclusions 
reached to changes in assumptions; and
 > assessing transparency: evaluating the 
adequacy of the Group’s disclosures about the 
sensitivity of the outcome of the impairment 
assessment to changes in key assumptions.
Our results
 > We found the resulting estimate of recoverable 
amounts to be acceptable.
Accrued volume rebates
(£0.9 million; 2016: £0.6 million)
Refer to page 48 (Audit Committee Report), 
page 67 (accounting policy) and Note 13 
(financial disclosures).
Data capture:
Completeness and accuracy of data 
used in the calculation, including 
actual supplier purchases and 
volume-specific contractual rebate 
percentages, because of the manual 
nature of the data transfer.
Our procedures included: 
 > test of detail: recalculate a sample of rebates 
based on actual supplier purchases and the 
relevant contractual rebate percentages. 
Comparing a sample of the year-end receivables 
back to post-year-end confirmatory evidence such 
as, cash receipts and supplier confirmations to 
assess the accuracy of the rebate receivable.
Our results 
 > We considered the amount of accrued rebate 
receivable recognised to be acceptable. Revolution Bars Group plc  
Annual Report and Accounts 2017
56
The risk Our response
Capitalisation of 
leasehold improvements
(£12.9 million; 2016: £11.9 million)
Refer to page 48 (Audit Committee Report), 
page 65 (accounting policy) and Note 11 
(financial disclosures).
Accounting treatment:
The Group’s statement of financial 
position includes a significant PP&E 
balance to which additions of £12.9 million 
have been made in the year in respect 
of leasehold improvements.
The classification of spend on 
leasehold improvements between 
operational and capital expenditure 
is inherently judgemental.
Our procedures included: 
 > accounting analysis: critically assessing the 
appropriateness of the capitalisation by obtaining 
third-party invoices for a sample of amounts 
capitalised and challenging the appropriateness 
of capitalisation based on the capitalisation 
criteria of the relevant accounting standards 
and the description of the expenditure.
Our results 
 > We considered the amounts capitalised as 
leasehold improvements to be acceptable.
Prior period adjustments
Opening reserves at 27 June 2015 
£2.5 million; opening reserves at 
2 July 2016 £3.3 million 
Refer to page 48 (Audit Committee Report), 
page 68 (accounting policy) and Note 1b 
(financial disclosures).
Accounting application:
Six categories of prior period 
errors, with a cumulative impact on 
opening reserves at 27 June 2015 of 
£2.5 million have been identified and 
corrected in the financial statements.
Judgements and complexities are 
involved in determining the amount 
of the identified errors and the 
appropriate prior accounting period 
to which the identified error relates. 
Our procedures included: 
 > test of detail: for each material prior year 
adjustments we inspected and agreed back to 
confirmatory evidence such as external reports or 
confirmations, or where external confirmations are 
not applicable internal supporting documentation, 
to critically assess the appropriateness of 
adjustments to prior periods.
 > assessing transparency: evaluating the adequacy 
of the Group’s explanatory disclosures in relation 
to each prior year adjustment made.
Our results
 > We found the accounting entries in respect of 
the prior period adjustments to be acceptable.
Parent Company: 
recoverable amount of 
investment in subsidiary
(£29.7 million; 2016: £29.7 million)
Refer to page 92 (accounting policy) and 
Note 29 (financial disclosures).
Low risk, high value 
The carrying amount of the Company’s 
investment in subsidiary, held at cost, 
represents 100% of the Company’s 
total assets.
We do not consider the recoverable 
amount of this investment to be at a 
high risk of significant misstatement, 
or to be subject to a significant level 
of judgement. However, due to its 
materiality in the context of the Company 
financial statements as a whole (this is 
the only asset recorded on the statement 
of financial position), this is considered 
to be the area which had the greatest 
effect on our overall audit strategy and 
allocation of resources in planning and 
completing our Company audit.
Our procedures included: 
 > test of detail: we compared the carrying value of 
the investment to the market capitalisation of the 
Group at the statement of financial position date.  
Our results 
 > We found the carrying amount of investment in 
subsidiary to be acceptable.

3. Our application of materiality and an overview 
of the scope of our audit 
Materiality for the Group financial statements as a whole was set 
at £356,000 (2016: £425,000), determined with reference to a benchmark 
of Group profit before tax, normalised to exclude this year’s exceptional 
items of £4,352,000 (2016: £1,382,000) as disclosed in Note 3.
Materiality for the Parent Company financial statements as a 
whole was set at £2,826,000 (2016: £2,965,000), determined 
with reference to a benchmark of Company total assets, of 
which it represents 9% (2016: 10%).
We agreed to report to the Audit Committee any corrected 
or uncorrected identified misstatements exceeding £18,000 
(2016: £22,500), in addition to other identified misstatements 
that warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.
The Group team performed the audit of the Group, including 
the audit of the Parent Company, as if it was a single aggregated 
set of financial information. The audit was performed using the 
materiality level set out above.

4. We have nothing to report on going concern 
We are required to report to you if:
 > we have anything material to add or draw attention to in 
relation to the Directors’ statement in Note 1 to the financial 
statements on the use of the going concern basis of accounting 
with no material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt 
over the Group and Company’s use of that basis for a period of 
at least 12 months from the date of approval of the financial 
statements; or 
 > if the same statement is materially inconsistent with our 
audit knowledge. 
We have nothing to report in these respects. 
5. We have nothing to report on the other information 
in the Annual Report 
The directors are responsible for the other information 
presented in the Annual Report together with the financial 
statements. Our opinion on the financial statements does not 
cover the other information and, accordingly, we do not express 
an audit opinion or, except as explicitly stated below, any form 
of assurance conclusion thereon. 
Our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing 
so, consider whether, based on our financial statements audit 
work, the information therein is materially misstated or inconsistent 
with the financial statements or our audit knowledge. Based solely 
on that work we have not identified material misstatements in the 
other information.
Strategic report and directors’ report 
Based solely on our work on the other information: 
 > we have not identified material misstatements in the strategic 
report and the directors’ report; 
 > in our opinion the information given in those reports for the 
financial year is consistent with the financial statements; and 
 > in our opinion those reports have been prepared in 
accordance with the Companies Act 2006.
Directors’ remuneration report 
In our opinion the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to 
be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006. 
Disclosures of principal risks and longer-term viability 
Based on the knowledge we acquired during our financial 
statements audit, we have nothing material to add or draw 
attention to in relation to:
 > the directors’ confirmation within the viability statement on 
page 23 that they have carried out a robust assessment of 
the principal risks facing the Group, including those that 
would threaten its business model, future performance, 
solvency and liquidity;
 > the principal risks disclosures describing these risks and 
explaining how they are being managed and mitigated; and 
 > the directors’ explanation in the viability statement of how 
they have assessed the prospects of the Group, over what 
period they have done so and why they considered that 
period to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether 
they have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be 
able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they 
fall due over the period of their assessment, including any 
related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary 
qualifications or assumptions. 
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the viability 
statement. We have nothing to report in this respect. 
Corporate governance disclosures 
We are required to report to you if: 
 > we have identified material inconsistencies between the 
knowledge we acquired during our financial statements audit 
and the directors’ statement that they consider that the annual 
report and financial statements taken as a whole is fair, 
balanced and understandable and provides the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s position 
and performance, business model and strategy; or 
 > the section of the annual report describing the work of the 
Audit Committee does not appropriately address matters 
communicated by us to the Audit Committee.
We are required to report to you if the Corporate Governance 
Statement does not properly disclose a departure from the 
eleven provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code 
specified by the Listing Rules for our review. 
We have nothing to report in these respects.

6. We have nothing to report on the other matters 
on which we are required to report by exception
Under the Companies Act 2006, we are required to report to 
you if, in our opinion: 
 > adequate accounting records have not been kept by the 
Parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have 
not been received from branches not visited by us; or 
 > the Parent Company financial statements and the part of 
the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not 
in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or 
 > certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by 
law are not made; or 
 > we have not received all the information and explanations 
we require for our audit.
We have nothing to report in these respects.
7. Respective responsibilities 
Directors’ responsibilities
As explained more fully in their statement set out on page 53, 
the Directors are responsible for: the preparation of the financial 
statements including being satisfied that they give a true and 
fair view; such internal control as they determine is necessary to 
enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; assessing 
the Group and Parent Company’s ability to continue as a going 
concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going 
concern; and using the going concern basis of accounting unless 
they either intend to liquidate the Group or the Parent Company or 
to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditor’s responsibilities 
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether the financial statements as a whole are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud, other irregularities, 
or error, and to issue our opinion in an auditor’s report. 
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but does 
not guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs 
(UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. 
Misstatements can arise from fraud, other irregularities or error 
and are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, 
they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic 
decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial statements. 
The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting 
from fraud or other irregularities is higher than for one resulting 
from error, as they may involve collusion, forgery, intentional 
omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal 
control and may involve any area of law and regulation not 
just those directly affecting the financial statements.
A fuller description of our responsibilities is provided on the 
FRC’s website at www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. 
8. The purpose of our audit work and to whom we owe 
our responsibilities 
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, 
in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. 
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to 
the Company’s members those matters we are required to state 
to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the 
fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume 
responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the 
Company’s members, as a body, for our audit work, for this 
report, or for the opinions we have formed.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION
for the 52 weeks ended 1 July 2017
1. General information
Corporate information
The consolidated financial statements of Revolution Bars Group plc for the 52 weeks ended 1 July 2017 were authorised for issue 
by the Board of Directors on 3 October 2017. Revolution Bars Group plc is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in 
England and Wales under the Companies Act 2006. The Company’s shares are listed on the London Stock Exchange.
The registered number of the Group is 08838504 and its registered office is 21 Old Street, Ashton-under-Lyne, Tameside OL6 6LA.
Statement of compliance
The Group’s financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as 
adopted by the EU, as they apply to the financial statements of the Group for the 52 weeks ended 1 July 2017 (prior year 53 weeks 
ended 2 July 2016), and in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
Basis of preparation
The accounting period runs to the Saturday which falls nearest to 30 June each year and therefore normally comprises a 52-week 
period but with a 53-week period falling at approximately five-year intervals. The year ended 1 July 2017 is a 52-week period; the 
period ended 2 July 2016 was a 53-week period. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with 
those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. References to 2017 relate to the 52-week 
period ended 1 July 2017 and references to 2016 relate to the 53-week period ended 2 July 2016 unless otherwise stated. The 
consolidated financial statements are presented in Pounds Sterling with values rounded to the nearest hundred thousand, except 
where otherwise indicated.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of Revolution Bars Group plc and its subsidiaries. 
The financial statements of subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting period as the Parent Company with adjustments 
made to their financial statements to bring their accounting policies in line with those used by the Group.
The financial results of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial information from the date that control commences 
until the date that control ceases. The consolidated financial information presents the results of the companies within the same 
group. Intra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealised income and expenses arising from intra-group transactions, are 
eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial information. Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised 
gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.
Judgements made by the Directors in the application of these accounting policies that have a significant effect on the financial 
statements and estimates with a significant risk of material adjustment in the next year are discussed below.
Going concern
The Directors have reviewed the Group’s trading forecasts. These forecasts demonstrate that the Group has adequate financial 
resources, including its £25 million revolving credit facility which is committed until December 2021, to continue in operational 
existence for a period of at least 12 months from the date of approval of the financial statements.
The Group is forecast to remain compliant with the terms of the revolving credit facility and the financial covenants attached to it, 
which are tested quarterly. The Directors expect to utilise the revolving credit facility for cash flow management and general 
business purposes as required.
The revolving credit facility contains a change in control clause and should this clause be invoked the Directors are confident that 
replacement facilities could be obtained from either the purchaser of the business or from alternative financial providers. For this 
reason the Directors continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the consolidated financial information. Revolution Bars Group plc

1. General information continued
(a) Accounting policies
Non-derivative financial instruments
Non-derivative financial instruments comprise investments in equity securities, trade and other receivables, cash and cash 
equivalents, loans and borrowings and trade and other payables.
Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables are recognised initially at fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition they are measured at amortised 
cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment losses.
Trade and other payables
Trade and other payables are recognised initially at fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition they are measured at amortised 
cost using the effective interest method.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an 
integral part of the Group’s cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the 
cash flow statement only.
Interest-bearing borrowings
Interest-bearing borrowings are recognised initially at fair value less attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial 
recognition, interest-bearing borrowings are stated at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Share capital
Ordinary Shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of Ordinary Shares are recognised as 
a deduction from equity, net of any tax effects.
Merger reserve
The merger reserve arose due to the return of share capital related to the sale of a subsidiary business on 22 February 2014. 
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at historical purchase cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated 
impairment losses. Cost includes the original purchase price of the asset and the costs attributable to bringing the asset to 
its working condition for its intended use.
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the costs of assets over their estimated useful lives, on the following bases:
Short leasehold premises and improvements  –  Lower of 25 years or the term of the leasehold agreement on 
a straight line basis
IT equipment and office furniture  – 3 years to 4 years on a straight line basis
Fixtures and fittings in licensed premises  – 5 years on a straight line basis
Freehold land is not depreciated.
Depreciation policies and useful economic lives are reviewed at each statement of financial position date.
Short leasehold costs include directly attributable employment costs and related personal expenses of individuals employed 
to manage or implement the Company’s capital development programme. Revolution Bars Group plc

1. General information continued
(a) Accounting policies continued
Impairment of tangible fixed assets
At each statement of financial position date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to 
determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. Where the asset does not generate 
cash flows its value is allocated to other cash generating units (“CGUs”) to which it is related as part of the impairment testing of 
those CGUs.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future 
cash flows are discounted to their present value using a discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value 
of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimate of future cash flows have not been adjusted. If the recoverable 
amount of an asset (or cash generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset 
(cash generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value, with due allowance being made for obsolete or slow-moving 
items. Cost is based on the first-in first-out principle and includes expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories and other costs 
in bringing them to their existing location and condition. Cost is stated net of supplier volume rebates.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price less further costs expected to be incurred prior to disposal.
Employee benefits
Defined contribution plans
A defined contribution plan is a post-employment benefit plan under which the Company pays fixed contributions to a separate entity 
and has no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts. Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension 
plans are recognised as an expense in the income statement in the periods during which services are rendered by employees.
Short-term benefits
Short-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are expensed as the related service is 
provided. A liability is recognised amounts expected to be paid under short-term cash bonus or profit-sharing plans if the Group 
has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay such amounts as a result of past service provided by the employee and the 
obligation can be estimated reliably.
Provisions
A provision is recognised in the statement of financial position when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as 
a result of a past event which can be reliably measured and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to 
settle the obligation. Provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects risks 
specific to the liability.
Revenue recognition
Revenue is the fair value of goods and services sold to third parties as part of the Group’s trading activities, net of discounts. 
Revenue primarily comprises food and beverages sold in the Group’s businesses. This revenue is recognised at the point of sale 
to the customer.
Expenses
Cost of sales
Cost of sales principally comprises the purchase cost of drinks and food sold.
Operating lease payments
Payments made under operating leases are recognised in the income statement on a straight line basis over the term of the lease. 
Lease incentives received are recognised in the income statement as an integral part of the total lease expense.

Expenses continued
Supplier rebates
Supplier rebates are recognised as a deduction from cost of sales on an accruals basis using the contractual terms and volumes 
supplied up to the statement of financial position date for each relevant supplier contract. Where rebates are conditional on 
long-term minimum volumes, management judgement is applied as to the achievement of those volumes. Accrued rebates receivable 
as at the date of the statement of financial position are included within trade and other receivables. Where listing fees received 
are conditional on a contractual term, the amounts are recognised over that term.
Financing income and expenses
 > Financing expenses comprise interest payable on borrowings and other finance charges.
 > Interest income and interest payable are recognised in the profit or loss account on an accruals basis, using the effective 
interest method.
Taxation
Tax on the profit or loss for the period comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the income statement except to 
the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case the tax is also recognised directly in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable or credit receivable on the taxable income or loss for the period, using tax rates enacted 
or substantively enacted at the statement of financial position date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting 
purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. The following temporary differences are not provided for: the initial recognition 
of goodwill; the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit other than in a business 
combination; and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable 
future. The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount 
of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the statement of financial position date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which 
the temporary difference can be utilised.
Operating segments
An operating segment is a component of the Group that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur 
expenses, including revenues and expenses that relate to transactions with any of the Group’s other components.
Segment information is based on the internal reports regularly reviewed by the Group’s Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) 
in order to assess each segment’s performance and to allocate resources to them. The CODM is the Board (see Note 2).
Share-based payments (long-term incentive plans)
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees. Equity-settled share-based payments are measured 
at fair value at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed 
on a straight line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest. This is recognised 
as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity. Fair value is measured by the Monte Carlo model for options 
subject to a market-based performance condition and by use of a Black Scholes model for all others. For share-based payment 
awards with non-vesting conditions, the grant date fair value of the share-based payment is measured to reflect such conditions 
and there is no true-up for differences between expected and actual outcomes. Revolution Bars Group plc

Exceptional items
Items that are unusual or infrequent in nature and material in size are disclosed separately in the income statement. The separate 
reporting of these items helps provide a more accurate indication of the Group’s underlying business performance, which the 
Directors believe would otherwise be distorted. Exceptional items include impairments of property, plant and equipment, closure 
costs including onerous lease costs, charges related to share-based payment arrangements, contract termination costs and costs 
associated with one-off projects.
Bar opening costs
Bar opening costs refer to costs incurred in getting new sites fully operational and primarily include costs incurred before opening 
and in preparing for the launch. These costs are disclosed separately in the income statement. The separate reporting of these 
items helps provide a more accurate indication of the Group’s underlying business performance, which the Directors believe 
would otherwise be distorted.
(b) Prior year restatements 
During the year, there were extensive changes within the finance team, following the resignations of key senior personnel. The 
new team became aware that certain of the Group’s accounting policies and processes were not being strictly applied or were not 
in accordance with accounting standards. This was highlighted in the Group’s pre-close announcement. The new finance team has 
undertaken a review into the Group’s accounting policies and practices and PwC was engaged to produce a report for the Board 
on the two most significant matters relating to the classification of certain marketing expenditure as short-life assets and the 
historical over-estimation of accrued income from supplier rebates. 
The review work has identified a number of prior period errors that, due to their materiality, require the restatement of the results 
for the 53 weeks ended 2 July 2016, as well as the consolidated statement of financial position positions as at 2 July 2016 and at 
27 June 2015.
In aggregate, the effect of the prior period restatement is to reduce net assets at 27 June 2015 by £2.5 million. The cumulative 
effect of the restatements was to reduce profit after tax for the period ended 2 July 2016 by £1.7 million, and to reduce net assets 
as at 2 July 2016 by £3.3 million.
The nature and effect of individual adjustments is described below and in the tables that follow. 
i. Overstatement of accrued income relating to supplier rebates 
  Certain policies relating to income from supplier rebates and listing fees were not applied correctly, resulting in an overstatement 
of accrued income as at 2 July 2016 and 27 June 2015. These amounts have now been written off to the consolidated income 
statements for those respective periods and net assets reduced accordingly.
ii. Short-life assets
  Certain items of marketing expenditure, including menus and branded collateral with lives of several months, were being 
capitalised as short-life assets and depreciated over periods of between three and six months. The appropriate treatment for 
such expenditure is to expense the cost when incurred. This treatment resulted in the overstatement of net assets as at 2 July 2016 
and 27 June 2015, and the overstatement of depreciation and understatement of marketing costs for the periods ended 2 July 2016 
and 27 June 2015. Corrections made result in the restatement of the Group’s key alternative reporting measure (adjusted EBITDA).
iii. Onerous leases
  Total liabilities were incorrectly assessed as at 2 July 2016 and 27 June 2015 due to errors in the calculation of onerous lease 
liabilities for two vacant properties. This has resulted in the overstatement of net assets as at 2 July 2016 and 27 June 2015, and 
the misstatement of the corresponding charge recorded within the consolidated income statement for the respective periods.

(b) Prior year restatements continued
iv . Share-based payments
  The amounts charged to the income statement for share-based payments in the period ended 2 July 2016 and 27 June 2015 
were understated due to errors in the calculations. Net assets at 2 July 2016 and 27 June 2015 were understated as a result 
of errors in the recognition of the corresponding deferred tax asset.
v. Inventories
  Inventories were overstated due to errors in the recording of sundry inventory values, the deductions made to cost for 
rebates received, and the elimination of intercompany profits resulting in an overstatement of net assets at both 2 July 2016 
and 27 June 2015. 
vi. Under accrual of costs
  Historically, the Group’s accounting systems and processes have not captured all expenditure and liabilities as incurred and 
consequently prior year statement of financial position have understated liabilities and overstated net assets. Under accruals 
at prior period ends have been identified. In addition, the systems for properly accounting for customer deposits have been 
inadequate leading to an understatement of the carrying value of these balances and an overstatement of net assets.
In addition the Group has restated for the consequential adjustments to taxation arising from the above.
Summary
A summary of the combined impact of the prior year adjustments on the consolidated statement of profit and loss account and 
consolidated statement of cash flow for the 53 weeks ended 2 July 2016 and on the consolidated statements of financial position 
as at 2 July 2016 and at 27 June 2015 arising from the restatement are as follows:

(c) Critical judgements and key sources of estimation and uncertainty
The preparation of consolidated financial information in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgements, 
estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, 
income and expenses. Actual results in due course may differ from these estimates.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis, and are based on historical experience and other 
factors including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Revisions to 
accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected. 
The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation and uncertainty at the date of the statement 
of financial position that have a significant risk of causing material adjustments to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities 
within the next financial year are set out below.
Provision for onerous leases (Note 16)
 > Provisions for onerous leases require estimation and judgements to be made of the amounts expected to be payable over the 
remaining lease term for bars that have been closed, including an assessment of any sublet income. The future cash flows are 
discounted at a rate which reflects the risk profile of the cash flows. Sensitivity of the provision recorded to these key 
assumptions is included in Note 16.
Recoverable amount of property, plant and equipment (Note 11)
 > Assets that are subject to amortisation are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that the 
carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount 
exceeds its estimated recoverable amount.
 > The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, 
the expected future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market 
assessments of the rate of return expected on an investment of equivalent risk. For an asset that does not generate largely 
independent income streams, the recoverable amount is determined in conjunction with the income generating units to which

 > Determining value in use requires a series of estimates to be made including the appropriate discount rate to calculate the 
present value, and an estimate of the cash flows expected to arise from the CGU (including an assessment of revenue and 
cost base growth) and the long-term growth rate. For further details of sensitivity to these key assumptions, see Note 11.
 > The key assumptions in the value in use calculation are the applicable discount rate of 11.7 per cent, revenue and cost base 
growth, and the long-term growth rate. 
Exceptional items and bar opening costs: adjusted profitability measures
Management uses a range of measures to monitor and assess the Group’s financial performance. These measures include 
a combination of statutory measures calculated in accordance with IFRS and alternative performance measures ("APMs"). 
These APMs include the following adjusted measures of profitability:
 > adjusted operating profit before exceptional items and bar opening costs;
 > adjusted profit before tax before exceptional and bar opening costs;
 > adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation before exceptional and bar opening costs 
(“adjusted EBITDA”); and 
 > adjusted basic earnings per share (before exceptional items and bar opening costs).
We report these measures as the Board believes that they provide management and investors with useful additional information 
about the Group’s performance. The above measures represent the equivalent IFRS measures but are adjusted to exclude items 
that we consider would prevent comparison of the Group’s performance both from one reporting period to another and with other 
similar businesses.
These items are not defined under IFRS and as such there is judgement applied in the classification of items as exceptional. 
Exceptional items are classified as those which are separately identifiable by virtue of their size, nature or expected frequency 
and therefore warrant separate presentation. Bar opening costs are other items that we consider should be presented separately 
to allow a better understanding of the underlying performance of the business. Presentation of these measures is not intended to 
be a substitute for or to promote them above statutory measures.
The Group’s income statement provides a reconciliation of the adjusted profitability measures, excluding exceptional  
and non-underlying items to the equivalent unadjusted IFRS measures. 
Exceptional items and bar opening costs are further detailed in Note 3 to the financial statements.
Items that are considered to be exceptional or bar opening costs and that are therefore separately identified in order to aid 
comparability may include the following:
 > costs incurred in association with business combinations, such legal and professional fees and stamp duty;
 > costs incurred in respect of contract termination of CFO and the associated external costs of an accounting review;
 > impairment charges in respect of tangible and intangible assets as a result of restructuring, business closure, underperformance 
of sites or fire damage;
 > charges relating to share-based payments arising from the Group’s long-term incentive schemes; and
 > costs associated with onerous leases on property. The Group may incur costs and recognise liabilities in respect of leasehold 
properties where the terms of the lease make them onerous.
Bar opening costs comprise non-recurring bar opening costs, which are costs incurred between a site being acquired and 
commencement of trading. It predominantly includes property overheads and staff recruitment, payroll and training costs.

1. General information continued
(c) Critical judgements and key sources of estimation and uncertainty continued
Capitalisation of leasehold additions
The Company capitalises employment costs and related personal expenses of individuals whose job roles are fundamentally 
associated with managing or implementing the Company’s capital development programme. Judgement is therefore applied in 
determining the element of internal employment costs which are directly attributable to capital projects. Where such an individual 
undertakes non-capital expenditure related activities as part of their job role then that proportion of their cost is not capitalised 
unless the non-capital expenditure related activities are incidental to their role.
(d) New accounting standards 
There have been no significant changes to accounting under IFRS which have affected the Group’s results. The only changes 
to the IFRS, International Financial Reporting Standards Interpretations Committee ("IFRS IC") interpretations and amendments that 
are effective for the first time in this financial year are the Annual Improvements to IFRS: 2012–2014 cycle. These have not had 
a material impact on the Group. The following IFRS have been issued but are not yet effective: 
 > IFRS 16 “Leases” (not yet endorsed by the EU) was issued on 13 January 2016 and is effective for accounting periods beginning 
on or after 1 January 2019. Early adoption is permitted if IFRS 15 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” has also been applied. 
IFRS 16 is expected to have a significant impact on the amounts recognised in the Group’s consolidated financial statements. 
On adoption of IFRS 16, the Group will recognise within the statement of financial position a right of use asset and lease liability for 
all applicable leases. Within the income statement, rent expense will be replaced by depreciation and interest expense. This will 
result in an increase in finance costs. The standard will also impact a number of statutory measures such as operating profit and 
cash generated from operations, and APMs used by the Group. The full impact of IFRS 16 is currently under review, including 
understanding the practical application of the principles of the standard. It is therefore not practical to provide a reasonable 
estimate of the financial effect until this review is complete.
 > IFRS 9 “Financial Instruments” replaces all phases of the financial instruments project and IAS 39 “Financial Instruments: 
Recognition and Measurement”. The standard is effective from 1 January 2018 and introduces new requirements for the classification 
and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities, and a new model based on expected credit losses for recognising 
provisions, and provides for simplified hedge accounting by aligning hedge accounting more closely with an entity’s risk 
management methodology. The potential impact of this change to the Group is currently under review but is not expected 
to have a material impact.
 > IFRS 15 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” (not yet endorsed by the EU) is effective after 1 January 2018 with early 
adoption permitted. It has not yet been endorsed by the EU. The standard establishes a principles-based approach for revenue 
recognition and is based on the concept of recognising revenue for obligations only when they are satisfied and the control of 
goods or services is transferred. The potential impact of this change to the Group is currently under review but is not expected 
to have a material impact.
Other standards and interpretations that are relevant to the Group have been assessed as having no significant financial impact 
or additional disclosure requirements at this time:
 > amendments to IAS 12 – Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for Unrealised Losses (not yet endorsed by the EU);
 > amendments to IFRS 2 – Share-based payment (not yet endorsed by the EU);
 > the IASB’s annual improvement process 2014–2016 cycle (not yet endorsed by the EU); and
 > amendments to IAS 7 – Disclosure Initiative (not yet endorsed by the EU). Revolution Bars Group plc

2. Segmental information
The Group’s continuing operating businesses are organised and managed as reportable business segments according to the 
information used by the Group’s CODM in its decision making and reporting structure.
The Group internal management reporting is focused predominantly on revenue and EBITDA, as these are principal drivers of the 
Group’s business and the allocation of resources. The CODM receives information on each trading venue and each trading venue 
is considered an operating segment. In line with IFRS 8, each operating segment has the same characteristics and, accordingly, 
the bars are aggregated to form the “Ongoing” reportable segment. Within the ongoing business, assets and liabilities cannot 
be allocated to individual operating segments and are not used by the CODM for making operating and resource allocation decisions.
The Group performs all of its activities in the United Kingdom. All of the Group’s non-current assets are located in the 
United Kingdom. Revenue is earned from the sale of goods.

review, including work undertaken by PwC, together with the costs relating to the contract termination of Chris Chambers, 
Chief Financial Officer, are included within exceptional costs.

3. Operating expenses continued
As a result of the annual impairment testing of property, plant and equipment, the net book value of the assets at six of the 
Group’s bars was written down either partially or in full.
During the year the level of provisions for onerous leases relating to two non-trading properties was reviewed and increased primarily 
reinstating a release in the prior period when management considered that there was a good prospect of being able to sublet the properties.
At the time of the initial public offering (“IPO”), substantial share options were awarded to a number of senior staff. The Board 
considers that the magnitude and timing of this award is one-off in nature and so treats any related charges or credits as exceptional.
In the 53 weeks ended 1 July 2016, restated exceptional items amounted to £1.4 million. This included professional fees incurred 
for an aborted corporate transaction and the contract termination costs relating to Sean Curran’s resignation as Chief Financial 
Officer. It also includes a charge for share-based payments (resulting from the prior year adjustments) and a credit in respect of 
an adjustment to the onerous lease provision (part of which was previously included within underlying operating profit) reflecting 
management’s assumptions at the time regarding the potential for subletting or disposing of the leasehold interests. Movements in 
long-term incentive plans and onerous lease provisions are in respect of the shortfall of pre-existing amounts.

A reduction in the UK corporation tax rate from 21 per cent to 20 per cent (effective from 1 April 2015) was substantively enacted on 
2 July 2013. Further reductions to 19 per cent (effective from 1 April 2017) and to 18 per cent (effective 1 April 2020) were substantively enacted 
on 26 October 2015, and an additional reduction to 17 per cent (effective 1 April 2020) was substantively enacted on 6 September 2016. 
This will reduce the Company’s future current tax charge accordingly. The deferred tax liability at 1 July 2017 has been calculated based

The Group has determined that, for the purposes of impairment testing, each bar is a cash generating unit (“CGU”). The bars 
are tested for impairment in accordance with IAS 36 “Impairment of Assets” when a triggering event is identified. The recoverable 
amounts for the CGUs are predominantly based on value in use, which is calculated on the cash flow expected to be generated by 
the bars using the latest projected data available and discounted over perpetuity.
In the 52 weeks ended 1 July 2017, the Group impaired the assets of six CGUs, either partially or in full, based on the value in use 
of the CGU determined by discounted cash flow projections being lower than the net book value. When we recognise an impairment 
loss, we depreciate the asset’s adjusted carrying value over its remaining useful economic life. 
In the 53 weeks ended 2 July 2016, no CGUs were impaired.
The value in use calculations use cash flows based on Board-approved budgets covering a three-year period. These budgets 
combine understanding of historical performance together with knowledge of the current market, and management’s views on the 
future achievable growth. Cash flows beyond this three-year period are extrapolated using a long-term growth rate to five years, 
at which point a terminal value has been calculated based upon the long-term growth rate.

11. Property, plant and equipment continued
The key assumptions in the value in use calculations are the cash flows contained within the budgets, the long-term growth rate 
and the risk-adjusted pre-tax discount rate as follows:
 > Long-term growth rate: 2.0 per cent (2016: 2.0 per cent).
 > Pre-tax discount rate: 11.7 per cent (2016: 11.7 per cent).
The long-term growth rate has been determined with reference to forecast Gross Domestic Product ("GDP") growth, which 
management believes is the most appropriate indicator of long-term growth rates that is available. The pre-tax discount rate is 
based on the Group’s weighted average cost of capital.
A sensitivity analysis has been performed on each of these key assumptions with other variables held constant. 
Increasing the pre-tax discount rate by 1 per cent would result in additional impairments of £0.1 million. A 0.1 per cent decrease in 
the long-term growth rate would increase the impairment charge recorded by £0.1 million.

(2016: £6.4 million).

The onerous lease provision is expected to be payable over the remaining lease terms. In 2016, the provision was net of an 
estimated rental income from future subletting of the properties.
The calculation is most sensitive to changes in the assumptions used for budgeted cash flow, and a risk-free discount rate 
of 2.6 per cent. Management considers that reasonably possible changes in assumptions would be a change in discount 
of 0.5 per cent. As an indication of sensitivity when applied to the calculation, an increase to the rate of +/-0.5 per cent 
would result in a change in the corresponding liability of -/+£0.1 million.

of 0.82 per cent. The facility expires in December 2021 and is secured and supported by debentures over certain Group assets.
The amount drawn at 1 July 2017 was £7.5 million (2016: £0.5 million). 
All borrowings are held in Sterling. There is no material difference between the fair value and book value of the Group  
interest-bearing borrowings. For more information on the Group’s exposure to interest rate risk, see Note 21.

 483 987
On 18 March 2015 conditional awards were made for 1,535,000 Ordinary Shares under the IPO LTIP Award, 767,500 under the 
2016 LTIP Award and 767,500 under the 2017 LTIP Award to senior employees. On 9 November 2015 further conditional awards 
were made for 44,357 under the IPO LTIP Award, 22,228 under the 2016 LTIP Award and 22,228 under the 2017 LTIP Award to 
additional senior employees. On 2 November 2016 further conditional awards were made for 141,250 under the IPO LTIP Award, 
70,625 under the FY16 LTIP Award and 70,625 under the FY17 LTIP Award to additional senior employees. 
The vesting of each award is subject to the attainment of performance conditions. For each award, 70 per cent is based upon an 
adjusted earnings per share (“EPS”) target (Part A) and 30 per cent on a TSR target (Part B). The adjusted EPS is based upon the 
non-GAAP measure as discussed in Note 9 (page 77).
The performance conditions are tested over the below performance periods:
 > the IPO LTIP Award will be tested over the period from 1 July 2015 to 30 June 2018 for Part A and 18 March 2015 to 30 June 2018 
for Part B and will vest in 2018 to the extent it satisfies the conditions;
 > the 2016 LTIP Award will be tested over the period from 1 July 2016 to 30 June 2019 and will vest in 2019 to the extent it satisfies 
the conditions; and
 > the 2017 LTIP Award will be tested over the period from 1 July 2017 to 30 June 2020 and will vest in 2020 to the extent it satisfies 
the conditions.
Part A – EPS targets
The vesting of Part A of each such award will be dependent on the Group’s EPS performance over the fixed periods listed above. 
No portion of Part A will vest unless the Group’s EPS growth is at least equal to a compound annual growth rate of 7 per cent; 
thereafter the following vesting schedule will apply:
The Company’s EPS compound growth Extent of vesting of Part A
At least 7% per annum 25%
Between a minimum of 7% per annum and 13% per annum Pro-rata between 25% and 100%
At least 13% per annum 100%
For the IPO LTIP Award, EPS performance will be tested using a pro-forma EPS figure for the year ended FY15 as a base point. 
Adjusted EPS for such purposes thereafter will be disclosed in due course at the time of vesting in the Remuneration Report.

Part B – TSR targets
The vesting of Part B of each such award will be dependent on the Group’s TSR over the fixed periods listed above relative to the 
TSR of the constituents of the peer group of other UK-listed restaurant and bar sector companies over the same period.
No portion of Part B will vest unless the Group’s TSR performance at least matches the median of the TSR performance within the 
comparator Group; thereafter the following vesting schedule will apply:
The Company’s TSR performance against the TSR of the comparator companies Extent of vesting of Part B
Median 25%
Between median and upper quartile Pro-rata between 25% and 100%
Upper quartile (or better) 100%
For the IPO LTIP Award, the offer price (200 pence) will be used as the base point from which TSR is measured for the Company. 
For the FY16 LTIP Award and the FY17 LTIP Award a three-month average prior to the start of the performance period will be used. 
For all awards the end point will be averaged over the last three months of the respective performance period.
Expected volatility has been estimated by considering historical average share price volatility for the Company or similar 
companies. Staff attrition has been assessed based on historical retention rates.
The following table illustrates the number and weighted average exercise price ("WAEP") of, and movements in, share options 
granted under the scheme:

21. Financial instruments
The Board has overall responsibility for the determination of the Group’s risk management objectives and policies. The overall 
objective of the Board is to set policies that seek to reduce risk as far as possible without unduly affecting the Group’s 
competitiveness and flexibility.
The Group is exposed to the following financial risks:
 > credit risk;
 > liquidity risk;
 > market risk; and
 > capital risk.
Cash and cash equivalents are held in Pounds Sterling. Trade and other payables are measured at amortised cost.
Credit risk
Credit risk arises from the Group’s cash balances held with counterparties and trade and other receivables. Credit risk is the risk 
of financial loss to the Group if a third party which owes amounts to the Group fails to meet its contractual obligations. At 1 July 2017 
there were no receivables considered to be past due (2 July 2016: £nil).
Trade and other receivables are measured at amortised cost. Book values and expected cash flow are reviewed by the Board 
and any impairment is charged to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income in the relevant period. 
All cash balances are held with reputable banks and the Board monitors its exposure to counterparty risk on an ongoing basis. 
The Group attempts to mitigate credit risk by assessing financial counterparties.
The Directors are not aware of any factors affecting the recoverability of outstanding balances as at 1 July 2017.
Given the nature of the Group’s operations, the Directors do not consider the Group’s credit risk, which arises mainly from cash 
held with banks, to be significant. 
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk arises from the Group’s management of working capital. It is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its future 
obligations as they fall due. The Group’s policy is to ensure that it will always have sufficient cash to allow it to meet its liabilities 
when they become due by maintaining adequate banking and borrowing facilities.
The Group performs regular cash flow projections to ensure that it has sufficient cash to meet expected operational expenses. 
The Group has committed lines of credit through a £25 million revolving credit facility in the amount of £25 million provided by 
The Royal Bank of Scotland, of which £7.5 million was drawn at 1 July 2017.
The Group’s financial liabilities are as follows:
 
1 July 2017
£’000
2 July 2016

Market risk
Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as interest rates or foreign exchange rates, will affect the Group’s costs. 
The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters. Market 
interest rate risk arises from the Group’s holding of interest-bearing financial assets and liabilities. 
At 1 July 2017, the Group’s interest-bearing financial assets consisted solely of cash and cash equivalents (see Note 14). The Group 
has interest-bearing financial liabilities as at 1 July 2017, being a revolving credit facility of £7.5 million (2016: £0.5 million).
The Board makes ad hoc decisions at its regular meetings as to whether to hold funds in instant access accounts or longer-term 
deposits. All accounts are held with reputable UK banks. These policies, which the Directors consider to be appropriate for the 
current stage of development of the Group’s business, will be kept under review by the Board in future years. If interest rates at 
each period-end reporting date had moved by 5 per cent, the impact on results would not have been significant.
Fair value of financial instruments
The fair value of each category of financial instruments is the same as their carrying value in the Group statement of financial position.
Capital risk
The Group’s capital is made up of share capital and retained earnings.
The objectives when managing capital are:
 > to safeguard the entity’s ability to continue as a going concern, so that it can provide returns for shareholders and benefits for 
other stakeholders; and
 > to provide an adequate return to shareholders by pricing products and services commensurately with the level of risk.
The capital structure of the Group consists of shareholders’ equity as set out in the consolidated statement of changes in equity. 
All working capital requirements are financed from existing cash resources and a revolving credit facility. There are no externally 
imposed capital requirements. Financing decisions are made by the Board based on forecasts of the expected timing and level 
of capital and operating expenditure required to meet the Group’s commitments and development plans.

commonly include either market or index-linked rent reviews. The timing of rent reviews varies on a lease-by-lease basis.
The total future minimum sublease income due under non-cancellable subleases is £1.2 million (2016: £1.4 million).
The total lease payments recognised in the income statement in the 52 weeks ended 1 July 2017 was £9.7 million (53 weeks 
ended 2 July 2016: £8.3 million).

25. Accounting policies
Statement of compliance
The Company’s financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) 
as adopted by the EU, as they apply to the financial statements of the Group, for the 52 weeks ended 1 July 2017 (prior period 
53 weeks ended 2 July 2016) and in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
Basis of preparation
The Company financial statements have been prepared in accordance with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to 
companies reporting under IFRS as adopted by the EU. They are presented in Pounds Sterling, with values rounded to the nearest 
hundred thousand, except where otherwise indicated.
Non-derivative financial instruments
Non-derivative financial instruments comprise investments in equity and debt securities, trade and other receivables, cash and 
cash equivalents, loans and borrowings and trade and other payables.
Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables are recognised initially at fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition they are measured at amortised 
cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment losses.
Trade and other payables
Trade and other payables are recognised initially at fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition they are measured at amortised 
cost using the effective interest method.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and cash held at bank. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and 
form an integral part of the Group’s cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose 
only of the cash flow statement.
Interest-bearing borrowings
Interest-bearing borrowings are recognised initially at fair value less attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial 
recognition, interest-bearing borrowings are stated at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Share-based payments
The Company issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees. Equity-settled share-based payments are 
measured at fair value at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments 
is expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest. This 
is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity. Fair value is measured by the Monte Carlo model 
for options subject to a market-based performance condition and by use of a Black Scholes model for all others. For share-based 
payment awards with non-vesting conditions, the grant date fair value of the share-based payment is measured to reflect such 
conditions and there is no true-up for differences between expected and actual outcomes. Cost is recharged to subsidiary entities.
Investments in subsidiary undertakings 
A subsidiary is an entity controlled, either directly or indirectly, by the Company, where control is the power to govern the financial 
and operating policies of the entity so as to obtain benefit from its activities. Investments in subsidiaries represent interests in 
subsidiaries that are directly owned by the Company and are stated at cost less any provision for permanent diminution in value.

25. Accounting policies continued
Share capital
Ordinary Shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of Ordinary Shares are recognised as a 
deduction from equity, net of any tax effects.
Dividends
Dividends receivable from the Company’s subsidiaries and joint venture investments are recognised only when they are approved 
or paid by shareholders. 
Dividend distributions to the company’s shareholders are recognised in the period in which the dividends are paid, and, for the 
final dividend, when approved by the company’s shareholders at the annual general meeting (“AGM”).
Taxation
Tax on the profit or loss for the period comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the income statement except to 
the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the period, using tax rates enacted or 
substantively enacted at the statement of financial position date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting 
purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. The following temporary differences are not provided for: the initial 
recognition of goodwill; the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit other than in 
a business combination; and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in 
the foreseeable future. The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the 
carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the statement of financial position date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which 
the temporary difference can be utilised.
26. Profit for the period
No profit or loss account is presented for the Company as permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006. The profit after 
tax for the year was £2,475,000 (2016: £1,600,000). 
27. Auditor’s remuneration
Auditor’s remuneration in respect of the Company audit was £500 (2016: £500). 
28. Directors’ remuneration and employee costs
Details of Directors remuneration in respect of services delivered to the Group are contained in the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report on pages 30 to 45. The remuneration received by the Directors in respect of directly attributable services to this company 
is inconsequential in the context of the remuneration figure. The Company has no employees other than the Directors and the 
Directors are not remunerated through this Company.  Revolution Bars Group plc

32. Prior year restatements
During the year, there were extensive changes within the Finance team, following the resignations of key senior personnel. The 
new team became aware that certain of the Group’s accounting policies and processes were not being strictly applied or were not 
in accordance with accounting standards, this was highlighted in the Group’s pre-close announcement. The new finance team has 
undertaken a review into the Group’s accounting policies and practices and PwC were engaged to produce a report for the Board. 
The review work has identified a number of prior period errors that, due to their materiality, require the restatement of the results 
for the 53 weeks ended 2 July 2016, as well as the consolidated statement of financial positions as at 2 July 2016 and at 27 June 2015. 
Refer to note 1(b) on pages 68 to 71 for a detailed explanation of the prior year restatements. 
In aggregate, the effect of the prior period restatement is to increase net assets as at 27 June 2015 by £0.3m, and to increase net 
assets as at 2 July 2016 by £1.3m.

was no impact on profit for the periods. Net assets at 2 July 2016 and 27 June 2015 were understated as a result.
