Sport & Leisure
Our foams are used for energy 
conservation in footwear, energy 
diffusion in impact protection pads, 
comfort in knee-pads, buoyancy 
in swimming aids and life-vests for 
extreme sports. Lightweight is often  
a factor in these applications.
Industrial
Marine hoses benefit from AZOTE

foams’ best in class strength-to-
weight ratio. Softer foams offer 
unique sealing properties in many 
applications such as white goods or 
other very demanding environments. 
ZOTEK
®
 foams are used in oil-
resistant seals. Moisture resistance, 
strength and ease of transformation 
are often determining factors in the 
choice of foams for a wide variety  
of industrial applications.
Other
The ingenuity of our customers, 
breadth and flexibility of our products 
and variety of processing techniques 
mean that there is an amazing 
diversity of uses for our foams. 
Often these applications require a 
combination of attributes not found 
in competitor foams, such as colour 
vibrancy, ease of processing and 
extreme lightweight, strength or  
cell structure.
Medical
Unsurprisingly, purity is often the 
critical factor in medical applications. 
The range of AZOTE

I am pleased to report a very successful year of 
strong sales and earnings growth and significant 
progress in the development of our business, with the 
commissioning of our largest ever capital investment 
project and the creation of an important strategic 
partnership with Nike.
2017 performance
Group sales grew 22% to £70.15m (2016: £57 .38m)  
and profit before tax and exceptional item also grew 
22% to £8.81m (2016: £7 .23m). Earnings per share 
before exceptional item rose 17% from 13.69p to 
16.04p. Profit before tax increased by 8% to £7 .55m 
(2016: £6.99m) and earnings per share was up 3%  
to 13.70p (2016: 13.25p). 
All business segments reported strong sales growth 
and our pipeline of commercial opportunities 
developed positively throughout the year. We have 
continued to invest in product and market development 
as well as the governance structure to support an 
increasingly international, high-growth business. 
Investments
The first phase of investment, HP1, at our site 
in Kentucky, USA has now been successfully 
commissioned, increasing Group high-pressure 
autoclave capacity by over 20%. Further capacity 
investment, this time in low-pressure autoclaves and 
infrastructure, at a cost of £12m, was approved during 
2017 for our Croydon, UK site, primarily for expansion 
of our ZOTEK
®
 range of HPP foams. 
The Board has also assessed a number of additional 
capacity options. It has decided, as a first step, to 
proceed with the installation of a second high-pressure 
autoclave (HP2) at our site in Kentucky at a cost of 
some $9m, which also includes a supporting extrusion 
line. The investment should deliver similar incremental 
capacity to HP1 and is expected to be commissioned 
in late 2019. 
An introduction from our Chairman

opportunities and we will continue to invest in capacity 
to enable these to be delivered. 
Dividend
The Board is proposing a final dividend of 4.02p per 
ordinary share (2016: 3.90p) which, if approved by 
shareholders, would make a total of 5.93p per ordinary 
share for the year (2016: 5.75p), an increase of 3.1%. 
This reflects the Board’s continued confidence in the 
Group’s future and is in line with the targeted policy of 
paying a progressive dividend. If approved, the final 
dividend will be paid on 24 May 2018 to shareholders 
on the register on 20 April 2018. 
Board changes and governance
In August 2017 the Board appointed Doug Robertson 
as a Non-Executive Director and Chair of the Audit 
Committee. Doug succeeded Marie-Louise Clayton, 
who retired from the Board on 30 September 2017 
and, on behalf of the Board, I would like to thank her 
for her contribution both as Non-Executive Director 
and Audit Committee Chair during the six years 
that she served on the Board. After 10 years on the 
Board Richard Clowes will be retiring at the AGM on 
16 May 2018 and, to prepare for this, on 2 January 
2018 Jonathan Carling joined the Board as a Non-
Executive Director. I would like to express my thanks 
to Richard for his guidance and significant contribution 
to the Board throughout his tenure. We are pleased 
to announce that Doug Robertson will be replacing 
Richard as the Senior Independent Director upon his 
departure. We have a refreshed Board with a good 
balance of experience to challenge, guide and support 
the Executives in the delivery of our strategy. 
The Board considers that it has fully applied all of 
the principles and provisions of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code during 2017 . More information  
is provided in the Corporate Governance report. 
People
Zotefoams relies on the skills, effort and dedication of 
our people and ensuring that we have the right people

to each and every one of our hard-working employees 
who have made 2017 a very successful year.

Group CEO’s strategic review
Delivering organic growth
Another year of progress
Zotefoams has performed strongly, delivering organic 
revenue growth of 22% to £70.15m (2016: 57 .38m) 
and profit before tax growth, before exceptional item, 
of 22% to £8.81m (2016: £7 .23m). Our strategy is to 
utilise our unique, cellular materials technology to 
manufacture value-added foam products and license 
related intellectual property. The markets in which we 
operate are driven by global trends – demographic, 
environmental and regulatory – which we believe offer 
potential for high rates of market growth as well as 
opportunity for our disruptive technology solutions. 
We measure strategic progress on four metrics, all 
before exceptional items:
1. Our HPP and MEL business units, which offer these 
unique, disruptive products and solutions, grew 32% 
and 56% respectively and together now account for 
25% of Group revenues.
2. Sales of our highly differentiated AZOTE
®
 polyolefin 
foam products grew by 18%, well above our target rate 
of twice global GDP growth.
3. Group operating margins were 13.4% (2016: 13.3%), 
as underlying operating profit, measured as the sum  
of segment margins, increased to 17 .2% (2016: 16.8%).
4. Group return on capital, which excludes large asset 
investments not yet commissioned, increased to 15.5% 
from 14.0%.
With record sales and profits in 2017 , Zotefoams is 
becoming more international, more diversified and has 
a strong portfolio of opportunities to deliver further 
organic growth in line with our stated strategic intent.
Human resources and embedding our culture  
to deliver
To deliver its potential Zotefoams needs talented 
people. We need to recruit, retain and motivate them 
as individuals and to work together in teams, often 
across geographic and cultural boundaries. As our 
business grows this is an increasing challenge. In 2017 
82% of revenues were outside the UK, the number of 
non-UK based employees increased by 14% and we 
invested 69% of capital outside the UK. Developing 
the right Group culture is important to complement 
the governance structures needed in a diverse, high-
growth business. Zotefoams’ culture is based around 
brand values and further development as a learning 
organisation, where lessons from failure may be the  
first step forward, where employees understand  
how we all contribute to the business and where  
we celebrate success and value the contribution  
of others. Within this structure, business units and 
brand leaders have significant autonomy to operate  
in a dynamic environment.
We recognise that matching our global talent base  
to our growth challenges is key to our success. 
Key investments
Zotefoams’ core autoclave technology is asset intensive 
with high barriers to entry on cost, lead-time and 
know-how. We took the decision in late 2014 to invest 
significantly in our site in Kentucky, USA and the $33m 
investment included infrastructure, extrusion and two 
high-pressure autoclaves, the first of which, HP1, has 
now been successfully commissioned. Recently, the 
Board of Zotefoams approved the commissioning 
of the second high-pressure autoclave (HP2) and 
With record sales and profits in 
2017 , Zotefoams is becoming more 
international, more diversified and has 
a strong portfolio of opportunities to 
deliver further organic growth in line 
with our stated strategic intent.

Our Kentucky plant begins 
production  
Following the decision late 
2014 to invest significantly 
in our Kentucky, USA plant, 
production of commercial 
AZOTE® foam commenced 
in February 2018. The plant 
is now a fully integrated 
production facility, adding 
extrusion and high-pressure 
autoclave capability to the 
already existing low-pressure 
foaming capability in place 
since 2001. 
Development of a more 
broadly based HPP 
business 
Sales in the HPP business 
unit grew 32%, with strong 
growth in ZOTEK® PEBA 
foams used in footwear as 
well as in the T-FIT® Clean 
range of products, which 
provide advanced insulation 
solutions to the biotech and 
pharmaceutical markets. 
Investing in people  
Talent attraction and employer 
branding are areas we have 
paid particular attention to in 
recent years, and in 2017 we 
have again seen the benefits 
of this investment through the 
highly skilled and qualified 
people we have hired.
associated extrusion equipment at an additional cost 
of $9m. This positions Kentucky as a significant, stand-
alone contributor to Group capacity, initially focused  
on AZOTE
®
 polyolefin foams, with the site large enough 
for further investment if needed. During 2017 we also 
approved a £12m investment for infrastructure and 
two low-pressure autoclaves for our Croydon, UK site, 
primarily for expansion of our ZOTEK
®
 range of HPP 
foams. This recent acceleration of capacity investment 
is all growth related, with expectations of increased 
revenues driven by our portfolio of differentiated 
products and market opportunities. In total, we have 
committed to increasing our capacity by approximately 
45% over 2017 production run rates.
The HP1 investment cost more and took longer than 
initially anticipated. While this is disappointing, we have 
learnt significant lessons from this, including improved 
clarity on certain costs, management of the risks 
associated with long-lead-time, specialist, equipment 
and the potential opportunity loss from lack of capacity. 
We therefore emerge as a better-informed organisation, 
more capable of managing similar investments in the 
future, whilst recognising that risks to execution remain 
on large and complex capital projects.
Zotefoams’ organic growth strategy requires that we 
invest in product and market development as well as 
in the governance structure to support an increasingly 
international business. We have therefore seen a 
large increase in our administration and distribution 
costs, including technical and market development, 
linked to both current and expected future states of 
the Zotefoams business. Cost investment currently 
exceeds revenue in three major product groups, MuCell 
Extrusion, T-FIT
®
 insulation and ZOTEK
®
 N foams, 
which, together, represent £7 .1m of Group revenues 
(2016: £4.56m) and, we believe, are well positioned  
for long-term profitable growth. 
Current trading and outlook
The year has started positively, with first quarter  
order volumes 8% higher than 2017 and an increased 
proportion of higher-value HPP sales. Our investment 
in capacity in Kentucky, USA has now been 
commissioned and we made the first sales in February. 
We have also broken ground on our investment in 
Croydon, which increases low-pressure capacity for 
our HPP businesses by a factor of six. The Board has 
now approved the commissioning of our second high-
pressure autoclave in the USA, with a view to having 
this operational during 2019. 
We believe that investment in product and market 
development over the past years, together with 
investment in capacity to meet expected future levels  
of demand, leave us well placed to support future 
growth and, while being mindful of the risks posed by 
the macroeconomic environment and a strengthening 
in the value of sterling, the Board remains confident 
about the future prospects for our business.
Sales in Polyolefin foams increased  
by 18% to £52.82m (2016: £44.73m),  
with segment profit increasing by 29%  
to £10.29m (2016: £7 .96m).
AZOTE
®
 polyolefin foams are manufactured using 
our unique, high-pressure nitrogen gas, autoclave 
process. This segment represented 75% of Group 
revenues and is the original and most diversified part 
of the Zotefoams business. AZOTE
®
 foams are more 
consistent, lighter weight and possess higher purity 
than foams manufactured using chemical technology. 
These attributes make our foams ideal for multiple use 
or “permanent” storage packaging, lightweight parts in 
aircraft, cars and trains, construction applications and 
medical equipment.
During 2017 we operated the Croydon facility at its 
effective capacity, increasing sales volumes globally 
by around 7%. Price increases and a better mix of 
sales, both by product and market, contributed 6% 
to revenue growth while more favourable exchange 
rates, mainly compared to the first six months of 2016, 
benefitted revenues by 5%. In continental Europe 
much of the mix impact was realised in Germany, 
where direct supply into a larger number of customers 
benefitted both pricing and business development.  
In North America the major impact was from our  
foam cutting operation in Tulsa, Oklahoma, which  
was operational for the full 12 months, increasing  
selling prices with their value-added processing  
of our materials. In the United Kingdom & Eire and  
Asia, revenues increased by 7% and 25% respectively.
The operational leverage impact of higher sales, while 
operating at capacity, meant that profits increased 
significantly in an environment of modest labour 
cost increases and stable prices for LDPE, our main 
raw material, despite a more difficult inflationary 
environment in some other materials and energy. 
Increasingly our sales resource is spent specifying 
our product at end users, often in collaboration with 
channel members. As additional capacity comes on 
line we believe this is the right approach to enhance 
the quality of our business, along with product range 
enhancement and selected value-added services.

a significant strategic partnership with Nike, focused 
on this market segment, which is now receiving 
a substantially larger allocation of resource and 
investment aligned to its continued growth potential. 
ZOTEK
®
 F fluoropolymer foams are mainly sold for 
aviation applications and, although remaining the 
largest element of HPP , the 2017 performance was 
below expectations, and against trend, with sales 
declining year-on-year due mainly to destocking in 
the downstream supply chain to Boeing. ZOTEK
®
 
Nylon foam sales have developed as expected, with 
a growing portfolio of opportunities in transportation 
markets, but are currently a small part of this portfolio. 
Sales of T-FIT
®
 advanced insulation grew strongly 
within the biotech and pharmaceutical markets and,  
in late 2017 , we launched product line extensions,  
using a lower-cost manufacturing process, targeted  
at food, dairy and general process industries. 
During 2017 we continued the development of complex 
three-dimensional foams. The solid parts are made by 
injection moulding, rather than extrusion, which offers 
the possibility of creating bespoke parts that retain their 
shape when foamed in Zotefoams’ autoclave process, 
enabling Zotefoams to provide parts which are close 
to the final dimensions required by some end-users. 
The development is proceeding well and we expect 
a trial launch late in 2018. The development is initially 
focused on our ZOTEK
®
 foams, where material yield 
is particularly important due to the higher cost of the 
polymers used. 
MuCell Extrusion LLC (‘MEL ’) licenses 
microcellular foam technology and sells 
related machinery. Sales increased by 56% 
to £4.25m (2016: £2.73m) and segment loss, 
before amortisation, increased to £(1.03)m 
(2016: £(0.40)m).
MEL ’s business model is to develop and license 
intellectual property (“IP”). MuCell
®
 technology offers 
the potential to reduce the plastic content of an article 
by around 15%, by injecting inert gas to displace plastic 
with microcellular bubbles. MuCell
®
 technology can be 
used with most common plastics and reduces material 
consumption with no negative impact on recycling. 
Initially, MEL will sell equipment to augment an existing 
extrusion line and, when the licensee is in production 
and saving money, MEL will collect a share of those 
savings as a licence fee and/or royalty payment. 
In 2017 equipment revenue grew 72% to £3.24m 
(2016: £1.88m), with one large contract accounting for 
approximately 39% of equipment sales, while licence 
fees and royalty revenue increased 19% to £1.01m 
(2016: £0.85m). Our potential base of royalty-generating 
machines grew 18%, with 131 MuCell
®
 units installed  
at MEL licensees (2016: 111). As there is often a time-
lag for end-user adoption, a key metric is the number 
of machines actually in production, which increased by 
46% to 83 machines (2016: 57), many of which are not 
yet operating at full potential. Segment loss increased 
as expected due to investment in people, including a 
dedicated IP manager, as well as non-recurring costs 
of £0.29m related primarily to write-downs of inventory, 
mostly costs of machinery developments which have 
been superseded. As most of the value created by 
MEL is royalty fees from contracts, often over terms 
exceeding 10 years, management is also measured 
on the expected present value of contracts. This key 
performance indicator increased significantly over 
the 12 months to 31 December 2017 . Management 
believes that increases in this metric, growing licence 
and royalty income, as well as creation of value through 
new IP , where we made good progress in 2017 and 
have some potentially significant developments to 
patent in 2018, continue to indicate a positive future  
for MEL.

Our business model
How our business works
What we do
Zotefoams is a diversified value-
added polymer processor, utilising 
unique cellular materials technology 
in a variety of markets globally. 
Zotefoams manufactures block 
foams using high-pressure nitrogen 
gas technology, processes its own 
foams for specific markets, licenses 
intellectual property (‘IP’), and also 
sells related machinery. 
The block foams business units 
compete primarily through the 
superior foam properties created 
by our technology, offering reduced 
environmental impact and a better 
safety and technical performance. 
This business has significant 
barriers to entry, including capital 
cost, know-how, user specifications 
and, in our HPP business, patents. 
Our licensing business
MuCell Extrusion LLC (‘MEL ’) licenses a 
patented process that creates ‘micro-bubbles’ 
in the core of plastic parts or products 
by injecting gas into them as they are 
manufactured. This produces a foamed core, 
bound by a solid skin into one integral material, 
that seems indistinguishable from a solid 
product. Products using MuCell
®
 technology 
can be designed to perform like solid plastic, 
but will typically use 15-20% less material, 
realising both cost and environmental benefits 
by using inert carbon dioxide or nitrogen gas 
and reducing the plastic content at source. 
Most customers are in the FMCG or food 
packaging industries, where value is created 
from making a small saving in plastic content 
which is multiplied across many millions of parts 
annually. MEL shares in the customers’ benefits 
by receiving a licence fee for IP and/or royalty 
on parts made.
A portfolio approach
Zotefoams works on a portfolio of opportunities 
which, over time, we expect will deliver our 
growth targets. Predominantly, our AZOTE
®
 
and ZOTEK
®
 foams are value-added materials 
used in conjunction with other materials to 
meet an end-user requirement. We are often 
working in conjunction with a channel partner 
and/or on applications where other solutions 
may be successful. MEL faces some similar 
challenges in working mainly with packaging 
converters who need to convince their end-
user customers of the benefits provided. It is, 
therefore, important that we invest in developing 
the portfolio of potential opportunities and the 
Group Executive team manages the allocation 
of these resources to optimise our return and 
risk over time. 
Routes to market
Zotefoams’ block foams are sold, and often 
specified, under the AZOTE
®
 and ZOTEK
®
 
brand names, which are well known in the 
industries we serve: automotive, aerospace, 
packaging, industrial parts, marine, building 
and construction, military and sport and 
leisure. Zotefoams also sells T-FIT
®
 technical 
insulation, manufactured from ZOTEK
®
 foams, 
for pharmaceutical, semiconductor and biotech 
facilities. Our block foams are typically sold 
through channel members, known as foam 
converters. These converters cut and shape 
foams into specific parts for end users and, 
therefore, Zotefoams’ success is built on a 
strong relationship with the foam converters 
and on having products which meet the 
specific needs of those end users. Our ZOTEK
®
 
foams are often sold with high levels of end-
user engagement, which reflects the more 
technical nature of these products, while our 
AZOTE
®
 foams traditionally have grown with the 
engagement and support of foam converters.
Local and global market 
positions
Typically the benefits of AZOTE
®
 polyolefin 
foams allow Zotefoams to command a stronger 
market position closer to our factories, as 
distribution costs are relatively high for these 
types of foams. Distribution costs also act as  
a barrier to imports from other regions. The 
main markets for AZOTE
®
 foams are, therefore, 
the UK, continental Europe and North America.  
Our ZOTEK
®
 foams are more technical, 
command higher selling prices and distribution 
costs are not normally a major factor in 
selling these materials. These businesses are 
more global in nature and we have strong 
management alignment to the product range 
and certain key markets.

Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
How we invest, create and deliver
Fundamental to our business model is our ability 
to invest for the long term in people, products and 
processes. This enables us to create defensible 
technology, a unique portfolio of products and  
a strong market position. Our business can then 
deliver, value for our stakeholders, a sustainable 
margin and accelerated growth.
Invest
People
Our business is reliant on the quality 
of our people. We employ people 
from a broad range of cultures and 
backgrounds. Further information on  
our equal opportunities policies may  
be found in the Directors’ report. We 
invest in our people so they have the 
necessary skills to contribute to the 
success of Zotefoams. 
Products
We engage with our suppliers and 
customers to ensure that the products 
we produce are of a consistently high 
standard and meet our customers’ 
needs. By listening to our customers, 
we gain an understanding of their 
requirements not just for the present, 
but for the future as well. We use this 
information, coupled with our extensive 
knowledge, to research and develop 
products to meet those needs. 
Processes
We invest in our equipment and  
business processes to maintain and 
improve safety standards, improve 
operating efficiencies, increase capacity 
to meet future demands and reduce 
operating costs.
Create
Defensible technology leadership
By investing in technology, often as an 
extension of our existing knowledge, 
we differentiate ourselves from our 
competitors. We view our technology 
leadership as a considerable barrier  
to entry. 
Unique attributes
Our market position is based around the 
uniqueness of our technology. We use 
this technology to create a portfolio of 
products with unique attributes which 
bring advantages to our customers. 
Market position
We are active in many markets, both 
geographical and across industries, 
and are therefore well positioned to 
identify and deliver benefits for users of 
Zotefoams’ technology and products.
Deliver
Stakeholder value
Delivering stakeholder value is core to 
our business. Our technology benefits 
people across the world by delivering 
lightweight, protective, regulatory-
compliant, resource-efficient products, 
which are used in leading-edge solutions 
globally and which are manufactured  
in a safe environment.
Sustainable margin
We charge the right price to our 
customers to give a sustainable margin, 
and continuously strive for efficiency 
improvements to maintain or improve 
margins through the supply chain.
Accelerated growth
Continuing to deliver value on core 
products, augmented by success  
in new and innovative areas.

Our external context
Alignment to three  
global megatrends
We have built a clear long-term strategy  
for growth based around three long-term 
global megatrends that are driving demand 
for our products. 
Understanding these market trends informs our strategy and product 
development, as well as the allocation of our resources. Given the 
diversity of applications for foam it is not possible to track every use for our 
materials, and a new idea or application may come from a foam converter, 
an end-user or from within Zotefoams. We therefore actively monitor these 
and maintain flexibility to react to a wide variety of possibilities. 
Better healthcare has created 
a population boom, especially 
in the older age groups, 
while globally, discretionary 
spending power is rising 
rapidly. Demand for healthcare 
products is accelerating. 
Wealthier and more discerning 
consumers are driving growth 
rates in other industries such 
as food and drink, packaging, 
sports equipment and 
transportation.
Transport, medical, and sport and 
leisure applications account for 
around 39% of sales directly, while 
our T-FIT
®
 insulation products, 
demand for which is currently linked 
to semiconductor, pharmaceutical 
and biotech manufacturing, 
account for a further 4% of sales. 
Regulatory pressures, primarily 
to safeguard consumers, 
are driving up standards 
worldwide. These standards 
in turn create demand for both 
safer products and protective 
equipment.
Zotefoams’ products are used to 
meet some of the most demanding 
fire standards for our type of 
materials. Zotefoams has, for 
example, developed AZOTE
®
 
foams which meet EN 45545,  
the latest EU railway standard  
for fire protection, and ZOTEK
®
  
F fluoropolymer foams meet 
exacting aircraft and insurance 
standards for fire performance.  
We sell AZOTE
®
 grades for 
automotive, medical, and 
packaging designed to minimise 
emissions and/or meet specific 
purity requirements. Over one-
third of Zotefoams’ revenue in 
2017 came from foam products 
with specific properties tested to 
customer requirements, although 
not all of this was demonstrably  
for regulation compliance. 
Saving scarce resources 
has become a universal 
driver. Lightweight is the key 
to reducing fuel usage and 
controlling emissions for 
the aviation and automotive 
industries. High-quality 
insulation conserves  
thermal energy.
MuCell
®
 technology uses less 
material to make everyday items 
as well as saves costs. It also aids 
recycling and makes commonly 
used plastics float in water, thus 
aiding collection of any waste. 
Much of our AZOTE
®
 foam is  
used in permanent packaging  
or packaging that is designed  
to be reused, while foams used 
in transportation, which accounts 
for 21% of sales, are normally 
specified to the lightest weight for 
the required physical performance. 
Zotefoams’ products typically 
use less plastic than competitive 
solutions due to the cell structure 
of foam made in our autoclave 
process, giving us both a cost  
and environmental advantage.

Product and sales development journey
Specific 
Zotefoams’ 
actions linked  
to our strategy 
and megatrends
However, when applications are 
developed it is often possible to 
accelerate adoption across multiple 
customers or platforms. This is 
particularly true of MuCell
®
 technology, 
where our main target market is 
consumer packaging, producing 
millions of units per annum. 
Zotefoams is often positioned 
second or third tier in any supply 
chain and, therefore, the definition  
of markets, potential opportunities  
and risk can be uncertain.
Following a development path  
there is often a long, and sometimes 
expensive, period of business 
development and testing for specific 
applications. A challenge of selling 
unique, technical materials is that 
awareness and understanding  
can be low. 
Our solution to this is to look for 
common attributes across multiple 
opportunities and develop materials 
with those attributes.
Using this approach we have 
developed: ZOTEK
®
 F fluoropolymer 
foams, with excellent insulation and 
fire performance; ZOTEK
®
 PEBA 
foams, to optimise kinetic energy 
management, which have opened 
up opportunities within the footwear 
segment; ZOTEK
®
 N nylon foams, 
which are being evaluated as 
thermoplastic composite cores in 
aviation and automotive as well as 
being used in applications where 
higher temperature stability is needed; 
as well as multiple variants of AZOTE
®
 
polymer foams with application or 
market-specific characteristics. 
Over the years Zotefoams has 
developed a portfolio of material and 
technology considering two principles: 
is there potential for significant 
opportunity; and are there barriers  
to entry, ideally based around our  
core technology?
Change in this industry can be slow 
and developing reference points  
for a specific application can often 
reduce the sales and adoption cycle 
for additional customers. Zotefoams plc Annual Report 2017 14
We measure progress against four strategic objectives:
Our ambition and strategic objectives
Our four-part plan to deliver 
growing returns
Grow
sales in our AZOTE
®
 Polyolefin foams business in excess of twice  
the rate of GDP global growth.
Demand for improved resource efficiency, regulation and global demographics underpins 
our growth potential. In 2017 we grew AZOTE
®
 sales by 18%, with 7% volume growth 
augmented by a stronger product and customer mix, some price increases and a 5% 
increase due to the benefit of favourable foreign exchange rates.
Develop
a HPP portfolio and MEL customer base to deliver enhanced margins.
HPP and MEL offer higher growth rates and the potential for higher margins than  
AZOTE
®
 foams. In 2017 sales in these segments increased by 37% and accounted  
for 25% of Group revenue (£17 .4m), up from 22% of Group revenue in 2016.
Increase
our operating margins, pre exceptional items.
In aggregate, segment margins before central costs increased to 17 .3% from  
16.8%. After central costs, which includes corporate, finance and IT as well  
as foreign exchange losses of £0.32m (2016 loss: £0.03m), which mainly relate  
to the corporate governance of an increasingly complex organisation, Group  
operating margin remained stable at 13.4% (2016: 13.3%).
Improve
our return on capital (over our investment cycle).
In 201 7 the return on capital increased to 15.5% (2016 restated: 14.0%). As Zotefoams’ 
business grows we have made, and further committed to, large capital programmes  
which change the shape of our statement of financial position. In order for return on capital  
to provide meaningful measurement, management has, therefore, altered the definition  
to recognise the changing financial structure of our business, where a) revolving credit 
facilities are treated as long-term debt, and b) major capacity and infrastructure investments, 
such as in Walton, KY , which are expected to require considerable capital over a number 
of years before being commissioned as production assets, are excluded from these 
calculations until the point of commissioning. If the US investment expansion is included,  
the return on capital increased to 12.07% from 1 1.94%.

Truly disruptive businesses 
Our MEL and T-FIT
®
 insulation businesses 
have significantly lower capital costs than 
the block foams business. However, these 
businesses are truly disruptive and, therefore, 
the development cycle for sufficient scale for 
profitability can be long. Both businesses are 
based on proprietary IP and our assessment  
is that the T-FIT
®
 business could be set for  
a step-change in size over the medium term, 
while the value from MEL will come from a 
combination of rolling out the existing business 
model and IP enhancement over a similar  
time scale.
As well as investment in capacity and product 
development we are developing the talent pool 
and culture to support a larger organisation. 
This is covered in “Our people” on page 30  
of this Strategic Report.
Matching market trends 
Our products are designed to match market 
trends. Continued organic growth comes 
from the creation of a portfolio of opportunities 
based on these trends and products, followed 
by successful conversion into sales. We have 
good products and a strong portfolio  
of opportunities. Our assessment of the 
potential conversion outcomes is such that  
we have already committed to significant 
capacity increases and we see the potential  
for further growth beyond this in the medium 
term. However, as with any portfolio, it is 
difficult to judge exactly which outcomes 
will occur and, therefore, we consider the 
possibilities, probabilities, risks and rewards  
on a frequent basis.
Developing barriers to entry
We recognise that capacity investment 
takes a long time to execute and Zotefoams’ 
autoclave manufacturing process is capital 
intensive. Both these factors, as well as the 
particular know-how, market position and, in 
some cases, patents, provide barriers to entry 
in our block foams business. We therefore 
continue to monitor our medium-term capacity 
utilisation, based on anticipated and known 
opportunities in our chosen markets, to  
assess the optimal timing for further investment 
commitments to support our medium- 
term growth. 
Capacity investment 
Central to the long-term success of our organic  
growth strategy is maintenance of a strong 
portfolio of opportunities and investment in 
capacity to support planned growth. Over 
the past three years we have developed our 
existing site in Walton, KY, USA with buildings, 
infrastructure, a large, high-pressure autoclave 
and extrusion capability. Manufacturing is 
being transferred from the UK to the USA, 
freeing capacity in our UK site. Recently we 
have announced a further tranche of expansion 
in Walton, which will double its capacity in 
these processes. Furthermore, if needed,  
we have space for further expansion. In the  
UK, we have approved investment in 
low-pressure autoclave capacity for foam 
expansion. This foaming capacity will be fed 
from assets currently used to manufacture 
materials for the North American market. In 
total, we have committed to increasing our 
capacity by approximately 45% over 2017 
production run rates. Zotefoams plc Annual Report 2017 16
Producing best-in-class 
solutions
AZOTE
®
 foams have been selected by an Italian 
defence contractor for use in a series of ultra-hi-tech 
unmanned crafts. The rigorous operating conditions 
mandate that the sophisticated internal components 
need to be protected and, therefore, our lightweight 
AZOTE
®
 LD24FR foam, which exceeds both UL and 
FAA standards, was selected to insulate components, 
fill gaps, and dampen vibration. It is vital these aviation 
regulatory standards are met to ensure safety and 
performance. 
The chosen AZOTE
®
 material is considered to 
represent the best-in-class solution for the desired 
range of characteristics, with its exceptional thermal 
conductivity values helping to ensure a steady 
environment for sensitive components, in desert  
heats to sub-zero temperatures, as well as at altitudes 
of 20,000-30,000 feet, for extended periods. 
AZOTE
®
 foams have a closed-cell structure, ideal to 
minimise moisture retention and condensation, and 
have been tested to withstand the effects of contraction 
and expansion, UV, and atmospheric conditioning. 
The chosen materials deliver industry-leading fire 
resistance, lightweight and consistent quality, all  
made possible using Zotefoams’ nitrogen-based 
autoclave technology.
This new application complements an already strong 
portfolio of classic and speciality foams for both 
aerospace and military sectors.
Our brand performance 
We offer what our 
customers want
AZOTE

polyolefin foams
AZOTE
®
 polyolefin foams are manufactured 
using our unique, high-pressure, nitrogen 
gas process. This physical expansion 
process differentiates Zotefoams from 
competitors manufacturing similar foams 
with low-density polyethylene (‘LDPE’),  
which is our main raw material. 
Zotefoams produces foams that are more 
consistent, lighter weight and possess  
higher purity compared to foams 
manufactured using chemical technology. 
These superior attributes are valued globally 
in many uses with examples as diverse as 
aerospace, sports equipment and medical 
packaging. Underlying growth of many of 
these segments is driven by global trends 
in demographics, regulation and the 
environment, including resource efficiency.
The main geographical markets for our 
AZOTE
®
 foams are the UK, other European 
countries and North America as, beyond 
this, distribution costs limit the market 
opportunity. We do sell outside these 
areas, mainly in Japan and China, into more 
niche, technical applications and further 
development of these geographies remains 
a longer-term goal. Zotefoams plc Annual Report 2017 17

Making the future of  
electric cars a reality
The automotive industry is embracing electric cars. 
Automobile manufacturers have ambitious plans to 
produce more than a hundred new electric and battery 
powered models in the next couple of years. Future 
models are expected to develop rapidly to help tackle 
environmental challenges and enable more sustainable 
use of resources. 
Lightweight components, such as foams, address 
one of the key limitations of electric vehicles: they 
help reduce the weight of the vehicle, making it more 
efficient and thus extending the range the vehicle is 
able to travel on a single journey.
Electric car models need to meet the automotive 
regulatory standards worldwide, as there is now a 
higher demand for both safer products and equipment 
use across the automotive industry. One of the 
major challenges in meeting these standards is 
specific to the battery and supporting materials. The 
materials that encase the battery must stand up to 
demanding environmental, mechanical, and chemical 
requirements, while emphasising safety and weight 
reduction. Within the Zotefoams product range we have 
materials which can meet the industry requirements of 
temperature, impact resistance and the flame-retardant 
standards UL 94 V-0, HF1. 
ZOTEK
®
 N nylon foams can withstand the higher 
operating temperatures generated from conventional 
engine and battery packs, which are typically used 
on hybrid vehicles. AZOTE
®
 materials have been used 
by automotive OEMs for their thermal insulation and 
vibration-dampening capabilities. Both types of  
material are lightweight and moisture resistant,  
ideal for demanding automotive applications. 
ZOTEK
® 
foams
ZOTEK
®
 products use Zotefoams’ unique 
autoclave technology applied to high-end 
polymers such as PVDF fluoropolymer, 
nylon or polyether block amide (‘PEBA’). 
Combining the original polymer properties 
with our foaming process creates truly 
unique materials. 
ZOTEK
®
 F fluoropolymer foams, which 
account for around half of HPP sales, are 
inherently fire and chemical resistant and 
are mainly used in aerospace applications. 
ZOTEK
®
 N nylon foams are designed 
to operate at very high temperatures 
and are finding uses in a wide variety of 
mainly industrial applications. There is a 
considerable level of interest currently in 
ZOTEK
®
 N as a lightweight thermoplastic 
composite material for transportation, 
designed to reduce weight and meet 
environmental targets for fuel economy. 
ZOTEK
®
 PEBA foams, which were the fastest 
growing product in HPP for the second 
year in a row, have excellent kinetic-energy 
management properties and are being sold 
primarily in sport and leisure applications. 
Historically, sales of ZOTEK
®
 foams have 
grown due to more stringent regulation  
in the aviation markets, while recent growth  
is being led by the changing demographics 
of the footwear market.  Zotefoams plc Annual Report 2017 18
Our brand performance Continued
Complying to unprecedented 
levels of aseptic, microscopic, 
pollutant-free, assembly
Global regulation and the ever-increasing requirement 
for the minimisation of risk is driving manufacturers to 
produce safer and purer products. The challenge faced 
by the vaccine, insulin, silicon chip and monoclonal 
antibodies (mAbs) manufacturers is to create 
production areas that comply to unprecedented levels 
of aseptic and microscopic pollutant-free assembly. 
This challenge has never been more acute and is 
where Zotefoams’ T-FIT
®
 Clean product has distinct 
advantages over competitors.
T-FIT
®
 Clean is a unique thermal insulation system, 
purpose designed for demanding, highly-controlled 
production environments, and has been adopted by 
market leading biotechnology and pharmaceutical 
companies. In 2017 it was utilised by major multi-
nationals worldwide, most notably by Bristol-Myers 
Squib (BMS) at their new US$1B Biologics facility in 
Cruiserath Ireland, where BMS will be manufacturing 
their range of immuno-oncology medicines, entrusting 
the security of their extensive cleanroom network to 
Zotefoams by choosing T-FIT
®
 Clean as their primary 
cleanroom insulation product.
T-FIT
® 
advanced 
insulation
The T-FIT
®
 insulation story began with 
end-users looking for a solution to insulate 
pipes in pharmaceutical and biotechnology 
cleanrooms. T-FIT
®
 Clean was developed as 
a unique thermal insulation system designed 
for these demanding, highly controlled 
production environments.
Based on the unique technology owned 
by Zotefoams and following the success 
of T-FIT

Driving benefits throughout 
production and distribution
MEL ’s value proposition is to bring significant material 
savings and cost benefits into plastic production 
lines through its patented MuCell® microcellular 
foaming technology. The innovative technology 
operates by injecting high-pressure gas into the 
different products. An example currently in use is at 
Plastilene, an established producer of flexible films 
and thermoformed packaging with five manufacturing 
plants in South America. MEL has worked with 
them since 2014, initially to understand the impact 
and implications of the MuCell
®
 technology, before 
integrating it into Plastilene’s production lines in 
Colombia and Guatemala.
Today, Plastilene is a leader in microcellular foaming 
technology in Latin America, with four units producing 
film for many market applications. The MuCell
®
 
technology is in production for coextruded laminated 
structures for flexible packaging films for sectors like 
grains, pellets, food in general, industrial packaging 
and agricultural applications, as well as rigid sheets 
for the thermoforming of food trays. In development 
are applications to capitalise on trends driven by 
demographic shifts, including food, dairy and cosmetic 
packaging and agricultural films.
Saving limited resources has become a global driver. 
By using MuCell
®
’s technology, the process delivers 
Plastilene a reduction of 15% in raw materials at a 
minimum, while still maintaining the thickness and 
mechanical properties for their multiple uses. An 
additional cost benefit to the technology is the reduced 
weight, which allows the production machinery to  
run faster, increasing its output in volume of product  
by 15-20%. Reduced raw material usage results in  
a reduction in unit weight, which usually brings cost  
and environmental benefits throughout production  
and distribution.

MEL licenses microcellular foam technology 
and sells related machinery. MEL ’s business 
model is to develop and license IP and share 
in the savings or benefits of the licensee 
through a royalty and/or licence fee 
MEL technology offers the potential to 
reduce the plastic content of an article by 
around 15%, by injecting inert gas to displace 
plastic with microcellular bubbles. MEL 
technology can be used with most common 
plastics and reduces material consumption 
with no negative impact on recycling. The 
primary target market for MEL is consumer 
packaging, where production volumes are 
large and developments are scalable across 
geographic and product markets.
MEL continues to evolve its product offering 
and intellectual property (IP). As the business 
begins to achieve commercial scale our staff 
becomes more specialist and our knowledge 
deepens. MEL staff integrates with the 
customers in product design, to make the 
best use of our technological capability, 
and with this depth of knowledge comes 
improved customer satisfaction and also 
more opportunity for further IP .
In the future we expect to see most growth 
coming from the existing and new customer 
base for packaging, especially flat sheet such 
as that used in the manufacture of yoghurt 
pots and ready meal containers. However, 
MEL is also active outside of packaging,  
with developments for aviation, thin films  
for bags and agricultural films as well as  
pipes and tubes. Zotefoams plc Annual Report 2017 20
Group CFO’s review 
Facilitating organic growth
Overview
Zotefoams has delivered a strong year of progress  
in 2017 . Growth rates in excess of 20% were  
achieved in both sales and operating profit before 
exceptional items. 
Group revenue was up 22% to a record £70. 15m, with 
strong sales performance across all business units. In 
constant currency, underlying net sales increased 17%. 
Operating profit before exceptional item was up 23%  
(up 10% after exceptional item), as the Group grew 
strongly in its European Polyolefin business and 
developed a more broadly based HPP business, whilst 
continuing with its investments in operating infrastructure 
as the Group pursues its expansion strategy. In constant 
currency, underlying operating profit before exceptional 
item was up 18%. During the year, following legal advice 
received by the pension trustees and a calculation  
by the actuaries, the Company provided £1.24m  
for potential additional liabilities in its Defined Benefit 
Pension Scheme (the “DB Scheme”), related to  
closure of the scheme in 2005.
Capital investment, to increase capacity for organic 
growth opportunities, was again high, falling just short 
of the record high of 2016. Zotefoams’ products are 
created in a unique, capital intensive manufacturing 
process and the Group’s three-year, $33m investment 
in Kentucky, USA adds at least 20% to global capacity. 
This capital investment, together with expansion-
related working capital growth, has increased net debt 
by £5.4m to £18.0m in 2017 , supported by an increase 
in facilities of £9.5m from the Group’s existing banking 
partnerships. With the Group’s high cash generation, 
gearing remained well within banking covenants at 
1.5 times. Driven by its exciting growth opportunities 
and strong margins, Zotefoams intends to continue 
to invest in necessary capacity whilst maintaining a 
strong financial position with manageable debt levels. 
Reflecting this, the Group recently announced an 
investment in HPP capacity in the UK as well as the 
commissioning of its second high-pressure autoclave 
in the USA. To support these investments, it secured a 
further £10m of financing in early March 2018.
Group revenue
Group revenue for the year increased 22% to £70.15m 
(2016: £57 .38m). Volume growth, at 7%, (2016: 4%) 
was significant and took the Group close to capacity 
throughout the year. The switch in approach from 
a distribution model to direct engagement with 
customers in Germany was the major contributor to 
26% sales growth in the European polyolefin foams 
business and a full year of Zotefoams Midwest 
LLChelped increase sales by 15% in the USA Polyolefin 
business. HPP sales were up 32%, with footwear and 
technical insulation leading the way. MEL recorded  
an increase of 56% in sales, driven by the shipment of  
a full extrusion line to a customer in Japan, representing 
MEL ’s largest individual equipment order and  
providing further evidence of market confidence  
in the technology and its prospects.
Gross margin
Gross margin progressed to 36.3% (2016 restated: 
35.4%). The restatement of 2016 gross margin arose 
following the reclassification of £0.2m of distribution 
costs to reflect more appropriately the manufacturing 
activities at MEL. Polyolefin price increases, sales 
mix, some foreign currency benefits and operations 
efficiencies pushed margins up. Energy cost increases, 
together with, for the most part, non-recurring inventory 
adjustments in HPP and MEL, held back some of this 
margin gain. 
Distribution and administrative costs
The Group continues to pursue its expansion strategy, 
founded on proprietary cellular-materials technology 
with an increasing portfolio of differentiated products. 
Organic growth with unique and highly differentiated 
products requires the Group to invest actively in, and 
reprioritise where needed, technical, sales-focused 
and administration resources to create, execute and 
manage this growth. Included within distribution and 
administrative expenses in the Group’s consolidated 
income statement are sales and marketing, technical 
development, finance, information systems and 
administration costs as well as the impact of foreign 
exchange hedges maturing in the period and non-cash 
foreign exchange translation expenses. These costs 
increased by 27% to £16.11m in 2017 (2016 restated: 
£12.69m). The Group expects this investment to 
continue, not least with the commissioning of its US 
investment in February 2018. These costs also include 
a net loss from foreign exchange hedging contracts 
and foreign exchange translation of £0.32m (2016 net 
loss: £0.03m).
The business unit results are shown on pages 8-9 
in this Strategic Report. They do not include central 
plc costs, which are not considered to be segment 
specific. In 2017 central plc costs were £2.40m (2016: 
£1.94m), including the full year impact of an increase in 
the executive management team.
Finance costs
The total interest charge for the year was £0.51m (2016: 
£0.39m) and includes £0.19m (2016: £0.19m) of interest 
on the Company’s defined benefit pension obligation. 
Profit before tax
Profit before tax and exceptional item increased 
by 22% to £8.81m (2016: £7 .23m). Profit before tax 
increased by 8% to £7 .55m (2016: £6.99m).
The Group is actively investing in, and 
reprioritising where needed, technical, 
sales-focused and administration 
resources to create, execute and 
manage this growth.

Exceptional item
During the year, following legal advice received by the 
pension trustees and a calculation by the actuaries, 
the Company provided £1.27m for potential additional 
liabilities in its Defined Benefit Pension Scheme (the 
“DB Scheme”). This is based on the legal opinion that, 
while the DB Scheme was properly closed to future 
accrual of service in 2005, the linkage with future 
increases in salary had not been broken. The Company 
is now taking steps to break this link, and £0.03m of 
the exceptional item relates to this action. 
Currency review
Zotefoams is a predominantly UK-based exporter. In 
2017 approximately 82% of sales were denominated 
in US dollars and euros. Most costs are incurred in 
sterling, other than the main raw materials for polyolefin 
foams, which are euro-denominated, and subsidiaries 
staff, operational costs and some HPP raw materials, 
which are US dollar-denominated. Movements in 
foreign exchange rates can have a significant impact 
on results. The Group therefore uses forward exchange 
rates to hedge its foreign currency transaction risk. 
Zotefoams’ policy is to use forward currency contracts 
to cover approximately two-thirds of the estimated net 
cash foreign exchange exposure for the euro for the 
next nine months and approximately two-thirds of the 
estimated income statement exposure for the US dollar 
for the next twelve months. The Group does not hedge 
for the translation of its foreign subsidiaries assets or 
liabilities. This policy is kept under frequent review and 
formally approved by the Board on an annual basis.
During the year the Group generated a net gain on 
forward contracts of £0.19m (2016 loss: £2.01m.) 
This was offset by a translation loss, primarily on the 
Company’s US dollar receivables, of £0.51m (2016 
gain: £1.98m). 
It is estimated that, for every one percent move in 
the USD/£ rate, profit moves by £0.06m hedged and 
£0.17m unhedged. In the year it is assumed that the 
euro is naturally hedged, with sales revenues offset by 
costs, primarily related to raw material purchases and 
certain further processing costs. With future growth 
coming mainly from outside the UK and a pricing 
approach predominantly based on local currency, 
the Group’s gross exposure to currency is expected 
to increase. The investment in US capacity, which 
increases the local manufacturing cost base, helps to 
mitigate some of this exposure, and future capital and 
financing decisions will also consider this risk. 
Tax and earnings per share 
The effective tax rate for the year is 20.40%, which is 
higher than the UK corporate tax rate for the year of 
19.25%. This is mainly due to the change in expected 
future US corporate tax rates from 35% to 21%, which 
has reduced the tax values of recognised US tax 
losses carried forward and other deductible temporary 
differences. This is partly offset by the change in the 
expected UK corporate tax rate from 19% to 17%, 
which has reduced the tax value of UK deferred tax 
assets and liabilities. The Group’s effective tax rate 
would be 19.93% without these changes. Taxation  
paid during the year was £0.94m (2016: £1.00m). 
Basic earnings per share before exceptional item 
was 16.04p (2016: 13.69p), an increase of 17%. Basic 
earnings per share was 13.70p (2016: 13.25), an 
increase of 3%. 
Dividend
The Directors are proposing a final dividend of 4.02p 
(2016: 3.90p), which would be payable on 24 May 2018 
to shareholders on the Company register at the close 
of business on 20 April 2018. Taken with the interim 
dividend of 1.91p (2016: 1.85p) this would bring the total 
dividend for the year to 5.93p per ordinary share (2016: 
5.75p), an increase of 3.1%, in line with the Group’s 
targeted policy of paying a progressive dividend. It 
would also represent a dividend cover of 2.3 times 
(2016: 2.2 times).
Investments
Zotefoams’ strategy is focused primarily on organic 
growth. Over the last three years Zotefoams has 
invested £32.4m in property, plant and equipment, the 
majority of which has been to increase capacity in its 
unique technology. In December 2017 and March 2018 
Zotefoams announced further capacity investments, 
which amount to approximately £20m over the next 
12-18 months and are in excess of the normal level 
of capital investment required in our organisation. 
Given the capital intensive nature of the Zotefoams 
business, long lead-times for key equipment and 
the importance of operational gearing, investment 
decisions require significant planning and are made 
with a clear assessment of strategic fit, risk and risk 
appetite. Confidence in the Group’s developing portfolio 
of HPP opportunities is a significant consideration in 
determining the timing of certain investments, while 
the strategic importance of maintaining growth in the 
profitable AZOTE
®
 business, the Group’s largest volume 
product range, informs the decision to increase total 
Group capacity versus rely solely on mix enrichment. 
Investment decisions target improvements in the 
Group’s return on capital over the investment cycle, 
while recognising the short-term impact on this return 
during construction and operating initially at lower 
utilisation levels. Zotefoams defines its return on 
capital as operating profit before exceptional items 
divided by the average sum of its equity, net debt and 
other non-current liabilities. This measure excludes 
acquired intangible assets and their amortisation 
costs. Zotefoams also excludes significant capacity 
investments under construction until they enter 
production. In 2017 the return on capital increased to 
15.5% (2016 restated: 14.0%). If the significant capacity 
investments were included, the return on capital 
increased to 12.07% from 11.94%. 
In previous years the Group has defined its return 
on capital as profit before tax excluding exceptional 
items, divided by average net assets, with goodwill, 
acquired intangible assets and associated amortisation 
excluded from the calculation. As Zotefoams’ business 
grows it has made, and further committed to, large 
capital programmes which change the shape of the 
statement of financial position. As the Group takes on 
debt to support its growth plans the revised definition 
is considered more appropriate to measure capital 
employed. Zotefoams plc Annual Report 2017 22
The Board performs post investment appraisals within 
an appropriate timeframe following start up. 
Cash flow and funding
Net cash inflow from operations for the year increased 
to £9.98m (2016: £6.36m), resulting from an increase in 
operating profit, before working capital and provisions, 
of £2.03m and an improvement in working capital 
outflow by £1.52m to £2.70m (2016: £4.22m), following 
improved collection of receivables and the timing of 
key supplier payments. This working capital movement 
includes an increase in inventory of £2.80m (2016: 
£2.12m), mostly related to growth in the higher-value 
HPP products.
Zotefoams continued to invest significantly in its 
property, plant and equipment during the year, with 
a net cash outflow of £11.39m in 2017 following a 
cash outflow of £12.14m in 2016. The Group’s largest 
project has been the extension of its existing facility 
in Kentucky, USA, to deliver at least 20% additional 
capacity for block foams. During 2017 the Group 
invested £7 .04m (2016: £6.90m) in the US expansion 
project, bringing the total investment at 31 December 
2017 to £22.00m. It also continued to invest in its 
Croydon, UK facility, increasing capacity, capability  
and continuing to ensure a safe working environment. 
After dividends paid in the year amounting to £2.55m 
(2016: £2.47m), closing net debt was £17 .96m (2016: 
£12.56m). In March 2017 , Zotefoams extended the 
Multi-Currency Revolving Credit Facility with Barclays 
Bank from £8m to £10m, with all terms and conditions 
remaining the same. In August 2017 , it secured further 
funding by way of a five-year, Croydon plant and 
machinery-backed, £7 .5m variable rate loan facility  
with Lombard North Central, with whom the Group  
has a longstanding relationship. 
Subsequent to the reporting period, in March 2018, the 
Group secured a further funding facility from Barclays 
Bank plc in the form of a £10m, 18-month term loan. 
This will allow the Group to proceed with its capital 
expenditure strategy, including the installation  
of the second high-pressure vessel in Kentucky, USA.
At the year end the Group remains comfortably within 
its covenants, with interest cover of 29 (2016: 37), 
versus a covenant minimum of 4 and net borrowings  
to EBITDA of 1.4 (2016: 1.2), against a maximum of 2.5. 
Pensions
In 2001 the Company closed the DB Scheme to new 
members. In 2005 the DB Scheme was closed to 
future accrual of benefits and all active members at 
that time transferred to a defined contribution scheme, 
substantially de-risking the Company’s financial and 
accounting exposure to the DB Scheme’s obligations. 
In common with many companies at the time, the 
Company took advice on the closure process. 
Following recent legal cases challenging the validity 
of previous benefit scheme closures, the Company 
recommended that the Trustees take further legal 
advice regarding the closure of the DB Scheme in 
2005. The outcome of this advice to the Trustees 
indicates that the DB Scheme was properly closed 
to future accrual of service, however the linkage with 
future increases in salary had not been broken. As  
the sponsoring employer, the Company may, therefore, 
have an additional liability for pension costs. The 
Company is taking its own legal advice, but feels it  
is appropriate at this stage to provide for the possible 
increase in liability.
The DB Scheme’s actuaries estimate an additional 
potential liability of £1.24m. The Directors are in the 
process of considering options available to mitigate this 
potential liability and seek redress where appropriate. 
The exceptional charge represents 4% of the DB 
Scheme obligation as at 31 December 2017 and 
would represent an increase in cash outflows over 
the remaining average service lives of the affected 
employees. This is not considered by the Directors 
to have a material impact on the Group’s financial 
condition or future prospects. 
A full actuarial valuation of the DB Scheme is scheduled 
as at 5 April 2017 , in line with the requirement to have  
a triennial valuation. As at the date of this report, the 
final outcome is still pending. The previous triennial 
actuarial valuation, on a Statutory Funding Objective 
basis, calculated a deficit for the Pension Scheme  
of £2.50m. As a result, the Company agreed with the 
Trustees to make contributions to the DB Scheme  
of £41,000 per month until April 2020 to eliminate this 
deficit. In addition, the Company pays the ongoing  
DB Scheme expenses of £10,600 per month. 
The net IAS19 deficit on the Company’s Defined Benefit 
Pension Scheme (the “Scheme”) decreased by £1.27m 
to £6.17m as at December 2017 (2016: £7 .44m).  
The main factors contributing to the improvement are 
the actual investment return achieved on the assets 
being higher than that required to match the expected 
increase in defined benefit obligation over the year, and 
the contributions paid during the year by the Company 
towards reducing the deficit. 
Going concern
The Group’s business activities, together with 
the factors likely to affect its future development, 
performance and position are set out in the Strategic 
Report on pages 7 to 19 and the section entitled ‘Risk 
management and principal risks’ on pages 23 to 29. 
This also describes the financial position of the Group, 
its cash flows and liquidity position. In addition, note 
21 to the financial statements includes the Group’s 
objectives, policies and processes for managing its 
capital, its financial risk management objectives, details 
of its financial instruments and hedging activities, 
borrowing facilities, and its exposure to credit risk  
and liquidity risk. 
The Directors believe that the Group is well placed to 
manage its business risks and, after making enquiries 
including a review of forecasts, budgets and banking 
facilities, have a reasonable expectation that the Group 
has adequate resources to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future. Accordingly,  
they continue to adopt the going concern basis  
of accounting in preparing the Annual Report.
Financial risk management
The main financial risks of the Group relate to funding 
and liquidity, credit, interest rate fluctuations and 
currency exposures. The management of these risks  
is documented in note 21.

Risk management framework
Risk appetite
Zotefoams has financial targets in place and is  
focused on growing the business. It is willing to  
accept higher levels of risk where it deems the 
likelihood of success to be achievable and the level  
of reward commensurate, but within clear boundaries 
as recommended by the Executive team and approved 
by the Board. As a manufacturing company the health  
and safety of our employees is paramount and we  
have an extremely low tolerance for risk in this area. 
Developments during the year 
  During the year Zotefoams began working on 
improvements to its risk management processes as 
well as the tools and guidelines to achieve this goal. 
At the end of the year it began training the leaders 
of its functional control committees on risk map 
generation in line with these processes. The new 
framework and processes have gone live from the 
beginning of 2018. 
  Zotefoams also held risk brainstorming workshops at 
the Executive team and Senior Management levels to 
review and enhance its risk understanding, which it 
presented to the Board, and which provide a further 
source of review for its Group principal risks and 
uncertainties map. 
  The Board and Executive team were heavily involved 
in risk assessment of the Group’s three-year strategic 
plan, as well as risk management associated with 
execution of these plans, including significant capital 
investments and people, culture and control system 
developments. 
  Each year, the Group reviews its key policies, such 
as anti-bribery and corruption, competition, ethics, 
whistleblowing and share dealing, to make sure they 
remain relevant and operate effectively. The Group 
recently introduced a new policy on preventing 
facilitation of tax evasion to comply with the Criminal 
Finances Act 2017 . It also began preparations for  
the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)  
and expects to be prepared in time for the May  
2018 implementation.
  During 2017 Zotefoams transitioned to the new 
version of the international standard for Quality, 
ISO9001:2015. This was certified in the last audit  
in December 2017 by the British Standards Institute. 
The new emphasis within the standard is the 
management of risks and opportunities, determining 
the context in which Zotefoams operates and leads. 
Several key customers audit Zotefoams regularly  
and there were no significant non-conformities raised 
in 2017 . Other bodies conduct product audits at 
Zotefoams and, following such audits in 2017 , all

  The Group uses an external advisor to perform 
its financial internal audit services. During the 
year an audit, based on the Group’s internal risk 
assessments, was performed by Grant Thornton,  
the Group’s internal auditor, on inventory 
management at its Croydon site, with outcomes 
presented to the Audit Committee.  Zotefoams plc Annual Report 2017 24
Risk management and principal risks Continued
Principal risks and uncertainties
We have identified 12 principal risks and uncertainties 
under nine key headings: operational, people, 
technology, supply chain, global market environment, 
financing, foreign exchange, commercial and pension. 
A principal risk is one that has the potential to affect 
significantly our strategic objectives, financial position 
or future performance. It includes both internal and 
external factors. Zotefoams monitors movements in 
likelihood and impact such that risks are appropriately 
mitigated, to the extent possible, in line with the 
Group’s risk appetite.
The risk profile in 2017 includes three added and one 
removed risk. With the Group’s investment in HP1 and 
infrastructure at its Kentucky, USA plant now complete 
and commercial product in the market, the level of 
this risk has been assessed to fall below the tier one 
materiality level for reporting and has therefore been 
removed. While the initial investment in Kentucky has 
increased capacity, the need to add further capacity  
at the right time and in the right place has been defined 
as a new risk, one which is becoming increasingly 
significant as Zotefoams pursues its growth 
expectations and one reflected by the commencement 
of investments in low-pressure capacity in Croydon, 
UK, and in the commissioning of the second high-
pressure autoclave (HP2) in Kentucky, USA. The Group 
has benefited greatly from the experiences of its recent 
US capital investment programme, and improved 
capacity planning processes tied with increasing 
optimism in HPP growth rates have raised the risk 
profile of capacity as a result. The second risk added, 
also related to its pursuit of growth, is the impact 
on span of control as the Group further expands 
operations overseas. Ensuring it has effective systems, 
communication methods, recruiting and training will  
be important mitigating factors. Finally, the risk of cyber 
attacks has been added, with high-profile examples 
during the year elevating the Group’s assessment of 
this risk and the importance of remaining vigilant and 
constantly considering the strength of its protective 
measures. 
Viability statement 
In accordance with provision C2.2 of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code, the Directors have assessed the 
prospects of the Group over a five-year period to 
December 2022. This is firstly based on the period 
covered by the Group’s Board-approved strategic 
plan of three years. However, this period has, this 
year, been augmented, reviewed and approved by the 
Board, by two further years as it became apparent that 
a longer period is more appropriate given the capital 
investment profile needed to support the Group’s 
anticipated rate of growth. The strategic plan, which is 
updated annually, includes analysis of growth and profit 
performance by business segment, impact and timing 
of new business opportunities and Group-level cash 
flow requirements, including investment programmes 
and returns to shareholders. Going forward, the 
strategic plan will cover a five-year period.
The Directors consider the timeline of five years to 
be appropriate, being the period upon which the 
Group actively focuses, and has reasonable visibility 
over, its opportunity portfolio and given the inherent 
uncertainties in considering the consequences of  
this portfolio over a longer period than five years. 
In making their assessment, the Directors have 
taken account of the Group’s market positioning and 
alignment with global trends, its financial position and 
its level of cash generation. They have also undertaken 
a sensitivity analysis over the key trading assumptions 
and considered the potential financial and operational 
impacts of the principal risks and uncertainties set out 
on pages 25 to 29. 
On the basis of this and other matters considered and 
reviewed by the Directors during the year, the Directors 
have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be 
able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as 
they fall due over the five-year period.  Zotefoams plc Annual Report 2017 25

Risk
As the majority of the Group’s operations are on one 
site, a significant operational disruption or Safety, 
Health and Environmental (‘SHE’) incident could 
impact the Group’s ability to manufacture and supply 
products. This could have sizeable financial and 
commercial consequences including, in certain defined 
circumstances, customer claims. It could also lead to 
reputational damage.
Mitigating actions
The Group has extensive SHE policies and procedures 
in place, which are in line with best practice. In the 
UK the Company is certified to accredited standards 
OHSAS 18001 on Health and Safety and ISO 
14001, the International Standard for Environment 
Management Systems. Regular training is provided  
on SHE matters to the staff.
Pressure equipment used is operated under the 
Pressure Systems Safety Regulations 2000 and is 
subject to systematic internal, and frequent external, 
inspections in accordance with the Safety Assessment 
Federation.
The Group has extensive fire prevention systems  
in place.
The Group has appropriate contingency plans in  
place in the event of the failure of certain major pieces 
of equipment.
Reporting of incidents, including ‘near misses’ and 
damage to plant or equipment not resulting in personal 
injury, is mandatory in order to track issues and to 
prevent reoccurrences.
Insurance is in place to cover capital restatement and 
loss of profits in the event of operational disruption 
caused by certain events. 
The Group has invested in its Kentucky, USA site, 
which provides multi-site capability, subject to capacity, 
on many polyolefin products. With experience, it will 
also become possible to manufacture some of the 
more challenging higher performance foams.
Controls 
  Regular internal and external audits and inspections 
are undertaken on the Group’s operations, policies 
and procedures.
  Reports are made to the Board, on a quarterly basis, 
on SHE issues.
  The Group has various committees in place that 
monitor and review the risks.

Risk
The business’s unique technology is highly capital 
intensive, with long lead times and complex equipment 
and engineering requirements. As customer demand 
grows, the ability to grow capacity requires effective 
and timely planning, sufficient resource and financing, 
and excellent execution. 
Mitigating actions 
The experiences gained through the recent investment 
in the Kentucky, USA site have provided a significant 
increase in know-how, spread across more personnel, 
which reduces uncertainty of future execution. 
Expected growth in HPP products is driving 
accelerated investment decisions.
Controls 
  The Group holds regular capacity planning reviews  
at Board and operational level. 
  The Board meets bi-annually to review its three-year 
plan, moving to a five-year plan in 2018, and consider 
capacity needs in light of medium-term growth 
expectations.

The failure to attract, develop or retain the right calibre 
of staff will impact the Group’s ability to deliver growing 
opportunities by product and geographic reach.
The impact of Brexit might impact the Group’s ability  
to retain mainland EU nationals.
Mitigating actions 
The Group continuously reviews its skill needs and 
labour requirements. The Group aims to provide its 
employees with varied and interesting work and to 
incentivise them appropriately.
The Group has a Global Talent Manager, whose remit  
is to ensure senior and emerging talent is appropriate 
for the Group’s current and future needs.
The Group is following the developments of the 
UK’s EU exit negotiations closely and addressing its

Risk
The Group’s processes for the manufacture of its 
products are substantially unique to the Group. 
Whilst the principles behind the processes are not 
confidential, the precise know-how is. A competitor 
could match or improve upon the properties and 
economics of the Group’s products.
Key to the success of the business of MuCell Extrusion 
LLC (‘MEL ’) is the strength of its intellectual property 
and, on the back of that, its ability to grant commercial 
licences. The risks to MEL are that its intellectual 
property becomes dated or its patents expire or  
are successfully challenged.
Mitigating actions 
There are high barriers of entry to the manufacturing  
of the Group’s foams. Significant capital investment 
and know-how would be required to invest in 
autoclaves and related infrastructure.
The Group actively maintains its intellectual property. 
It patents its technology wherever it believes it is 
appropriate to do so. Where technology is not subject 
to patent, patents are no longer applicable or the 
technology is incapable of being patented, the Group 
guards its know-how.
The Group reduces its technology risk by entering into 
new markets. For example, the development of High-
Performance Products (‘HPP’) and MEL, where the 
product offerings are unique and protected by patents 
and/or process know-how and capability, opens up 
new markets for the Group with potential significant 
and lasting differential advantages.
MEL actively maintains and updates its intellectual 
property portfolio. This is done by undertaking research 
and development to add new patents to the portfolio, 
further developing its know-how and obtaining licences 
of key third-party patents, which are complementary  
to the existing portfolio.
A MEL licence typically includes a bundle of patents 
and know-how and, therefore, is not completely 
dependent on any particular patent.
Controls 
  The Group keeps a watching brief on competitor 
activity and maintains close contact with its 
customers and end-users of its products to 
understand market activity.
  All MEL ’s licences are reviewed by senior personnel 
to ensure terms are appropriate. The intellectual 
property portfolio is managed by MEL ’s Executive 
Committee.

Risk
The Group has significant exposure to foreign 
exchange fluctuations. This is both transactional and 
on the translation of foreign currency balances and the 
consolidation of its foreign subsidiaries.
Despite recent investments overseas, the Group’s 
operations are substantially based in the UK and, 
therefore, most of its manufacturing assets and costs 
are sterling denominated.
The Group’s customers are normally invoiced in their 
local currencies. In 2017 , approximately 80% of the 
Group’s revenue was in currencies other than sterling. 
The Group, therefore, generates surpluses in US dollars 
and euros, which are converted into sterling.
Mitigating actions 
The Group reduces its foreign exposure for 
transactional items by making its purchases either 
in euros or US dollars. For example, there are US 
dollar costs associated with the Group’s operations in 
Kentucky USA and with MEL. In addition, the majority 
of the Group’s raw materials are purchased in euros.
The Group recently completed its significant capital 
investment in North America, which will reduce 
exposure for transactional items on the US dollar by 
increasing the cost base in the USA. Raw materials are 
now purchased locally and a larger workforce supports 
full process production.
The Group has a hedging policy, which is approved 
by the Board. The Group hedges a proportion of its 
exposure for transactional items to foreign exchange  
by using forward exchange contracts.
The Group, like most public companies, does not 
hedge for the translation of its foreign subsidiaries’ 
assets or liabilities in the consolidation of its Group 
accounts. It is, however, increasingly focused on 
hedging its statement of financial position through 
matching, where possible, its overseas assets with 
overseas liabilities, such as foreign currency debt 
financing.

Certain of the Group’s raw materials and engineering 
components are sourced from single suppliers. 
Disruption in those supplies, either on a temporary 
or more permanent basis, could affect production 
and supply to the Group’s customers and, in certain 
defined circumstances, have contractual commercial 
consequences which may result in customer claims.
Mitigating actions 
Wherever possible, supplies are sourced from more 
than one supplier or location. However, this is not 
always possible, due to the special nature of the raw 
materials and machinery used.
The Group continually monitors suppliers and is 
investing significantly in the search for, testing and 
approval of, alternative suppliers of critical materials.
Controls 
  Key Supplier Review Committee, an internal 
committee, meets at least twice a year to review the 
ability of the Group to source its key raw materials 
and engineering components. A dedicated raw 
materials manager leads this review.
  Audits of key suppliers are carried out.

Risk
Until recently most of Zotefoams’ revenue was shipped 
from the UK. Following its investments in the USA and 
Asia, the Group now employs more people, holds 
more assets and generates a higher proportion of 
revenues outside the UK. While scaling up operations 
internationally, it becomes increasingly important to 
manage the span of control risk through embedding 
effective systems across the Group and maintaining 
an effective financial control and corporate governance 
environment, while delivering on the Group’s strategic 
objectives.
Mitigating actions 
The Board and Executive Committee continually review 
the Group’s corporate culture, its communication and 
embedding of controls across the organisation. 
Key leaders travel frequently to overseas locations 
to ensure the right people are in the right roles and 
behaviours are aligned with those at the corporate 
centre.
The Group has been investing significantly in human 
resource over the past three years as it builds global 
functions and hires leaders with international and

Risk
The Group needs to have sufficient cash, or be able 
to draw on loan facilities or access capital markets, 
to finance its operations and its increasing growth 
expectations. 
The Zotefoams business is growth led and capital 
intensive. An expectation of growth creates the need 
for investment in fixed assets and working capital to 
service this growth, which increases debt levels ahead 
of the expected future cash inflows. 
Mitigating actions
The Group has strong cash generation from its 
operations. In Q1 2018 the Group completed HP1, 
which cost a total of $33m. It has since announced a 
£12m investment in low-pressure capacity in Croydon 
to support HPP growth and a $9m investment to 
commission the second high-pressure autoclave (HP2) 
in the USA. The Group continues to assess additional 
significant investment opportunities and working 
capital needs to enable it to meet its increasing growth 
opportunities. Accelerated growth leads to a shorter 
investment cycle and the need for a more frequent 
assessment of the Group‘s financing structure.
The Group has debt facilities, at 31 December 2017 , 
amounting to:
– a 10-year, $8m fixed rate loan
– a five-year £7 .5m variable rate loan facility; and
–  a four-year £10m RCF facility and a £2m overdraft 
facility.
In March 2018 the Group secured an additional £10m 
facility with an 18-month term. The loans and RCF 
facility are secured against certain Group assets and 
are subject to covenants. 
When considering investment projects the Group 
has regard to its ability to raise finance for the project 
and will not fully commit to a project until acceptable 
and appropriate finance is in place, or believed to be 
available.

may impact the Group’s ability to import raw materials 
and export finished foam product in a timely manner. 
Tariffs may increase input costs and export prices. 
Labour regulations may affect the Group’s ability to 
attract EU talent. 
Mitigating actions 
Some of the Group’s markets can be cyclical. However, 
this risk is spread geographically and across a 
number of segments, which are expected to diversify 
further with the growth of HPP and MEL. The Group 
is operationally geared and its experience is that, in 
challenging circumstances, operational labour costs 
can be reduced, polymer prices generally fall with 
reduced economic demand, giving a cost benefit, and 
cash can be generated from both reducing working 
capital as well as slowing capital expenditure projects 
to help offset the effects of a downturn. The Group 
targets an appropriate financial structure to give it 
flexibility in a downturn. 
The Group will monitor Brexit developments and 
take appropriate commercial action, which ultimately 
impacts capital investment decisions, as the political 
and economic situation becomes clearer.

2017 was an unprecedented year for global cyber-
threats in terms of scale, impact and speed of infection. 
Increasingly, additional measures are needed to 
combat and mitigate this growing risk
Mitigating actions 
The IT department stays on top of all developments 
and regularly reviews the quality and status of its

example, during 2017 the department:
–  Commenced deployment of enhanced malicious 
code protection to all laptops globally
–  Upgraded servers and desktops that had  
old operating systems
–  Underwent an independent security audit  
to highlight any risks
The department also increased the level of 
communication on cyber-related risks with  
Group personnel.
The Group is committed to certification against the UK 
Government backed and industry supported Cyber 
Essentials Plus scheme. This will introduce many

The Company has a Defined Benefit Pension Scheme 
(‘Scheme’) and any inability of the Scheme to meet 
its liabilities to its members could, ultimately, be the 
responsibility of the Company.
There have in recent times been a number of legal 
cases challenging the validity of previously closed 
defined benefit schemes, but as yet no clear case law.
Mitigating actions 
To minimise the risk to the Company of meeting the 
obligations under the Scheme, the Company took 
action to close the Scheme to new members in 2001 
and closed it to future accrual of benefits in 2005. 
The Company obtained legal advice in 2017 which 
opined that, while the Scheme was effectively closed to 
future accrual of benefits in 2005, it was not effectively 
closed to future accrual of salary. The impact of this, 
estimated to be £1.27m, has been booked as an 
exceptional item in the financial statements. A process 
is currently under way to close the scheme to future 
accrual of salary, while the Company also considers its 
options for recourse to its advisors at the time. 
The Company will continuously work together with 
the Trustees to undertake de-risking activities to the 
Scheme, where feasible.
The last triennial actuarial valuation of the Scheme is 
as at 5 April 2017 and the outcome of this is still being 
considered. As a recovery plan for the Scheme for the 
previous valuation (5 April 2014), the Company agreed 
to make a contribution to the Scheme of £41,000 per 
month until April 2020 to reduce the deficit, together 
with expenses of £10,600 per month.

Group revenues and profits could be impacted by  
the loss, insolvency or divergence of interest with  
a major customer. 
Mitigating actions 
The Group’s largest customers are converters of foam. 
The Group has good knowledge of the end customers 
of its major customers and, with some additional short-
term work, would expect to bring or identify additional 
converter capacity, supply routes or channel partners 
to service these markets. 
As the Group successfully converts projects out of 
its HPP portfolio into commercial opportunities, the 
customers it sells its ZOTEK
®
 PEBA, F and N foams 
to will mostly be significantly larger than the average 
AZOTE
®
 customer. These relationships, with balanced 
commercial contracts, are by their nature longer term, 
providing a unique technical solution and competitive 
advantage to the ZOTEK
®
 foams customers. Continued 
investment in the portfolio could yield further successes 
that spread the risk of any single loss, while the T-FIT

insulation business provides further balancing with its 
more broadly spread customer base.

Securing the right people  
for future growth
Getting the right balance between learning and 
accountability is difficult and requires an open culture 
that is receptive to questioning and improvement 
and this is our fifth culture pillar: “We constructively 
challenge ourselves and others”. Last, but not least, 
our ambitious growth plan relies on our ability to take 
people with us. To support us with this in 2017 we 
contracted a third party global engagement survey,  
for which we achieved a very credible 77% response. 
This survey measured employee engagement and 
provided benchmarks on key priorities, including our 
safety culture and the roll out of our brand values.  
We received many constructive practical suggestions 
from this survey but the overarching message on 
culture from our employees is to improve the level of 
recognition they receive. This leads to our sixth culture 
pillar: “We value people and recognise our successes”. 
While everyone is very busy at Zotefoams these days 
we nevertheless recognise the importance of this and 
intend to take the time to make this an integral part  
of our growth journey during 2018 and beyond.
Talent management
Like most organisations, Zotefoams has its own 
peculiar challenges with talent and in 2017 we set up 
a talent framework to tackle them. Our talent pool is 
focused on people with key business knowledge or 
experience together with transferable behaviours and 
skills. This group of people will begin a development 
programme in 2018, designed to increase their mobility 
by broadening their exposure across the business. 
The group is mobile in respect to function and, in many 
cases, geography and we are preparing them for key 
roles in new business units as well as for a wider range 
of opportunities within the core business. Alongside 
this mobile talent pool, we have developed talent 
feeder paths to hire and develop people towards the 
roles we find hardest to fill. Neither route particularly 
compromises people on an upward trajectory within 
their specialities and we believe we have structured 
a talent solution that focuses on resolving business 
needs without blocking career paths across the 
broader business.
Building capability
In 2016 we conducted an extensive talent gap review. 
Through 2017 we addressed many areas that this 
review highlighted, including workflow gaps, training 
and hiring. We also defined the key skills and expertise 
needed to support growth over the next 3-5 years, 
identifying the two key areas where we need to 
strengthen the pipeline of critical skills.
The first is in expertise across our technology and 
operations departments and we focused on entry-level 
solutions in 2017 , launching a graduate scheme  
to sit alongside our placements and internships.  
Our graduates, together with our mobile talent pool, 
are undertaking development programmes this year. 
Our aim for this group is to learn alongside some of 
our longer-serving employees, where much of our 
expertise lies (see fig 1, years of service and age),  
so we transfer knowledge and capabilities and start 
building bench strength for future business demands.

Our brand values: Trustworthy; Reliable; Responsive 
and Pioneering, define how we expect to work together 
and with our stakeholders. We have made these values 
intrinsic to progression and recruitment for the last 
three years to drive these behaviours gradually  
through the organisation.
In 2017 we ran projects in culture and talent to support 
us further in the execution of these plans. We derived 
six guiding culture pillars, firmly tied to the nature and 
priorities of our business, to sit alongside our brand 
values and underpin our commercial efforts. Aligning 
our business and Brand Values is therefore the first 
pillar in our Company Culture. We accept that growth 
means continuing change and our second culture pillar 
is “We understand how we contribute to Zotefoams’ 
success” in recognition of the need to maintain clarity 
and purpose through changing times.
“We hold ourselves accountable” is our third culture 
pillar, reflecting the evolution of our organisation into 
more defined profit-accountable business units, as 
new technologies grow into more tangible businesses. 
However, being technology leaders in our space, 
our people also need the scope and permission to 
experiment, learn and grow. This means tolerating a 
level of failure which we do gladly within agreed levels 
of risk and encouraging a “failing forward” approach 
to learning. This is our fourth culture pillar: “We are a 
learning organisation”. 
We intend to be the world leader in cellular materials technology  
in our chosen markets. As we strive towards our business goals,  
it’s important to have a strong culture through which we anchor  
ourselves to a common guiding philosophy.  Zotefoams plc Annual Report 2017 31

women accounting for around 30% of key hires over 
the past two years, something also true of our graduate 
hires in 2017 , despite operating in a highly male-
dominated field. (see fig 3). We have completed  
a comprehensive analysis of basic salaries in respect  
to gender pay and have submitted our report as at 
5 April 2017 . 
In 2018 we plan to extend this review to benefits to 
ensure we are operating fairly in all aspects of reward.
Talent attraction and employer branding are areas we 
have paid particular attention to in recent years, and in 
2017 we have again seen the benefits of this investment 
through the highly skilled and qualified people we have 
hired. 2017 marked the beginning of a more targeted 
approach through forming relationships with the key 
local universities in materials engineering. We will 
augment this in 2018 through sponsorship and building 
more links and we plan to extend our acquisition efforts 
to apprenticeships.

Doing the right thing
Zotefoams considers that the management 
of safety, health, environmental, social and 
ethical matters forms a key element of 
effective corporate governance.
Zotefoams’ products
Zotefoams’ products are known for their lightweight 
and durability as well as consistency. Zotefoams’ 
products are frequently part of the sustainability 
agenda of our customers and/or end users, such 
as in the aviation and automotive industries, where 
manufacturers seek weight reduction to deliver fuel 
savings. A significant proportion of Zotefoams’ foams 
used in packaging are for permanent protection, such 
as tool cases, or multiple-use applications such as 
internal transportation of parts in automotive, semi-
conductor or other industries.
The MuCell
®
 technology, developed by MuCell 
Extrusion LLC, offers licensees the opportunity to 
manufacture extruded plastic parts using less raw 
materials than with conventional extrusion methods. 
A 15-20% saving on raw materials at source offers 
significant environmental benefits, as well as cost 
reduction, and often requires little compromise 
in product design, as the end parts are typically 
indistinguishable from their solid counterparts.
Zotefoams is making advances in both the types of 
foams that we offer and their uses for existing materials. 
The global trends of using fewer materials, and using 
less fuel through weight reduction and increased use 
of better insulation, all offer opportunities to use foams. 
The unique process currently used by Zotefoams to 
manufacture our block foam products is based on 
nitrogen gas, which is inert and comprises 78% of 
the earth’s atmosphere, to expand the foams, while 
MuCell
®
 processes use either nitrogen or already-
existing carbon dioxide as the foaming agent. The 
common peroxide cross-linking agent, which improves 
the foam’s properties, is completely expended during 
the manufacturing process. 
Foam products and technologies offer many 
environmental benefits, and Zotefoams intends to 
develop further products and solutions to deliver global 
needs in a sustainable manner. 
MuCell
®
 technology 
enables manufacturers 
to use 15 – 20% less 
raw material than with 
conventional extrusion 
methods.
AZOTE
®
 and ZOTEK
®
 
foams assist manufacturers 
who are constantly seeking 
weight reductions in the 
aeroplanes and vehicles they 
build – which leads to the 
consumption of less fuel  
per mile travelled.
Unlike foam manufactured 
by the Group’s 
competitors, no other 
chemical additives or fillers 
are used in our process.

Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
Safety, Health and Environment (‘SHE’)
The Board has in place separate policies relating to 
Safety, Health and Environment. The Company is 
certified to accredited standards OHSAS 18001 on 
Health and Safety and ISO 14001, the International 
Standard for Environmental Management Systems, 
and is regularly audited by those bodies to ensure  
that the Company complies with those standards.  
The Company is working towards implementing  
ISO 14001/2015 and expects to achieve compliance  
in 2018.
The Board has ultimate responsibility for SHE policy 
and performance and receives quarterly reports  
on SHE issues. Annual performance objectives  
are agreed by the Board and performance against 
these objectives is monitored as part of its quarterly 
reporting programme.
The Group CEO is directly responsible to the Board for 
Safety, Health and Environmental performance. Site 
Committees on SHE normally meet once a quarter to 
consider all SHE matters and are overseen by Steering 
Committees, chaired by the Group CEO (or appropriate 
responsible person in subsidiary companies). The 
Steering Committees consider overall performance  
and the impact of current and impending legislation.
On joining the Group, all employees receive training 
on SHE matters, including the Group’s policies, 
and refresher training is provided, as appropriate, to 
ensure that the employees understand SHE matters. 
All employees are made aware that everyone has a 
part to play to ensure the safety of themselves and 
their colleagues at work. Employees are encouraged 
to report to their managers any unsafe, or potentially 
unsafe, conditions. Senior managers are responsible 
for ensuring that SHE policies are implemented 
in their areas, that their teams are informed of 
the departmental SHE requirements and that the 
employees receive training on environmental issues 
and safe working practices and understand them. 
Regular audits are conducted to ensure policy and 
procedure implementation is appropriate.
The Group takes the reporting of all SHE incidents 
very seriously and requires the employees to report 
all incidents, including any near misses, as well as 
damage to plant or equipment which has not resulted 
in personal injury. The Group considers the reporting 
of near misses to be as equally important as actual 
incidents, since it raises situations to management 
that could cause, or might have caused, harm and, 
therefore, appropriate corrective action can be taken  
to eliminate or minimise the risk. The Group also 
ensures that appropriate safety practices are included 
in standard operating procedures to reduce the risk  
of SHE incidents occurring.
All SHE incidents are investigated by appropriate levels 
of management to ascertain the root cause of the 
incident and, wherever possible, working practices 
and procedures are improved to minimise the risk of 
reoccurrence. In 2017 there were no prosecutions, 
fines or enforcement actions taken as a result of 
non-compliance with safety, health or environmental 
legislation (2016: none). In December 2017 the Division 
of OSH Compliance from the Kentucky Labor Cabinet 
visited the Group’s Kentucky site before the start-up of 
the new plant. The results of the visit were positive and 
provide a firm foundation for this important operation  
as it grows in significance to the Group. 
Health and safety performance
Few controlled substances are used in the  
manufacture of our foams, but where they are,  
the Group has established procedures, upon which  
the relevant employees are trained, to ensure the 
storage and handling of such substances are safe  
and in accordance with regulatory requirements.  
The manufacturing process involves manual handling 
and processing of materials. When new or altered 
equipment or materials are introduced, and at regular 
periods thereafter, the risks to the processes are 
assessed and, wherever possible, improvements  
are made, such as to the design of the equipment,  
to reduce or eliminate the risks identified.
The most strictly controlled parts of the Group’s 
sites are where high-pressure gas is used. The 
high-pressure autoclaves are subject to the Pressure 
Systems Safety Regulations 2000 in the UK and OSHA 
(Occupational Safety and Health Administration) in 
the USA. Tightly-defined procedures and operational 
controls are in place to manage the safety of these 
pressure systems. Fail-safe mechanisms, known as 
pressure relief valves and bursting discs (which act 
like fuses in an electrical system), are included in the 
design of the pressure systems, which when triggered 
allow depressurisation of sections of the system and 
prevent any further risks. Operation of these fail-safe 
mechanisms releases harmless nitrogen gas into the 
atmosphere.
In 2017 , there has been a significant focus on health 
and safety. Management is committed to undertaking 
safety walks through all plant locations. In Croydon,  
a programme was developed to pair up executives  
and managers from different parts of the business  
each month to undertake inspections of the plant.  
The Executive team and managers received training  
on Safe and Unsafe Acts (SUSA) auditing to improve 
the effectiveness of inspections and discussions with 
the employees on safety matters.
In 2017 , the Group had six reportable lost time injuries. 
All incidents were fully investigated and appropriate 
corrective actions have been put in place. The nature  
of these incidents varied, but they all related to incorrect 
manual handling or slips and falls.
Environmental performance
There were no significant environmental incidents 
during the year (2016: none). In 2017 the Group had 7 
internally recorded environmental incidents (2016: 11), 
the majority of which were noise and light complaints.
All incidents are taken seriously, investigated, and 
responses given, appropriate to their level of impact  
or potential impact.

Reportable

The majority of the waste produced by Zotefoams in 
the UK is either solid or foamed polyolefin. Our goal  
is to minimise waste through improving manufacturing 
yields. We aim to find an alternative use for any non-
prime material, although it is sometimes necessary to 
have such material recycled by third parties or, as a last 
resort, disposed of in landfill. The overall yield for the 
prime material produced in Croydon reduced by 0.7% 
in 2017.
Since 2013 the amount of waste material being sent to 
landfill has reduced, despite increases in the volume 
of activity within the business. However, in 2017 , the 
amount of waste sent to landfill increased as China 
declared a ban on importing waste plastic for recycling, 
which altered the market dynamics considerably, 
and the Croydon site was cleared to prepare for 
construction of a new building to accommodate  
the investment of two large high-temperature low-
pressure autoclaves. 
Water usage on the Croydon site in 2017 was 
74,000m³, which was higher than 2016 (60,000m³).  
We identified two leaks in the system during the year, 
which have now been rectified, and we continue 
to investigate our water systems for areas of high 
consumption. 
We measure energy efficiency by taking energy 
consumption and dividing it by the amount of material 
(in kg) that passes through high-pressure autoclaves. 
In 2017 , our energy efficiency improved significantly to 
11.05 kWhr/kg (2016: 11.76 kWhr/kg). This improvement 
is a combination of a number of initiatives such as 
introducing LED lighting around the Croydon site, 
replacing older service equipment and commencing 
use of vaporising technology in Croydon at the end of 
2016. This vaporising technology has reduced demand 
on the older, energy-intensive, nitrogen compressors 
used to pressurise autoclaves. 
In October 2009, the Company entered into a 
Climate Change Levy (‘CCL ’) agreement, which 
involves meeting specific targets to reduce energy 
consumption. Providing the Company meets the 
requirements of the CCL agreement, it receives a  
rebate on its electricity bills and is also exempt from  
the Carbon Reduction Commitment Scheme.
In 2015 the Group had its first assessment under  
the Energy Savings Opportunity Scheme (‘ESOS’).  
The next assessment for ESOS will be for the four- 
year period ending 31 December 2018.
Carbon emissions
The Group’s total carbon emissions for all its operations 
globally were 16,425 metric tonnes for the year ended 
31 December 2017 (2016: 16,142 metric tonnes). The 
breakdown of these figures is shown in the table above.
Our principal carbon emissions have been from energy 
usage in the manufacture of our foam products in both 
Croydon and Kentucky. The carbon emissions from 
MuCell Extrusion LLC and Zotefoams Midwest LLC  
are minimal.
The methodology we have used has been in 
accordance with the guidance published by the 
Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 
in June 2013. We have only included emissions 
for which we are directly responsible. We have not 
included emissions for activities over which we have 
no direct control. For example, we have included 
business mileage on Company vehicles and mileage 
claimed by employees in the UK, but not other forms 
of business travel, such as travel made by employees 
elsewhere in the Group or travel using public transport 
or aeroplanes.
Whilst there has been an increase in our carbon 
emission for 2017 compared to 2016, this is due to 
more material being produced. Our actual carbon 
emissions (kg) per material gassed (kg) have reduced 
from 2.3 to 2.1. It should also be noted that another 
driver for the lower carbon emissions in 2017 and 
2016, compared to the earlier years, is that lower 
conversion factors have been used for electricity and 
gas consumed in the UK to calculate their carbon 
emissions. The Department for Business, Energy and 
Industrial Strategy last updated the conversion factors 
in August 2017 .

Corporate governance introduction
Committed to the highest standards  
of corporate governance
Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to present the report on corporate 
governance on behalf of the Board.
At Zotefoams, we recognise the importance of being  
a well-managed business, not only for the interests 
of our shareholders, but for other stakeholders as 
well. The Board and I are committed to the highest 
standards of corporate governance and regularly 
monitor our compliance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code. The Code is available from the 
Financial Reporting Council’s website (www.frc.org.uk).
Statement of compliance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code (the ‘Code’)
Under the UK Corporate Governance Code we are 
required to state whether we have complied with the 
Code’s provisions. The Board confirms that, throughout 
the financial year ended 31 December 2017 , the Group 
applied all of the provisions set out in the UK Corporate 
Governance Code as published in April 2016.
The Board also confirms that the Group has applied  
the principles set out in the Code, including both  
the main principles and the supporting principles,  
by complying with the Code. Further explanation  
of how the principles and supporting principles have 
been applied is set out below and in the Directors’ 
remuneration report, the Audit Committee report  
and the Nominations Committee report.
Proposed revision of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code
The Board is aware of the proposed revision to the UK 
Corporate Governance Code, which was published  
in December 2017 , and the consultation period, which 
closed on 28 February 2018. The Board is monitoring 
the developments of the Code and will consider how  
to implement the changes once the finalised version  
of the Code is published.
Board and Committee composition
M-L Clayton retired from the Board on 30 September 
2017 . D G Robertson was appointed to the Board on 
8 August 2017 and as Chair of the Audit Committee 
and member of the Nominations and Remuneration 
Committees. J D Carling was appointed to the Board 
on 2 January 2018, as well as to the Audit, Nominations 
and Remuneration Committees. After being on the 
Board for ten years, R J Clowes will be retiring at the 
AGM scheduled for 16 May 2018. D G Robertson will 
replace R J Clowes as Senior Independent Director  
on 16 May 2018. 
AGM
We believe that the AGM is an ideal opportunity for the 
shareholders to attend and meet both the Executive 
Directors and the Non-Executive Directors, see the 
Croydon site and ask questions that they may have. 
The AGM is scheduled for 16 May 2018 and the Board 
looks forward to meeting you there.
The Board is aware of 
the proposed revision 
to the UK Corporate

Financial Statements Strategic Report Governance
The Board and its Committees
The Board’s role is to provide the entrepreneurial 
leadership of the Group within a framework of prudent 
and effective controls which enable risk to be assessed 
and managed. The Board sets the strategic aims of 
the Group, ensures that the necessary resources are 
in place to achieve the Group objectives and reviews 
management performance. The Board’s role is to 
act as representative of the shareholders and other 
stakeholders and focus on the governance of the 
Group. Management is delegated to the Executive 
Directors and the senior executive management of  
the Group.
All Directors take decisions objectively in the interests 
of the Group.
As part of their role as members of a unitary Board, 
Non-Executive Directors constructively challenge and 
help develop proposals on strategy. Non-Executive 
Directors scrutinise the performance of management  
in meeting agreed goals and objectives and monitor 
the reporting of performance. They satisfy themselves 
on the integrity of financial information and that financial 
controls and systems of risk management are robust 
and defensible. They are responsible for determining 
appropriate levels of remuneration of Executive 
Directors and have a prime role in appointing, and 
where necessary removing, Executive Directors,  
and in succession planning.
The Board has three principal committees which report 
into it and function within defined Terms of Reference. 
These are the Audit Committee, the Remuneration 
Committee and the Nominations Committee. The 
Terms of Reference for these Committees are available 
on the Group’s website, www.zotefoams.com, and in 
paper form, on request to the Company Secretary.
The Board has put in place a schedule of matters that 
are reserved for its determination or which need to 
be reported to the Board. This schedule is reviewed 
regularly and was last updated in January 2018.
Chairman and Group CEO
The Chairman is responsible for the leadership of  
the Board, ensuring its effectiveness on all aspects  
of its role and setting its agenda. The Chairman  
is also responsible for ensuring that the Directors  
receive accurate, timely and clear information.  
The Chairman facilitates the effective contribution  
of the Non-Executive Directors, in particular, and 
ensures constructive relations between Executive  
and Non-Executive Directors.
The Board considers that S P Good has sufficient  
time to devote to his role as being the Chairman of  
the Group. Mr Good has no executive positions,  
but is currently a Non-Executive Director of two  
other companies (Elementis plc and Anglia Water 
Services Limited).
The Group CEO is responsible for the running of the 
Group’s business. He is supported by the Group CFO 
and the Group’s senior management team.
Board balance and independence
The Board currently comprises two Executive 
Directors, four independent Non-Executive Directors 
and the Non-Executive Chairman. R J Clowes has 
acted as the Senior Independent Non-Executive 
Director throughout 2017 . The Board considers  
R J Clowes to be independent, notwithstanding he 
has served on the Board since 2007 , as he continues 
to demonstrate independence in his judgement and 
contribution to the Board. 
The Chairman is also Chair of the Nominations 
Committee and a member of the Remuneration 
Committee. Only the respective Committee Chairs 
and members are entitled to be present at meetings 
of the Remuneration, Audit and Nominations 
Committees, but others may attend at the invitation 
of the Committees. During the year the Chairman met 
with the Non-Executive Directors several times without 
the Executive Directors present and the Non-Executive 
Directors met without the Chairman being present.

Appointments to the Board and the  
Nominations Committee
Appointments to the Board are proposed by the 
Nominations Committee and approved by the Board.
A separate Nominations Committee report provides 
details of the role and activities of the Committee  
and its work in relation to appointments to the Board.
The Board acknowledges the benefits of diversity, 
including that of gender but, when considering 
appointments to the Board, appointments are made 
purely on merit and against objective criteria. No 
specific policy or quotas have been set on diversity 
and, when search consultants are briefed of the search 
criteria, they are encouraged to cast their search 
sufficiently broadly to identify the best candidates.  
Care is taken to ensure that appointees, as well as  
the existing Directors, have sufficient time to devote  
to their roles.
Information and professional development
Each month all Directors receive management reports 
and briefing papers in relation to Board matters. New 
appointments to the Board receive an induction and, if 
appropriate, training. Training is made available in order 
to fulfil the requirements of being a director of a listed 
company. The Directors have access to the Company 
Secretary and independent professional advisers, at 
the Group’s expense, if required for the furtherance  
of their duties.
Board evaluation
A formal review of the performance of the Board and 
its Committees is carried out each year. The review 
of the Chairman’s performance is led by the Senior 
Independent Non-Executive Director, together with  
the other Non-Executive Directors in consultation  
with the Executive Directors. The other Non-Executive 
Directors’ performance is evaluated by the Chairman 
in consultation with the Executive Directors. The 
Executive team’s performance is evaluated by the 
Remuneration Committee in conjunction with the 
Group CEO (except in the case of the Group CEO, 
when the Group CEO is not present in that evaluation).
The evaluation of the Board normally takes the form 
of a questionnaire, prepared by the Chairman and 
the Company Secretary, and the results are compiled 
and discussed, with actions agreed. Each Committee 
undertakes its own evaluation, led by the relevant Chair. 
These might include a questionnaire to identify specific 
topics, but there is always a discussion at one of the 
meetings each year to consider the activities of the 
Committee during the year and areas for improvement. 
Due to the Group’s size, the Board feels, at this stage, 
it is not appropriate to use the services of an external 
facilitator for its annual evaluation, but will keep the 
matter under review.
The most recent Board evaluation was undertaken 
in the second quarter of 2017 . After the Directors 
had each completed a questionnaire, the Chairman 
held individual meetings with each Director and then 
prepared a discussion document, which reviewed 
progress against the actions identified from the 2016 
Board evaluation and set out recommended actions 
for the following year. These included improving the 
succession plans of both the Board and the Group’s 
senior management, redesigning the risk management 
process and utilising more ‘in flight’ reviews to enhance 
the effectiveness of the Board.
Re-election
Re-election of Board members is required by the 
Articles at the first AGM following appointment and 
normally once every three years thereafter. The current 
Code requires all directors of FTSE 350 companies 
to stand for annual re-election, although one of the 
proposed changes to the Code that was published  
in December 2017 is that this requirement apply  
to all listed companies. Whilst the Group is not within 
the FTSE 350, the Board has decided since 2012 to 
follow best practice for Main Market Listed companies 
and has adopted the practice of annual re-election  
of all Directors.
Remuneration Committee and  
executive remuneration
A report on the activities of the Remuneration 
Committee is contained within the Directors’ 
remuneration report, together with the principles  
and details of executive remuneration.
Financial reporting
The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the  
financial statements are set out in the Statement  
of directors’ responsibilities in respect of the  
annual report.
Audit Committee and Auditors
A separate Audit Committee report provides details 
of the role and activities of the Committee and its 
relationship with the External Auditors.
Relations with shareholders
The Group is always willing, where practicable,  
to discuss with its shareholders its objectives in 
order to promote a mutual understanding. Meetings 
with institutional shareholders are held twice a 
year following the announcements of the Group’s 
interim and final results. Other meetings are held at 
institutional shareholders’ request. To ensure that 
the Board, particularly the Non-Executive Directors, 
understands the views of the shareholders, the Group’s 
corporate brokers provide summary feedback from 
the investor meetings that they arrange, in particular 
the meetings held following the interim and final 
results announcements. The Chairman and the Senior 
Independent Non-Executive Director, as well as the 
other Non-Executive Directors, are available to meet 
institutional shareholders if requested.
The Board considers the Annual Report, the AGM  
and the corporate website www.zotefoams.com to  
be the primary vehicles for communication with private 
investors. The Chairs of the Audit and Remuneration 
Committees will normally be available at the AGM to 
answer questions. The Chairman, being also the Chair 
of the Nominations Committee, will normally be present 
as well.
Internal control
The Board has applied the Code by establishing a 
continuous process for identifying, evaluating and 
managing the significant risks the Group faces.  
The Board regularly reviews the process, which has 
been in place from the start of the year to the date of 
approval of this report and which is in accordance with 
the Financial Reporting Council’s Guidance on Risk 
Management, Internal Control and Related Financial 
and Business Reporting. The Board is responsible 
for the Group’s system of internal control and for 
reviewing its effectiveness. Such a system is designed 
to manage, rather than eliminate, the risk of failure to 
achieve business objectives, and can only provide 
reasonable and not absolute assurance against 
material misstatement or loss.
The Group is always 
willing, where 
practicable, to discuss 
with its shareholders 
its objectives in order 
to promote a mutual 
understanding.
The Board and its Committees Continued Zotefoams plc Annual Report 2017 41
Financial Statements Strategic Report Governance
In compliance with the Code, the Board regularly 
reviews the effectiveness of the Group’s system of 
internal control, as well as how it is reported to the 
Board. The Board’s monitoring covers all controls, 
including financial, operational and compliance 
controls and risk management. It is based principally 
on reviewing reports from management to consider 
whether significant risks are identified, evaluated, 
managed and controlled and whether any significant 
weaknesses are promptly remedied and indicate a 
need for more extensive monitoring. The Board has 
also performed a specific assessment for the purpose 
of this Annual Report. This assessment considered all 
the significant aspects of internal control arising during 
the period covered by the report. The assessment also 
included a robust review of the principal risks facing the 
Group, including those that would threaten the Group’s 
business model, future performance, solvency and 
liquidity. The Audit Committee assists the Board  
in discharging its review responsibilities.
During the course of its review of the system of internal 
control and the principal risks facing the Group, the 
Board had not identified, nor been advised of, any 
failings or weaknesses it determined to be significant. 
Therefore, a confirmation in respect of necessary 
actions has not been considered appropriate.
Key elements of the Group’s system of internal controls 
are as follows:
Control environment
The Group has an appropriate organisational structure 
for planning, executing, controlling and monitoring 
business operations in order to achieve Group 
objectives. Overall business objectives are set by the 
Board and communicated through the organisation. 
Lines of responsibility and delegations of authority  
are documented.
Risk identification
Group management is responsible for the identification 
and evaluation of key risks applicable to its areas of 
business. These risks are assessed on a continual 
basis and may be associated with a variety of internal 
or external sources.
Information and communication
Annual budgets are a key part of the planning process 
and the Board reviews the performance against the 
budgets and the quarterly forecasts. In addition, the 
Board receives monthly management reports, which 
highlight financial results, performance against key 
performance indicators and significant activities and 
matters of note during the month of review. In 2017 , the 
Group’s Finance Department has focused on improving 
the quality of these reports.
Through these mechanisms, the performance of the 
Group is regularly monitored, risks identified in a timely 
manner, their financial implications assessed, control 
procedures re-evaluated and corrective actions agreed 
and implemented.
Control procedures
The Group has implemented control procedures 
designed to ensure complete and accurate accounting 
for financial transactions and to limit the potential 
exposure to loss of assets or fraud. Measures taken 
include physical controls, segregation of duties, reviews 
by management, internal audit and external audit to  
the extent necessary to arrive at their audit opinion.
A process of control self-assessment and hierarchical 
reporting has been established, which provides for a 
documented and auditable trail of accountability. These 
procedures are relevant across the Group and provide 
for successive assurances to be given at increasingly 
higher levels of management and, finally, to the 
Board. Planned corrective actions are independently 
monitored for timely completion.
Monitoring and corrective action
There are clear and consistent procedures in place  
for monitoring the system of internal financial and non-
financial controls. The Audit Committee normally meets 
three times a year and, within its remit, reviews the 
effectiveness of the Group’s system of internal financial 
controls. The Committee receives reports from the 
External Auditors, Internal Auditors and management.
Non-financial controls are reviewed regularly by 
executive management, who report any issues  
and corrective actions taken directly. Zotefoams plc Annual Report 2017 42
Audit Committee report
New Audit Committee 
Chair appointed
Summary of the role of the Audit Committee
The main responsibilities of the Audit Committee are:
  monitoring the integrity of the financial statements  
of the Group and any formal announcements  
relating to the Group’s financial performance and 
reviewing significant financial reporting judgements 
contained therein; 
  reviewing the Group’s internal controls and risk 
management systems; 
  reviewing the arrangements by which staff may, 
in confidence, raise concerns about possible 
improprieties (‘the Whistleblowing policy’); 
  reviewing the arrangements put in place by the 
Group to prevent bribery and to receive reports  
of non-compliance; 
  annually assessing the need for an internal audit

responses to any findings and reviewing any 
recommendations made from Internal Audit; 
  reviewing the External Auditors’ management letter 
and management responses to any findings and 
recommendations made from the external audit; 
  reviewing and monitoring the External Auditors’ 
independence and objectivity and the  
effectiveness of the audit process, taking into 
consideration relevant UK professional and  
regulatory requirements, and their appointment  
and remuneration; 
  developing and implementing a policy on the 
engagement of the External Auditors to supply  
non-audit services, taking into account relevant 
guidance regarding the provision of non-audit 
services by the external audit firm; and 
  reporting to the Board on how it has discharged  
its responsibilities, including making 
recommendations, when necessary,  
on any actions or improvements required. 
The Audit Committee’s Terms of Reference, which are 
available on the Group’s website, include all matters 
indicated by the Disclosure and Transparency Rule 
7 .1 and the UK Corporate Governance Code. The 
Terms of Reference are reviewed regularly by the Audit 
Committee to ensure they remain appropriate and 
reflect best practice and, if amended, are then referred 
to the Board for approval. The Terms of Reference 
were last reviewed and updated in December 2016 and 
reflect the changes brought in by the UK Corporate 
Governance Code published in April 2016.
Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to present my first report, as Chair of the Audit 
Committee, on the activities of the Committee for 2017 .
As part of my induction to the Board, I spent time with M-L Clayton, 
the previous Chair of the Audit Committee, M Jones, Audit Partner 
at PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (‘PwC’), the Group CFO and the 
Company Secretary to gain a full understanding of the financial 
reporting of the Group, its risk management framework and the 
operations of the Audit Committee.
The internal audit in 2017 , performed by the Group’s selected advisor, 
Grant Thornton UK LLP , was a review of the Group’s inventory 
management policies, procedures and controls in Croydon. Findings 
were presented to the Audit Committee by senior representatives of 
Grant Thornton and timely management actions and commitment 
dates discussed and approved. The Group adopts a risk-based 
approach to internal audit. In 2016 the audit review was on fixed 
assets at the UK and US sites, while in the previous year it covered 
accounts payable procedures at the head office in Croydon. 
The Committee considered the issues arising from the potential 
increased liability on the Group’s Defined Benefit Pension Scheme 
in the UK. The Committee also considered the impairment of the 
goodwill arising on the acquisition of MuCell Extrusion LLC (‘MEL ’)  
in 2011 and the inventory adjustment at MEL.
With the significant capital investments being made by the Group in 
Croydon and Kentucky, USA, the Committee was kept informed on 
the Group’s financing facilities and net debt forecast, to ensure that 
the Group had sufficient finance to undertake these investments and 
to continue its other operations.
The Committee was kept informed on the continuing work to develop 
and implement a new risk management framework for the Group.
As a result of its work during the year, the Audit Committee has 
concluded that it has acted in accordance with its Terms of Reference 
and has ensured the independence and objectivity of the External 
Auditors. I will be available at the AGM to answer any questions about 
the work of the Committee.
D G Robertson
Chair of the Audit Committee
6 April 2018 Zotefoams plc Annual Report 2017 43
Financial Statements Strategic Report Governance
The Audit Committee 
membership, as a 
whole, has competence 
relevant to the sector 
in which the Group 
operates.
Composition of the Audit Committee
The Committee comprises the independent  
Non-Executive Directors and two members  
constitute a quorum.
The members of the Audit Committee during 2017 
were the independent Non-Executive Directors of 
the Company. A C Bromfield and R J Clowes were 
members for the whole year. M-L Clayton chaired the 
Committee until 8 August 2017 and retired from the 
Committee on 30 September 2017 . D G Robertson 
was appointed as Chair of the Committee on 8 August 
2017 . J D Carling was appointed as a member of the 
Committee on 2 January 2018.
M-L Clayton is a Fellow of the Association of Chartered 
Certified Accountants and D G Robertson is a Fellow 
of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of England 
and Wales. In the opinion of the Board, they both have 
significant, recent and relevant financial experience,  
in the case of D G Robertson, to fulfil the requirements 
of the role and, in the case of M-L Clayton, to have 
performed the role. All Audit Committee members are 
expected to be financially literate and further training  
is provided if required or requested.
The Audit Committee’s membership, as a whole, has 
competence relevant to the sector in which the Group 
operates. Whilst D G Robertson is the only current 
member of the Committee with a financial qualification, 
the other members are financially literate: A C Bromfield 
has an MBA; R J Clowes is a Chartered Engineer; and 
J D Carling has extensive engineering and business 
experience. In addition, all four current members have 
held, or currently hold, positions, both executive  
or non-executive, in industries (engineering, 
manufacturing and construction) that all have a  
strong focus on engineering and construction projects, 
health and safety and customer supply and delivery.
Meetings
The Audit Committee has a planned calendar linked 
to events in the Group’s financial calendar, causing it 
to meet at least three times in the year. Each meeting 
agenda is predominantly based around these events 
and is approved by the Audit Committee Chair on 
behalf of the other members, although other members 
have the right to require reports on matters of interest 
in addition to standard agenda items. The Audit 
Committee met four times in 2017 .
The Company Secretary acts as secretary to the  
Audit Committee. The Company Chairman, Group 
CEO, Group CFO, Group Financial Controller and 
senior representatives of the External and Internal 
Auditors are invited to attend relevant meetings of the 
Committee, although the Committee reserves the 
right to request any of these individuals to withdraw. 
At each meeting, the External Auditors are given the 
opportunity to raise matters without the management 
being present. Other senior management may be 
invited to present such reports as are required for the 
Committee to discharge its duties. During the year,  
on an informal basis, the Audit Committee Chair meets 
senior representatives of both the External Auditors  
and Internal Auditors to discuss matters ahead of the 
formal Committee meetings.
Overview of the actions taken by the  
Audit Committee to discharge its duties
Since the beginning of 2017 the Audit Committee has:
  reviewed the financial statements in the 2016 Annual 
Report, including the going concern and viability 
statements and the stress testing of the viability 
statement, and received the External Auditors’  
report on the audit of the 2016 Annual Report;
  reviewed the interim report issued in August  
2017 and received the report from the External 
Auditors on their review of the interim report;
  received an initial report on the Group’s  
preparation for compliance with the General Data 
Protection Regulation;
  reviewed an initial draft on the Group’s statement  
on Modern Slavery;
  considered the Group’s first cut of the data for 
gender pay gap reporting; 
  considered the inventory adjustment at MEL;
  received a paper on the complications under  
the Companies Act 2006 for the payments of  
interim dividends;
  received a paper on the new corporate offence  
for failure to prevent the facilitation of tax evasion;
  reviewed the Group’s policies on ethics, anti-bribery 
and corruption, fraud and whistleblowing; 
  reviewed the appropriateness of the Group’s UK 
subsidiary companies to rely upon the exemption 
from audit as permitted by section 479A of the 
Companies Act 2006; 
  considered the output from the Group-wide process 
used to identify, evaluate and mitigate high-level 
business risks, including reviewing the Group’s  
high-level business risk matrix; 
  agreed a programme of work for 2017 to be 
performed by the Internal Auditors and received the 
Internal Auditors’ reports on the work undertaken 
and management’s responses to the proposals 
made in the reports; 
  reviewed the effectiveness of the Group’s internal 
controls (including, but not limited to, financial 
controls and measures for detecting fraud) to ensure 
that they remain appropriate and adequate as the 
Group grows; 
  reviewed and agreed the scope of the audit work  
to be undertaken by the External Auditors; 
  considered the views of both the External Auditors 
and Internal Auditors on the effectiveness of the 
Group’s internal financial controls; 
  agreed the fees to be paid to the External Auditors 
for their audit and work on the Annual Report and 
interim report; 
  undertaken an evaluation of the independence, 
objectivity and effectiveness of the External Auditors, 
including reviewing the amount of non-audit services 
provided by the External Auditors; and
  reviewed its own effectiveness. Zotefoams plc Annual Report 2017 44
Financial reporting and significant  
financial issues
The Audit Committee assesses whether suitable 
accounting policies have been adopted and whether 
management has made appropriate estimates and 
judgements. The Committee reviews accounting 
papers prepared by management which provide  
details on the main financial reporting judgements.  
The Committee reviews reports by the External 
Auditors on the full-year and half-year results 
which highlight any issues with respect to the work 
undertaken on the audit or review.
An area of significant focus by the Audit Committee 
has been the provision raised during 2017 of £1.27m 
in relation to the potential increase on the liability of the 
Group’s Defined Benefit Pension Scheme in the UK,  
for which the Group carries ultimate liability as 
sponsoring employer of the Scheme. This potential 
liability arose following legal advice obtained by the 
Scheme’s Trustees on the closure of the Scheme in 
2005. Whilst the legal advice indicated that the Scheme 
was properly closed to future accrual of service in 
2005, the linkage to future increases in  
salary had not been broken.
Another area of significant focus considered by the 
Audit Committee was whether the £2.3m of goodwill 
on the consolidated statement of financial position, 
which arose on the acquisition of MEL in 2011, 
remained appropriate in view of past year losses and 
management’s expectations of future cash flows.
External audit tender
The Audit Committee is aware of the requirement for 
FTSE 350 companies to put to tender their external 
audits at least once every ten years (as set out in the 
Competition and Markets Authority’s Statutory Audit 
Services for Large Companies Market Investigation 
(Mandatory Use of Competitive Tender Processes and 
Audit Committee Responsibilities) Order 2014) and for 
audit committees to state their plans for when they are 
likely to consider a tender process if the external audit 
has not been put to tender in the past five years.
A tender process for the external audit for the 
Group was last undertaken in 2012, following which 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (‘PwC’) was selected 
as the External Auditors. This is PwC’s sixth annual 
audit for the Group and the second annual audit led by 
Michael Jones. Whilst the Group is not within the FTSE 
350 and hence not subject to the above-mentioned 
requirement, the Audit Committee has no current plans 
in the medium term to retender the external audit, but 
will keep the matter under review.
Effectiveness of the external auditors
The Audit Committee assesses the effectiveness of 
the external audit process in a number of ways. The 
External Auditors are invited to, and normally attend,  
all the scheduled meetings of the Committee during the 
year. At least annually, the External Auditors present a 
report, which includes an assessment and confirmation 
of their independence, as well as the activities that 
the External Auditors are undertaking to ensure 
compliance with best practice and regulation. At the 
conclusion of the annual audit, the Audit Committee 
undertakes an assessment of the External Auditors in 
relation to their fulfilment of the agreed audit plan, the 
robustness and perceptiveness of the External Auditors 
in handling key accounting and audit judgements and 
the thoroughness of the External Auditors’ review of 
internal financial controls. As part of this assessment, 
management’s opinions on the External Auditors are 
also considered.
In December 2016 the Audit Committee approved a 
new policy, which took effect from 1 January 2017 , in 
relation to the provision of non-audit services provided 
by the External Auditors. The new policy requires  
that no non-audit services will be provided by the 
External Auditors without the prior approval of the  
Audit Committee. The External Auditors have not 
provided any non-audit services in 2017 .
The Audit Committee, having conducted a review of the 
External Auditors, concluded that the External Auditors 
have performed in a satisfactory manner and continue 
to be objective and independent and, therefore, has 
recommended to the Board that a resolution be put to 
the shareholders at the 2018 AGM to re-appoint the 
External Auditors.
Internal audit function
Each year the Audit Committee reviews the need  
for an internal audit function and, given the size of  
the Group, continues to be of the opinion that the 
internal audit function is best performed by an external 
audit firm, which complements the services provided 
by the External Auditors. Following a tender process 
in 2015, Grant Thornton UK LLP has been used to 
provide internal audit services in 2017 . The Audit 
Committee agreed the scope for the internal audit, 
reviewed the report received and discussed the 
proposals made with management. Grant Thornton  
UK LLP has provided no other work for the Group  
and, therefore, the Audit Committee has considered 
them to be independent.

Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to present my report on the activities of the Nominations 
Committee for 2017 .
2017 was a busy year for the Nominations Committee. The Committee 
considered succession planning, including the skills and needs, of 
both the Board and the senior management team. The Committee and 
I led the search for the two new Independent Non-Executive Directors 
and I am pleased that the Committee was able to recommend to the 
Board the appointments of D G Robertson and J D Carling. Further 
information on the search process is contained in my report.
The focus in 2018 will be on the succession planning of both the  
Board and the senior management team.
S P Good
Chair of the Nominations Committee
6 April 2018
Composition and operation of the  
Nominations Committee
The Nominations Committee currently comprises the 
Chairman, S P Good (who is its Chair), and the four 
independent Non-Executive Directors. The quorum  
for meetings of the Committee is two independent 
Non-Executive Directors.
The Nominations Committee operates within a defined 
set of Terms of Reference from the Board and is 
responsible for putting in place succession plans for 
the Board, reviewing the continuation in office of the 
Directors and managing the recruitment of new Board 
members within a specification set by the Board.  
The Committee met on eight occasions in 2017 to 
perform its duties as set out in its Terms of Reference. 
The Terms of Reference were last updated in March 
2014 and may be found on the Company’s website.
Appointments of the two new  
independent Non-Executive Directors
In 2017 , two searches were made for the two recent 
appointments of independent Non-Executive Directors 
to the Board. The process started with role profiles for 
the positions being drafted by the Chairman, setting 
out the desired skills and experience required for each 
position. These profiles were then circulated to the 
other members of the Nominations Committee and 
the Executive Directors for comment. Once the role 
profiles were agreed, either a non-executive director 
recruitment consultant was briefed to undertake the 
search or a specialist online senior executive and 
non-executive recruitment platform was used to 
advertise the position. Initial interviews of the shortlisted 
candidates were undertaken by the Chairman and 
the second round of interviews were undertaken by 
two other members of the Nominations Committee 
followed by a meeting with the Group CEO. Before 
the candidate was invited to join the Board, all other 
members of the Board were given the opportunity to 
meet or speak on the telephone with the candidate.
In relation to the appointment of D G Robertson, 
Chair of the Audit Committee, it was agreed that the 
candidate should have public company experience 
as a CFO of a larger listed public company, should 
not currently be a full-time executive and, ideally, 
should already have gained experience of being a 
non-executive director, preferably, as chair of an audit 
committee. A recruitment consultant was briefed to 
undertake the search as it was believed that such  
a consultant would have a wider pool of candidates 
that met the role profile than other channels.
In relation to the appointment of J D Carling, as he 
would be replacing R J Clowes as a Non-Executive 
Director, it was agreed that the candidate should have 
an engineering or science-based background and 
extensive operational experience in manufacturing 
businesses. A good short list was developed, using  
an on-line recruitment platform, from which J D Carling 
was selected.
Senior Independent Non-Executive Director
The Nominations Committee has recommended to the 
Board that D G Robertson replace R J Clowes as the 
Senior Independent Director at the conclusion of the 
2018 AGM scheduled for 16 May 2018.

Directors’ Remuneration Policy
We received good support at the 2017 AGM on the 
resolution to approve the Directors’ Remuneration 
Policy (91.85% in favour), but we recognise that 
some votes were cast against the resolution. We 
consulted with our major shareholders on the Policy 
and we did amend our original proposals to ensure, 
as far as possible, that the Policy struck the right 
balance between our long-term strategic ambitions 
and the wider interests of the shareholders and was 
appropriate in the current climate towards executive 
remuneration. 
In addition to shaping the remuneration for the 
Executives on the Board, the Policy sets the tone 
for the remuneration of the entire senior team. While 
the business continues to grow we need to be able 
to recruit, incentivise and retain Executives of a high 
calibre. 
We will continue to engage with shareholders as 
necessary and will consider the feedback that has 
been and will be provided.
Activities of the Remuneration Committee  
during 2017
On page 56 of the remuneration report we have set out 
the main activities of the Remuneration Committee in 
2017 . In addition to these the Committee did look at the 
bonus arrangements offered to the wider workforce in 
the UK. This will be considered further in 2018.
Base salaries reviewed to represent a more 
balanced approach going forward
I noted in my Annual Statement last year that we 
propose to increase on 1 April 2018 the base salaries 
of the Group CEO by 6% to £253,000 and of the 
Group CFO by 9% to £170,500, subject to continued 
strong performance by the Group and the Executives. 
The Remuneration Committee has considered 
whether these proposed increases are warranted 
and the Committee believes, in light of the Group’s 
strong performance in 2017 and the Executives’ own 
performance, that they are warranted. The increases 
will have already been implemented by the time of the 
AGM on 16 May 2018.
Group performance for 2017 and annual bonus
The Group’s profit before tax and exceptional item was 
£8.81m, compared to £7 .23m in 2016. This is a strong 
set of results, which is ahead of market expectations. 
There will be a full pay out for this element of the annual 
bonus for the Executive Directors. HPP segment sales 
for 2017 were £12.62m, under a separate definition of 
such sales by the Remuneration Committee, which 
resulted in only 4.42% of the maximum opportunity 
of 15% for this element of the annual bonus being 
achieved. The Executive Directors have also made 
good progress in building operational capability, 
in delivering the strategy and on their individual 
objectives. As a consequence, there were pay outs 
on the 2017 annual bonus of 84.4% of the maximum 
opportunity for the Group CEO and 85.4% of the 
maximum opportunity for the Group CFO. Vesting of 
the 2015 LTIP awards will be 57 .95% of the maximum 
opportunity of the 2015 LTIP awards. Whilst basic 
earnings per share before exceptional item (EPS) 
for 2017 was 16.04p, the Remuneration Committee 
decided to eliminate the impact on deferred tax (the 
US net operating losses which are carried forward) 
due to the change in expected future US corporate tax

approved at the 2017 AGM, following 
a thorough process and shareholder 
consultation
Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to present the remuneration report for the year ended  
31 December 2017 .
Introduction
2017 was another busy year for the Remuneration Committee.  
The Committee completed its in-depth review of the Company’s 
approach to executive remuneration, which involved consulting with 
a number of shareholders in the first part of the year and culminated 
with the approval of the new Directors’ Remuneration Policy at the 
Company’s AGM held on 17 May 2017 .
There have been a few changes in the membership of the 
Remuneration Committee, reflecting the changes in the Board.  
M-L Clayton stepped down from the Remuneration Committee  
on 30 September 2017 . D G Robertson joined the Committee on  
8 August 2017 and J D Carling also became a member on  
2 January 2018. Zotefoams plc Annual Report 2017 47

rates, which resulted in an EPS of 16.59p being used 
for calculating the satisfaction of the EPS target for the 
vesting of the 2015 LTIP awards. Further details on the 
annual bonus and the LTIP awards are given on pages 
50 and 51.
Outlook for 2018
The Committee has considered the proposed metrics 
for the 2018 annual bonus and 2018 LTIP awards.
The metrics are set out on pages 48 and 49 of the 
Remuneration report.
The maximum annual bonus for 2018 will continue  
to be 75% of base salary (before salary sacrifice).  
The incentive will be based on an appropriate balance 
of financial and non-financial performance targets 
that support delivery of the strategy. For a number 
of years the Committee has set a target for HPP 
segment sales. As this business is now established, 
the Committee decided that it is no longer appropriate 
to have a sales performance metric for HPP as part of 
the bonus. In 2018 the targets will include profit before 
tax, development of the MEL business, a metric for 
the development of the T-FIT® segment and individual 
objectives. The latter will include a focus on health  
and safety.
The Committee will be granting LTIP awards in April 
2018 of 150% of base salary (before salary sacrifice). 
These awards will be based on the increased salaries 
that become effective on 1 April 2018. The Committee 
decided to use the same performance metrics that 
were used for the LTIP awards granted in 2017 , as the 
Committee continues to believe that EPS (representing 
70% of the award) and relative TSR (representing 30% 
of the award) are the most appropriate measures to 
ensure that management is focused on the delivery of 
profitable growth, which will ultimately deliver long-term 
returns for the shareholders.
Zotefoams plc Approved Share Option Plan 2018
The current approved share option plan was approved 
in 2008 and expires on 8 May 2018. The Committee 
has decided to continue issuing share options to senior 
employees in the UK as a way of incentivising and 
retaining them. It should be noted that the Executive 
Directors are no longer entitled to receive awards of 
approved share options under the current Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy. There is a resolution at this year’s 
AGM to approve the replacement plan (the Zotefoams 
Approved Share Option Plan 2018). Further information 
on the operation of the plan and a summary of the rules 
may be found in the notes and appendix to the notice 
of the AGM on pages 114 to 116.
Conclusion
The Committee will be considering the proposed 
revisions to the UK Corporate Governance Code in 
relation to remuneration matters, as well as other 
developments of best practice in remuneration.
The Committee and I hope you will be able to support 
the resolutions in respect of the Annual Remuneration 
Report and the Zotefoams plc Approved Share Option 
Plan 2018 at the AGM.
I will be available at the AGM to answer any questions 
you may have.

Introduction
Directors’ remuneration report for  
the year ended 31 December 2017
The Directors’ remuneration report has been prepared 
in accordance with the relevant provisions of the 
Listing Rules, section 421 of Companies Act 2006 and 
Schedule 8 to the Large and Medium sized Companies 
and Groups (Accounts and Reports) (Amendment) 
Regulations 2013.
The current Directors’ Remuneration Policy (the 
‘Remuneration Policy’) was approved at the 2017 AGM 
(17 May 2017) and is intended to remain in place until 
the AGM that will be held in 2020. The Remuneration 
Policy has not been included in this Annual Report, but 
may be found on pages 41 to 52 of the 2016 Annual 
Report. A copy of the 2016 Annual Report may be 
found by following this link: http://bit.ly/2HdcbDC
The Annual Report on Remuneration provides details 
on how Directors were paid in 2017 and how the 
Remuneration Committee intends to implement the 
Remuneration Policy in 2018. This section of the report 
will be subject to an advisory shareholder vote at the 
2018 AGM. Zotefoams plc Annual Report 2017 48
Annual report on remuneration
Statement of implementation of the Directors’ Remuneration Policy in 2018 (unaudited)
Base salary and annual bonus
Due to the previous Directors’ Remuneration Policy providing a base remuneration below the market for the 
Executive Directors, upon approval of the new Directors’ Remuneration Policy at the 2017 AGM, the Executive 
Directors’ base salaries were increased, effective 1 April 2017 , by 6% to £238,500 per annum for the Group CEO, 
D B Stirling and by 9% to £156,500 for the Group CFO, G C McGrath.
It was stated in the Annual Statement by the Chair of the Remuneration Committee in the 2016 Annual Report that 
the Executive Directors’ base salaries would be increased in 2018 (effective 1 April) by 6% to £253,000 per annum 
for D B Stirling and by 9% to £170,500 for G C McGrath, subject to continued strong performance by the Executive 
Directors and the Group. The Remuneration Committee has considered the performance of the Group and the 
Executive Directors and is satisfied that the salary increases are warranted.
Budgeted salary increases for the wider employee group are taken into consideration when determining increases 
for the Executive Directors and senior executives, but the Remuneration Committee does not consult with 
employees when formulating the Remuneration Policy for the Executive Directors.
The 2018 salary increase for the wider workforce has not yet been agreed and, in the UK, is subject to negotiation 
with the unions.
For 2018, the maximum opportunity for D B Stirling and G C McGrath in respect of the annual bonus will be 75% 
of base salary (before salary sacrifice).
Awards to the Executive Directors under the annual bonus are subject to a mix of financial, strategic and individual 
performance measures as follows:
Measure
As a percentage of 
maximum bonus opportunity
D B Stirling G C McGrath
Profit before tax 60% 60%
T-FIT
®
 segment sales 10% 5%
Development of MEL business 10% –
Group financing – 15%
Individual objectives 20% 20%
Total 100% 100%
Due to the competitive nature of our industry, the actual target ranges for these measures have not been disclosed 
as they are considered by the Board to be commercially-sensitive information. 
To ensure that bonuses are more closely aligned with business and management performance, the Remuneration 
Committee will use the budgeted foreign exchange rates for the translation of foreign exchange balances when 
determining bonus awards for the profit before tax element of the annual bonus in 2018. Transactional exposures 
are managed by management within the Group’s hedging policy and, therefore, are assessed at actual rates,  
net of hedging.
The individual objectives are specific and measurable and are linked to the Company’s strategic priorities. They 
include targets for health and safety performance, key investment projects, organisation development and specific 
strategic targets.
Benefits
Executive Directors will be provided with a car allowance, private medical insurance, death-in-service cover and,  
if they participate in the SIP , Matching Shares.
Retirement benefits
For 2018, contributions to the defined contribution pension plan (or cash alternative payments) are as follows:
 D B Stirling – 15.75% pensionable salary. 
 G C McGrath – 5.0% pensionable salary (before salary sacrifice). 
LTIP
In April 2018, the Executive Directors will receive awards for the conditional right to acquire shares under the LTIP 
equal to 150% of base salary (before salary sacrifice).
The 2018 awards will be subject to two performance measures: (i) relative TSR performance measured 
against the FTSE SmallCap Index (excluding investment trusts), which will represent 30% of the award; and (ii) 
EPS performance, which will represent 70% of the award vesting. TSR will be measured over the three-year 
performance period with a three-month average at the start and end of the performance period. If performance 
is below the TSR trigger point then no part of the TSR award will vest. If the performance is below the EPS trigger 
point then no part of the EPS award will vest. Between the trigger point and the maximum, the award vests on a 
sliding scale basis.

Base salary and pension contributions
The Company operates a Defined Contribution (‘DC’) Pension Plan, where individuals can elect to change their 
contract of employment under a salary sacrifice arrangement, whereby their salary is reduced and the Company 
makes a corresponding contribution into their DC Pension Plan. G C McGrath opted for the salary sacrifice 
scheme and the amounts shown for his base salary are after salary sacrifice. Similarly, the amounts shown for 
pension include the amounts of salary sacrificed. At 31 December 2017 , the base salary (before salary sacrifice)  
for G C McGrath was £156,500 pa (£143,500 as at 31 December 2016).
As D B Stirling has approached his lifetime pension limit, since September 2016 both he and the Company ceased 
contributing to his DC Pension Plan. Instead, D B Stirling receives a cash contribution in lieu of contributions to 
his DC Pension Plan. Before September 2016, D B Stirling made contributions to his DC Pension Plan via a salary 
sacrifice scheme as described above. The salary sacrifice arrangement ceased as from September 2016.  
At 31 December 2017 , the base salary for D B Stirling was £238,500 pa (£225,000 pa as at 31 December 2016).
Benefits
Benefits include a company car allowance, private medical insurance and the value of the Matching Shares (at 
dates when awarded) acquired during the year under the SIP .

The Committee is satisfied with the overall payments in light of the level of performance achieved.
LTIP
The LTIP awards made under the Zotefoams plc 2007 Long-Term Incentive Plan are subject to performance and 
service conditions. 50% of the award is subject to growth in absolute Total Shareholder Return (‘TSR’) and 50% 
subject to EPS growth. Performance is measured over a three-year period and a proportion of the restricted 
shares will be released to the participant, to the extent that TSR and EPS targets over the period have been met, 
together with additional shares that represent the dividends that would have been paid during the performance 
period on the restricted shares that have been released.
The total award vesting is the sum of the awards for TSR and EPS. If the performance is below the EPS trigger 
point then no part of the EPS award vests. If performance is below the TSR trigger point then no part of the TSR 
award vests. Between the trigger point and the maximum, the award vests on a sliding scale basis.
The table below summarises the performance criteria for the 2015 award, which is due to vest on 30 March 2018.

The targets for absolute TSR growth and EPS were both partially met. Absolute TSR growth was 20.0% pa and 
EPS was 16.59p (please refer to the paragraph headed “Group performance for 2017 and annual bonus” in the 
Statement of the Chair of the Remuneration Committee on page 46). Therefore, 57 .95% of the award will vest, 
which will be increased to reflect the dividends paid during the performance period. Zotefoams plc Annual Report 2017 52

Notes
(1)  The pension entitlement shown is that which would be paid annually on retirement at normal retirement age (or immediately upon late retirement 
where applicable), based on service to 31 December 2005 (the date the DB Scheme was closed to future accrual), including increases to the year 
end, but excluding any future increases under the rules of the DB Scheme. This also does not take into account the legal advice obtained in 2017, 
that the linkage with future increases in salary had not been broken when the DB Scheme closed to future accrual. Please refer to the Group CFO’s 
review on page 22 for further information.
(2)  As required by the Regulations, the pension input amount has been calculated using the method set out in section 229 of the Finance Act 2004(a) 
where: 
– ‘Pension input period’ is the year ended 31 December 2017; and 
– in the application of section 234 of the Act, the figure 20 is substituted for the figure 16. 
The following is additional information relating to the Director’s pension from the DB Scheme:
(a)  Before the DB Scheme closed, members had the option of paying Additional Voluntary Contributions (‘AVCs’). The value of these AVCs has been 
excluded from the above figures. 
(b)  Normal retirement age is 65. 
(c)  On death before retirement, a spouse’s pension is payable of one half of the member’s preserved pension at leaving, revalued from leaving to the 
date of death. On death in retirement, a spouse’s pension is payable of one half of the member’s pension at death, without reduction for any part of 
the member’s pension commuted for cash at retirement. 
(d)  Members’ Guaranteed Minimum Pensions increase at statutory rates. Other pensions increase in payment at 5% pa, or the increase in the Retail 
Prices Index if lower. 
(e)  From 1 January 2006, active employee members were able to pay contributions to the DC Pension Plan set up by the Company in order to receive 
retirement benefits. The Company also contributes to this arrangement. Details of the contributions made into this Plan have been disclosed in the 
single figure calculation and are not included in the above disclosure. 
Payments made to past Directors (audited)
The only payments made to past Directors were in relation to the vesting of C G Hurst’s LTIP awards. C G Hurst 
left the Company on 16 May 2016 and his outstanding LTIP awards, which were granted in 2014 and 2015, were 
pro-rated to reflect him leaving part the way through their respective performance periods. The LTIP awards vest at 
their normal times subject to the performance conditions being met. The 2014 LTIP award vested on 7 April 2017 
and C G Hurst’s shares were sold on 10 April 2017 for £56,412. This is considered to be remuneration in respect 
of 2016. The 2015 LTIP award is due to vest on 30 March 2018 and has been valued at £54,935, by using the 
average share price over the three months to 31 December 2017 (£3.892), and is considered to be remuneration  
in respect of 2017 .

Statement of Directors’ shareholding and share interests (audited)
In 2014 the Remuneration Committee introduced a policy requiring Executive Directors to hold a shareholding 
equivalent to 100% of base salary, with a five-year period to build up to this holding from introduction of the policy 
or becoming an Executive Director. This policy was updated in 2017 (adopted at the 2017 AGM) and now requires 
Executive Directors to hold a shareholding equivalent of 200% of base salary, with a five-year period to build up 
this holding from: (1) appointment to the Board, or (2) the date of the 2017 AGM (17 May 2017) for the current 
Executive Directors. The new policy also requires the shares to be held for one year following cessation  
of employment with the Group. Throughout 2017 , D B Stirling complied with both the old and new policies.  
G C McGrath, who only joined the Group on 1 December 2015, has until 17 May 2022 to build up a shareholding 
to comply with the new policy.

Change in remuneration of the Group CEO (unaudited)
The table below illustrates the percentage change in salary and benefits for the Group CEO and the UK workforce.
The employee subset consists of an average of the UK workforce employees for the period under review. This 
group has been selected as the Group CEO is based in the UK and this employee representative group is the 
largest group of employees within the organisation.

Employee subset 2.5 – 33.3
The employees’ salary review is negotiated with the unions and a 2.5% increase was agreed in relation to 2017 . 
The 2018 salary review for the employees has not yet been agreed.
There was a 0.6% increase in the taxable benefits for the Group CEO, which is due to an increase in the  
premium for the private medical insurance for the Group CEO. The majority of employees do not receive any 
taxable benefits.
The maximum opportunity for the Group CEO’s annual bonus in 2016 was 100% of base salary, whereas in 2017 
it was 75% of base salary. The change of 15.1% has been calculated on the basis that the pay out for the 2017 
annual bonus is equivalent to 63.3% of base salary, compared to the pay out of 55.0% of base salary in 2016.  
The staff bonus in the UK was 3.75% of base salary, in relation to 2016, and 5.00% of base salary for 2017 .

Committee role and advisers (unaudited)
The Group has established a Remuneration Committee, which is constituted in accordance with the 
recommendations of the UK Corporate Governance Code. A C Bromfield, R J Clowes, and S P Good were 
members of the Committee throughout 2017 to the date of this report. M-L Clayton was also a member until 
she retired on 30 September 2017 . D G Robertson was appointed a member on 8 August 2017 and J D Carling 
on 2 January 2018. All the members are independent Non-Executive Directors, with the exception of S P Good, 
who was independent on appointment as Chairman of the Group. The Committee was chaired by A C Bromfield 
throughout the year. The Committee’s Terms of Reference were last updated in March 2014 and may be found on 
the Group’s website.
None of the Committee members have any personal financial interest (other than fees paid as disclosed on page 
49 and as shareholders) in the Company, nor do they have any interests that may conflict with those of the Group, 
such as cross directorships. None of the Committee members are involved in the day-to-day management of the 
business. The Committee makes recommendations to the Board on remuneration matters. No Director is involved 
in any decision concerning his or her own remuneration.
The Remuneration Committee met eight times in 2017 and, at the invitation of the Committee, the Group CEO 
attended on four occasions to give background information on remuneration matters. The Committee was also 
advised by the Group CFO as regards the level of completion of the performance targets. The secretary to the 
Committee is the Company Secretary.
In 2017 , the Remuneration Committee considered the following matters:
  completing a wholesale review of the remuneration strategy for the Executive Team and finalising the creation 
of the new Directors’ Remuneration Policy, which included consulting with a number of the Group’s largest 
shareholders; 
  the Directors’ remuneration report for 2016 and relevant matters; 
  the annual bonuses for the Executive team and the employees; 
  the grant of HMRC Approved Share Options; 
  the grant of awards under the Long-Term Incentive Plan and the Deferred Bonus Share Plan and the vesting  
of awards made in 2014 under the Long-Term Incentive Plan; 
  the salary review of the Executive Team and the Company Secretary; 
  evaluating its effectiveness, in particular in formulating the new Directors’ Remuneration Policy and the services 
provided by the remuneration consultant; 
  bonus arrangements for the UK workforce; 
  considering new rules for the Long-Term Incentive Plan, the Deferred Bonus Share Plan and the Annual Bonus 
Plan;
  reviewing pension matters for the UK workforce; and
  performance targets to be used for the 2018 Directors’ annual bonus and Long-Term Incentive Plan awards.
Deloitte LLP was engaged in 2016 to assist and provide advice to the Remuneration Committee in creating the 
new Directors’ Remuneration Policy, which was approved at the 2017 AGM. Deloitte LLP’s engagement continued 
into 2017 to finalise the Directors’ Remuneration Policy. Deloitte LLP is a member of the Remuneration Consultants 
Group and adheres to its Code on executive remuneration consulting in the UK.

Directors’ report
The Directors present their Annual  
Report and audited consolidated

31 December 2017
Results and dividends
Profit attributable to shareholders for the year 
amounted to £6.01m (2016: £5.80m). An interim 
dividend of 1.91p (2016: 1.85p) per share was paid 
on 12 October 2017 . The Directors recommend that 
a final dividend of 4.02p (2016: 3.90p) per share be 
paid on 24 May 2018 to shareholders who are on the 
Company’s register at the close of business on 20 April 
2018. This makes a total dividend of 5.93p per share 
for the year (2016: 5.75p). For further information on the 
performance of the entity refer to the Strategic Report.
Directors
The appointment, replacement and powers of the 
Directors are governed by the Company’s Articles 
of Association (the ‘Articles’), the UK Corporate 
Governance Code, the Companies Act 2006, prevailing 
legislation and resolutions passed at the Annual 
General Meeting (‘AGM’) or other general meetings of 
the Company.
The current Directors named on pages 36 and 37 
served throughout the year, with the exception of  
D G Robertson, who was appointed on 8 August 2017 , 
and J D Carling, who was appointed on 2 January 
2018. M-L Clayton retired on 30 September 2017 . 
The Articles give the Directors power to appoint and 
replace Directors. Under the Terms of Reference of 
the Nominations Committee, any appointment must 
be recommended by the Nominations Committee for 
approval by the Board of Directors. The Articles also 
require Directors to retire and, if they so wish, submit 
themselves for election at the first AGM following their 
appointment and normally every three years thereafter. 
As has been the case for the last few AGMs, the Board 
has decided to follow best practice and all Directors 
will stand for annual re-election at this year’s AGM, 
notwithstanding that this specific requirement in the UK 
Corporate Governance Code currently only applies to 
FTSE 350 companies.
D B Stirling and G C McGrath, the Executive Directors, 
have service contracts which are terminable on 12 
months’ written notice. All the other Directors have 
letters of appointment which are terminable on six 
months’ written notice.
The Company has issued Deeds of Indemnity in 
favour of all of the Directors. These Deeds were in 
force throughout the year ended 31 December 2017 
and remain in force as at the date of this report. 
These Deeds, as well as the service contracts and 
the Company’s Articles of Association, are available 
for inspection during normal business hours at the 
Company’s registered office and will be available at the 
AGM and 15 minutes before the meeting.
Conflicts of interest
All Directors submit details to the Company Secretary 
of any new situations, or changes to existing ones, 
which may give rise to an actual or potential conflict 
of interest with those of the Company. On an annual 
basis, the Company Secretary seeks confirmation 
from the Directors of their interests, which are reviewed 
by the Board and, where considered appropriate, 
approved by the Board.
Where an actual, or potential, conflict is approved 
by the Board, the Board will normally authorise the 
situation on the condition that the Director concerned 
abstains from participating in any discussion or 
decision affected by the conflicted matter. Authorisation 
of a conflict is only given by Directors who are not 
interested in the matter.
Amendment to the Articles of Association
The Company’s Articles of Association may only be 
amended by a special resolution of the shareholders 
passed in general meeting.
Corporate governance
The Corporate governance report on pages 38 to 60 
should be read as forming part of the Directors’ Report.
Employees
To ensure employee welfare, the Group has 
documented, and well publicised, policies on 
occupational health and safety, the environment and 
training. The Group operates an equal-opportunities, 
single-status employment policy, together with an 
open management style. The Company operates to 
a number of recognised industry standards including 
Quality (ISO 9001), Environmental (ISO 14001) and 
Occupational Health and Safety (OHSAS 18001).
Zotefoams operates an equal opportunities policy and 
we believe diversity (ethnicity, age, gender, language, 
sexual orientation, gender re-orientation, religion, 
socio-economic status, personality and ability) of the 
employees promotes a better working environment, 
which in turn leads to innovation and business 
success. Applications for employment by disabled 
persons are always fully considered and, in the event 
of an employee becoming disabled, every effort is 
made to ensure that their employment with Zotefoams 
continues and that appropriate training is provided 
where necessary. Zotefoams’ policy is that the training, 
career development and promotion of disabled 
persons should, as far as possible, be identical to that 
of other employees.
Zotefoams places considerable value on the involvement 
of its people and holds formal and informal meetings 
to brief them on matters affecting them as employees 
and on the various factors affecting the performance 
of the Group. In the UK, there is a Joint Consultative 
Committee (‘ JCC’), which comprises an employee 
representative from each department. The JCC meets 
regularly and considers a wide range of matters 
affecting the employees’ current and future interests. Zotefoams plc Annual Report 2017 58
In order to encourage employees to share in the 
successes of Zotefoams, an all-employee share 
incentive plan was established in 2015 in the UK, where 
employees can purchase shares each month through 
the plan. For every four shares bought, the employee  
is awarded one further share, which normally vests  
on the third anniversary of it being awarded.
Human rights
Whilst Zotefoams does not, at present, have a specific 
policy on human rights, it recognises and respects all 
human rights as defined in international conventions. 
We conduct every aspect of our business with honesty, 
integrity and openness, respecting human rights and 
the interests of our employees, customers and third 
parties, according to the principles set out in our Ethics 
Policy, where we state that we will respect the human 
rights of all our employees, including:
  ensuring our employees have the freedom to join 
a union, associate or bargain collectively without 
fear of discrimination against the exercising of such 
freedoms; 
  not using forced labour or child labour; and 
  respecting the rights of privacy of our employees 
and protecting access and use of their personal 
information. 
Supporting our Ethics Policy, we also have an Equal 
Opportunities Policy and a Dignity at Work Policy, 
which promote the right of every employee to be 
treated with dignity and respect and not be harassed 
or bullied on any grounds. We aim to ensure that goods 
and services are from sources that do not jeopardise 
human rights, safety or the environment, and expect 
our suppliers to observe business principles consistent 
with our own. Zotefoams published on its website on 
16 May 2017 its first statement on the steps it has taken 
to ensure that its supply chains are free of modern 
slavery. This may be found at the following address: 
http://bit.ly/2q8VvXR
Business ethics
Zotefoams is committed to high standards of business 
conduct and seeks to maintain these standards across 
all of our operations throughout the world. Under our 
Ethics Policy, we state that we will:
  operate within the law; 
  not tolerate any discrimination or harassment; 
  not make any political donations; 
  not make or receive bribes; 
  avoid situations that might give rise to conflicts  
of interest; 
  not enter into any activity that might be considered 
anti-competitive; 
  aim to be a responsible company within our local 
communities; and 
  support and encourage our employees to report,  
in confidence, any suspicions of wrongdoing. 
Supporting our Ethics Policy, we have policies on 
anti-bribery and corruption, anti-fraud, anti-competitive 
behaviour, employee share trading and whistleblowing.

Research and development
The amount spent by the Group on R&D in the year 
was £1,363,000 (2015: £1,001,000). In the opinion 
of the Directors £156,000 (2016: £198,000) of this 
expenditure met the requirements for capitalisation 
under IAS 38, while £1,207 ,000 (2016: £803,000) 
did not and was consequently expensed in the 
Consolidated income statement.

Share capital and reserves
The Company has one class of ordinary shares, which 
has no right to fixed income. Each share carries the 
right, on a poll, to one vote at general meetings of the 
Company. There are no specific restrictions on the size 
of a holding nor on the transfer of shares, which are 
both governed by the general provisions of the Articles 
of Association and prevailing legislation. The Directors 
are not aware of any agreements between holders of 
the Company’s shares that may result in restrictions on 
the transfer of securities or on voting rights. No person 
has any special rights of control over the Company’s 
share capital and all issued shares are fully paid.
At 31 December 2017 , the Zotefoams Employees’ 
Benefit Trust (‘EBT’) held 521,351 shares (approximately 
1.17% of the issued share capital) (2016: 628,979 
shares, approximately 1.42% of the issued share 
capital at 31 December 2016) to satisfy share plans as 
described in the Directors’ remuneration report. During 
the year, the EBT released 107 ,628 shares in respect of 
these share plans and no shares were bought by the 
EBT during the year. In accordance with best practice, 
the voting rights on the shares held in the EBT are not 
exercised and the right to receive dividends has been 
waived. However, due to a clerical error on the part of 
the EBT in failing to release in time 22,930 shares to 
two beneficiaries before the record date (21 April 2017) 
for the 2016 final dividend paid on 25 May 2017 , the 
trustee of the EBT did not waive its right to receive a 
dividend over 22,930 shares in order that it could pass 
on the dividends received on these shares to the two 
beneficiaries.
At the AGM held on 17 May 2017 , authority was 
given to the Directors to allot unissued shares in the 
Company up to a maximum amount equivalent to 
approximately two-thirds of the issued share capital of 
the Company. Authority was also given to the Directors 
to allot equity securities in the Company for cash 
without regard to the pre-emption provisions of the 
Companies Act 2006. At the date of this Report neither 
authority has been used and they both expire at the 
AGM to be held on 16 May 2018. The Directors seek 
new authorities for a further year.
The Company was given authority at the 2017 AGM to 
purchase up to 4,441,444 of its ordinary shares. This 
authority will also expire on 16 May 2018 and, at the 
date of this Report, had not been used. In accordance 
with normal practice for listed companies, a special 
resolution will be proposed at this year’s AGM to seek 
a new authority to make market purchases up to a 
maximum of 10% of the issued share capital of the 
Company.

Details of the joint ventures, subsidiaries and branches 
within the Group are given in notes 10 and 13 of  
the financial statements.

Information in respect of the Group’s policies on 
financial risk management objectives, including  
policies for hedging, as well as an indication of

Group CEO’s strategic review.
Greenhouse gas emissions
Information on the Group’s greenhouse gas emissions 
may be found in the Sustainability report on pages 32

Pension schemes
The Company closed its defined benefit pension 
scheme to future accrual of benefit in December 2005 
although, as mentioned in the Group CFO’s review 
and having taken recent legal advice regarding the 
closure of the scheme, it has transpired that, whilst 
the scheme was properly closed to future accrual of 
benefit, the linkage with future increases in salary had 
not been broken. An exercise is currently underway to 
obtain consent of the deferred members who are still in 
service with the Company to break this linkage.
Employees are offered membership of one of a number 
of defined contribution pension schemes.
Finance costs capitalised
Refer to note 11 of the financial statements for details  
of borrowing costs capitalised by the Group. 
Disclosure of information to Auditors
The Directors who held office at the date of approval 
of this Directors’ report confirm that, in so far as they 
are each aware, there is no relevant audit information 
of which the Company’s Auditors are unaware, and 
each Director has taken all the steps that they ought to 
have taken as a Director to make themselves aware of 
any relevant audit information and to establish that the 
Company’s Auditors are aware of that information.
Independent auditors
A resolution to re-appoint PricewaterhouseCoopers 
LLP as the Company’s Auditors will be proposed at  
the forthcoming AGM.

6 April 2018 Zotefoams plc Annual Report 2017 60
Statement of directors’ responsibilities  
in respect of the annual report 
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual 
Report, Remuneration Report and the financial 
statements in accordance with applicable law and 
regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial 
statements for each financial year. Under that law 
the Directors have prepared the Consolidated and 
Company financial statements in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRSs’) as 
adopted by the European Union. Under company law 
the Directors must not approve the financial statements 
unless they are satisfied that they give a true and 
fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and the 
Company and of the profit or loss of the Group for that 
period. In preparing these financial statements, the 
Directors are required to:
  select suitable accounting policies and then apply 
them consistently;
  make judgements and accounting estimates that  
are reasonable and prudent;
  state whether applicable IFRSs as adopted by  
the European Union have been followed, subject  
to any material departures disclosed and explained  
in the financial statements; and
  prepare the financial statements on the going 
concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume 
that the Group will continue in business.
The Directors consider the Annual Report,  
taken as a whole, to be fair, balanced and 
understandable and provides the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s 
performance, business model and strategy.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate 
accounting records that are sufficient to show and 
explain the Group’s transactions and disclose, 
with reasonable accuracy, at any time, the financial 
position of the Company and the Group and enable 
them to ensure that the financial statements and the’ 
Remuneration Report comply with the Companies 
Act 2006 and, as regards the Consolidated financial 
statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. They 
are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of 
the Company and the Group and hence for taking 
reasonable steps for the prevention and detection  
of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance 
and integrity of the Group’s website. Legislation in 
the United Kingdom governing the preparation and 
dissemination of financial statements may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions.
Each of the Directors, whose names and functions 
are listed on pages 36 and 37 of the Annual Report, 
confirms that, to the best of their knowledge:
  the Consolidated financial statements, which have 
been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted 
by the EU, give a true and fair view of the assets, 
liabilities, financial position and profit of the Group;

Report on the audit of the financial statements
Opinion
In our opinion, Zotefoams plc’s Consolidated financial statements and Company financial statements (the “financial statements”):
  give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the Company’s affairs as at 31 December 2017 and of the Group’s profit and the Group’s  
and the Company’s cash flows for the year then ended;
  have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and, as regards the Company’s financial statements,  
as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and
  have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Consolidated financial statements, Article 4  
of the IAS Regulation.
We have audited the financial statements, included within the Annual Report, which comprise: the Consolidated and Company statements of financial 
position as at 31 December 2017; the Consolidated income statement and statement of comprehensive income, the Consolidated and Company 
statements of cash flows, and the Consolidated and Company statements of changes in equity for the year then ended; and the notes to the financial 
statements, which include a description of the significant accounting policies.
Our opinion is consistent with our reporting to the Audit Committee.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (“ISAs (UK)”) and applicable law. Our responsibilities under ISAs (UK) 
are further described in the Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. We believe that the audit evidence we 
have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Independence
We remained independent of the Group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in  
the UK, which includes the FRC’s Ethical Standard, as applicable to listed public interest entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities  
in accordance with these requirements.
To the best of our knowledge and belief, we declare that non-audit services prohibited by the FRC’s Ethical Standard were not provided to the Group  
or the Company.
We have provided no non-audit services to the Group or the Company in the period from 1 January 2017 to 31 December 2017 .
Our audit approach
Materiality
Audit scope
Areas of
focus
Overview
  Overall Group materiality: £400,000 (2016: £350,000), based on 4.5% of profit before tax and exceptional item.
  Overall Company materiality: £350,000 (2016: £290,000), based on 4% of profit before tax and exceptional item.
  There are eight trading companies (including joint ventures) within the Zotefoams plc consolidated financial statements, 
two based in the UK, three in the USA and three in Asia. 
  We conducted an audit of full year financial information on three trading companies, Zotefoams plc in the UK and 
Zotefoams Inc. and MuCell Extrusion LLC in the USA. We visited these trading companies as part of our audit 
procedures.
  The trading companies where we performed full audit procedures accounted for 95% of the Group’s profit before tax  
and exceptional item.
  Impairment of intangible assets of MuCell Extrusion LLC (Group).
  Defined benefit pension scheme assumptions (Group and Company).
The scope of our audit
As part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements. In particular, we 
looked at where the Directors made subjective judgements, for example in respect of significant accounting estimates that involved making assumptions 
and considering future events that are inherently uncertain. 
We gained an understanding of the legal and regulatory framework applicable to the Group and the industry in which it operates, and considered 
the risk of acts by the Group which were contrary to applicable laws and regulations, including fraud. We designed audit procedures at Group and 
significant component level to respond to the risk, recognising that the risk of not detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk 
of not detecting one resulting from error, as fraud may involve deliberate concealment by, for example, forgery or intentional misrepresentations, or 
through collusion. We focused on laws and regulations that could give rise to a material misstatement in the Group and Company financial statements, 
including, but not limited to, the Companies Act 2006, the Listing Rules, Pensions legislation, UK tax legislation and equivalent local laws and regulations 
applicable to the significant components. Our tests included, but were not limited to, review of the financial statement disclosures to underlying supporting 
documentation, review of correspondence with legal advisors and enquiries of management. There are inherent limitations in the audit procedures 
described above and the further removed non-compliance with laws and regulations is from the events and transactions reflected in the financial 
statements, the less likely we would become aware of it. Zotefoams plc Annual Report 2017 62
Independent auditors’ report to the members of 
Zotefoams plc Continued
We did not identify any key audit matters relating to irregularities, including fraud. As in all of our audits we also addressed the risk of management override 
of internal controls, including testing journals and evaluating whether there was evidence of bias by the Directors that represented a risk of material 
misstatement due to fraud. 
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in the auditors’ professional judgement, were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the 
current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) identified by the auditors, including 
those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement 
team. These matters, and any comments we make on the results of our procedures thereon, were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial 
statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. This is not a complete list of all 
risks identified by our audit. 
Key audit matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter
Impairment of intangible assets of MuCell Extrusion LLC
The Group’s consolidated statement of financial position as at 31 
December 2017 includes goodwill of £2.3m, which arose on the acquisition 
of MuCell Extrusion LLC (‘MuCell’) in a previous accounting period, and 
other intangible assets of £2.5m.
The carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets is contingent on 
future cash flows. There is a risk that, if these cash flows do not meet the 
Group’s expectations, these intangible assets will be impaired. It is noted  
at this time that MuCell continues to be loss making.
The impairment reviews performed by the Group contain a number of 
significant judgements and estimates including revenue growth, profit 
margins, and long-term growth and discount rates. Changes in these 
assumptions can have a significant impact on the headroom available  
in the impairment calculations.
The above factors represent a risk that the balance of goodwill and  
other intangible assets relating to MuCell could be misstated.
We obtained the Group’s impairment analyses and tested the 
reasonableness of key assumptions, including profit and cash flow growth 
or decline, terminal values and the discount rate. We also involved our 
valuations experts to benchmark the discount rate used by management  
in the impairment analyses.
We challenged management to substantiate its assumptions, including a 
‘look-back’ analysis to compare management’s assumptions per prior year 
budgets with the current year’s actuals. We also verified the underlying 
forecasts to Board-approved budgets and assessed how these budgets 
were compiled.
We verified the integrity and mathematical accuracy of supporting 
calculations. We obtained and evaluated management’s sensitivity 
analyses to ascertain the impact of changes in key assumptions and 
we performed our own independent sensitivity calculations to quantify 
the downside changes to management’s models required to result in 
impairment.
As a result of our work, we determined that the carrying values of goodwill 
and intangible assets are appropriate in the context of the Consolidated 
financial statements taken as a whole.
We reviewed the disclosures made in the financial statements, including 
sensitivity analysis and the reasonably possible downsides. We are 
satisfied that these disclosures are appropriate.
Defined benefit pension scheme assumptions
The Company’s closed defined benefit pension scheme represents 
one of the largest liabilities on the statement of financial position as at 
31 December 2017 with a net liability of £6.2m.
The valuation of the scheme’s liabilities requires management to apply their 
judgement in making a number of key assumptions, being the rates of 
inflation (Consumer Price Index and Retail Price Index), the discount rate, 
and the life expectancy of scheme members. In addition, judgement is 
required when determining the impact of the apparent failure to break the 
linkage between accrued benefits and final pensionable salary on closure 
of the scheme. There is a risk of material misstatement if there are small 
changes in the assumptions, as the liability is highly sensitive.
We involved our pensions experts to evaluate and benchmark the key 
assumptions applied by management in the determining the scheme’s 
liabilities. We noted that while certain assumptions used by management 
were more optimistic than those used in the prior year, in particular the  
pre-retirement Retail Price Index (‘RPI’) inflation rate, overall the 
assumptions applied are considered reasonable.
We also reviewed the calculations for the additional liability arising from the 
failure to break the linkage between accrued benefits and final pensionable 
salary on closure of the scheme and consider the amounts recognised  
to be reasonable.
Based on the procedures performed, we did not identify any material 
misstatements in the defined benefit pension obligation at the year-end.
We reviewed the disclosures made in the financial statements and are 
satisfied that these disclosures are appropriate.

Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
How we tailored the audit scope
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements as a whole,  
taking into account the structure of the Group and the Company, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which they operate.
All the work was performed by the Group engagement team.  
Of the eight trading companies (including joint ventures), three of these are considered to be significant components of the Group, Zotefoams plc in  
the UK, Zotefoams Inc. and MuCell Extrusion LLC in the USA, on which we have performed full-scope audits, all of which are 100%-owned subsidiaries  
of the Group.
Materiality
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality. These, together with 
qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures on the individual 
financial statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating the effect of misstatements, both individually and in aggregate on the financial statements 
as a whole. 
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:
Consolidated financial statements Company financial statements
Overall materiality £400,000 (2016: £350,000). £350,000 (2016: £290,000).
How we determined it 4.5% of profit before tax and exceptional item. 4% of profit before tax and exceptional item.
Rationale for benchmark 
applied
Based on the benchmarks used in the annual report, 
profit before tax and exceptional item is the primary 
measure used by the shareholders in assessing 
the performance of the Group, and is a generally 
accepted auditing benchmark. The exceptional item 
is considered one-off in nature and as such has been 
excluded from the benchmark amount.
Based on the benchmarks used in the annual report, 
profit before tax and exceptional item is the primary 
measure used by the shareholders in assessing the 
performance of the Company, and is a generally 
accepted auditing benchmark. The exceptional item 
is considered one-off in nature and as such has been 
excluded from the benchmark amount.
For each component in the scope of our group audit, we allocated a materiality that is less than our overall group materiality. The range of materiality 
allocated across components was between £200,000 and £350,000. Certain components were audited to a local statutory audit materiality that was  
also less than our overall group materiality.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above £20,000 (Group audit) (2016: £18,000) 
and £20,000 (Company audit) (2016: £18,000) as well as misstatements below those amounts that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative 
reasons.
Going concern
In accordance with ISAs (UK) we report as follows:
Reporting obligation Outcome
We are required to report if we have anything material to add or draw 
attention to in respect of the Directors’ statement in the financial statements 
about whether the Directors considered it appropriate to adopt the going 
concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements and the 
Directors’ identification of any material uncertainties to the Group’s and the 
Company’s ability to continue as a going concern over a period of at least 
twelve months from the date of approval of the financial statements.
We have nothing material to add or to draw attention to. However, because 
not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this statement is not a 
guarantee as to the Group’s and Company’s ability to continue as a going 
concern.
We are required to report if the Directors’ statement relating to Going 
Concern in accordance with Listing Rule 9.8.6R(3) is materially inconsistent 
with our knowledge obtained in the audit.
We have nothing to report. Zotefoams plc Annual Report 2017 64
Independent auditors’ report to the members of 
Zotefoams plc Continued
Reporting on other information 
The other information comprises all of the information in the Annual Report other than the financial statements and our auditors’ report thereon.  
The Directors are responsible for the other information. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, accordingly,  
we do not express an audit opinion or, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in this report, any form of assurance thereon. 
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other 
information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. 
If we identify an apparent material inconsistency or material misstatement, we are required to perform procedures to conclude whether there is a material 
misstatement of the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that 
there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report based on these responsibilities.
With respect to the Strategic Report and Directors’ report, we also considered whether the disclosures required by the UK Companies Act 2006 have 
been included. 
Based on the responsibilities described above and our work undertaken in the course of the audit, the Companies Act 2006, (CA06), ISAs (UK) and the 
Listing Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) require us also to report certain opinions and matters as described below (required by ISAs (UK) 
unless otherwise stated).
Strategic Report and Directors’ report
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit, the information given in the Strategic Report and Directors’ report for the year 
ended 31 December 2017 is consistent with the financial statements and has been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements. (CA06)
In light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and Company and their environment obtained in the course of the audit, we did not identify any 
material misstatements in the Strategic Report and Directors’ report. (CA06)
The Directors’ assessment of the prospects of the Group and of the principal risks that would threaten the solvency or liquidity of the Group
We have nothing material to add or draw attention to regarding:
  The Directors’ confirmation on page 41 of the Annual Report that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the Company, 
including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity.
  The disclosures in the Annual Report that describe those risks and explain how they are being managed or mitigated.
  The Directors’ explanation on page 24 of the Annual Report as to how they have assessed the prospects of the Group, over what period they have  
done so and why they consider that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have a reasonable expectation that the Group  
will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their assessment, including any related disclosures drawing 
attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.
We have nothing to report having performed a review of the Directors’ statement that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks 
facing the Group and statement in relation to the longer-term viability of the Group. Our review was substantially less in scope than an audit and only 
consisted of making inquiries and considering the Directors’ process supporting their statements; checking that the statements are in alignment with the 
relevant provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code (the “Code”); and considering whether the statements are consistent with the knowledge and 
understanding of the Group and Company and their environment obtained in the course of the audit. (Listing Rules)
Other Code Provisions
We have nothing to report in respect of our responsibility to report when: 
  The statement given by the Directors, on page 60, that they consider the Annual Report taken as a whole to be fair, balanced and understandable,  
and provides the information necessary for the members to assess the Group’s and Company’s position and performance, business model and 
strategy is materially inconsistent with our knowledge of the Group and Company obtained in the course of performing our audit.
  The section of the Annual Report on pages 42 to 44 describing the work of the Audit Committee does not appropriately address matters 
communicated by us to the Audit Committee.
  The Directors’ statement relating to the Company’s compliance with the Code does not properly disclose a departure from a relevant provision  
of the Code specified, under the Listing Rules, for review by the auditors. Zotefoams plc Annual Report 2017 65
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
Directors’ Remuneration
In our opinion, the part of the Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006. (CA06)
Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit
Responsibilities of the Directors for the financial statements
As explained more fully in the Statement of directors’ responsibilities in respect of the annual report set out on page 60, the Directors are responsible for 
the preparation of the financial statements in accordance with the applicable framework and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. The 
Directors are also responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the Directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s and the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, 
disclosing as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Directors either intend to liquidate 
the Group or the Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to 
fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an 
audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and 
are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the 
basis of these financial statements. 
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the FRC’s website at: www.frc.org.uk/
auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditors’ report.
Use of this report
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the Company’s members as a body in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the 
Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other 
person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
Other required reporting
Companies Act 2006 exception reporting
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
  we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or
  adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not visited 
by us; or
  certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
  the Company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement with the accounting records 
and returns. 
We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility. 
Appointment
Following the recommendation of the audit committee, we were appointed by the Directors on 26 July 2012 to audit the financial statements for the 
year ended 31 December 2012 and subsequent financial periods. The period of total uninterrupted engagement is 6 years, covering the years ended 
31 December 2012 to 31 December 2017 .

Notes
1. General information
Zotefoams plc (the ‘Company’) is a public limited company, which is listed on the London Stock Exchange and incorporated and domiciled in the UK.  
The registered office of the Company is 675 Mitcham Road, Croydon CR9 3AL.
The Company, its subsidiaries and joint venture (together referred to as the ‘Group’) is engaged in the manufacturing and sale of high-performance foams 
and licensing of related technology for specialist markets worldwide.
2. Significant accounting policies
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below. These policies have been consistently applied 
to all of the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
2.1 Basis of preparation
The financial statements of Zotefoams plc have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and IFRS 
Interpretations Committee (IFRS IC) interpretations, as adopted by the European Union and with the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies 
reporting under IFRS. The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention except for derivative financial instruments,  
which are measured at fair value through profit or loss. 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires management  
to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity,  
or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the financial statements, are disclosed in note 26.
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position are set out in the Group CEO’s 
strategic review on pages 7 to 9. The Group CFO’s review on pages 20 to 22 also describes the financial position of the Group, its cash flows and liquidity 
position. In addition, note 21 to the financial statements includes the Group’s objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital, its financial risk 
management objectives, details of its financial instruments and hedging activities, borrowing facilities, and its exposure to credit risk and liquidity risk.  
As a consequence, the Directors believe that the Group is well placed to manage its business risks.
i) Going concern
The Group meets its day-to-day working capital requirements through its banking facilities. The Group’s forecasts and projections, taking account 
of reasonably possible changes in trading performance, show that the Group should be able to operate within the level of its current facilities. Having 
assessed the principal risks and the other matters discussed in connection with the viability statement, the Directors considered it appropriate to adopt 
the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements. Further information on the Group’s borrowings is given in note 18.
2.2 Basis of consolidation
i) Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has control. The Group controls an entity when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns 
from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the 
date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are deconsolidated from the date on which that control ceases.
ii) Transactions eliminated on consolidation
Intra-group balances and transactions, including any unrealised gains and losses or income and expenses arising from such transactions, are eliminated 
in preparing the consolidated financial statements. Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains, but only to the extent that there 
is no evidence of impairment. Where necessary, amounts reported by subsidiaries have been adjusted to conform with the Group’s accounting policies.
iii) Acquisitions and disposals of non-controlling interests
Acquisitions and disposals of non-controlling interests that do not result in a change of control are accounted for as transactions with owners in their 
capacity as owners and therefore no goodwill is recognised as a result of such transactions. The adjustments to non-controlling interests are based on 
a proportionate amount of the net assets of the subsidiary. Any difference between the price paid or received and the amount by which non-controlling 
interests are adjusted is recognised directly in equity and attributed to the owners of the Company.
iv) Joint arrangements
The Group applies IFRS 11 to its joint arrangement. Under IFRS 11, investments in joint arrangements are classified as either joint operations or joint 
ventures, depending on the contractual rights and obligations of each investor. The Group has assessed the nature of its joint arrangement and 
determined it to be a joint venture. 
Interest in the joint venture is accounted for using the equity method, after initially being recognised at cost. 
Equity method 
Under the equity method of accounting, the investment is initially recognised at cost and the carrying amount is increased or decreased to recognise  
the investor’s share of the change in net assets of the investee after the date of acquisition. 
If the ownership interest in the joint venture is reduced but joint control is retained, only a proportionate share of the amounts previously recognised  
in other comprehensive income is reclassified to profit or loss where appropriate.
The Group’s share of post-acquisition profit or loss is recognised in the income statement, and its share of post-acquisition movements in other 
comprehensive income is recognised with a corresponding adjustment to the carrying amount of the investment. Where the Group’s share of losses in 
the joint venture equals or exceeds its interest in the joint venture, including any other unsecured receivables, the Group does not recognise further losses, 
unless it has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the joint venture. Distributions received from the joint venture reduce 
the carrying amount of the investment. Zotefoams plc Annual Report 2017 75
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
2. Significant accounting policies (continued)
The Group determines at each reporting date whether there is any objective evidence that the investment in the joint venture is impaired. If this is the case, 
the Group calculates the amount of impairment as the difference between the recoverable amount of the joint venture and its carrying value,  
and it recognises the amount adjacent to ‘share of profit/(loss) of joint venture’ in the income statement.
Gains and losses resulting from upstream and downstream transactions between the Group and the joint venture are recognised in the Group’s financial 
statements only to the extent of an unrelated investor’s interests in the joint venture. Unrealised losses are eliminated unless the transaction provides 
evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred. Accounting policies of the joint venture have been aligned where necessary to ensure consistency  
with the policies adopted by the Group.
v) Accounting for business combinations
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method as at the acquisition date, which is the date on which control is transferred to  
the Group. Control is the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from the activities. In assessing control, 
the Group takes into consideration potential voting rights that currently are exercisable. 
For acquisitions on or after 1 January 2010, the Group measures goodwill at the acquisition date as:
  The fair value of the consideration transferred; plus
  The recognised amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree; plus
  If the business combination is achieved in stages, the fair value re-measured at acquisition date of the existing equally interest in the acquiree; less
  The net recognised amount (generally in fair value) of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
When the excess is negative, a bargain purchase gain is recognised immediately in profit or loss. The consideration transferred does not include amounts 
related to the settlement of pre-existing relationships. Such amounts are generally recognised in profit or loss. Costs related to the acquisition, other than 
those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, that the Group incurs in connection with a business combination are expenses as incurred. 
Any contingent consideration payable is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. If the contingent consideration is classified as equity, it is not re-
measured and settlement is accounted for within equity.  Otherwise, subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration are recognised 
in profit or loss.
When share-based payment awards (replacement awards) are required to be exchanged for awards held by the acquire employees (acquiree awards) and 
relate to past services, then all or a portion of the amount of the acquirer replacement awards are included in measuring the consideration transferred in 
the business combination. This determination is based on the market-based value of the replacement awards compared with the market-based value of 
the acquiree awards and the extent to which the replacement awards relate to past and/or future services. 
2.3 Foreign currency
i) Functional and presentation currency
Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which 
each entity operates (‘the functional currency’). The consolidated financial statements are presented in sterling, which is the Group’s presentation currency. 
The Company’s financial statements are prepared and presented in sterling, which is its functional currency.
ii) Transaction and balances 
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions or valuation 
(where items are remeasured). Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign 
currencies are recognised in the income statement, except when deferred in other comprehensive income as qualifying cash flow hedges. All foreign 
exchange gains and losses are presented in the income statement within administrative expenses. 
Translation differences related to changes in amortised cost are recognised in profit or loss, and other changes in carrying amount are recognised in  
other comprehensive income. 
iii) Group companies
The results and financial position of all of the Group entities (none of which has the currency of a hyper-inflationary economy) that have a functional 
currency different from the presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows: 
 assets and liabilities for each statement of financial position presented are translated at the closing rate at the date of that statement of financial position;
  income and expenses for each income statement are translated at average exchange rates (unless this average is not a reasonable approximation of 
the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, in which case income and expenses are translated at the rate on the dates of each 
transaction); and
 all resulting exchange differences are recognised in other comprehensive income.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity, and they are 
translated at the closing rate. Exchange differences arising are recognised in other comprehensive income. Zotefoams plc Annual Report 2017 76
2. Significant accounting policies (continued)
2.4 Derivative financial instruments
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange risks arising from operational, financing and investment 
activities. In accordance with its treasury policy, the Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. However, 
derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are accounted for as trading instruments.
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date when a derivative contract is entered into, and they are subsequently remeasured at their fair 
value. The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument and, if so, the nature 
of the item being hedged. The Group designates all derivatives as hedges of a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a highly 
probable forecast transaction (cash flow hedge).
At the inception of the transaction, the Group documents the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management 
objectives and strategy for undertaking various hedging transactions. The Group also documents its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an 
ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of 
hedged items.
The fair values of various derivative instruments used for hedging purposes are disclosed in note 21. Movements on the hedging reserve in other 
comprehensive income are shown in note 21. The full fair value of a hedging derivative is classified as a non-current asset or liability where the remaining 
hedged item is more than 12 months, and as a current asset or liability where the remaining maturity of the hedged item is less than 12 months. Trading 
derivatives are classified as a current asset or liability.
The fair value of forward exchange contracts is their quoted market price at the statement of financial position date, being the present value of the quoted 
forward price.
i) Cash flow hedging
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognised in other comprehensive 
income. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement within administrative expenses. 
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or the entity revokes designation of the hedge relationship but the hedged 
forecast transaction is still expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss at that point remains in equity and is recognised in accordance with the above 
policy when the transaction occurs. If the hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is 
immediately transferred to the income statement within administrative expenses.
2.5 Investments in subsidiaries and joint arrangements
The Company’s investments in subsidiaries and joint arrangements are stated at cost less provision for impairment.
2.6 Property, plant and equipment
i) Owned assets
Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost or deemed cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment losses.
When parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, those components are accounted for as separate items of property, 
plant and equipment. 
Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future 
economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of the replaced 
part is derecognised. All other repairs and maintenance are charged to the income statement during the financial year in which they are incurred.
The cost of assets under construction includes the cost of materials and direct labour, and any other costs directly attributable to bringing the asset  
to a working condition for its intended use.
ii) Depreciation
Land is not depreciated. Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each part of the item  
of property, plant and equipment. The estimated useful lives are as follows:
Buildings   20 years
Plant and equipment  5–15 years
Fixtures and fittings  3–5 years
Assets under construction are depreciated from the beginning of the next quarter once the asset is ready for its intended use.
The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at the end of each reporting period.

2. Significant accounting policies (continued)
2.7 Intangible assets
i) Research and development
Expenditure on research activities undertaken with the prospect of gaining new scientific or technical knowledge and understanding is recognised  
in the income statement as an expense as incurred. 
Development costs that are directly attributable to the design and testing of identifiable and unique products controlled by the Group are recognised  
as intangible assets where the following criteria are met: 
 it is technically feasible to complete the asset so that it will be available for use;
 management intends to complete the asset and use or sell it;
 there is an ability to use or sell the asset;
 it can be demonstrated how the asset will generate probable future economic benefits;
 adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the asset are available; and
 the expenditure attributable to the asset during its development can be reliably measured.
Directly attributable costs that are capitalised as part of the asset include the product development employee costs and an appropriate portion  
of relevant overheads.
Other development expenditures that do not meet these criteria are recognised as an expense as incurred. Development costs previously recognised  
as an expense are not recognised as an asset in a subsequent period.
ii) Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s interest in the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent 
liabilities acquired in a business combination. Goodwill is stated at the amount recognised on acquisition date less any accumulated impairment losses. 
Goodwill is tested annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill may be impaired.
iii) Software
Acquired computer software licences are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring to use the specific software. 
iv) Other intangible assets
Intangible assets acquired from a business combination are capitalised at fair value as at the date of acquisition and amortised over their estimated useful 
economic life. Their carrying value is the fair value at acquisition less cumulative amortisation and any impairment. An intangible asset acquired as part 
of a business combination is recognised outside goodwill if the asset is separable or arises from contractual or other legal rights and its fair value can be 
measured reliably. 
Other intangible assets, including patents that are purchased by the Group and have finite useful lives, are measured at cost less accumulated 
amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. The cost is the purchase price of the asset. Amortisation is charged to the income statement on  
a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Expenditure on internally generated goodwill and brands is recognised in the income 
statement as an expense as incurred.
v) Amortisation
The estimated useful lives of the Group’s intangible assets are as follows:
Marketing related   5–15 years
Customer related   2–10 years
Technology related   5–20 years
Software related  3–10 years
Capitalised development 3–10 years, from the date the patent is granted
Amortisation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each reporting date and adjusted if appropriate. Zotefoams plc Annual Report 2017 78
2. Significant accounting policies (continued)
2.8 Financial assets
i) Classifications
The Group classifies its financial assets in the following categories: a) financial assets at fair value through profit or loss; and b) loans and receivables.  
The classification depends on the purpose for which the financial assets were acquired. Management determines the classification of its financial assets  
at initial recognition.
a) Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are financial assets held for trading. A financial asset is classified in this category if acquired principally 
for the purpose of selling in the short term. Derivatives are also categorised as held for trading, unless they are designated as hedges. Assets in this 
category are classified as current assets if expected to be settled within 12 months, otherwise they are classified as non-current assets.
b) Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. They are included 
in current assets, except for maturities greater than 12 months after the end of the reporting period. These are classified as non-current assets. The 
Group’s loans and receivables comprise ‘trade and other receivables’ and ‘cash and cash equivalents’ in the statement of financial position.
ii) Recognition and measurement
Investments are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs for all financial assets not carried at fair value through profit or loss. Financial assets 
carried at fair value through profit or loss are initially recognised at fair value, and transaction costs are expensed in the income statement. Financial assets 
are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the investments have expired or have been transferred, and the Group has transferred 
substantially all risks and rewards of ownership. Loans and receivables are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the ‘effective interest’ rate 
method. 
Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of the ‘financial assets at fair value through profit or loss’ category are presented in the income 
statement within administrative expenses in the period in which they arise. 
iii) Offsetting financial instruments
Financial assets and liabilities are offset, and the net amount is reported in the statement of financial position, when there is a legally enforceable right 
to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. The legally 
enforceable right must not be contingent on future events, and it must be enforceable in the normal course of business and in the event of default, 
insolvency or bankruptcy of the Group or the counterparty.
iv) Impairment of financial assets carried at amortised cost
The Group assesses at the end of each reporting period whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or group of financial assets is impaired. 
A financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired and impairment losses are incurred only if there is objective evidence of impairment as a result 
of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the asset (a ‘loss event’), and that loss event (or events) has an impact on the estimated 
future cash flows of the financial asset or group of financial assets that can be reliably estimated.
Evidence of impairment might include indications that the debtors or a group of debtors are experiencing significant financial difficulty, default or 
delinquency in interest or principal payments, the probability that they will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation, and where observable data 
indicate that there is a measurable decrease in the estimated future cash flows, such as changes in arrears or economic conditions that correlate with 
defaults.
For loans and receivables, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated 
future cash flows (excluding future credit losses that have not been incurred) discounted at the financial asset’s original effective interest rate. The carrying 
amount of the asset is reduced and the amount of the loss is recognised in the income statement. If a loan or held-to-maturity investment has a variable 
interest rate, the discount rate for measuring any impairment loss is the current effective interest rate determined under the contract. 
If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the 
impairment was recognised (such as an improvement in the debtor’s credit rating), the reversal of the previously recognised impairment loss is recognised 
in the income statement.
2.9 Trade and other receivables
Trade receivables are amounts due from customers for goods sold or services performed in the ordinary course of business. If collection is expected in 
one year or less (or in the normal operating cycle of the business, if longer), they are classified as current assets. If not, they are presented as non-current 
assets.
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less provision  
for impairment.

2. Significant accounting policies (continued)
2.10 Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less 
the estimated costs of completion and selling expenses.
In determining the cost of raw materials, consumables and goods purchased for resale, the weighted average purchase price is used. The cost of finished 
goods and work in progress comprises design costs, raw materials, direct labour, other direct costs and related production overheads (based on normal 
operating capacity), but excludes borrowing costs. For work in progress and finished goods manufactured by the Group, cost is taken as production cost, 
which includes an appropriate proportion of attributable overheads.
2.11 Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and short-term highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less. Bank 
overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Group’s cash management are included as a component of cash and cash 
equivalents for the purposes of the statement of cash flows.
2.12 Impairment of non-financial assets
The carrying amounts of the Group’s non-financial assets are reviewed at each statement of financial position date where there is an indication that the 
asset may be impaired. If any such indication exists, the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated (see below).
For goodwill, property, plant and equipment and intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives or that are not yet available for use, the recoverable 
amount is estimated each year at the same time. An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset or its related cash-generating unit 
(‘CGU’) exceeds its estimated recoverable amount.
i) Calculation of recoverable amount
The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. In assessing value in use, the estimated 
future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the 
risks specific to the asset or CGU. For the purpose of impairment testing, assets that cannot be tested individually are grouped together into the smallest 
group of assets that generates cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or CGUs. Subject to an 
operating segment ceiling test, for the purposes of goodwill impairment testing, CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated are aggregated so that the 
level at which impairment testing is performed reflects the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal reporting purposes. Goodwill acquired  
in a business combination is allocated to groups of CGUs that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.
The Group’s corporate assets do not generate separate cash inflows and are utilised by more than one CGU. Corporate assets are allocated to CGUs  
on a reasonable and consistent basis and tested for impairment as part of the testing of the CGU to which the corporate asset is allocated.
ii) Impairment losses
Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement. Impairment losses recognised in respect of CGUs are allocated first to reduce the carrying 
amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU (or group of CGUs), and then to reduce the carrying amounts of the other assets in the CGU (or group of 
CGUs) on a pro rata basis.
iii) Reversals of impairment
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. In respect of other assets, impairment losses recognised in prior years are assessed at each 
reporting date for any indications that the loss has decreased or no longer exists. An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the 
estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed 
the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.
2.13 Dividends
Final dividends are recognised as a liability in the period in which they are approved. Interim dividends are recognised when paid.
2.14 Interest-bearing loans and borrowings
Interest-bearing borrowings are recognised initially at fair value less attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, interest-bearing 
borrowings are stated at amortised cost with any differences between cost and redemption values being recognised in the income statement over the 
period of the borrowings on an effective interest basis, where material. Zotefoams plc Annual Report 2017 80
2. Significant accounting policies (continued)
2.15 Employee benefits
i) Defined contribution plans
A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Group pays fixed contributions into a separate entity. The Group has no legal or constructive 
obligations to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employees the benefits relating to employee service in the 
current and prior periods. Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the income statement as 
incurred.
For defined contribution plans, the Group pays contributions to publicly or privately administered pension insurance plans on a mandatory, contractual 
or voluntary basis. The Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid. The contributions are recognised as employee 
benefit expense when they are due. Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in the future 
payments is available.
ii) Defined benefits plans
A defined benefit plan is a pension plan that is not a defined contribution plan. Typically, defined benefit plans define an amount of pension benefit that an 
employee will receive on retirement, usually dependent on one or more factors, such as age, years of service and compensation.
The liability recognised in the statement of financial position in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the present value of the defined benefit obligation 
at the end of the reporting period, less the fair value of plan assets. The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries using 
the projected unit credit method. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using 
AA credit rate bonds that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension obligation.
The current service cost of the defined benefit plan, recognised in ‘staff expenses’ in the income statement, except where included in the cost of an asset, 
reflects the increase in the defined benefit obligation resulting from service in the current year, benefit changes, curtailments and settlements.
Past service costs are recognised immediately in the income statement.
The net interest cost is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net balance of the defined benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets.  
This cost is included in finance costs in the income statement.
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to equity in other 
comprehensive income in the period in which they arise.
2.16 Share-based payment transactions
The Company operates a number of equity-settled, share-based compensation plans, under which the entity receives services from employees as 
consideration for equity instruments (share awards) of the Company. The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of the 
share awards is recognised as an expense. The total amount to be expensed is determined by reference to the fair value of the share awards granted:
 including any market performance conditions (for example, an entity’s share price);
  excluding the impact of any service and non-market performance vesting conditions (for example, profitability, sales growth targets, and remaining  
an employee of the entity over a specified time period); and
 including the impact of any non-vesting conditions (for example, the requirement for employees to save or hold shares for a specific period of time).
Share awards granted since 1 January 2006 are valued using a Black-Scholes model.
At the end of each reporting period, the Company revises its estimates of the number of share awards that are expected to vest based on the non-
market vesting conditions and service conditions. It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in the income statement, with a 
corresponding adjustment to equity.
In addition, in some circumstances, employees might provide services in advance of the grant date, and so the grant date fair value is estimated for the 
purposes of recognising the expense during the period between service commencement and grant date.
When the share awards vest or are exercised, the Employee Benefit Trust (EBT) will normally release the shares to the participant. This may involve selling 
all, or a portion of, the shares. The proceeds received from the sale, net of any directly attributable transaction costs, are credited to share capital (nominal 
value) and share premium. 
The grant by the Company of share awards over its equity instruments to the employees of subsidiary undertakings in the Group is treated as a capital 
contribution. The fair value of employee services received, measured by reference to the grant date fair value, is recognised over the vesting period  
as an increase to investment in subsidiary undertakings, with a corresponding credit to equity in the parent entity accounts.
Any social security contributions payable in connection with the grant of the share awards are considered an integral part of the grant itself, and  
the charge will be treated as a cash-settled transaction.
Own shares held by Employee Benefit Trust (EBT)
Transactions of the Company-sponsored EBT are treated as being those of the Company and are therefore reflected in the financial statements.  
In particular, the EBT’s purchase and sale of shares in the Company are debited and credited directly to equity.

2. Significant accounting policies (continued)
2.17 Trade and other payables
Trade and other payables are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of business from suppliers. Trade 
and other payables are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year or less (or in the normal operating cycle of the business, if longer).  
If not, they are presented as non-current liabilities. Trade and other payables are stated at cost.
Trade and other payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
2.18 Borrowing costs
General and specific borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets that 
necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of those assets, until such time as the assets 
are substantially ready for their intended use or sale.
Investment income earned on the temporary investment of specific borrowings, pending their expenditure on qualifying assets, is deducted from the 
borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation. All other borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement in the period in which they are incurred.
2.19 Revenue
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, and represents amounts receivable for goods supplied, stated net of 
discounts, returns and value added taxes. The Group recognises revenue when: the amount of revenue can be reliably measured; it is probable that future 
economic benefits will flow to the entity; and specific criteria have been met for each of the Group’s activities, as described below. The Group bases its 
estimate of return on historical results, taking into consideration the type of customer, the type of transaction and the specifics of each arrangement.
i) Sale of foam
Revenue from the sale of foam is recognised in the income statement, as per international commercial terms, at the point of despatch, when significant 
risks and rewards of ownership are deemed to have been transferred to the buyer. 
ii) Licence and royalty income
The Group recognises licence revenue upon transfer of the technology, provided that no significant obligations remain, the licence amount is 
determinable, and the collection of the related amount is probable. Royalty income is based on the terms of the licence agreements and is recorded  
when amounts are determinable and collection of the related amount is probable. 
iii) Sale of equipment
Revenue from equipment sales is recognised upon either shipment or delivery as specified in the contract terms. Revenue received in advanced is 
recognised as deferred income in the statement of financial position until the terms of sale have been fully satisfied.
2.20 Leases
i) Operating lease payments
Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases. Payments made 
under operating leases (net of any incentives received from the lessor) are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of  
the lease.
ii) Finance lease payments
The Group leases certain property, plant and equipment. Leases of property, plant and equipment, where the Group has substantially all of the risks and 
rewards of ownership, are classified as finance leases. Finance leases are capitalised, at the lease’s commencement, at the lower of the fair value of the 
leased property and the present value of the minimum lease payments.
Each lease payment is allocated between the liability and finance charges. The corresponding rental obligations, net of finance charges, are included in 
other long-term payables. The interest element of the finance cost is charged to the income statement over the lease period so as to produce a constant 
periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each period. The property, plant and equipment acquired under finance leases is 
depreciated over the shorter of the useful life of the asset and the lease term.
2.21 Current and deferred tax
Tax expense for the period comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items 
recognised directly in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, 
respectively.
The current tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted at the statement of financial position date in the countries where the Group 
operates and generates taxable income. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable 
tax regulation is subject to interpretation. It establishes provisions, where appropriate, on the basis of amounts expected  
to be paid to the tax authorities.
Deferred tax is recognised on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial 
statements. However, deferred tax liabilities are not recognised if they arise from the initial recognition of goodwill; deferred tax is not accounted for if it 
arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that, at the time of the transaction, affects neither 
accounting nor taxable profit or loss. Deferred tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the 
statement of financial position date and are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences 
can be utilised. Zotefoams plc Annual Report 2017 82
2. Significant accounting policies (continued)
Deferred tax liabilities are provided on taxable temporary differences arising from investments in subsidiaries and joint arrangements, except for any 
deferred tax liability where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference 
will not reverse in the foreseeable future. 
Deferred tax assets are recognised on deductible temporary differences arising from investments in subsidiaries and joint arrangements only to the 
extent that it is probable that the temporary difference will reverse in the future and there is sufficient taxable profit available against which the temporary 
difference can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when the 
deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the same taxable entity or different taxable entities 
and there is an intention to settle the balances on a net basis.
2.22 Share capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new ordinary shares or options are shown in equity  
as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
Where any group company purchases the Company’s equity share capital (treasury shares), the consideration paid, including any directly attributable 
incremental costs (net of income tax) is deducted from equity attributable to the Company’s equity holders until the shares are cancelled or reissued. 
Where such ordinary shares are subsequently reissued, any consideration received, net of any directly attributable incremental transaction costs and  
the related income tax effects, is included in equity attributable to the Company’s equity holders.
2.23 Exceptional items
Exceptional items are disclosed separately in the financial statements, where it is necessary to do so to provide further understanding of the financial 
performance of the Group. They are items that are material, either because of their size or their nature, or that are non-recurring, and are presented  
within the line items to which they best relate. 
2.24 New standards and interpretations not yet adopted
The IASB and IFRS Interpretations Committee have issued the following standards and interpretations with an effective date of implementation for 
accounting periods beginning after the date on which the Group’s financial statements for the current year commenced.

IFRS 9 ‘Financial instruments’ 1 January 2018 Yes
IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from contracts with customers’ 1 January 2018 Yes
IFRS 16 ‘Leases’ 1 January 2019 Yes
Effective for accounting periods 
beginning on or after
Endorsed by the 
EU
Amendments
IAS 12 ‘Income taxes’ 1 January 2017 Yes
IAS 7 ‘Statement of Cash Flows’ 1 January 2017 Yes
IFRS 2 ‘Share-based payments’ 1 January 2018 No
IFRIC 22 ‘Foreign currency transactions and advance consideration’ 1 January 2018 No
IFRS 3 ‘Business combinations’ and IFRS 11 ‘ Joint arrangements’ 1 January 2019 No
IAS 28 ‘Investments in associates and joint ventures’ 1 January 2019 No
IFRS 15 provides enhanced detail on the principle of recognising revenue to reflect the transfer of goods and services to customers at a value which the 
Group expects to be entitled to receive. The standard also updates revenue disclosure requirements. The Group will retrospectively apply the standard 
from 1 January 2018 recognising the cumulative effect of initially applying the standard as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings.  
The standard will not have a material impact on the Group’s revenue streams from the supply of goods and services. The timing of the recognition of 
revenue under IAS 18 are consistent with those to be adopted under IFRS 15.
IFRS 9 replaces the majority of IAS 39 and covers the classification, measurement and de-recognition of financial assets and financial liabilities, introduces 
a new impairment model for financial assets based on expected losses rather than incurred losses and provides a new hedge accounting model. IFRS 9 
has been implemented by the Group from 1 January 2018. The new Standard is not expected to have a material impact on reported results. 
IFRS 16 will be implemented by the Group from 1 January 2019. The Standard will replace IAS 17 ‘Leases’ and will require lease liabilities and ‘right of use’ 
assets to be recognised on the balance sheet for almost all leases. The Group is assessing the potential impact of IFRS 16.

3. Segment reporting
The Group’s operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to and regularly reviewed by the Group Chief 
Executive Officer, David Stirling, who is considered to be the ‘chief operating decision maker’ for the purpose of evaluating segment performance and 
allocating resources.
The Group manufactures and sells high-performance foams and licenses related technology for specialist markets worldwide. Zotefoams’ activities  
are categorised as follows:
 Polyolefin foams: these foams are made from olefinic homopolymer and copolymer resin. The most common resin used is polyethylene. 
  High-Performance Products (‘HPP’): these foams exhibit high performance on certain key properties, such as improved chemical, flammability, 
temperature or energy management performance. Turnover in the segment is currently mainly derived from products manufactured from three main 
polymer types: PVDF fluoropolymer, polyamide (nylon) and polyether block amide (PEBA). Foams are sold under the brand name ZOTEK
®
, while 
technical insulation products manufactured from certain materials are branded as T-FIT
®
.
 MuCell Extrusion LLC (‘MEL ’): licenses microcellular foam technology and sells related machinery.

Segment profit is made up of operating profit before foreign exchange losses and unallocated central costs. Unallocated central costs are not directly 
attributable or cannot be allocated to a segment.
Following a reassessment of cost classifications, certain costs at the Group’s subsidiaries, previously recognised as distribution costs in 2016, have been 
reclassified to cost of sales (£203k) and administrative costs (£266k).  Zotefoams plc Annual Report 2017 84

Amortisation is included in cost of sales in the income statement.
Goodwill arising on acquisition is allocated to the cash generating unit (‘CGU’) that is expected to benefit, being MEL. The recoverable amount of the CGU 
has been determined based on value-in-use calculations. These calculations use pre-tax cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by 
management covering a three-year period. Cash flows beyond the three-year period are extrapolated using the estimated growth rates stated below.  
The growth rate does not exceed the long-term average growth rate for the business in which the CGU operates.
The key assumptions of long-term growth rate and discount rate used in the value-in-use calculations are as follows.
Key assumptions:
Sales growth 
This is based on past performance and management’s expectations of market development over the three-year forecast period.
Other operating costs 
These are the fixed costs of the CGU, which do not vary significantly with sales volumes or prices. Management forecasts these costs based on the 
current structure of the business, adjusting for inflationary increases, and these do not reflect any future restructurings or cost-saving measures. 
Long-term growth rate 2.5%
This growth rate is based on a prudent assessment of past experience and future estimations of market expectations.
Discount rate 12%
The pre-tax discount rate applied to the cash flow forecasts for the CGU are derived from the estimated pre-tax weighted average cost of capital for the 
MEL CGU.
Sensitivity to changes in assumptions
There is sufficient headroom for the MEL CGU such that management believe no reasonable change in any of the above assumptions would cause the 
carrying value of MEL goodwill to exceed its recoverable amount.  Zotefoams plc Annual Report 2017 92

Collateralised borrowings are secured by the property, plant and equipment of the Group (note 11) and are limited to the value of the debt. 
In December 2012 the Company obtained a £3,500k loan repayable over five years in equal quarterly instalments. This loan was secured by specific 
property, plant and equipment at the Company’s Croydon facility. This loan was settled during the year (2016: £766k). 
In 2016 a multi-currency revolving credit facility (RCF) of £8,000k was obtained and the bank overdraft facility was reduced to net £2,000k. During 2017 , 
the RCF limit was increased to £10,000k. This borrowing is secured by a floating charge on the Company’s book debts, the Company’s Croydon facility 
and a cross-guarantee structure.
During 2017 , the Company obtained a £7 ,500k loan facility, which is secured by property, plant and equipment at the Company’s Croydon facility. Each 
draw down from this facility is repayable over five years in equal quarterly instalments commencing in 2018. At 31 December 2017 , the Company had 
utilised £4,500k of the above facility. 
In December 2015 the Group obtained a $8,000k loan, repayable over ten years in equal monthly instalments. This loan is secured by the property, plant 
and equipment of Zotefoams Inc.

Unrecognised deferred tax assets
The Group has tax losses carried forward in the USA of $3,242k (2016: $2,816k) which expire between 2022 and 2027 under prevailing tax legislation. 
At year-end exchange rates, these tax losses translate to £2,402k (2016: £2,200k). Of the above, the Board expects to utilise only tax losses of £1,026k 
(2016: £1,026k) in the upcoming years based on projections. Applying the enacted tax rate of 21% (2016: 35%), the Group has recognised a deferred tax 
asset of £216k (2016: £359k) on such tax losses expected to be utilised in future periods. Zotefoams plc Annual Report 2017 96

21. Financial instruments and financial risk management
Policy
The Group’s and Company’s principal financial instruments include cash in hand and at bank and interest-bearing loans and borrowings, the main 
purpose of which is to provide finance for the Group’s and Company’s operations. Foreign exchange derivatives are used to help manage the Group’s  
and Company’s currency exposure. Per the Group’s and Company’s policy, no trading in financial instruments is undertaken.
The main risks arising from the Group’s and Company’s financial instruments are credit risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk and foreign currency risk.  
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below. These policies have remained consistent 
throughout the year.
Credit risk
Credit risk is managed on a Group basis, except for credit risk relating to accounts receivable balances. Each local entity is responsible for managing 
and analysing the credit risk for each of their new clients before standard payment and delivery terms and conditions are offered. Credit risk arises from 
cash and cash equivalents and derivative financial instruments with banks and financial institutions, as well as credit exposures to customers, including 
outstanding receivables and committed transactions.
Management has a credit policy in place and the exposure to credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis. Credit evaluations are performed for customers 
offered credit over a certain amount. The Group and Company do not require collateral in respect of financial assets.
At the statement of financial position date there were no significant concentrations of credit risk. The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented  
by the carrying amount of each financial asset, including derivative financial instruments, in the statement of financial position.

Trade receivables net of allowances 17,710  18,643  11,704 11,394
The normal terms of trade are between 30–90 days from the end of the month of invoice.
The credit quality of trade receivables that are neither past due nor impaired is assessed individually based on credit history and experience. In 2017  
and 2016, the Group and Company insured a significant portion of its trade receivable balances to mitigate credit risk. The uninsured exposure as at  
31 December 2017 for the Group was £5,718k (2016: £6,890k) and for the Company was £2,499k (2016: £3,390k). The Group and the Company make 
provisions against trade receivables, such provisions being based on the debtor’s prior credit history and knowledge of any adverse conditions affecting 
the debtor (e.g. receivership or liquidation). The Directors believe an adequate provision has been made for trade receivables at the year end.
None of the amounts owed by Group undertakings are impaired.
Interest rate risk
The Group’s and Company’s interest rate risk arises from long-term borrowings and short-term bank overdraft. Borrowings issued at variable rates 
expose the Group and Company to cash flow interest rate risk. Borrowings issued at fixed rates expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk.
The Group and Company has strong cash generation from its operations and closely monitors its borrowing levels to manage the interest rate risk.
The interest rate profile of the Group’s and Company’s borrowings at 31 December is shown below:

Liquidity risk
Group Finance performs cash flow forecasting in the operating entities of the Group, which is then aggregated. Group Finance monitors rolling forecasts 
of the Group’s liquidity requirements to ensure that it has sufficient cash to meet operational needs, while maintaining sufficient headroom on its undrawn 
committed borrowing facilities (note 18) at all times, so that the Group does not breach borrowing limits or covenants (where applicable) on any of its 
borrowing facilities. Such forecasting takes into consideration the Group’s debt financing plans, covenant compliance, compliance with internal balance 
sheet ratio targets and any applicable external regulatory or legal requirements.

Foreign currency risk
The Group and Company operate internationally and are exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currency exposures, primarily with respect 
to the US dollar and euros. Foreign exchange risk arises from recognised assets and liabilities and future commercial transactions. 
Foreign exchange risk is managed centrally by Group Finance. Foreign exchange risk arises when future commercial transactions or recognised assets  
or liabilities are denominated in a currency that is not the Company’s functional currency. 
The Group’s and Company’s treasury risk management policy is to hedge approximately two-thirds of anticipated cash flows (mainly sales and purchases) 
in US dollar and euros for the subsequent 9-12 months. The Group and the Company use forward exchange contracts to hedge their foreign currency 
risk. Group Finance monitors cash flows to ensure that there is sufficient liquidity when forward currency contracts mature.
The euro and US dollar rates used in preparing the financial statements are as follows:
2017 2016
Average Closing Average Closing
Euro/sterling 0.88  0.89  0.82  0.85 
US dollar/sterling  0.78  0.74  0.75  0.82 
In respect of other monetary assets and liabilities held in currencies other than the euro and the US dollar, the Group and the Company ensure that the  
net exposure is kept to a manageable level by buying or selling foreign currencies at spot rates, where necessary, to address short-term imbalances.
Where possible the Group tries to hold a majority of its cash and cash equivalent balances in the local currency of the respective entity or, for borrowings, 
in a currency which provides an offset, albeit often partial, against monetary working capital net assets in that currency. Zotefoams plc Annual Report 2017 100

The hedged highly probable forecast transactions denominated in foreign currency are expected to occur at various dates during the next 12 months. 
Gains and losses recognised in the hedging reserve in equity on forward foreign exchange contracts as of 31 December 2017 are recognised in the 
income statement in the period or periods during which the hedged forecast transaction affects the income statement. This is generally within 12 months 
of the end of the reporting period.

Estimation of fair values
The following summarises the major methods and assumptions used in estimating fair values of financial instruments reflected in the table above.  
They are classified according to the following fair value hierarchy:
  Level 1: quoted process (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
  Level 2: inputs other than quoted process included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly 
(derived from prices)

Sensitivity analysis
In managing currency risks the Group and Company aim to reduce the impact of short-term fluctuations on their earnings. Over the longer-term, however, 
changes in foreign exchange would have an impact on earnings.
At 31 December 2017 it is estimated that an increase of one percentage point in the value of sterling against the euro would decrease the Group’s profit 
before tax by approximately £3k (2016: £74k) before forward exchange contracts and £1k (2016: £58k) after forward exchange contracts are included. 
At 31 December 2017 it is estimated that an increase of one percentage point in the value of sterling against the US dollar would decrease the Group’s 
profit before tax by approximately £175k (2016: £180k) before forward exchange contracts and £58k (2016: £102k) after forward exchange contracts  
are included.

Capital management
The Group’s objectives, when managing capital, are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for 
shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders, and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital. In order to maintain or adjust 
the capital structure, the Group can adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders or manage investments in new assets to reduce debt.
The Group defines its return on capital as operating profit before exceptional items divided by the average sum of its equity, net debt and other non-
current liabilities. This measure excludes acquired intangible assets and their amortisation costs. The Group also excludes significant capacity investments 
under construction until they enter production. In 2017 the return on capital was 15.5% (2016: 14.0%). If the significant capacity investments were included, 
the return on capital was 12.07% (2016: 11.94%).

23. Post employment benefits
Defined benefit pension plans
The Company operates a UK registered trust-based pension scheme that provides defined benefits. Pension benefits are linked to the members’ final 
pensionable salaries and service at their retirement (or date of leaving if earlier). The Trustees are responsible for running the Scheme in accordance with 
the Scheme’s Trust Deed and Rules, which set out their powers. The Trustees of the Scheme are required to act in the best interests of the beneficiaries  
of the Scheme. There is a requirement that one-third of the Trustees are nominated by the members of the Scheme.
There are two categories of pension scheme members:
 Deferred members: former and current employees of the Company; and
 Pensioner members: in receipt of pension.
The defined benefit obligation is valued by projecting the best estimate of future benefit outgoings (allowing for revaluation to retirement for deferred 
members and annual pension increases for all members) and then discounting to the statement of financial position date. The majority of benefits received 
increases in line with inflation (subject to a cap of no more than 5% per annum). The valuation method is known as the Projected Unit Method. The 
approximate overall duration of the Scheme’s defined benefit obligation as at 31 December 2017 was 18 years.
Since 1 October 2001 the Scheme has been closed to new members and, from 31 December 2005, the future accrual of benefits for existing members  
of the Scheme ceased.
Future funding obligation
The Trustees are required to carry out an actuarial valuation every three years. The last actuarial valuation of the Scheme was performed by the Scheme 
Actuary for the Trustees as at 5 April 2014. This valuation revealed a funding shortfall of £2,500k. In respect of the deficit in the Scheme as at 5 April 2014, 
the Company agreed to pay £492k per annum until 5 April 2020. In addition, the Company pays £127k per annum to cover administration expenses. The 
Company therefore expects to pay £619k to the Scheme during the accounting year beginning 1 January 2018, until an updated valuation is performed. 
There is currently a valuation underway as at 5 April 2017 which, when finalised, may reveal a different funding level and therefore may likely result in a 
different recovery plan for the future.
Risks
Through the Scheme, the Company is exposed to a number of risks:
  Asset volatility: the Scheme’s defined benefit obligation is calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields, however the 
Scheme invests significantly in equities and other growth assets. These assets are expected to outperform corporate bonds in the long term, but 
provide volatility and risk in the short term.
  Changes in bond yields: a decrease in corporate bond yields would increase the Scheme’s defined benefit obligation, however this would be partially 
offset by an increase in the value of the Scheme’s bond holdings.
  Inflation risk: a significant proportion of the Scheme’s defined benefit obligation is linked to inflation, therefore higher inflation will result in a higher defined 
benefit obligation (subject to the appropriate caps in place). The majority of the Scheme’s assets are either unaffected by inflation, or only loosely 
correlated with inflation, therefore an increase in inflation would also increase the deficit.
  Life expectancy: if Scheme members live longer than expected, the Scheme’s benefits will need to be paid for longer, increasing the Scheme’s defined 
benefit obligation. 
The Trustees and Company manage risks in the Scheme through the following strategies:
  Diversification: investments are well diversified, such that the failure of any single investment would not have a material impact on the overall level  
of assets.
  Investment strategy: the Trustees are required to review their investment strategy on a regular basis.
  Annuities: the Scheme holds insurance contracts to pay some members’ AVC benefits and spouses’ pensions. This removes investment, inflation and 
longevity risk for those members.
The Company has recognised all actuarial gains and losses immediately in other comprehensive income. The initial results calculated as part of the formal 
actuarial valuation as at 5 April 2014 have been updated to 31 December 2017 by a qualified independent actuary. The major assumptions used by the 
actuary were (in nominal terms) as follows:
As at  
31 December 2017
As at  
31 December 2016
Discount rate 2.40% 2.70%
RPI inflation (before retirement) 2.90% 3.30%

Risks (continued)
Assumptions regarding future mortality are set based on actuarial advice in accordance with published statistics and experience in each territory.  
These assumptions translate into an average life expectancy, in years, for a pensioner retiring at age 65, of:
2017 2016
For an individual aged 65 
– Male 22.1 22.4
– Female 23.9 24.5
At age 65 for an individual aged 45

The above sensitivity analyses are based on a change in an assumption while holding all other assumptions constant. In practice, this is unlikely to occur, 
and changes in some of the other assumptions may be correlated. When calculating the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to significant actuarial 
assumptions the same method – present value of the defined benefit obligation calculated with the projected unit credit method at the end of the reporting 
period, has been applied as when calculating the pension liability recognised within the statement of financial position. The assets of the Scheme are

Other pension schemes
On 1 January 2006 a separate stakeholder scheme was set up for those employees who were originally in the closed defined benefit pension scheme. 
The contributions paid by the Company in 2017 were £350k (2016: £404k).
In addition to this scheme, the Company operates a stakeholder scheme which is open to employees who joined after 1 October 2001. The contributions 
paid by the Company in 2017 were £194k (2016: £204k).
The Company also operates another stakeholder scheme which is open to employees who joined after 1 March 2014. The contributions paid by the 
Company in 2017 were £189k (2016: £141k).
For certain non UK based employees of the Company, the Company makes contributions into individual schemes. The contributions paid by the 
Company in 2017 were £2k (2016: nil).
For USA based employees, Zotefoams Inc. operates a 401(k) plan. The contributions paid by Zotefoams Inc. in 2017 were £145k (2016: £65k).  Zotefoams plc Annual Report 2017 106
24. Share-based payments
The Company has a share option scheme that entitles senior management personnel to purchase shares in the Company. Options are exercisable at 
a price equal to the lower of the mid-market price of the Company’s shares the day before the option is granted or the average mid-market price for the 
three dealing days before the option is granted. The vesting period is three years. If the options remain unexercised after a period of 10 years from the date 
of grant, the options will expire. (Depending on the circumstances options are normally forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before the options vest.
In 2007 the Company introduced a LTIP scheme for senior management personnel. Shares are awarded in the Company and vest after three years to 
the extent performance conditions are met. Dependent on the circumstances awards are normally forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before the 
award vests. A new LTIP scheme was introduced in 2017 , which operates in similar way to the LTIP scheme introduced in 2017 . No new awards are made 
under the 2007 scheme. (Depending on the circumstances options are normally forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before the options vest.
In 2007 the Company introduced a Deferred Bonus Share Plan. Originally under the Plan executive bonuses over 40% of eligible salary were held as 
deferred shares for three years. In 2014 the Remuneration Committee amended the Deferred Bonus Plan for bonuses awarded since 2014, where 25% 
of executive bonuses are held as deferred shares for three years. Depending on the circumstances awards are normally forfeited if the employee leaves 
the Group before the award vests. A new Deferred Bonus Share Plan scheme was introduced in 2017 , which operates in similar way to the old Plan 
introduced in 2007 . No new awards are made under the 2007 Plan. Depending on the circumstances options are normally forfeited if the employee  
leaves the Group before the options vest.
Details of the vesting conditions for the share, share option and LTIP awards are given in the Remuneration Report on pages 46 to 56.

26. Accounting estimates and judgements for the Group and Company
In the application of the Group’s accounting policies, which are described in note 2, the Directors are required to make judgements, estimates and 
assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities which are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and associated 
assumptions are based on historical experience and other facts that are considered relevant. Actual amounts may differ from these estimates.
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events  
that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. 
Key sources of estimation uncertainty
The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the statement of financial position date that have  
a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are disclosed below.
i) Estimated impairment of goodwill and intangibles
The Group tests annually whether goodwill has suffered any impairment, in accordance with the accounting policy stated in note 2.12. The recoverable 
amounts of cash-generating units (CGUs) have been determined based on value-in-use calculations. These calculations require the use of estimates  
(note 12).
The determination of goodwill and intangible assets requires judgements made by the Directors. Other intangible assets are assessed on an ongoing 
basis to determine whether circumstances exist that could lead to the conclusion that the carrying value of such assets is not supportable. Such 
calculations require judgement relating to the appropriate discount factors and long-term growth prevalent in particular markets as well as short-term 
business performance. The Directors also draw upon experience in making these judgements.
ii) Pensions assumptions
The present value of the defined benefit pension obligations depends on a number of factors that are determined on an actuarial basis using a number  
of assumptions. The assumptions used in determining the net cost (income) for pensions include the discount rate. Any changes in these assumptions  
will impact the carrying amount of pension obligations.
The Company engages an independent actuary to perform the valuation and assist in determining an appropriate discount rate at the end of each year.  
This is the interest rate that should be used to determine the present value of estimated future cash outflows expected to be required to settle the pension 
obligations. In determining the appropriate discount rate, the Company considers the interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated  
in the currency in which the benefits will be paid and that have terms to maturity approximating the terms of the related pension obligation. Note 23 
contains information about the assumptions relating to retirement benefit obligations.
The valuation of pension scheme liabilities is calculated in accordance with Company policy. The valuation is prepared by an independent qualified 
actuary, but significant judgements are required in relation to the assumptions for pension increases, inflation, the discount rate applied, investment returns 
and member longevity, which underpin the valuations. 
Key assumptions for pension obligations are based, in part, on current market conditions. Additional information is disclosed in note 23.
Key judgements
i) Joint ventures
The Group holds 50% of the voting rights of its joint arrangement. The Group has joint control over this arrangement because, under the contractual 
agreements, unanimous consent is required from all parties to the agreements for all relevant activities. The Group’s joint arrangement is structured as  
a limited company and provides the Group and the parties to the agreements with rights to the net assets of the limited company under the arrangements. 
It was concluded that the contracts entered into for a sales and a manufacturing joint-venture with INOAC Corporation constituted joint-venture 
agreements, and therefore these investments have been accounted for under the equity method.
ii) Exceptional item
Due to the material and non-recurring nature of the items, the Group has disclosed the increase in past service costs as an exceptional item in 2017  
(2016: restructuring costs).

or as the Directors otherwise consider 
necessary,

shares, fractional entitlements or legal, 
regulatory or practical problems arising 
under the laws or requirements of any 
overseas territory or by virtue of shares

had not expired. Zotefoams plc Annual Report 2017 111

held by them; and
 (b)  to the allotment of equity securities or sale 
of treasury shares (otherwise than under 
paragraph (a) above) up to a nominal amount  
of £111,036,
   such authority to expire at the conclusion of the 
next Annual General Meeting of the Company 
(or, if earlier, on 30 June 2019) but, in each case, 
prior to its expiry the Company may make offers, 
and enter into agreements, which would, or 
might, require equity securities to be allotted (and 
treasury shares to be sold) after the authority 
expires and the Directors may allot equity 
securities (and sell treasury shares) under any 
such offer or agreement as if the authority had 
not expired.

transaction which the Directors determine to 
be an acquisition or other capital investment 
of a kind contemplated by the Statement of 
Principles on Disapplying Pre-Emption Rights

   such authority to expire at the conclusion of the 
next Annual General Meeting of the Company 
(or, if earlier, on 30 June 2019) but, in each case, 
prior to its expiry the Company may make offers,

shares’) provided that:
 (a)  the maximum number of ordinary shares 
authorised to be purchased is 4,441,444; 
 (b)  the minimum price which may be paid for any 
such ordinary share is 5 pence;

ordinary share shall be an amount equal to 
105% of the average middle market quotations 
for an ordinary share as derived from the 
London Stock Exchange Daily Official List for 
the five business days immediately preceding 
the day on which the ordinary share is 
contracted to be purchased; and
 (d)  this authority shall, unless previously renewed, 
revoked or varied, expire on the earlier of 30 
June 2019 and the conclusion of the next 
Annual General Meeting, but the Company may 
enter into a contract for the purchase of ordinary 
shares before the expiry of this authority which 
would or might be completed (wholly or partly) 
after its expiry.
16.  That the rules of the Zotefoams plc Approved 
Share Option Plan 2018 (the ‘2018 ASOP’), 
described in the circular of which the notice 
containing this resolution forms part and in the 
form produced in draft to the meeting and for the 
purposes of identification initialled by the Chairman 
of the meeting, be and are hereby approved and 
adopted and that the Directors be and are hereby 
authorised to do all such other acts and things as 
they may consider appropriate to implement the 
2018 ASOP , including making any changes to the 
rules of the 2018 ASOP necessary or desirable in 
order to ensure that the Directors can make a valid 
declaration to HM Revenue & Customs that the 
2018 ASOP satisfies the requirements of Schedule 
4 to the Income Tax (Earning and Pensions) Act 
2003.
17 .  That a general meeting other than an Annual 
General Meeting may be called on not less than

Notice of the 2018 Annual General Meeting 
Continued
Notes 
(i)  Pursuant to Part 13 of the Companies Act 2006 and to 
Regulation 41 of the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 
2001 (as amended), only those members registered in 
the register of members of the Company at the close of 
business on 14 May 2018 (or if the AGM is adjourned, 48 
hours before the time fixed for the adjourned AGM) shall 
be entitled to attend and vote at the AGM in respect of the 
number of shares registered in their name at that time.  
In each case, changes to the register of members after 
such time shall be disregarded in determining the rights  
of any person to attend or vote at the AGM.
(ii)  If you wish to attend the AGM in person please bring 
some form of identification (such as driver’s licence or 
bankcard) and present this to the Company’s reception 
desk on arrival. 
(iii)  A member who is entitled to attend, speak and vote 
at the AGM may appoint a proxy to attend, speak and 
vote instead of him or her. A member may appoint more 
than one proxy provided each proxy is appointed to 
exercise rights attached to different shares (so a member 
must have more than one share to be able to appoint 
more than one proxy). A proxy need not be a member 
of the Company but must attend the AGM in order to 
represent you. A proxy must vote in accordance with any 
instructions given by the member by whom the proxy is 
appointed. Appointing a proxy will not prevent a member 
from attending in person and voting at the AGM (although 
voting in person at the AGM will terminate the proxy 
appointment). A proxy form is enclosed or has been sent 
to you separately. The notes to the proxy form include 
instructions on how to appoint the Chairman of the AGM 
or another person as a proxy. You can only appoint a 
proxy using the procedures set out in these notes and in 
the notes to the proxy form.
(iv)  To be valid, a proxy form, and the original or duly certified 
copy of the power of attorney or other authority (if any) 
under which it is signed or authenticated, should reach 
the Company’s registrars, Computershare Investor 
Services plc, The Pavilions, Bridgwater Road, Bristol 
BS99 6ZY, by no later than 10.00 am on 14 May 2018. 
(v)  The proxy form includes details on how to vote 
electronically. The notes to the proxy form also include 
instructions on how to appoint a proxy by using the 
CREST proxy appointment service. You may not use any 
electronic address provided either in this notice of AGM 
or in any related documents (including the proxy form) to 
communicate with the Company for any purposes other 
than those expressly stated.
(vi)  In the case of joint holders of shares, the vote of the first 
named in the register of members who tenders a vote, 
whether in person or by proxy, shall be accepted to  
the exclusion of the votes of other joint holders.
(vii)  The following information is available at www.zotefoams.
com: (1) the matters set out in this notice of AGM; (2) the 
total numbers of shares in the Company, and shares in 
each class, in respect of which members are entitled 
to exercise voting rights at the AGM; (3) the totals of the 
voting rights that members are entitled to exercise at 
the AGM, in respect of the shares of each class; and 
(4) members’ statements, members’ resolutions and 
members’ matters of business received by the Company 
after the first date on which notice of the AGM was given. 
(viii)  If you are a person who has been nominated by a 
member to enjoy information rights in accordance with 
Section 146 of the Companies Act 2006, notes (iii) to (v) 
above do not apply to you (as the rights described in these 
notes can only be exercised by members of the Company) 
but you may have a right under an agreement between 
you and the member by whom you were nominated to be 
appointed or to have someone else appointed, as a proxy 
for the meeting. If you have no such right or do not wish to 
exercise it, you may have a right under such an agreement 
to give instructions to the member as to the exercise of 
voting rights.
(ix)  A member that is a company or other organisation not 
having a physical presence cannot attend in person but 
can appoint someone to represent it. This can be done 
in one of two ways: either by the appointment of a proxy 
(described in notes (iii) to (v) above) or of a corporate 
representative. Members considering the appointment of 
a corporate representative should check their own legal 
position, the Company’s Articles of Association and the 
relevant provision of the Companies Act 2006.
(x)  Members attending the AGM have the right to ask, and, 
subject to the provisions of the Companies Act 2006,  
the Company must cause to be answered, any questions 
relating to the business being dealt with at the AGM.
(xi)  As at the close of business on 3 April 2018, the 
Company’s issued share capital comprised 44,414,442 
ordinary shares of 5 pence each. Each ordinary share 
carries the right to one vote at a general meeting of the 
Company. No ordinary shares were held in treasury 
and accordingly the total number of voting rights in the 
Company as at the close of business on 3 April 2018 is 
44,414,442.
(xii)  Shareholders should note that it is possible that, pursuant 
to requests made by shareholders of the Company under 
Section 527 of the Companies Act 2006, the Company 
may be required to publish on a website a statement 
setting out any matter relating to: (i) the audit of the 
Company’s accounts (including the auditors’ report and 
the conduct of the audit) that are to be laid before the 
AGM; or (ii) any circumstance connected with the auditors 
of the Company ceasing to hold office since the previous 
meeting at which annual accounts and reports were laid 
in accordance with Section 437 of the Companies Act 
2006. The Company may not require the shareholders 
requesting any such website publication to pay its 
expenses in complying with Sections 527 or 528 of the 
Companies Act 2006. Where the Company is required 
to place a statement on a website under Section 527 of 
the Companies Act 2006, it must forward the statement 
to the Company’s Auditors not later than the time when 
it makes the statement available on the website. The 
business which may be dealt with at the AGM includes 
any statement that the Company has been required  
under Section 527 of the Companies Act 2006 to  
publish on a website.
(xiii)  Copies of the Executive Directors’ service contracts with 
the Company and any of its subsidiary undertakings, 
deeds of indemnity in favour of the Directors and letters of 
appointment of the Non-Executive Directors are available 
for inspection at the registered office of the Company 
during the usual business hours on any weekday 
(Saturday, Sunday or public holidays excluded) from the 
date of this notice until the conclusion of the AGM.  Zotefoams plc Annual Report 2017 113

Explanatory notes to the resolutions 
Ordinary business 
Resolution 1 – Receiving the Annual Report 
Shareholders will be asked to receive the Company’s Annual 
Report for the financial year ended 31 December 2017 , as 
required by law.
Resolution 2 – Directors’ Remuneration Report 
Resolutions 2 seeks shareholder approval of the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report for the year ended 31 December 2017 
which can be found on pages 46 to 56 (inclusive) of the  
Annual Report.
The Company’s Auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP , have 
audited those parts of the Directors’ remuneration report that 
are required to be audited and their report may be found on 
pages 61 to 65 of the Annual Report.
The Shareholders approved the current Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy at the AGM held on 17 May 2017 and it 
became effective immediately. As there have been no changes 
to the Directors’ Remuneration Policy, there is no need to seek 
further approval of it at this year’s AGM. The current intention  
is to submit the Directors’ Remuneration Policy for Shareholder 
approval at the AGM scheduled for 2020, unless, in the interim, 
there are specific changes that require Shareholder approval. 
The Directors’ Remuneration Policy may be found in the 2016 
Annual Report on pages 41 to 52 (inclusive).
Resolution 3 – Declaration of dividend 
This resolution concerns the Company’s final dividend 
payment. The Directors are recommending a final dividend  
of 4.02 pence per ordinary share in respect of the year ended 
31 December 2017 which, if approved, will be payable on  
24 May 2018 to the shareholders on the register of members 
on 20 April 2018.
Resolutions 4 to 9 – Election and re-election of Directors 
Resolutions 4 and 5 concern the election of J D Carling and D 
G Robertson, who were both appointed to the Board since the 
last AGM was held on 17 May 2017 .
The UK Corporate Governance Code requires all directors of 
FTSE 350 companies to stand for annual re-election. Whilst 
the Company is not within the FTSE 350, best practice for 
listed companies is to follow this requirement and, therefore, 
the Board has decided for this year that all the Directors will 
stand for annual re-election. Resolutions 6 to 9 concern the 
re-election of A C Bromfield, S P Good, G C McGrath and  
D B Stirling.
R J Clowes will not be standing for annual re-election and  
will be retiring from the Board at the close of the AGM.
Biographies for the Directors are set out on pages 36 and 37 
of the Annual Report for the year ended 31 December 2017 . 
The Chairman having undertaken performance reviews of the 
Directors and the Non-Executive Directors of the Chairman, 
the Board is satisfied that each Director continues to be 
effective and demonstrates commitment to the role and 
recommends that each Director should be re-elected.
Resolutions 10 and 11 – Re-appointment of Auditors and  
their remuneration 
Resolution 10 concerns the re-appointment of 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as the Company’s Auditors,  
to hold office until the conclusion of the Company’s next 
general meeting where accounts are laid.
Resolution 11 authorises the Audit Committee to determine  
the Auditors’ remuneration.
Special Business 
Resolution 12 – Power to allot shares 
This resolution grants the Directors authority to allot shares 
in the capital of the Company and other relevant securities 
up to an aggregate nominal value of £740,240, representing 
approximately one-third (33.33%) of the nominal value of the 
issued ordinary share capital of the Company as at 3 April 
2018, being the latest practicable date before publication 
of this notice. In addition, in accordance with the latest 
institutional guidelines issued by the Investment Association, 
paragraph (b) of resolution 13 grants the Directors authority to 
allot further equity securities up to an aggregate nominal value 
of £1,480,481, representing approximately two-thirds (66.67%) 
of the nominal value of the issued ordinary share capital of the 
Company as at 3 April 2018, being the latest practicable date 
before publication of this notice. This additional authority may 
be only applied to fully pre-emptive rights issues.
The intention of the authority granted pursuant to paragraph 
(b) of resolution 12 is to preserve maximum flexibility and if the 
Directors do exercise this authority, they intend to follow best 
practice as regards its use.
The Company does not currently hold any shares as treasury 
shares within the meaning of Section 724 of the Companies 
Act 2006 (‘Treasury Shares’).
The Directors consider it desirable that the specified amount 
of authorised but unissued share capital is available for issue 
so that they can more readily take advantage of possible 
opportunities.
Unless revoked, varied or extended, this authority will expire 
at the conclusion of the next AGM of the Company or 30 June 
2019, whichever is the earlier.
Resolutions 13 and 14 – Authority to allot shares  
disregarding pre-emption rights 
These resolutions authorise the Directors in certain 
circumstances to allot equity securities for cash other 
than in accordance with the statutory pre-emption rights 
(which require a company to offer all allotments for cash 
first to existing shareholders in proportion to their holdings). 
Resolution 13 authorises the Directors to issue shares either 
where the allotment takes place in connection with a rights 
issue or the allotment is limited to a maximum nominal amount 
of £111,036, representing approximately 5% of the nominal 
value of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company as at 
3 April 2018 being the latest practicable date before publication 
of this notice. Resolution 14 authorises the Directors to issue a 
further 5% of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company, 
but only to be used to raise finance for an acquisition or a 
specified capital investment (within the meaning given in 
the Pre–Emption Group’s Statement of Principles) which is 
announced contemporaneously with the allotment, or which 
has taken place in the preceding six-month period and is 
disclosed in the announcement of the allotment.
Unless revoked, varied or extended, these authorities will 
expire at the conclusion of the next AGM of the Company  
or 30 June 2019, whichever is the earlier.
The Directors consider that the powers proposed to be 
granted by these resolutions are necessary to retain flexibility 
to allot shares. Zotefoams plc Annual Report 2017 114
Notice of the 2018 Annual General Meeting 
Continued
Resolution 15 – Authority to purchase shares  
(market purchases) 
This resolution authorises the Board to make market 
purchases of up to 4,441,444 ordinary shares (representing 
approximately 10% of the Company’s issued ordinary shares 
as at 3 April 2018, being the latest practicable date before 
publication of this notice). Shares so purchased may be 
cancelled or held as Treasury Shares. The authority will expire 
at the end of the next AGM of the Company or 30 June 2019, 
whichever is the earlier. The Directors intend to seek renewal  
of this authority at subsequent AGMs.
The minimum price that can be paid for an ordinary share is 
5 pence being the nominal value of an ordinary share. The 
maximum price that can be paid is 5% over the average of the 
middle market prices for an ordinary share, derived from the 
Daily Official List of the London Stock Exchange, for the five 
business days immediately before the day on which the share 
is contracted to be purchased.
The Directors intend to exercise this right only when, in light 
of the market conditions prevailing at the time and taking into 
account all relevant factors (for example, the effect on earnings 
per share), they believe that such purchases are in the best 
interests of the Company and shareholders generally. The 
overall position of the Company will be taken into account 
before deciding upon this course of action. The decision as to 
whether any such shares bought back will be cancelled or held 
in treasury will be made by the Directors on the same basis at 
the time of the purchase.
As at 3 April 2018, being the latest practicable date before 
publication of this notice, there were outstanding awards 
under the Company’s long-term incentive schemes (excluding 
the Share Incentive Plan) in respect of 805,899 ordinary 
shares in the capital of the Company representing 1.8% of 
the Company’s issued ordinary share capital. If the authority 
to purchase the Company’s ordinary shares were exercised 
in full, such awards would represent 2.0% of the Company’s 
issued ordinary share capital.
Resolution 16 – Approved Share Option Plan 
Resolution 16 is to authorise the adoption of the Zotefoams plc 
Approved Share Option Plan 2018 (the ‘2018 ASOP’).
The 2018 ASOP replace the Company’s existing ASOP that 
will expire on 8 May 2018 (the ‘Old Share Plan’). Shareholder 
approval is sought for the approval of the 2018 ASOP at the 
AGM to ensure that the Company has the appropriate share 
incentives. No new awards will be made under the Old Share 
Plan after 8 May 2018.
There are no material differences between the Old Share Plan 
and the 2018 ASOP , save for the following: 
  addition of malus and clawback arrangements; and
  addition of revised leaver and change of control provisions.
The rules of the 2018 ASOP will be available for inspection 
during normal business hours on Monday to Friday (excluding 
bank holidays) at the Company’s registered office and on 
its website from the date of this document until the close of 
the AGM and at the place of the AGM for at least 15 minutes 
before the AGM and during the AGM.
Resolution 17 – Notice period for general meetings 
Under the Companies Act 2006, a listed company must give 
at least 21 days’ notice of its general meetings. However, 
this Act enables general meetings (other than AGMs) to be 
held on shorter notice of not less than 14 days provided the 
shareholders have given their consent at the previous AGM 
or a general meeting held since the last AGM. Resolution 17 
seeks such approval similar to the resolution that was passed 
last year. The approval will be effective until the Company’s 
next AGM, when it is intended that a similar resolution will be 
proposed. The Directors will always endeavour to give as much 
notice as possible of general meetings, but would like to have 
the flexibility to call a general meeting on the shorter permitted 
notice period for time sensitive matters that are clearly in the 
shareholders’ interests. If the authority is used, the Company 
will offer the ability, as required by the Companies Act 2006,

SUMMARY OF THE PRINCIPAL FEATURES 
OF THE ZOTEFOAMS PLC APPROVED Share 
OPTION PLAN 2018 (2018 ASOP)
Eligibility
The 2018 ASOP will be operated and administered by 
the Remuneration Committee of the Board of Directors 
of the Company (the ‘Remuneration Committee’).
The Remuneration Committee will determine who 
may participate in the 2018 ASOP and this will extend 
to any employee (including any executive directors of 
subsidiaries) of the Company or any of the Company’s 
subsidiaries. Directors granted options under the ASOP 
must be full-time Directors devoting not less than 
25 hours a week to the performance of their duties. 
Options cannot be granted to a participant who has a 
material interest in the Company.
Operation
Under the 2018 ASOP , selected employees and 
Executive Directors will be granted options over 
ordinary shares in the Company (“Shares”) at an 
exercise price that is equal to or more than market 
value (“Options”). Options granted under the 2018 
ASOP are intended to be qualifying options under 
Schedule 4 of ITEPA (“Schedule 4”) and as such  
qualify for beneficial tax treatment.
Performance conditions 
Options shall be subject to the satisfaction of a 
performance condition measured over a performance 
period if options are granted to Executive Directors 
of the Company. Whilst Options granted to other 
employees of the Group may be subject to the 
satisfaction of a performance condition, this will be 
determined by the Remuneration Committee at the 
time of grant. 
Performance conditions may be amended or 
substituted if one or more events occur which cause 
the Remuneration Committee to consider that an 
amended or substituted performance condition would 
be more appropriate. Any amended or substituted 
performance condition would not be materially less 
difficult to satisfy than the original condition was 
intended to be.
Individual limits
For Executive Directors of the Company, the maximum 
number of Options that may be granted under the 
2018 ASOP will be the limit as set out in the Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy that is in force at the date of grant 
of the Option.
No option holders may be granted an option under the 
2018 ASOP such that the market value of the Shares 
granted under it or any other option granted under the 
2018 ASOP or any other option plan qualifying under 
Schedule 4 exceeds £30,000, calculated at the date of 
grant.
Grant of Options
Options may only be granted within the period of 42 
days following the approval of the 2018 ASOP by the 
Company’s shareholders, the announcement of the 
Company’s results for any period, from the date on 
which an individual becomes an eligible employee 
under the rules of the 2018 ASOP or any day on 
which the Remuneration Committee determines that 
exceptional circumstances exist. If, during such period, 
the Company is restricted from granting Options, 
Options may be made immediately following such 
restrictions ceasing to apply.
Exercise Price
The exercise price of Options is determined by the 
Remuneration Committee and must not be less than 
the market value of a Share calculated either as the 
price on the business day before the date of grant or, if 
the Remuneration Committee determines, the average 
price over a number of business days, not exceeding 
five, preceding the date of grant.
Exercise of Options
Options may normally only be exercised between the 
third and tenth anniversary of the grant date. To the 
extent not exercised during this period the Option will 
lapse. Any Options which are subject to performance 
conditions may normally only be exercised after the 
third anniversary of the grant date to the extent any 
conditions have been met. 
If a participant dies, his or her Option may be exercised 
to the extent that any performance conditions have 
been satisfied by his or her personal representatives 
for a period of 12 months following death to the extent 
vested (or to such further extent as the Remuneration 
Committee may determine). If a participant ceases to 
be employed by the Company or any other member  
of the Group by reason of ill health, injury, disability,  
a sale of the entity that employs the participant out of 
the Group, or for any other reason at the Remuneration 
Committee’s discretion, Options can be exercised 
to the extent vested within 6 months of the date of 
cessation of employment provided the options have  
not already lapsed.
The Remuneration Committee has the discretion  
to allow the Option to be exercised in full.
If a participant ceases to be employed by the Company 
for any other reason, Options will lapse on the earlier 
of the date notice of such cessation is received from 
the participant or when the participant ceases to hold 
office or employment.
Reduction for malus and clawback
The Remuneration Committee may, in its absolute 
discretion, determine at any time within five years of  
the grant of an Option to:
  reduce the number of Shares to which an Option 
relates;
  cancel an Option;
  impose further conditions on an Option; or
  require the participant to transfer to the Company  
(or the Employees’ Benefit Trust) a number of Shares 
or a cash amount,
in circumstances where: 
  the financial statements or results for the Group  
are materially restated (other than restatement  
due to a change in accounting policy or to rectify  
a minor error);
Appendix
(which summarises the rules of the 2018 ASOP) Zotefoams plc Annual Report 2017 116
  if in the reasonable opinion of the Remuneration 
Committee and following consultation with the 
relevant group member:
–  a participant has deliberately misled the 
management of the Company and/or the market 
and/or the Company’s shareholders regarding the 
financial performance of any part of the Group; 
–  the participant’s actions have caused the Group 
company and/or the participant’s business unit 
reputational damage;
–  a participant’s actions amount to serious 
misconduct or conduct which causes significant 
financial loss for the Group and/or the participant’s 
business unit; or
–  there have been overpayments, including any 
vesting under the 2018 ASOP , to the participant at 
a level higher than would have otherwise been the 
case due to material abnormal write-offs affecting 
any Group company on an exceptional basis.
Corporate events
On a change of control of the Company, the number 
of Shares in respect of which Options vest shall be 
determined by the Remuneration Committee, having 
regard to the extent to which any performance 
condition has been satisfied at the date of change 
of control and, unless the Remuneration Committee 
determines otherwise, pro-rating such vesting to reflect 
the period from the start of the performance period to 
the date of the relevant event (or such other relevant 
period). The Options will then be exercisable for a 
period of one month and will then lapse.
Alternatively, the Remuneration Committee may permit 
or, in the case of an internal reorganisation or if the 
Remuneration Committee determined any other event, 
require Options to be exchanged for equivalent options 
which relate to Shares in a different company.
If other corporate events occur such as a demerger, 
special dividend or other event which, in the opinion 
of the Remuneration Committee, may affect the value 
of Shares to a material extent, the Remuneration 
Committee may determine that Options will vest 
conditional on the event occurring. The number of 
Shares in respect of which Options vest shall be 
determined by the Remuneration Committee, having 
regard to the extent to which any performance 
condition has been satisfied and, unless the 
Remuneration Committee determines otherwise, 
pro-rating to reflect the period from the start of the 
performance period to the date of the relevant event  
(or such other relevant period). If the event does not 
occur, Options will continue on their original terms.
Adjustments
In the event of any rights issue or capitalisation, sub-
division, consolidation, reduction or other variation 
of the ordinary share capital, the Remuneration 
Committee may make such adjustments as it considers 
appropriate to the number of Shares and the exercise 
price subject to Options.
Terms of Awards
Options may be granted over newly issued Shares, 
treasury Shares or Shares purchased in the market. 
Options are not transferable (other than on death). No 
payment will be required from participants for the grant 
of any Options.
Limits on the issue of Shares
The 2018 ASOP is subject to the following overall limits:
  On any date, the number of Shares which may be 
issued or issuable pursuant to rights granted in the 
preceding 10 year period under the 2018 ASOP  
and under any other employees’ share plan adopted 
by the Company may not exceed 10% of the issued 
ordinary share capital of the Company on that  
date; and
  on any date, the number of Shares which may be 
issued or issuable pursuant to rights granted in the 
preceding 10 year period under the 2018 ASOP 
and any other discretionary employees’ share plan 
adopted by the Company may not exceed 7 .5% of 
the Company’s issued ordinary share capital on the 
day preceding that date.
Treasury Shares will be treated as newly issued for the 
purpose of these limits until such time as guidelines 
published by institutional investor representative bodies 
determine otherwise. Shares purchased in the market 
are not subject to these limits.
The above limits may be varied by the Remuneration 
Committee to take into account any variation in the 
Company’s share capital from time to time.
Rights attaching to Shares
All Shares provided under the 2018 ASOP will rank pari 
passu with all other Shares of the Company for the time 
being in issue (save as regards any rights attaching to 
such Shares by reference to a record date prior to the 
date of issue or transfer to the participant). 
Amendments and termination
The Remuneration Committee may amend the 2018 
ASOP at any time, provided that prior approval of 
the Company’s Shareholders in a general meeting 
will be required for amendments to the advantage of 
employees relating to eligibility, limits, the basis for 
determining a participant’s entitlement to, and the 
terms of, the Shares comprised in an award and the 
impact of any variation of capital.
However, any minor amendment to benefit 
administration, or any amendment to take account of 
legislative changes, or to obtain or maintain favourable 
tax, exchange control or regulatory treatment in 
any jurisdiction, may be made by the Remuneration 
Committee without Shareholder approval.
No further awards may be made under the 2018 
ASOP on or after the tenth anniversary of the approval 
by shareholders of the 2018 ASOP , but the rights 
of existing participants will not be affected by any 
termination.
Overseas plans
The Remuneration Committee may establish such 
sub-plans or schedules to the 2018 ASOP , modified 
to take account of local tax, exchange controls or 
securities laws if required to do so or if it is beneficial 
to do so in any overseas jurisdiction, provided that any 
Shares made available under such plans are treated 
as counting against the limits on individual and overall 
participation in the 2018 ASOP .
Pension benefits
Benefits under the 2018 ASOP are non-pensionable.
