Group sales were £6,125m, 5% lower
than 2001, largely as a consequence of
divestments, principally in the Regional and
Industrial businesses, and adverse exchange
rate movements.
Trading profit for the International
Businesses (National Starch, Quest,
Performance Specialties and Paints) was
£543m, 5% below 2001, but only 1% lower
on a comparable basis with Paints 9% up
and National Starch 5% up offset by the
performance of Quest, 23% lower, and
Performance Specialties, 24% lower.
Group profit before tax, goodwill
amortisation and exceptional items was
£400m, essentially in line with 2001.
Return on average net assets The
International Businesses achieved a 20%
return, (2001 20%) despite the lower trading
profit.
Dividends declared at 7.5p per Ordinary
Share.
Net debt reduced by £1,250m to £1,667m
at the end of 2002, mainly as a result of
proceeds from the Rights Issue of £807m and
business divestments. In addition, the Group
generated a net operating cash inflow of
£99m, £164m better than for 2001.
Trading profit, profit before tax and earnings per share
figures are quoted before goodwill amortisation and
exceptional items throughout this Report, including pages
7 to 9, unless otherwise stated.
References to “comparable” performance exclude the
effect of currency translation differences and the impact
of acquisitions and divestments on the results reported
by the International Businesses. Reconciliations between
“comparable” and “as reported” performance measures
for the International Businesses are provided on pages
28 and 31. All references to the Group’s performance
are “as reported”.

selected financial data As we looked ahead at the beginning of 2002, we shared
the widespread optimism that we would see a recovery
in the major economies around the globe, stronger stock
markets and rising consumer confidence. Instead, as the
year progressed, it became clear that 2002 would be
another very challenging year for business. The majority
of our major markets, with the notable exception of China,
experienced little or no economic growth and fragile
consumer confidence.
The weakness in global stock markets and the effect on
individual and household net worth and consumer sentiment
gave cause for widespread concern, as did the continuing
anxiety over the threat of terrorism and, particularly in the
latter half of the year, the increased threat to global security.
When one adds to this mix of negative factors, the shocking
revelations of corporate malfeasance and large corporate
failures, principally in the United States, during the year, it is
perhaps surprising that consumer behaviour was not even
more seriously affected.
With this as the geo-political and economic backdrop, I
am pleased to record that ICI finished the year in sounder
shape, financially, than it was a year earlier. Thanks to strong
shareholder support for the Rights Issue in the first quarter,
combined with the proceeds from the sale of assets and
tightly focused management of working capital, your Company’s
balance sheet has been substantially strengthened. These
actions to reduce Group debt were successful in protecting
our credit rating. With the actions taken during 2002 behind
us, the shape and structure of the Group is now essentially
set and our primary focus for the future will be on the growth
and development of our International Businesses.
Despite the weak economic environment, the International
Businesses turned in a creditable performance. The Group
achieved sales of £6,125m in 2002, 5% lower than in 2001,
mainly due to business disposals and exchange translation
effects. Profit before tax at £400m was essentially the same
as in 2001 and earnings per share for 2002 were 23.7p, both
quoted before goodwill amortisation and exceptional items.
The dividend for the year was 7.5p.
As we look to 2003, we believe it would be prudent to
assume that the competitive environment will continue to be
challenging and that high levels of customer satisfaction will
require the very highest levels of quality, value and technology.
This standard of performance must be achieved with world-
class productivity and overall business efficiency to achieve
satisfactory financial results.
The ICI team is dedicated to achieving these imperatives.
We have a highly skilled and motivated management and
workforce and immense technological capability. Our products
number in the tens of thousands and we compete in a wide
range of market segments, including food, personal care,
home improvement and adhesives. We believe that our
extensive product and technology base provides us with a
solid foundation on which to build. As in 2002, the efficient
use of capital will be of the highest priority. We will continue
to compete vigorously in all of the world’s major market
places and will place particular emphasis on the high
growth countries.
And finally, a comment on governance. ICI has a long history
of adhering to a strong ethical code. It is a tradition of which
we are proud and, as custodians of that tradition, we are
deeply conscious of the trust that you have placed in us. I
want to assure you that your Board of Directors continues
to be dedicated to the highest standards of corporate
governance, financial control and reporting.
I would like to thank you again for your support for the Rights
Issue in early 2002 and, on behalf of the entire ICI team, give
you our pledge that we will continue to do all in our power to
deliver value to you, our shareholders.

hoped-for global economic upturn did not materialise, we
emerged in substantially better shape than a year earlier.
The early months of the year were dominated by the successful
execution of the Rights Issue, which raised net proceeds
of just over £800m, making it one of the largest to date in
London. It received excellent and much appreciated support,
with shareholders taking up more than 91% of the rights.
Once again, I’d like to thank shareholders for confirming their
confidence that ICI’s strategy is the right one to deliver long-
term success.
The intended sale of Synetix, our catalyst business, was
announced in February. A sale agreement with Johnson
Matthey was concluded in September and the divestment
was subsequently completed with gross proceeds of £260m.
In June we also reached agreement with CSFB Global
Opportunities Partners for the sale of ICI’s interest in
Huntsman International Holdings. We received an initial 
cash payment of $160m (£109m) with the balance of $280m
(£174m) payable before the end of May 2003.
The combination of the Rights Issue, divestment proceeds
and our success in improving organic cash generation,
reduced the level of year-end debt from almost £3bn in 2001
to less than £1.7bn in 2002. Interest cover for the year rose
from 3.5 to 4.3 times.
With structurally lower levels of debt, ICI exited 2002 with
a balance sheet that provides a solid foundation from which
to grow the profit of our core specialty products and paints
businesses.
Performance 2002
In performance terms, our businesses once again demonstrated
resilience in economically difficult times. Profit before tax,
goodwill amortisation and exceptional items of £400m was
only £1m lower than last year. Our International Businesses
delivered comparable sales growth of 1% and trading profit of
£543m that was only 1% lower, on a comparable basis. Given
the weakness in most major Western economies, this was a
creditable performance. Overall gross margin percentages in
the International Businesses were maintained at last year’s
level and fixed costs were well controlled. The Group’s net
operating cash flow improved substantially for the year,
particularly with the benefits of further working capital
efficiency improvements in the International Businesses.
The International Businesses achieved comparable sales
growth in three regions of the world, with the strongest
growth in Asia. The Group also performed well in North
America and Europe, seen against the backdrop of lower
economic growth. And, whilst sales in hard currency terms
were down in Latin America, the significant weakening of the
exchange rates in Argentina and Brazil were primary
contributors to this.
Paints once again led the way, despite the difficult economic
conditions in Latin America, with continued double-digit sales
and profit growth in Asia and good performances in both
Europe and North America.
National Starch improved sales and profit with excellent
progress in Asia and a return to growth in North America. Its
electronics businesses grew sales by 6% in difficult markets
and, in the second half, adhesives returned to top-line growth.
Food and Industrial Starches and Specialty Synthetic
Polymers also delivered good sales growth.
chief executive’s statement Uniqema made a weak start to the year, with industrial
demand down. The picture improved somewhat as the year
progressed, but year-on-year comparable profits fell 24%,
although the high growth potential areas of lubricants and
personal care were more encouraging, with sales growth of
9% and 4% respectively.
Quest achieved good sales growth in North America and Asia.
Fine fragrances performed particularly strongly. However,
problems in the second quarter with new supply chain
systems caused an order backlog at our major Food site in
the Netherlands. Although the problem was largely rectified
by October, production was disrupted for a period. Quest is
determined to restore its reputation for excellent customer
service.
For our Regional and Industrial businesses, higher profits in
Pakistan and Argentina were offset by the loss of profits from
divested businesses and a legal provision.
Despite the respectable overall performance, I regret that I
cannot report the improvement in ICI’s share price for which
we are all working. Against our selected peer group, our
ranking in terms of Total Shareholder Return remained 13
of 17. This performance is disappointing. The Board and I
continue to believe that ICI has all the necessary components
for an improved placing and are committed to achieving that
improvement.
I remain convinced that, given the improved strength of our
balance sheet, our stated goals – organic sales growth of 4 to
5% (1 to 2% above global GDP), plus another 1 to 2% growth
from synergistic bolt-on acquisitions – are achievable, once
economies improve. We believe that this, in combination with
improved operational effectiveness, will provide the basis for
consistent, longer-term profit growth.
Exciting progress
We’re already making progress on a number of fronts. We are
launching innovative new products across the Group, such as
Paints’ one-coat elastomeric ‘Polycell Basecoat’, which was
an instant success in the UK. Our science and technology
function continues to enhance its reputation. National Starch
researchers, for example, are working with the US Army
Research Laboratories developing sealants and encapsulants
to protect tomorrow’s flexible flat screens from moisture and
oxygen. Some of our largest global customers have
expressed interest in understanding how ICI businesses’
technology and know-how might be leveraged in collaborations
to generate long-term added value for their product
development programmes.
ICI is focused on growth and we have an increasing number
of people in the regions with significant potential. In China,
an important growth market, we now have 1,400 employees,
up from some 900 only four years ago, and we continue to
invest in manufacturing and marketing facilities in the country.
ICI is global, but our success is often built on local management
able to understand and respond to local consumer and
customer requirements.
In May we published “The ICI Report on the Secrets of the
Senses”, Dr Charles Spence of Oxford University’s ground
breaking research into the importance of sensory experience
for health and emotional wellbeing. This helped focus
attention on ICI’s expertise in the growth areas of the science
of sight, scent, taste and touch, the heart of our business
today.
Our people
In conclusion, I want to thank our employees all around the
world for the dedication and effort that delivered commendable
results under difficult conditions. When the tide turns, I know
we will be ready.

General
ICI is one of the world’s leading specialty products and paints
businesses with products and ingredients developed for a wide range
of consumer and industrial markets.
In 1997, ICI began the process of refocusing the business from
commodity chemicals into higher value added specialty products
and paints, addressing specific and specialised customer needs. This
transformation is now essentially complete. The Group’s businesses
are now more knowledge intensive than capital intensive and focused
on delivering innovative products to customers in a wide range of
sectors of the world economy.
The specialty products and paint businesses, referred to as the
International Businesses, comprise National Starch, Quest, Performance
Specialties and Paints. These businesses serve diverse consumer
and industrial markets through some 40 strategic business units,
comprising close to 100 operating units with an array of market
leadership positions across the world. In addition, a number of
Regional and Industrial businesses remain in ICI’s portfolio.
ICI believes that its International Businesses have a quality customer
and product mix, strong management teams and potential for profitable
growth. The higher growth potential businesses include electronic and
engineering materials, specialty food starches, flavours and fragrances,
personal care ingredients, lubricants and, in Asia, adhesives and
decorative paints.
Group Strategy
The Group’s businesses operate across a wide spectrum of consumer
and industrial markets, and across a wide geographic spread. Its
strategy is to be an industry leader in creating value for its customers
and shareholders in its chosen markets. This requires ICI to achieve
profitable organic sales growth. The key aspects of this strategy
are to:
• focus on higher value added specialty products and brands,
• serve a wide range of markets including a number of niche markets,
• develop long-term relationships with customers by addressing their
specific and specialised needs,
• innovate and use technology creatively to facilitate organic growth,
• invest in growth markets and build leading market positions,
• grow through organic growth supplemented by small, strategic,
bolt-on acquisitions in its chosen growth areas,
• improve its operational performance, and
• pursue synergies across the Group.
In order to implement its strategy, the Group aims to attract, train and
develop talented people and to maintain a strong commitment to
safety, health and the environment.
Group Financial Objectives
The Group’s financial objectives derive from a combination of top-
down goals and a bi-annual strategic planning process. These
strategic financial objectives then form the basis for all financial
targets. At the Group level, management is focused on achieving the
following goals over the medium term. While demanding, management
believes they should be achievable.
Sales growth
With respect to sales, management is aiming to achieve organic
growth of 4 to 5% per annum on average (1 to 2% over assumed
GDP). Subject to the right opportunities becoming available,
management is aiming to achieve on average a further 1 to 2% growth
per annum through small strategic bolt-on acquisitions in its chosen
growth areas.
Trading margin expansion
Average trading margin (before amortisation of goodwill and
exceptional items) for the Group in 2002 was 9% (2001 9%).
Management is aiming to achieve an improvement in trading margin of
approximately 0.5% per annum on average over the next 4 to 5 years.
Recent history
In July 1997, ICI took a major step to reposition its business towards
the higher added value sector of the industry with the acquisition of
the companies and businesses comprising the Speciality Chemicals
division of Unilever PLC and Unilever N.V. for a cash consideration
of $8 billion (£4.8 billion). This acquisition was consistent with its
strategy to shift its business profile towards products which meet
specific customer needs and to areas where leading positions in
profitable growth markets can be won through the application of its
technology and skills.
Consistent with the Group’s strategy, ICI has divested nearly all of
its industrial chemicals portfolio, including its Polyester, Fertilisers,
Tioxide, Petrochemicals, Chlor-Chemicals and Klea businesses. Since
July 1997, ICI has divested more than 50 businesses with proceeds
from the sale of assets and businesses in excess of £7.0 billion. In
addition, it has continued to reposition its business towards higher
added value sectors of the industry through a number of acquisitions
within the international specialty and paints businesses. ICI believes
that it has now essentially completed the transformation of the Group.
However, the Group will continue to look for opportunities to grow its
business both organically and through small, strategic bolt-on
acquisitions, thereby strengthening its portfolio.
In 2001, ICI initiated a wide ranging restructuring programme across
all of its International Businesses in order to underpin future growth
and provide cost savings and working capital improvements.
In September 2002 ICI concluded the sale of Synetix, its catalyst
business, subsequently completing the transaction in December – within
12 months of first announcing its intention to divest the business.
description of business Geographic focus
ICI’s headquarters is in the UK, where it also has several significant manufacturing sites. Outside the UK, operations are conducted by locally
managed subsidiary companies staffed almost entirely by nationals of the country concerned. Eighty-four per cent of the employees of ICI’s
businesses are located outside the UK.

ICI ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS AND FORM 20-F 2002
Continuing operations
ICI’s businesses comprise National Starch, Quest, Performance
Specialties and ICI Paints, which are referred to as the International
Businesses, and a number of smaller Regional and Industrial
businesses.
National Starch
National Starch, which accounted for 30% of the Group’s sales in
2002, is a global leader in industrial adhesives and specialty food
starches. In addition, the business has strong positions in electronic
materials, specialty polymers and specialty starches, and has niche
businesses in personal care and healthcare ingredients. It provides
specialty ingredients for attractive, relatively non-cyclical and high
growth markets. The Group believes that National Starch’s position
in these markets has been achieved through its unique polymer
technology and application understanding, both natural and synthetic,
and a high degree of technical support for its customers. Within the
overall Group strategy, National Starch’s strategy is to:
• continue to build on these strengths in areas where it sees good
growth opportunities, such as electronic materials, personal care,
and Asia Pacific,
• innovate and introduce new products to all of its customers, and
• focus in its more mature businesses on improved cost efficiency.
National Starch produces thousands of technically advanced products
and operates an international network of 153 manufacturing and
customer service centres, located in 37 countries on six continents. 
National Starch’s world and American headquarters is in Bridgewater,
New Jersey, USA. Its European headquarters is in High Wycombe,
UK and its Asia Pacific operations headquarters is in Singapore.
Major manufacturing facilities are located in the USA, Canada, the 
UK, Germany, Netherlands, Japan, Thailand, Korea, China and Brazil,
with other manufacturing facilities located in 21 other countries around
the world.
In 2002 the Electronic and Engineering Materials (EEM) business
opened a new manufacturing and technical facility near Shanghai,
China, where the Acheson unit manufactures materials to supply to
Chinese and multi-national customers in the electronic and automotive
industries. Ablestik, another EEM business, expanded its facility in
Linton, near Cambridge, in the UK to meet the growing needs of
European semi-conductor and micro-electronic manufacturers.
National Starch comprises four distinct business groupings:
• Adhesives (41% of National Starch sales in 2002),
• Specialty Starches (25% of National Starch sales in 2002),
• Specialty Synthetic Polymers (20% of National Starch sales in 2002),
and
• Electronic and Engineering Materials (EEM) (14% of National Starch
sales in 2002).
Adhesives
National Starch is one of the largest producers of industrial adhesives
in the world. It manufactures a broad range of adhesive types,
including adhesives based on both natural and synthetic polymers,
water-borne, hot melts, 100% solids, reactive adhesives and pressure
sensitive adhesives.
The division’s products are used in packaging for sealing cases and
cartons and fixing labels to bottles and cans. There are a number of
paper converting applications such as laminating, bag making, tissue,
paper tube winding and box manufacturing. Converting adhesives are
also used in bookbinding, envelopes, magazines, and remoistenable
stamps. Adhesives are also critical components in the construction of
disposable nappies/diapers, personal sanitary products and
disposable hospital supplies.
National Starch’s high performance curing adhesives are used to
laminate plastic films, metal foils and paper for numerous flexible
packaging applications. Pressure sensitive adhesives are used to
manufacture self-adhesive tapes, labels, decals, and transdermal
drug delivery patches.
National Starch’s adhesives and primers are used in the assembly of
sports shoes. The Bondmaster business unit supplies adhesives for
assembly operations in the woodworking, construction and
transportation industries.
For the corrugating industry, specialty carrier starches provide bond
strength for adhering board to corrugating medium and contribute to
increased production and reduced waste. They improve the overall
quality and water resistance of meat, fruit, vegetable and shipping
cases. Specialty synthetic polymer products add increased water
resistance for demanding applications.
In 2002, the division introduced a number of new products including:
‘Cool-Lok’ 34-274A, a low temperature hot melt adhesive that resists
high heat better than previous products; ‘Ultracase’ 100% solid
adhesive that permits bookbinders to eliminate waste caused by
moisture; and ‘Ultra-Set’ glued lap adhesive for corrugated
containers.
Specialty Starches
National Starch’s food starches are an important part of many
everyday foods. They enhance texture and appearance and provide
effects which enable end-consumer products to withstand the rigours
of ultra high temperature (UHT) processing, microwave cooking,
freeze/thaw cycles and extended storage.
In the specialty food ingredients area, the Starch division produces
products which are used for fruit preparations, meals and canned
foods, binders for meat and fish products and pet foods and a range
of coating agents to control texture, crispiness and appearance in
battered foods. Products for the dairy market are used to improve the
quality and stability of a range of dairy foods. Ingredients for cereals
and snacks influence the expansion, texture and eating quality of a
variety of baked, fried and extruded foods. National Starch’s stabilisers
and thickeners are used to control the viscosity, stability, mouth-feel
and texture of a wide variety of sauces and salad dressings. In the
bakery market, the division’s ingredients are used to control the
moisture retention, texture and structure of baked doughs and their
fillings. Encapsulation products encapsulate flavours and fragrances,
stabilise flavour emulsions and are used in starches that improve
mouth-feel properties in beverage systems. 
Products in pharmaceutical and nutrition areas include specialty starches
for use as carriers, binders and disintegrants in tablets and capsules,
thickeners for liquid dosage medicines, pharmaceutical grade dusting
powders for surgical gloves and specialty ingredients for the nutrition
industry. 13
In the pulp and paper industry, the division’s specialty starches
provide strength and contribute to enhanced productivity in the
manufacture of unbleached kraft, fine papers, bleached board,
newsprint and recycled fibre stocks. Additives and liquid polymers
improve the biodegradability and strength of tissue and towel
products. Specialty surface size starches increase runnability in the
size press and printability on the end user’s printing press, while
replacing more costly functional additives.
The division has also created a starch-based replacement for plastic
packaging. ‘Eco-Foam’ loosefill is composed of nearly 100% starch
and protects the contents of packages as effectively as polystyrene
“peanuts”, yet is fully degradable and decomposes in water.
New products introduced in 2002 included: 100% organic ‘Novation’
starches that enable food manufacturers to include the texture and
taste consumers seek along with foods they feel will help them stay
healthy; and ‘Versa-Sheen’ glazing agent which enables bakers to
coat items such as croissants and cookies with an attractive high
sheen.
Specialty Synthetic Polymers
National Starch has multiple capabilities in specialty polymers, resins
and redispersible powders for markets as diverse as personal care,
construction, water treatment, detergents, paper coatings and apparel.
The Vinamul Polymer business’s binders, saturants and laminants add
desirable characteristics to non-wovens (fibrefill, interlinings,
disposable garments), textiles and papers.
Specialty polymers improve the holding power in hair sprays and
gels and the manageability and softness of mousses, conditioners,
shampoos and other styling aids. They are also used to thicken and
emulsify cosmetic and beauty products and increase the functionality
of sunscreens, hand and body creams and lotions.
The Alco business’s products include dispersants, anti-scalants and
detergent builders, as well as rheology modifiers (thickeners) for the
carpet, adhesive and detergent industries. Dithiocarbamate chemistry
is used in microbiocides and metal precipitants for process water
treatment.
‘Elotex’ redispersible powder polymers improve the adhesion, flexural
strength, insulation properties and shrink-resistance of cements,
grouts, adhesives and other construction products.
New products introduced in 2002 included: ‘Structure-XL’ a naturally
derived polymer for skin care emulsions; ‘DynamX’ technology, for
hair care formulators; and ‘Alcosperse’ 747, a polymer that improves
performance of detergents used for laundering, automatic
dishwashing and hard surface cleaners.
Electronic and Engineering Materials (EEM)
The EEM division manufactures, markets and sells adhesives,
encapsulants, specialty coatings and process lubricants used in the
manufacture of electronic, automotive, medical, aerospace and other
equipment and components. The division serves customers worldwide
with formulations and application assistance to meet demanding
performance and processing requirements.
The EEM division is comprised of five business units, each focused on
specific product lines and end-use markets.
• Ablestik supplies adhesives and encapsulants used for semiconductor
packaging and microelectronic assembly. Products include adhesive
pastes, films, tape adhesives, and underfill encapsulants.
• Acheson supplies thick film materials and specialty coatings used
in cathode ray tubes, keyboards and switches, printed circuits, and
other electronic components. Specialty coatings are also used for
noise reduction and wear resistance in automotive components.
Acheson also supplies process lubricants and application systems
used in metalworking and casting.
• Emerson & Cuming supplies adhesives, encapsulants, and coatings
used in circuit assembly and in fabrication of electronic, electrical,
and electromechanical components.
• Permabond supplies adhesives used in product assembly, structural
bonding, and repair applications, including disposable medical
devices, electric motors, automotive components, and motor vehicle
assembly.
• Tra-Con provides adhesives and coatings in single-use and other
specialty packages serving a broad range of industrial customers
through telemarketing programmes.
Quest
Quest, which accounted for 12% of the Group’s sales in 2002, is a
leader in the development, application and production of fragrances,
flavours and food ingredients for a wide variety of consumer brands.
Quest operates in fast moving markets that the Group believes
present attractive growth opportunities and comprises two major
strategic businesses:
• Food (60% of Quest sales in 2002), and 
• Fragrance (40% of Quest sales in 2002).
ICI believes that Quest’s competitive position is based on four
distinctive strengths. These are:
• the quality of its customer relationships, 
• the sensory design skills of its perfumers and flavourists, 
• the technological advances resulting from its research and
development, and
• the customer service and support provided by the marketing and
application groups as well as its global network of servicing units.
These strengths enable Quest to assist its customers in making their
products and brands successful. Within the overall Group strategy,
Quest’s strategy is to continue to build on these strengths, while:
• focusing on growth with key customers, in fine fragrances and in
Asia,
• investing in consumer understanding,
• creating and making best use of an effective and efficient innovation
process,
• working to ensure operational excellence in both service levels
and costs by focusing on appropriate parts of the value chain (for
example, expanding its position in novel fragrance ingredients while
outsourcing non-core activities) and continuous process
improvement.
Quest’s innovative flavours and fragrance products consist of
compounds of blended ingredients under formulae created by expert
flavourists, perfumers and scientists. Certain of these compounds
contain molecules which have been created by Quest’s chemists and
which add distinctive characteristics to its products. Quest also has a
strong presence in nature-identical flavours for sweet and culinary
applications. description of business
14
ICI ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS AND FORM 20-F 2002
Food ingredients include emulsifiers, hydrocolloids, proteins and bio
ingredients (enzymes, cultures and yeast), developed to meet the
changing commercial requirements in taste and texture of its
customers’ brands.
Fragrance ingredients are the scented building blocks of the fragrance
formulae. They also contribute additional technical characteristics,
such as deodourisation or insect repellence, to the finished
compound.
In the food market, growth has been driven by the desire of consumers
for new and more sophisticated flavours as well as for foods that are
compatible with a healthy lifestyle. These factors have stimulated the
demand for products such as convenience foods, ethnic foods, low-
cholesterol and low-fat food products, as well as soft drinks that must
also meet expectations in taste, texture and appearance.
During 2002, ‘Quest HIT flavours’, a state of the art topnote range
based on artisanal cooking as a benchmark, was launched in a variety
of regions. Specific successes have been achieved with the range in
Europe, North America and Asia. ‘Pure Delivery’ (an encapsulation
technology) continued to be rolled out across the globe and gained
adoption by a major key account. Progress on consumer appeal
platforms has continued with increased adoption of the ‘TrendAntenna’
process. The Hyprol protein hydrolysates for sports drinks has been
successfully launched and is supported by a dedicated web site:
www.hyprol.com.
Quest’s Fine Fragrance business has been behind a stream of new
scents. Among 2002’s perfume launches, containing Quest fine
fragrances, have been Armani’s Mania for Men, Givenchy’s Eau
Torride, Jennifer Lopez signature scent Glow and Bora Bora, a
unisex fragrance based on bio-captive ingredients.
Science, innovation and creativity are the key pillars of Quest’s
research effort. Innovation is at the heart of Quest’s business. It
designs and develops new fragrance and flavour ingredients and
compounds that create a distinctive sensory impact. This demands
a complex artistic and technical process, combining the knowledge
and skill of Quest’s perfumers and flavourists with the expertise of
its application and research chemists. Quest has research centres at
Ashford in the UK and Naarden in the Netherlands, together with
specific product process development teams at six other sites around
the world. Quest also benefits from its membership of the wider ICI
group and the science base that is available to support innovation.
The Food division’s headquarters is in Naarden, the Netherlands,
where Quest’s corporate headquarters is also located. The Fragrance
division’s headquarters is in Ashford, UK. Major manufacturing
facilities are located in the Netherlands, the UK, USA, Mexico, France,
Australia, Ireland and Indonesia with smaller manufacturing facilities in
11 other countries. Quest has its own sales distribution network in 38
countries and is represented elsewhere by sales agents.
Performance Specialties
At the beginning of 2002, Performance Specialties consisted of two
main strategic business units: Uniqema and Synetix, plus the smaller
Security Systems business. During the course of the year Security
Systems was sold to Lincolnshire Management Inc. and Synetix to
Johnson Matthey plc.
Performance Specialties accounted for 13% of the Group’s sales in
2002. As a percentage of Performance Specialties sales in 2002,
Uniqema represented 83%, Synetix 15% and other businesses 2%.
Uniqema
Uniqema was formed at the beginning of 1999. Its operating sectors
comprise lubricants, personal care, and performance technologies.
ICI believes that Uniqema’s strength is its strong positions and
applications capabilities in the personal care and synthetic lubricants
markets, and in the European and US oleochemicals sector. Within the
overall Group strategy, Uniqema’s strategy is to seek profitable growth
in personal care and lubricants, and cost leadership in base
oleochemicals.
Uniqema supplies innovative customised effect chemicals for
purposes such as dispersion, wetting, emulsification, polymer
modification, adjuvancy, lubrication, emolliency and defoaming.
These effects are supplied as ingredients for personal and healthcare
formulations, for lubricant formulations and for the production of
agrochemicals, paint dispersions, resins, polymers and oilfield
chemicals, as well as for use in textile processing. ICI believes that
Uniqema has a strong position in synthetic lubrication. It manufactures
and markets a wide range of synthetic basestocks and ingredients
which are formulated into engine, compressor, gear hydraulic and
process oils and fluids, where high performance or environmental
characteristics are required. Products are frequently tailored to
specific customer requirements. ICI believes that Uniqema is also
a leader in synthetic refrigeration lubricants, to which it provides
worldwide technical support.
As a prominent player in personal care, Uniqema provides ingredients
for skin care, hair care, oral care and toiletries. These include new
vegetable-based products for skin care formulations, mild ingredients
for cleansing formulations and functional ingredients for skin repair
products and UV protection products.
In the more regionally based Performance Technologies business, the
main product streams are based on natural oils and fats, and strong
positions in polymers are based on a range of specialty dimers, which
are used in adhesives, coatings and resins, printing inks, engineering
plastics, fibres and foams. Performance Technologies also includes
specialist sectors in textile and oil applications.
Uniqema also supplies process intermediates based on natural fats
and oils such as coconut, palm kernel and rape seed, which are split
to yield fatty acids and by-product glycerine. Further processing of
fatty acids yields a range of higher added-value products, such as
surfactants, soaps, lubricants and polymers.
The headquarters and one of the major operating centres of Uniqema
is in Gouda, in the Netherlands. The other major operating centres of
Uniqema are in Wilton in the UK, Newcastle Delaware, USA and Kuala
Lumpur in Malaysia. Uniqema has a total of 16 manufacturing sites in
Europe, North America and Asia Pacific.
In 2002 Uniqema closed its offices in Everberg, Belgium and
successfully completed the implementation of new Enterprise
Resource Planning (ERP) computer systems at all sites in Europe.
Paints
ICI Paints is a leading international paint business and accounted for
36% of the Group’s sales in 2002. It concentrates on decorative paint
(91% of ICI Paints’ sales in 2002) and coatings for food and beverage
cans (9% of ICI Paints’ sales in 2002). In 2002, 46% of ICI Paints’
sales were in North America, 34% in Europe, 12% in Asia and 8% in
Latin America and Rest of World. ICI believes that ICI Paints’ strengths
include its well-established brands and the global nature of the
business which allow ICI Paints to use its resources, expertise and
experience to offer the best solution for each local market and the
needs of the end users. 15
Within the overall Group strategy, the strategy of ICI Paints is to
maintain and develop its branded leading market positions in the
global paints and coatings industry. ICI Paints expects to further
develop its strategy by:
• building its business in high growth areas such as China, India and
elsewhere in Asia,
• capitalising on supply chain rationalisation opportunities,
• utilising best practice throughout the business to reduce costs.
The decorative paints business has well-established brands such as
‘Dulux’, ‘Glidden’, ‘Valentine’, ‘Coral’, ‘Alba’ and ‘Color Your World’.
The acquisition in 1998 of the European Home Improvement business 
of Williams Plc added further strong brand names in Europe such as
‘Hammerite’, ‘Cuprinol’, ‘Polyfilla’, ‘Polycell’, ‘Xyladecor’, ‘Molto’
and ‘Alabastine’. The acquisition broadened and strengthened the
decorative product range to include wood care, metal care, adhesives
and fillers. The decorative paint business has four regional strategic
business units as the worldwide paint market is still highly regional.
During 2002 ICI Paints has continued to focus on strengthening its
brands and developing innovative products and services which meet
and anticipate customers’ needs around the world. Achievements in
2002 included extending the ‘Hammerite’ range in Latin America, a
new ‘Cuprinol’ rollable paint in the UK, the launch, also in the UK, of
‘Polycell Basecoat’, a product similar to paint which covers hair line
cracks and serves as a base for emulsion paint finish on interior walls,
the US launch of Dulux ‘Fortis’, a premium exterior paint and Alkyd
paint using the new ICI Advanced Alkyd technology, and the
introduction of a second generation ‘Dulux 5-in-1’ paint in China.
ICI Paints is a leader in sales of internal and external coatings for
food and beverage cans. It also manufactures and distributes a broad
product offering of packaging coatings and has significant market
positions in both the mature markets of Europe and North America
and the emerging markets of Asia and Latin America.
Technology and innovation are also important factors in the growth
of ICI Paints. Success is dependent on being first to the market with
innovative, value-adding products and services which meet real
market needs. ICI Paints benefits technologically from the colloid,
polymer and particle related science base and research carried out
by other parts of the Group.
ICI Paints’ business headquarters is at Slough in the UK. Major
manufacturing facilities are located in the USA, UK, Brazil, Argentina,
Germany, Netherlands, France, China, India and Malaysia. Additional
manufacturing facilities are located in 16 other countries. ICI Paints
maintains its own sales distribution network in 32 countries, and sells
elsewhere through sales agents and distributors.
Regional and Industrial
The Regional and Industrial businesses comprise several businesses
which are essentially local in their scope. Excluding sales relating
to continuing supply contracts involving businesses that have been
divested and which are transacted at nil margin, Regional and
Industrial businesses accounted for 9% of the Group’s sales in 2002.
The most significant of these businesses are located in Pakistan, India
and Argentina. In Pakistan and India, ICI operates through non wholly-
owned subsidiary companies whose share capital is quoted on the
local stock exchanges. During 2002 the regional explosives operations
in the USA and the UK were divested.
ICI Pakistan has interests across a number of different market sectors.
The more important of these are the manufacture of polyester staple
fibre for the textile industry and soda ash for soaps, detergents, glass
and paper. Other businesses of ICI Pakistan include pharmaceuticals,
seeds and specialty products. Pakistan PTA Limited located at Port
Qasim near Karachi manufactures purified terephthalic acid (PTA) for
the fibre industry.
ICI India’s regional business comprises explosives, rubber chemicals,
and nitrocellulose. The explosives business, centred at Gomia,
manufactures a wide range of modern bulk and packaged explosives.
The rubber chemicals business has manufacturing facilities near
Kolkata, and the nitrocellulose business is based in Gujarat. ICI India’s
pharmaceuticals business was sold in early 2002.
ICI Argentina manufactures a range of products of which wine chemicals
and sulphur related products are the most important. The wine
chemicals business is located near Mendoza, whilst the sulphur
related products are manufactured at San Lorenzo, near Rosario.
Huntsman International Holdings LLC
Huntsman International Holdings LLC (“HIH”), formed in 1999, is
controlled by Huntsman Corporation and comprises ICI’s former
Polyurethanes and Tioxide businesses and the majority of ICI’s former
UK based Petrochemicals businesses, together with the propylene
oxide assets of Huntsman Corporation.
ICI’s interests in HIH comprise a holding of subordinated loan
notes in HIH and an equity interest in ICI Alta Inc., a wholly owned
subsidiary. ICI Alta Inc. holds ICI’s 30% equity interest in HIH and
a contract for the sale of this equity interest in HIH to Huntsman
Specialty Chemicals Corporation (“HSCC”), as announced on 21
December 2001 (see “material contracts” on page 122). On 17 June
2002, ICI announced it had reached an agreement with CSFB Global
Opportunities Partners L.P. (now Matlin Patterson Global Opportunities
Partners L.P.) for the sale of ICI’s interests in HIH. The aggregate
purchase price payable under this new agreement is $440m (£283m).
Of this amount, $160m (£109m) has been received. The remaining
$280m (£174m) (with an amount equivalent to interest from 15 May
2002 to the date of payment) will be payable on 15 May 2003, with
Matlin Patterson Global Opportunities Partners L.P. having the option
to pay all or part of the amount due prior to 15 May 2003 by means of
installment payments.
Ownership of the HIH Notes, subject to a pledge arrangement, has
been transferred and ownership of ICI Alta Inc. will be transferred
when the full purchase price has been received. As a result of this
transaction, HIH has ceased to be treated as an associate from
17 June 2002.
Discontinued Operations
For UK GAAP purposes, the Group classifies discontinued operations
as material operations which it has sold or permanently terminated
either during a particular financial year or during the subsequent
period to the date of signature of the annual accounts for such
financial year. There were no operations reported as discontinued
during 2002 or 2001 and the last businesses to be so classified,
in 2000, were the: Chlor-Chemicals, Klea and Crosfield businesses,
Methanol business, and the Group’s 50% equity holding in Philips-
Imperial Petroleum Ltd.
Markets and distribution
ICI sells its products through an extensive network of subsidiaries,
associates and distributors.
Specialty products manufactured by National Starch, Quest and
Uniqema are sold mainly by direct sales forces, alliances and
distributors. Customers are primarily other manufacturers, in a range
of markets from consumer oriented manufacturers of branded goods
in the food, perfume and personal care sectors to those involved in
surfactants, lubricants, papermaking and chemicals. description of business
16
ICI ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS AND FORM 20-F 2002
Paints are sold through a range of distribution channels. Branded
architectural paints are sold through a combination of both independent
retailers and stores and the Group’s own retail concerns, particularly
in North America. Can coatings are supplied directly to beverage and
food manufacturers in Europe, the Americas and Asia.
The Group’s Regional and Industrial businesses sell into a wide range
of industries including engineering, textiles, pharmaceuticals and the
extractive industries. These products are either marketed directly or
through independent merchants, wholesalers and distributors who
resell to small users. Commodity products are sold through a direct
sales force or through distributors primarily to other operators in the
chemical industry.
Seasonality
Due to the diversity of their product portfolios and broad international
coverage, seasonality in the National Starch, Quest and Uniqema
businesses is not significant. ICI Paints, however, is affected, with
higher sales of products used on the exterior of buildings normally
during better weather conditions. With the geographic profile of
ICI Paints, this results in higher activity levels in the second and third
quarters of the year.
Sources and availability of raw materials
Raw materials and supplies are purchased from a variety of industry
sources, principally the agricultural and chemical sectors and to a
lesser extent from the mining sector. They are generally available
from multiple suppliers and alternative sources are generally available
to enable business to continue in the event of any interruption from
present sources. Prices are subject to normal conditions of supply
and demand.
The primary raw materials used by National Starch are corn, tapioca
and chemicals. Specialty hybrid corn (high amylose and waxy seeds)
is planted under contract for National Starch to guarantee supply of
these special strains. Starch manufacturing facilities in Thailand are
located close to the sources of production of tapioca root to ensure
reliability of supply. National Starch’s main chemical raw material is
vinyl acetate monomer, the cost and supply of which is dependent
on the price of natural gas and manufacturing capacity of suppliers.
Quest purchases thousands of different raw materials from sources
across the world. The main natural raw materials are extracts and
concentrates from fruits, vegetables and other flora as well as animal
products and essential oils. Synthetic raw material purchases are
mostly organic chemicals.
The raw materials for Uniqema include a wide range of both renewable
(palm oil, rape-seed oil, tallows) and petrochemical based (ethylene
oxide, propylene oxide) raw materials.
The raw materials for ICI Paints include resins, solvents and pigments
from major chemical suppliers.
Intellectual property
ICI has thousands of patents and applications which help to protect
its technology and numerous trademark registrations which help to
protect ICI’s brands. In addition, it derives substantial competitive
advantage from trade secrets and proprietary business knowledge
relating to formulae, products, processes and technical know-how.
ICI uses appropriate terms of employment and management processes
to identify and protect its intellectual property. As necessary, it enters
into confidentiality agreements with customers, suppliers and other
third parties to protect the confidentiality of its proprietary, technical
and business information.
Competition
Due to the breadth and variety of the products and end markets
served, the Group encounters a wide range of competitors, from
multinational companies to many small local and independent firms.
National Starch does not compete with any one competitor in all of
its markets. However, multinational competitors in specific markets
include HB Fuller, Rohm & Haas and Air Products. Similarly, Uniqema
does not compete with any one competitor in all of its markets, but in
particular markets competitors include Cognis, Fina, Akzo Nobel and
Twin Rivers.
Quest is one of the top five flavour and fragrance manufacturers which
together account for approximately half of the total market. Quest’s
main competitors are multinational flavour and fragrance houses,
including International Flavors & Fragrances and Givaudan.
ICI Paints’ competition is mainly national in character. However,
international competitors include Sherwin Williams and Akzo Nobel.
Capital expenditure 
The analyses in the tables above summarise the Group’s capital
expenditure on tangible fixed assets over the three year period
ended 31 December 2002.
In 2002, over 90% of capital expenditure was incurred by the
International Businesses. One significant project has been the
implementation of new enterprise resource planning systems in Quest.

The remainder of the expenditure has been incurred on a large number
of relatively minor projects aimed at achieving additional capacity for
specialty products, as well as for productivity improvements through
increased automation of manufacturing processes and the relocation
and consolidation of facilities. A significant portion of the expenditure
relates to information technology and to the support of customers
including tinting machines (Paints) and creative systems (Quest).
Commitments for capital expenditure not provided in the Group’s
consolidated financial statements totalled £163m at 31 December
2002, compared with £146m at the end of the previous year. These
are analysed further in note 40 to the consolidated financial statements
between those for which contracts have been placed and those
authorised but not yet contracted.
Research and development (R&D)
A Technology Board, comprising the senior business R&D managers
and led by the Group Vice President for R&D, is responsible for the
development of the Group’s Technology Strategy and its implementation
by the R&D staff employed by the Group’s businesses. In 2002,
expenditure on R&D by continuing operations excluding Technical
Service, amounted to £148m (2001 £151m; 2000 £157m – both as
restated). This expenditure represented 2.4% of sales in 2002, up
from 2.3% in 2001 and the same as in 2000.
Each of the Group’s businesses is responsible for its own R&D
resources and for driving innovation to meet the needs of its customers
and markets. The business R&D teams are complemented by a central
R&D resource that aims to provide world class capabilities that are
common to all the businesses. Its capabilities are in colloid interface
science; high throughput experimentation (HTE); modelling; particle
engineering and polymer science. It also provides measurement
science services to the ICI businesses as well as undertaking a
small measurement science development programme. The Group’s
distributed technology network draws on the expertise across ICI thus
allowing new products and processes to be developed and exploited
by individual businesses more rapidly, and stimulating new options
from the combination of the technical capabilities of the Group’s
different businesses.
In 2002, a Business Development Board was established, comprising
senior managers from the individual Businesses, the Group Vice
President of R&D, planning support from the Corporate Centre, and
chaired by the Executive Vice President Performance Specialties.
The purpose of the Board is to accelerate the commercial exploitation
of technology opportunities within ICI, and reflects the desire to
continuously develop and strengthen the links between market needs
and technology capability.
The Group’s prime technology areas, namely biosciences, chemistry
and materials, have been established to support its goals in selected
growth markets. These areas (or megathemes) constitute a portfolio
of projects, which are intended to accelerate the Group’s long-term
technology development, and avoid business duplication while
reducing individual business risk.
Bioscience has key areas of knowledge and expertise which the Group
applies to the development of personal care, food and beverage
products. Projects under way focus on the use of natural materials,
linking consumer response to the molecular constituents of the
Group’s products, and the development of superior product effects
through improved understanding of skin science. An example is the
collaboration with Arena Pharmaceuticals Inc to apply Arena’s 
proprietary CART technology to olfactory and gustatory G protein-
coupled receptors (GPCRs) to develop assays and then screen
compounds supplied by ICI businesses.
Chemistry underpins much of the Group’s product development and
here its focus is on high throughput R&D to explore novel molecules,
formulations and processes. A successful collaboration with Symyx
Inc has made it possible to rapidly build an ICI Centre of Expertise in
High Throughput Screening and Formulation which is now advancing
a portfolio of projects for the ICI Businesses. Investments in HTE
capability continue at Quest, and are beginning in Paints.
Current projects in the materials area are directed towards bio-
materials and renewable resources, exploiting effects shown by
bio-polymers and bio-molecules, and increasing the Group’s ability to
fabricate at the nano-scale for macro-scale effects. The combination
of these capabilities is particularly focused on controlled and targeted
delivery of effect products e.g. the collaboration between National
Starch and Uniqema has already led to the launch of two new crop
protection products; Metasperse dispersants, and Semkote seed
coatings.
The competitive edge of the Group comes from the combination of
these capabilities, not merely the demonstration of excellence in any
one megatheme area. Nowhere is this more evident than in ICI’s ability
to offer products with a multisensory (touch, taste, fragrance and
colour) dimension. The power and opportunity that this approach
offers is displayed in the ICI report on “The Secrets of the Senses”
commissioned from Dr Charles Spence from the Department of
Experimental Psychology at the University of Oxford.
Regulation, safety, health and the environment
ICI’s businesses are subject to the normal regulatory framework
applicable to a specialty products and paints company, notably
various health, safety and environmental rules both at national
and local levels in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates.
Its businesses also voluntarily conform to international and national
codes of best practice appropriate to their business.
ICI attaches great importance to the safety and health of its
employees, to reducing any adverse environmental impact of its
activities year-on-year and to developing products and services
with improved environmental features.
Most aspects of the Group’s business are subject to laws relating
to safety, health and environment (SHE). The scope and severity of
such laws vary across the different businesses and according to the
jurisdiction concerned. The various manufacturing processes which
are operated require consents and licences including relevant
emission permits. The Group requires full compliance by its
businesses with all relevant SHE laws and regulations in each
jurisdiction in which it operates.
ICI’s policy is to improve its SHE performance continuously and to
have in place quantitative measures to monitor progress. For these
reasons, ICI published a set of targets in 2001 to be achieved by
the end of the year 2005 for improvements in Safety, Health and the
Environment (“Challenge 2005”). Targets for the last of these included
reducing its environmental burden in specific categories and a
commitment to improve energy efficiency per tonne of production by a
further 5% of the 2000 base level. ICI developed the measurement of
environmental burden in order to take account not just of the quantity
of an emission but its potential impact on the environment. It uses the
environmental burden methodology to help prioritise actions for further
performance improvement. description of business
18
ICI ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS AND FORM 20-F 2002
Challenge 2005 focuses on the effects of the Group’s activities on
climate change, land, water, and other potential impacts using the
environmental burden concept introduced in 1995, and to achieve
a further 50% reduction in employee injuries and illnesses from the
2000 outurn.
We maintain our focus on SHE and, in the second year of our current
five-year programme, are on plan to meet the majority of our
Challenge 2005 objectives and have actions in place to address 
those areas where we are behind. Full details are published in our
Sustainability Report and on our website, www.ici.com. ICI’s
performance in 2002 is currently being verified by Enviros Consulting
Ltd, and the detailed performance results and verification statement
will be published on its website. During 2002, there were eleven
instances of breaches of safety, health or environmental regulations
which resulted in prosecutions or fines totalling £95,000. Each was
investigated and appropriate action taken.
The main process by which the Group manages SHE issues and seeks 
to meet its objectives is the Responsible Care Management System
(RCMS). This sets out standards along with guidelines, training,
auditing and procedures for reviewing and reporting performance,
all of which are essential to continuous improvement. The system
covers operations on site as well as product stewardship and
community relations. RCMS has been independently verified by
Lloyd’s Register Quality Assurance Limited as complying with the
US and UK Responsible Care Codes, the certifiable international
standard for environmental management systems, ISO 14001 and
the ICC (International Chamber of Commerce) Business Charter for
Sustainable Development.
ICI works to manage and minimise the risks associated with the
condition of its sites and has developed further procedures to enable
the ranking of priorities for management attention. ICI is actively
engaged in research aimed at developing and implementing more cost
effective environmental remediation technologies, some of which 
is being done in collaboration with other companies and academic
institutes.
The raw materials which the Group’s businesses use and the products
which they produce are subject to demanding regulations concerning
product safety in all parts of the world. These regulations, which also
cover product testing and risk assessment requirements, are subject
to review and revision, as is currently happening in Europe with the
European Union Chemicals Policy White Paper. The Group is
assessing the potential impact of these proposals on its businesses
and will ensure compliance when the new European Union regulations
come into force.
There is a growing pressure from legislators, customers and the
general public to reduce the environmental and health impacts of
products throughout their life cycle. ICI is responding to this by
ensuring that each business has a “Product Stewardship” programme
in place. This voluntary programme embraces, through best business
practices, product regulatory requirements, societal pressures,
reducing the risk of harm to people and the environment, and ICI aims
to provide the relevant information to enable correct use and disposal
of products.
Anticipating external pressures and concerns and providing speedy,
innovative solutions with lower environmental impact is becoming a
key aspect of sustaining competitive advantage. ICI recognises these
pressures and is responding with the introduction of new processes,
products and services which improve the efficiency of use of raw
materials and utilities and reduce adverse environmental effects.
Processes are in place for regular reviews of environmental liabilities,
and provisions were established by 31 December 2002 in accordance
with the accounting policy described in the Group financial statements 
on page 51. Although there can be no guarantees, management
believes that, within the existing legislative framework and taking
account of the provisions already established, the cost of addressing
currently identified environmental obligations (as ICI currently views
these obligations) is unlikely to have a material adverse effect on its
financial position or results of operations.
Litigation
Save as disclosed below, neither ICI nor any of its subsidiaries is
involved in any legal or arbitration proceedings which may have, or
have had, during the 12 months preceding the date of this document,
a material effect on the financial position of the Group, nor are any
such proceedings pending or threatened involving ICI or any of its
subsidiaries.
The Glidden Company (“Glidden”), a wholly owned subsidiary of ICI,
is a defendant, along with former lead paint and pigment producers as
well as other lead product manufacturers and their trade associations,
in a number of suits in the United States. These suits seek damages
for alleged personal injury caused by lead-based paint or the costs
of removing lead-based paint. An alleged predecessor of Glidden
manufactured lead pigments until the 1950s and lead-based
consumer paint until the 1960s. Due to the nature of the suits, Glidden
is unable to quantify the amount being claimed although the suits are
likely to involve substantial claims for damages.
The cases presently pending against Glidden include: a suit filed in
1989 by the New York City Housing Authority in New York state court
seeking the removal of all lead-based paint from two housing projects;
a purported statewide personal injury class action filed in 1998 on
behalf of all lead poisoned children in New York state court; a personal
injury suit filed in 1999 on behalf of six lead poisoned minors in state
court in Maryland, and a personal injury action filed in 2002 on behalf
of a lead poisoned adult in state court in Mississippi. Five other
individual personal injury actions were filed in 2000 and 2001 against
Glidden and other members of the lead industry in Maryland state
court, however, these actions have not been served on any of the
defendants and no activity is expected for the foreseeable future.
One additional personal injury action was filed in late 2002 in New
York state court but Glidden has not been served in that case.
Glidden has been dismissed from seventeen cases in 2002 and was
not named as a defendant in more than two dozen lead paint lawsuits
filed this year. Glidden continues to believe that it has strong defences
to all of the pending cases and has denied all liability and will continue
to vigorously defend all actions.
ICI Chemicals & Polymers Limited (C&P), a subsidiary, is involved in
arbitration proceedings in Singapore regarding PTA technology
exchange and licence arrangements with PT Polyprima Karyareksa
(Polyprima). Fees due under these arrangements are being claimed
against Polyprima who, in response, has claimed damages totalling
up to $130m for alleged breach of contract, alleged fraud, deceit,
misrepresentation and concealment, allegations which C&P rejects
and intends to resist vigorously. C&P’s claim against Polyprima was
heard before an arbitration tribunal in Singapore in May 2002 and the
decision of the tribunal is awaited.
In connection with the disposal of the Group’s Chlor-Chemicals
business to Ineos Chlor, Ineos Chlor has made a £65m claim against
the Group relating to expenditure allegedly required in relation to the
Runcorn site, which the Group is disputing. As yet, legal proceedings 19
have not been commenced by Ineos Chlor but it is possible that they
will be in the near future.
Ineos Chlor has also approached the UK Department of Trade and
Industry to seek Regional Selective Assistance for certain capital
projects and is also seeking financial support from its parent company
and the Group. ICI has received reports that Ineos Chlor may seek to
close part or all of its business if this financial support is not
forthcoming. If such a closure was to occur, a number of Chlor-
Chemicals contracts in the Group’s name which have not yet been
novated to Ineos Chlor and certain environmental liabilities could
revert to the Group or be accelerated.
Employees
As of 31 December 2002, ICI employed 36,660 employees. An
analysis of employee numbers by business and geographical area
may be found in note 36 to the consolidated financial statements.
ICI has a mixture of unionised and non-unionised operations across
the world. ICI considers its relations with its employees to be good.
Property
ICI operates production, marketing and research and development
facilities worldwide. The individual business descriptions on the
preceding pages provide details of these facilities. ICI owns
substantially all of its properties, free of material encumbrances,
and it believes such properties are adequate for their purposes and
suitably utilised according to the individual nature and requirements
of the relevant properties.
Insurance
ICI maintains the types and amounts of insurance customary in the
industries and countries in which it operates. This includes but is not
limited to Employee Related Accidents and Injury policies, Property
Damage policies and Directors and Officers liability coverage. ICI
considers its insurance coverage to be adequate both as to the nature
of the risks covered and the amounts insured for the businesses
conducted by the Group. The insurance market, since the terrorist
attacks on the United States on 11 September 2001, has become
far more expensive and limited in coverage availability. There are
indications that insurance costs will continue to increase and that the
scope of coverage available in the market will become more limited. As reported International Business trading profit was 5% lower than
last year, with the difference from the comparable performance due to
the effects of foreign exchange translation (–2%) and divestments (–2%).
Regional and Industrial businesses reported a £10m trading loss for
the year, £14m lower than in 2001 (2000 £17m profit) due to the loss
of profits from divested businesses and a legal provision in relation to
one of ICI’s former businesses.
Associates
The Group’s share of losses of associates before exceptional items
for the year was of £10m, in line with last year (2001 £10m loss; 2000
£40m profit). Reduced losses from Huntsman International Holdings
LLC (which ceased to be accounted for as an associate from 17 June
2002) were offset by losses in Irish Fertilizer Industries (which went
into liquidation in November 2002). The Group result included the
Group’s share of operating profit before exceptional items from
associates of £18m (2001 £57m; 2000 £100m) less net interest
payable by associates of £28m (2001 £67m; 2000 £60m).
Interest
The Group net interest charge for the year was £123m compared to
£162m in 2001 (2000 £202m excluding exceptional interest income),
primarily as a result of lower average net debt following the successful
completion of the Rights Issue, and lower interest rates during the
year.
Profit before tax
Profit before tax, goodwill amortisation and exceptional items for
the year was £400m, £1m lower than last year (2000 £450m). Lower
trading profits for the International Businesses, by £26m, and a loss
for Regional and Industrial businesses were almost entirely offset by
the lower interest costs. Profit before tax, but after goodwill
amortisation and exceptional items was £317m compared to £205m in
2001 (2000 £87m loss, including the provision for loss on the sale of
the Chlor-Chemicals, Klea and Crosfield operations of £503m).
During 2002 the adverse currency translation effect compared to last
year on the Group’s reported profit before tax, goodwill amortisation
and exceptional items was £11m.
Exceptional items
There was no net exceptional charge to trading profit in 2002 (2001
£143m loss relating to the restructuring programme to improve cost
effectiveness and supply chain efficiencies across the International
Businesses; 2000 nil).

Turnover
Group sales, as reported for the year, were £6,125m, 5% lower than
2001 (£6,425m in 2001 and £6,415m in 2000 or £7,748m including
discontinued operations). The lower sales in 2002 were largely the
consequence of divestments, principally in the Regional and Industrial
businesses, and adverse foreign exchange translation effects.
International Business sales, at £5,543m, were 1% ahead of 2001
on a comparable basis. Growth resumed in North America and
remained strong in Asia, more than offsetting lower sales in Latin
America, where economic conditions remained challenging. Sales in
Europe were slightly ahead of the prior year. Each of the International
Businesses delivered comparable sales growth, with National Starch
and Performance Specialties both 2% ahead, and Paints and Quest
both 1% ahead of last year.
As reported sales for the International Businesses were 2% below
2001 (2001 £5,645m; 2000 £5,570m), with the effects of foreign
exchange translation (–2%), and divestments in Performance
Specialties (–1%) accounting for the difference from the comparable
performance.
Trading profit*
Group trading profit for the year was £533m, 7% lower than 2001
(2001 £573m; 2000 £617m or £612m including discontinued
operations).
Trading profit for the International Businesses for the year, at £543m,
(2001 £569m; 2000 £600m) was only 1% lower than 2001 on a
comparable basis. Paints and National Starch both made good
progress in difficult conditions, and were up 9% and 5% respectively
on a comparable basis. However, comparable trading profit was 23%
lower for Quest, which was impacted by supply chain problems, and
24% lower for Performance Specialties, with Uniqema being particularly
affected by rising raw material prices in the second half of the year.

References to “comparable” performance exclude the effect of
currency translation differences and the impact of acquisitions
and divestments on the results reported by the International
Businesses. A reconciliation between “comparable” and “as
reported” performance measures can be found on pages 28
and 31. A more detailed explanation of “comparable” performance
appears on page 124. There were also no exceptional losses from associates (2001 £9m loss
relating to a restructuring programme in Huntsman International
Holdings LLC; 2000 nil).
Exceptional items charged after trading profit for the year comprised 
a £50m profit from the sale or closure of operations (2001 £7m profit;
2000 £515m loss), and a £3m profit on the disposal of fixed assets
(2001 £8m profit; 2000 £11m profit) and £99m written off investments
(2001 £22m; 2000 nil).
In 2002, the pre-tax profit from the sale or closure of operations
included a £90m profit on the sale of the Group’s catalyst business,
Synetix, and a £17m profit on the sale of the Security Systems
business. These were partially offset by a £32m loss on the
divestment of the UK Nitrocellulose and Energetic Technologies
businesses and a £27m loss due to the liquidation of Irish Fertilizer
Industries, in which the Group has a 49% interest.
Amounts written off investments in 2002 of £99m related to a
provision against ICI’s existing investments in Ineos Chlor, where
uncertainty exists as to the extent to which, and period over which,
these amounts will be recovered.
In total, exceptional items before tax and minority interests for 2002
amounted to a loss of £46m (2001 £159m loss; 2000 £502m loss).
Exceptional items after tax and minorities were a loss of £48m (2001
£142m loss; 2000 £456m loss).
Taxation
Taxation on profit before goodwill amortisation and exceptional items
was £115m, £1m lower than 2001 (2000 £142m), with the Group
effective rate being maintained at 29% (2000 32%). Prior years have
been restated for the effect of FRS No.19.
Net profit
Net profit before goodwill amortisation and exceptional items was
£264m, compared to £259m in 2001 and £284m in 2000.
Net profit after goodwill amortisation and exceptional items was
£179m, compared to £80m in 2001 and a loss of £207m in 2000.
The results for 2001 and 2000 have been restated for the effect of
FRS No. 19.
Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share before goodwill amortisation and exceptional
items for the year were 23.7p compared to 29.8p in 2001 (2000 32.7p).
Basic earnings per share after goodwill amortisation and exceptional
items were 16.1p compared to 9.2p in 2001 (2000 loss per share
23.8p).
Prior year’s profit and earnings per share figures have been restated
for the effects of the bonus element of the Rights Issue, and for
FRS 19. The weighted average number of shares in issue in 2002
was 1,114m compared to 869m in 2001 (2000 869m).
Dividend and dividend policy
As previously stated, the Group’s dividend policy is that dividends
should represent about one third of net profit before goodwill
amortisation and exceptional items. In line with this policy, the Board
has recommended a second interim dividend of 4.5p, to bring the total
dividend for 2002 to 7.5p.
Shareholders’ funds
The net profit for the year of £179m was reduced by dividends of
£(88)m and an adverse movement through reserves due to foreign
exchange of £(57)m, but increased by the issue of new shares for the
Rights Issue £807m and other goodwill items of £22m to give an
overall net increase in shareholders’ funds in 2002 of £863m. At the
end of 2002, shareholders’ funds were in surplus of £499m (2001
deficit £(364)m; 2000 deficit £(249)m). The prior year figures have
been restated for the effect of FRS No. 19.
Performance and value based management
The Group remains committed to value based management and
further progress was made during the year. The Group continued to
focus on better utilisation of both fixed and working capital, and
average working capital as a percentage of sales in the International
Businesses was reduced by over 1% on a comparable basis. Despite
lower trading profits for the International Businesses, the return on
average net assets in the International Businesses of 20% remained
unchanged from 2001.
Cash flow
The following analysis of Group cash flow, which relates to the table
on page 22, distinguishes between cash flows relating to operating
activities and those related to portfolio reshaping and legacy issues.
Included within “reshaping and legacy” are gross proceeds from
divestments, cash expenditures following divestments (including tax
paid and payments against divestment provisions, which, in some
cases, will continue for a number of years), the ICI UK Pension Fund
top-up payments, and loans to associates and other investments.
Management believes this presentation provides important financial
information relating to the continuing operating activities of the Group
separate from cash flows relating to the divestment programme and
the transformation of the Group. This should not be considered as an
alternative but as supplementary to the presentation of cash flows in
accordance with UK GAAP included within the financial statements
and related notes.

Operating cash flow
The Group’s net operating cash flow improved significantly in 2002.
Group earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and goodwill
amortisation for the year, at £729m, were 7% below 2001, mainly
as a result of the lower trading profit for the International Businesses.
However, the benefits of working capital efficiency improvements
resulted in a small cash inflow from working capital of £13m for the
year, some £43m better than 2001. Capital expenditure, of £219m,
was also £16m lower, while other cash items, including exceptional
outflows against restructuring provisions, were at a similar level
to 2001. Consequently, the Group delivered an operating cash inflow
after capital expenditure of £434m, £2m better than for 2001.
Net interest and tax payments (excluding tax on divestments) during
2002 amounted to £191m, some £33m lower than 2001, primarily as
a result of the cash interest benefits of the Rights Issue. Dividend
payments, at £127m, were £78m lower than last year, following
implementation of the revised dividend policy.
Acquisition expenditure was £17m, £51m below 2001.
Overall, for 2002, the Group generated a much improved net
operating cash flow which, at £99m, was £164m better than for 2001.
Reshaping and legacy cash flows
Reshaping and legacy cash flows benefited from the successful
completion of the divestment of Synetix (delivering gross proceeds of
£260m) and the proceeds (£109m) from the first installment in relation
to the sale of ICI’s interests in Huntsman International Holdings LLC.
Overall, 2002 divestment proceeds of £458m were £114m more than
for 2001. Tax payments resulting from divestments were £8m, down
from £21m in the prior year.
Payments against divestment provisions were also significantly lower
than last year, down £165m to £133m. 
The top-up payment to the ICI UK Pension Fund for the year was
maintained at £30m. The next triennial actuarial review of the fund will
take place at 31 March 2003.
Overall, the 2002 cash flow due to reshaping and legacy items was an
inflow of £250m, £296m higher than 2001.
Movement in net debt 
Cash flow before financing for the year, at £349m, was £460m better
than in 2001. This, together with the net Rights Issue proceeds of
£807m and a favourable non-cash exchange rate translation impact
of £94m, led to a £1,250m reduction in net debt at the end of the year
to £1,667m.
Cash flow – UK GAAP
This commentary relates to the Statement of Group cash flow on
page 55, which is prepared in accordance with FRS No.1 (revised).
The Group net cash inflow from operating activities for 2002 was
£623m, £14m lower than last year due mainly to lower trading profits.
Capital expenditure and financial investment for the year, at £184m,
was £22m lower than 2001, with lower spend on tangible fixed
assets and higher proceeds from the sale of fixed assets. Returns
from investments and servicing of finance and cash tax spend were
also reduced. ICI share price and FTSE 100 share price index

Net proceeds from disposals were £290m against £17m last year,
and comprised £423m gross disposal proceeds (2001 £315m) less
expenditure against divestment provisions of £133m (2001 £298m).
Disposal proceeds in 2002 mainly related to the divestment of Synetix
(gross proceeds of £260m), the first instalment in relation to the sale
of ICI’s interests in Huntsman International Holdings LLC (£109m) and
the divestment of Security Systems. Acquisition expenditure, including
investments in participating interests, at £54m, was also £55m lower
than 2001.
The Group generated a cash inflow before the use of liquid resources
of £349m in 2002, compared to a cash outflow of £111m in 2001. The
much improved cash flow was primarily due to the higher net disposal
proceeds, combined with lower equity dividends, acquisition costs,
interest and tax payments.
Treasury policies
The Group’s Treasury seeks to reduce financial risk, to ensure
sufficient liquidity is available to meet foreseeable needs and to invest
cash assets safely and profitably. It operates within policies and
procedures approved by the Board, which include strict controls on
the use of financial instruments in managing the Group’s risk. The
Group does not undertake any trading activity in financial instruments.
The Group reviews the credit quality of counterparties and limits
individual and aggregate credit exposures accordingly.
Financing and interest rate risk
At 31 December 2002, the Group’s net debt was £1,667m (2001
£2,917m; 2000 £2,799m).
The Group’s policy is to finance the Group mainly through a mixture
of retained earnings and debt. Debt is principally sourced from long-
term loans, medium-term notes, commercial paper, securitised
receivables and bank debt. The Group’s borrowings are primarily
raised centrally by Group finance companies and on-lent to operating
subsidiaries on commercial terms. The Group borrows in the major
global debt markets in a range of currencies at both fixed and floating
rates of interest, and uses derivatives to generate the desired currency
and interest rate profile of borrowings.
The Group’s exposure to interest rate fluctuations on its borrowings
is managed through the use of interest rate swaps and forward rate
agreements. The Group’s policy is to maintain between 40% and 60%
of its long-term borrowings at fixed rates for periods of up to 5 years.
Notes 20 and 38 to the consolidated financial statements show the
overall interest rate structure of the Group’s borrowings at the end of
2002.
The Group’s borrowings (after taking account of swaps and forward
contracts) are denominated mainly in US Dollars. Details of the
currency mix of borrowings are shown in note 38 to the consolidated
financial statements. The currency disposition of the borrowings is
used as a partial, long-term hedge of the cash flows arising from
investments overseas and as a hedge against any future business
disposal proceeds. In addition, it takes into account the availability
and costs of funds, and the sensitivity of Group gearing and earnings
ratios to exchange rate movements.
The maturity of loans is shown in note 20 to the consolidated financial
statements. The Group’s objective in determining borrowing maturity
is to ensure a balance between flexibility, cost and the continuing
availability of funds. As such, it funds in a mix of long-term and short-
term maturity debt.
Funding policy aims to produce a reasonably even maturity profile
for long-term debt up to around 5 years. The average maturity for
long-term debt was 2.5 years at 31 December 2002.
Liquidity and investments
At 31 December 2002 the Group had at its disposal £1.509bn
equivalent of committed borrowing facilities with varying maturities up
to the year 2006. Of this, a $1,100m committed borrowing facility is
maturing in January 2004 and some £201m of short-term committed
borrowing facilities have varying maturities of less than one year.
These facilities provide back-stopping for short-term funding as well
as flexibility to supplement future cash flows.
The Group’s net debt position has historically changed over the course
of a year, and in particular, short-term debt has generally increased in
the early part of the year to fund working capital requirements. These
working capital needs arise principally from the seasonality of the
Paints business, which experiences higher sales of products used on
the exterior of buildings, and thus working capital, during the North
American and European summer (the second and third quarters of the
year). The Group’s commercial paper programmes and other short-
term borrowings are used to fund these working capital fluctuations.
At 31 December 2002, the Group had £226m of short-term
borrowings outstanding.
During 2002, the principal movements in long-term debt were a
$200m (£129m) 10 year note maturity, and $500m and $250m
(£484m) 5 year note maturities. Also in 2002, the Group redeemed
£300m in FRPS (fixed rate redeemable preference shares) reducing
the amount outstanding at 31 December 2002 to £100m compared
to £400m at 31 December 2001. The Group runs a receivables
securitisation programme in the US, with £95m outstanding, out
of a total available facility of £111m, at 31 December 2002. This
outstanding amount has been reported in the Group’s financial
statements under current instalment of loans (note 20 to the
consolidated financial statements) and the available facility is included
in its total committed borrowing facilities. Off balance sheet financing
mainly comprises the leases described in note 35 to the consolidated
financial statements and a series of forward contracts (total nominal
amount of £122m as of 31 December 2002) used to hedge some of
the obligations of the employee share ownership plans.
During 2003, £500m of loans will be maturing, which, in addition to
various bonds and notes, includes the £100m of FRPS and £95m from
the receivables securitisation programme. These are expected to  be refinanced through new debt issues. Access to the full range of
the debt markets which we currently enjoy requires us to maintain our
investment grade credit rating. Any downgrade of ICI’s credit rating
would reduce its funding options, including a loss of access to the
major commercial paper and money markets, significantly increase
its cost of borrowings and have an adverse effect on its results of
operations and cash flow.
With respect to the sale of ICI’s interest in Huntsman International
Holdings LLC the remaining $280m (£174m) will be payable by Matlin
Patterson Global Opportunities Partners L.P. on 15 May 2003, with the
purchaser having the option to pay all or part of the amount due prior
to 15 May 2003 by means of instalment payments. Other than the
$160m (£109m) already received, sums due from the purchaser will
carry interest from May 2002 to the date of payment. 
Under the arrangements with Ineos Chlor Limited (described in note
40 to the consolidated financial statements), a further £30m could be
lent by the Group to Ineos Chlor.
The following table summarises ICI’s principal contractual obligations
at 31 December 2002, including installments, which are described in
the consolidated financial statements and related notes. The table
below only includes the contractual obligations which are described
in the consolidated financial statements and excludes all other
contractual obligations such as derivatives, and other hedging
instruments, and also the non-novated contracts referred to in the

Foreign currency risk
Most of the Group’s net assets are denominated in currencies other
than Sterling with the result that the Group’s Sterling balance sheet
can be significantly affected by currency movements. The Group
partially hedges this effect by borrowing in currencies other than
Sterling. The Group does not hedge translation exposures other than
by passive use of currency borrowings.
The Group requires its subsidiaries to hedge their material transaction
exposures (sales and purchases in currencies other than their
functional currency) using forward contracts. The majority of this
hedging is performed by Group Treasury. The Group selectively
hedges its anticipated future trading cash flows up to 12 months
ahead using forward contracts and purchased currency options. The
Group’s profits are denominated in many currencies across the world,
the most significant of which are the US dollar and related currencies.
The adverse impact due to translation exposures on the Group trading
profit (before goodwill amortisation and exceptional items) of a 5%
strengthening in Sterling against the US dollar is approximately £7m.
Counterparty credit risk
The Group’s counterparty credit risks arise mainly from non-central
operating cash held on short-term bank deposit, the positive “mark to
market” effect of swaps and counterparty risk arising from the liquidity
of the Group’s captive insurance company. The Group considers the
risk of material loss in the event of non-performance by a financial
counterparty to be low.
Euro
Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) has been implemented in the
twelve participating member states of the European Union. These
countries adopted the Euro as their only currency with effect from
1 January 2002. These participating countries do not include the
United Kingdom where ICI is headquartered.
The Group’s strategy for trading with suppliers and customers in
Continental Europe has been to facilitate the use of the Euro. However
for the time being, the Group will continue to report its results in
Sterling and keep under review the case for any redenomination of
its share capital.
Although the introduction of the Euro eliminates exchange rate risks
between the former currencies of participating countries, while the UK
remains outside of EMU, and while ICI continues to report in Sterling
the Group will remain exposed to potential foreign exchange
fluctuations which occur between the Euro and Sterling. The adverse
impact due to translation exposures on the Group trading profit
(before goodwill amortisation and exceptional items) of a 5%
strengthening in Sterling against the Euro is approximately £3m.
Quantitative disclosure about market risk
The analysis below presents the sensitivity of the market value or
the fair value of the Group’s financial instruments to selected changes
in market rates and prices. The rates of change chosen reflect the
Group’s view of changes that are reasonably possible over a one year
period. Fair values are quoted values or, where these are not available,
values obtained by discounting cash flows at market rates or using
option valuation models. The fair values for interest rate risk are
calculated by using a standard zero coupon discounted cash flow
pricing model.
Interest rate risk
The sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous 1% move in interest
rates of all currencies from their levels at 31 December 2002, with all
other variables held constant.

The movement in fair value of debt and instruments hedging debt will
not result in any immediate change to the Group’s financial statements
since fair values are not recognised on the Group’s balance sheet. An
increase in short-term interest rates of all currencies of 1% would
increase Group net interest payable for the year by £12m.
Foreign currency risk
The sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous 10% change in
foreign currency exchange rates against Sterling from their levels at
31 December 2002, with all other variables (including interest rates
and currency option volatility) held constant.
The currency mix of debt at the 2002 year-end was held 57.5% in US
dollars, 14.1% in Euro and Euro related currencies, 16.7% in Yen and
11.7% other.

Critical Accounting Policies
The Group’s main accounting policies are set out on pages 50 and
51 of the consolidated financial statements and conform with UK
Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“UK GAAP”). The Group
considers the following to be its critical accounting policies under UK
GAAP:
Environmental liabilities
With regards to environmental liabilities, the Group is subject to
obligations and contingencies pursuant to environmental laws and
regulations that in future will or may require it to take action to correct
the effects on the environment of prior disposal or release of chemical
substances by the Group or other parties. The ultimate requirement
for such actions, and their cost, is inherently difficult to estimate.
Provision for these costs are made when expenditure on remedial
work is probable and the cost can be estimated within a reasonable
range of possible outcomes. Processes are in place for regular
reviews of environmental liabilities and provisions. The environmental
provisions are detailed in notes 21 and 22 and discussed in note 40
to the consolidated financial statements.
Divestment provisions
The divestment provisions have arisen as a result of the reshaping of
the Group’s portfolio of businesses to focus its resources on paints
and specialty products. The initial determination of the size of these
provisions, and the subsequent timing and amounts of the expenditure
in relation to these provisions, is inherently difficult to estimate and
therefore requires considerable management judgement. Provisions
were established at the time of each disposal and are regularly
reviewed based on latest available facts. The divestment provisions
are set out in note 22 to the consolidated financial statements.
Contingent liabilities
The Group is subject to a number of contingent liabilities. No
provision has been made for these contingent liabilities since either
the obligations have been evaluated as “possible” and their existence
will be confirmed by uncertain future events, or they have not been
recognised, as either a transfer of economic benefits is not “probable”,
or the amount cannot be measured with sufficient reliability. Details of
the Group’s contingent liabilities are set out in note 40 to the consolidated
financial statements.
Investments
As a result of the transformation programme, the Group retains
a number of investments. The recoverability and hence carrying
value of these assets requires considerable management judgement.
Currently, significant items where management judgement has been
used in ascertaining recoverability include the Group’s interests in
Huntsman International Holdings LLC (note 17) and Ineos Chlor 
(notes 3 and 40).
Retirement benefits
ICI provides retirement benefits for the majority of its former and
current employees through a variety of defined benefit and defined
contribution schemes. These include the ICI UK Pension Fund which
is ICI’s largest defined benefit schemes and which at 31 December
2002 had liabilities of approximately £6.5bn. This fund accounts for
approximately 87% of the Group’s retirement benefit scheme by asset
value and in projected benefit terms. In preparing the Group accounts
on the basis of relevant UK accounting standards, key assumptions
are required in respect of, for example, rates of inflation, increases in
earnings, member demographics, healthcare cost inflation, discount
rates and returns on investments. These assumptions are assessed,
and regularly reviewed, in accordance with the advice of independent
qualified actuaries.
Exceptional items
Exceptional items are material items which derive from events or
transactions that fall within the ordinary activities of the Group and
which individually or, if of a similar type, in aggregate, need to be
disclosed by virtue of their size or incidence if the financial statements
are to give a true and fair view. The determination of which items
should be separately disclosed as operating exceptional items
requires a significant degree of judgement.
The Group considers goodwill to be an additional critical accounting
policy under US GAAP:
Goodwill
Included within the US GAAP disclosures in note 42 is capitalised
goodwill at 31 December 2002 of £3,507m. In the period to
31 December 2002, an impairment of £122m was recognised
representing the entire goodwill in the Paints Latin America reporting
unit. Goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least annually
using a two-stage approach at a reporting unit level. In the first stage,
significant management judgement is required to determine the fair
value of the reporting unit for example, in forecasting the underlying
cash flows of the unit, in estimating terminal growth values, and in
selecting an appropriate discount rate. Where the second stage is
performed, further management judgement is applied to determine the
fair values of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the reporting unit.
If alternative management judgements were adopted in implementing
this impairment exercise then different outcomes could be arrived at,
including potentially a larger impairment charge.

US GAAP results
Under US GAAP, the net income in 2002 was £9m (2001 £13m net income; 2000 £456m net loss) compared with net income of £179m
(2001 £80m net income; 2000 £207m net loss) under UK GAAP. Under US GAAP, shareholders’ equity at 31 December 2002 was £2,805m,
at 31 December 2001 was £2,568m and at 31 December 2000 was £2,828m compared to £499m (surplus) and £364m (deficit) and £249m (deficit)
respectively under UK GAAP. These differences primarily result from the differing accounting treatment of purchase accounting adjustments,
pensions, disposal accounting, capitalisation of interest, foreign exchange, derivative instruments, and restructuring costs.

Review of 2002 business results
Review of 2002 business results
National Starch
National Starch’s sales of £1,841m were 2% ahead of 2001, and
trading profit of £224m was 5% ahead, both on a comparable basis.
The growth in sales and profitability reflected both the modest
recovery in economic conditions in North America in comparison to
2001 and continued growth from the Asian businesses. Investment in
restructuring, announced during 2001, improved the competitiveness
and profitability of the Specialty Polymer and Adhesive businesses in
both the US and Europe.
Foreign exchange translation effects accounted for the difference
between comparable and as reported results with sales and trading
profit as reported 1% lower and 3% higher than 2001 respectively.
The following commentary on the four business groupings within
National Starch refers to performance measured on a comparable
basis.
Adhesives
Adhesives sales were 1% ahead of 2001, and trading profit was also
ahead, as gross margin percentages improved partly due to lower
raw material costs throughout most of the year. The business also
benefited from savings from the 2001 restructuring programme.
Growth within Asia was strongest in China, Indonesia, Malaysia and
India, offsetting weakness in Japan, where economic conditions
continued to be difficult. In the United States, business performance
improved in the second half of the year, although full year sales
remained slightly behind. In Europe, sales were slightly ahead for
the year, with a strong second half performance stemming from
new contract wins. During the year a new manufacturing facility
was opened in Shanghai, China.
Starch
Sales for Starch were 4% ahead of 2001, while trading profit was
lower, largely due to lower profits in the United States. Sales growth
in Asia was strong, particularly in food starch, although higher raw
material costs lowered gross margin percentages during the middle
of the year. In the United States, sales mix was poor, with growth in
commodity food starches outpacing growth in specialty food starch.
Papermaking starch sales in North America improved in the second
half, following new business wins in both the United States and
Canada. However, with average corn costs for the year higher than
2001, and fixed costs also higher, trading profit in North America was
lower. In Europe, sales and trading profit in both food and
papermaking were ahead for the year.
Specialty Synthetic Polymers
Specialty Synthetic Polymers sales were 2% ahead of 2001, and with
the benefits from the 2001 restructuring programme and lower raw
material costs, trading profit was well ahead of 2001. The Personal
Care polymers business introduced a number of new products during
the year, helping it to deliver another year of growth. Alco Chemical
performed strongly during the year, particularly in sales of its low
molecular weight polymers to the water treatment industry in the
United States. The Elotex redispersible powders business also
performed well and delivered its strongest growth in the United States,
and from expansion into Eastern Europe and Asia. The Vinamul
emulsion polymer business achieved strong profit growth due to good
fixed cost control and lower average raw material prices, albeit from
lower overall sales.
Electronic and Engineering Materials
Electronic and Engineering Material sales were 6% ahead, a modest
recovery from a weak 2001. Sales were relatively strong in the second
quarter and towards the end of the year, but uncertainty in the
electronics and telecommunications markets meant that there was
no sustained recovery during 2002. Trading profit was ahead of 2001
despite increased fixed costs, mainly on sales and research resources
to support future growth. Ablestik delivered good growth in the
semiconductor materials market and Emerson & Cuming also
delivered sales growth, particularly from strong sales in ink jet
materials. Acheson sales were ahead for the year, primarily as a
result of growth in its process lubricants business.
Quest
Quest delivered sales of £716m, 1% ahead of 2001 on a comparable
basis, with good overall growth in North America and Asia, offsetting
lower Food sales in Europe and Fragrance sales in Latin America.
Food delivered 2% sales growth whilst Fragrance sales were 1%
lower. Overall gross margin percentages were in line with 2001, with
favourable product mix offset by tolling costs and adverse exchange
rate movements. However, with an estimated £17m impact from
production issues arising from second quarter systems changes in
a foods factory in the Netherlands, trading profit of £82m was 23%
lower on a comparable basis.
As reported, sales and trading profit were 2% and 23% lower
respectively, with the effect of foreign exchange translation accounting
for the difference from the comparable sales performance.
During the year, Quest continued to implement the major programme
announced in 2001 to rationalise its cost base and upgrade its
business systems.

Fragrance comparable sales were 1% lower in a difficult market,
partly due to economic slowdown in Latin America combined with
a general market slowdown in fine fragrance retail sales throughout
the year. However, the introduction of new products resulted in strong
performances in Quest’s fine fragrance and personal care businesses,
which largely compensated for more difficult conditions in aroma
chemicals and other segments. Consequently, the improved sales mix
and benefits from supply chain efficiencies contributed positively but,
with adverse foreign currency movements and increased fixed costs
to support future growth, trading profit was below 2001.
Food
Food had a difficult year but still delivered 2% comparable sales
growth, with particularly strong sales performances for both flavours
and food ingredients in Asia and in North America. Sales in Europe
were lower. Gross margin percentages and fixed costs were both
negatively impacted by the second quarter ERP implementation issues
in the Netherlands and, consequently, trading profit was well below
2001.
Performance Specialties
The reported sales and trading profit for Performance Specialties for
2002 reflect the effects of the divestment of the Synetix and Security
Systems businesses during the year. Security Systems was sold to
Lincolnshire Management Inc. in July 2002 and Synetix was sold to
Johnson Matthey plc for £260m in the fourth quarter of 2002. As
reported sales of £804m and trading profit of £49m were 3% and 28%
below 2001 respectively.
Uniqema
Uniqema had a difficult year; sales of £669m were 2% ahead of 2001
on a comparable basis but trading profit of £28m was 24% lower.
The business experienced significant pressures on gross margin
percentages, mainly as a result of weaker sales mix in fatty acids and
increases in raw material costs. Market prices of glycerine (a major
by-product from Uniqema processes) fell in the first quarter but
showed no further year on year weakness in subsequent quarters.
Lubricants and Personal Care delivered good comparable sales
growth in 2002, 9% and 4% respectively. Lubricants sales were
driven by strong demand in the industrial sector in Europe and the
compressor sector in North America. Personal Care grew in all
regions, and particularly in China and Korea, while sales of new
skincare products also increased.
The 2001 programme of restructuring and efficiency improvements is
on track to deliver full cost savings and working capital reductions by
2004. In 2002 Uniqema closed its offices at Everberg in Belgium and
successfully completed the implementation of new ERP computer
systems at all sites in Europe.

Review of 2002 business results
operating and financial review Synetix
Synetix sales for the 10 months up to the divestment were 8% ahead
of 2001 on a comparable basis with growth in all main markets. Gross
margins were above 2001 due to improved sales mix, and trading
profit was consequently up.
Paints
For 2002, Paints delivered sales of £2,182m and achieved comparable
sales growth of 1% despite the economic difficulties in Latin America,
where sales were down 24%. Performance in Asia was excellent, with
double-digit sales and trading profit growth. Trading profit for Paints of
£188m, was 9% ahead on a comparable basis, with a trading loss in
Latin America more than offset by profit growth in other regions. As
reported sales were 2% below 2001 and as reported trading profit 7%
ahead with foreign exchange effects accounting for the difference from
the comparable performance.
The following commentary on the four geographical regions where
Paints operates refers to performance measured on a comparable
basis.
In Europe, sales were 3% ahead, with particularly good performances
in the UK retail and trade markets during the second half of the year.
There was also strong growth in the businesses in France and Poland,
offsetting lower sales in Germany where a slow economy affected
business. Trading profit was ahead for the year, with sales growth and
lower raw materials costs offsetting weaker sales mix and higher fixed
costs.
In North America, sales were 1% ahead of 2001. Sales growth in the
US domestic housing and Canadian markets was partially offset by
lower sales in the US non-residential construction sector. Trading
profit for the North American business as a whole was significantly
up, aided by benefits from the 2001 restructuring programme.
Sales growth in Asia exceeded 10% for the second year in succession
with strength in India, China, Thailand and Indonesia being partially
offset by Singapore and Taiwan. Strong sales and lower raw material
costs combined to deliver trading profit well ahead of 2001.
Latin America had a significant negative impact on Paints overall
sales and profit growth for the year. The major devaluation in the
Argentinean Peso during the first quarter was followed by devaluations
in the other currencies in the region and a slowdown in economic 
activity. As a result, sales declined from 2001 by 24% in US$ terms,
and this, together with the higher cost of imported raw materials from
the currency devaluation, resulted in a trading loss for the year.
The Packaging business delivered comparable sales growth of 1% but
trading profit was lower, mainly due to weaker sales mix.
Regional and Industrial 
Regional and Industrial sales for 2002, at £615m, were 25% below
2001, mainly due to divested businesses and a reduction in “nil margin
sales” from £275m in 2001 to £209m in 2002. 2001 sales included
sales of methanol under a tolling agreement which ceased in April
2001 and supply contracts involving businesses that have been
divested. Higher profits from Pakistan and Argentina were offset by
the loss of profits from divested businesses and the impact of a £5m
provision in relation to a continuing European court case involving ICI’s
former Soda Ash business. Consequently, the Regional and Industrial
business recorded a trading loss of £10m, £14m lower than 2001.
Pakistan
The world and Asian PTA markets experienced significant price
fluctuation during the year with markets improving rapidly during the
middle of the year, but falling away towards the end of the year as
new capacity came on stream in Asia. The PTA business delivered a
satisfactory trading performance for the year. Sales and trading profit
were lower in polyester fibre, although the Soda Ash business
continued to perform well. Overall, trading profit in Pakistan was
above 2001.
India
Trading profit for the regional businesses in India was below 2001
mainly due to the divestment of the pharmaceuticals business during
the period. The explosives and nitrocellulose businesses continued to
perform well.
Argentina
Whilst sales in Argentina for 2002 were below 2001 due to the effect
of the Peso devaluation, trading profit improved as the wine chemicals
and performance chemicals businesses benefited from significant hard
currency exports.
Discontinued operations
No businesses became discontinued in 2002.

Review of 2001 business results
Continuing operations
National Starch
National Starch’s sales in 2001 of £1,853m were 4% behind 2000 with
trading profit of £218m, 12% lower for the same period, both on a
comparable basis. Both sales and profit declines reflected the effects
of the continued economic downturn in the US, and the sharp
downturn in the electronics industry which impacted from early in
2001. However, profit improvement programmes, including an 8%
reduction in headcount during 2001, reduced the rate of profit decline
versus 2000 to only 3% for the second half, and improved trading
margins compared with the first half of 2001. In the fourth quarter
of 2001, a restructuring programme was announced that intended
to further reduce the cost base and improve competitiveness. In total,
£37m was intended to be spent on restructuring programmes over
2002 and 2003, which included the closure or sale of several sites
in the US, Europe, Asia and Australasia, and a further significant
headcount reduction. The programme was focused on Specialty
Polymers and Adhesives in North America and Europe.
Foreign exchange translation effects largely accounted for the
difference between comparable and as reported performance in 2001
with as reported sales and trading profits 2% and 11% lower than
2000 respectively.
The following commentary on the four business groupings within
National Starch refers to performance measured on a comparable
basis.
Adhesives
Adhesives sales in 2001 were 3% behind 2000, and trading profit was
also lower as good performances in Europe and Asia were offset by
the impact of the economic downturn in the US. In the US, price
increases and aggressive cost control efforts partially offset lower
sales volumes, while the European business was more robust,
recovering from a slow start to deliver both sales and profit growth
for the full year. The Asia Pacific region continued to be a strong
performer. While the downturn in Japan had a significant impact,
growth continued in other parts of Asia, most notably in China and in
the Dongsung-NSC business. During 2001, Dongsung-NSC expanded
its shoe adhesives business into Vietnam and Mexico.
Starch
Sales for Starch were slightly below 2000, and trading profit also
declined, as Food Starch growth was more than offset by the decline
in the papermaking sector in North America. Food Starch sales were
strong in all regions, including North America, with its focus on
customer needs through technology application continuing to
distinguish this business from its competitors. Tapioca-based starch
products produced in Thailand maintained their sales growth, both in
Asia and in other regions of the world, but margins were squeezed
by higher tapioca costs, especially in the latter part of 2001. The
papermaking starch business, which was under severe pressure in
North America, continued to grow in Asia.
Specialty Synthetic Polymers
Specialty Synthetic Polymers sales for 2001 were 2% below 2000.
Margins were impacted early in the year by high raw material costs,
but improved as the year progressed as a result of aggressive cost
reduction efforts and more favourable raw material costs. Trading
profit in 2001 was well ahead of the previous year. The Vinamul
polymers business experienced lower demand in many applications,
and pressure on pricing remained strong. Alco Chemical, which
supplies low molecular weight chemistries for water treatment and
other applications, continued its strong growth in North America and
sustained its expansion in Europe and Asia. The Elotex powders
business suffered from lower sales due to the decline in construction
in Western Europe, especially Germany, and from high raw material
costs early in the year. 
The personal care business continued to progress in 2001 with broad
geographic sales growth, building on the recovery of sales that
commenced in the second half 2000.
Electronic and Engineering Materials
Electronic and Engineering Materials in 2001 suffered from the effects
of a major downturn in the semiconductor and electronics industry,
and, as a result, sales for that year were 13% below 2000. Ablestik,
which supplies materials for semiconductor packaging and micro-
electronic assemblies, was most severely impacted by this downturn,
but continued to work closely with customers throughout the period
and is expected by Group management to be well positioned to
benefit from a future upturn in this sector. Acheson sales of coatings
for cathode ray tubes slowed, reflecting sluggish demand for computer
monitors and television sets. Emerson & Cuming was also affected by
the downturn, although it was able to maintain its strong relationships
with key ink jet customers, while the Circuit Assembly Materials
business unit developed significant new business in the aerospace
sector, particularly within satellite components. Costs were reduced
throughout the division to offset the industry slowdown, and, despite
the decline in sales, the division generated a positive trading profit.
Quest
Quest delivered sales of £727m, 3% growth in 2001 on a comparable
basis, with high single digit growth outside Europe and North America.
Improvements in Fragrance offset an adverse sales mix in Food, and
trading profit of £107m was in line with 2000 on a comparable basis.
As reported sales were up 6% and trading profit up 4%, with the
effect of foreign exchange, +2%, and the Quest India acquisition, +1%
(sales) and +2% (trading profit), accounting for the improvement over
comparable performance.
During 2001, Quest initiated a major programme to rationalise its cost
base through the closure of surplus manufacturing sites, restructuring
and redesign of the supply chain and the streamlining of management
and support services. In addition, business systems, processes and
capabilities will be upgraded in order to drive supply chain improvements,
significantly enhance customer service levels and create e-connectivity.
The estimated total exceptional cash expenditure of £41m was
expected to be incurred within the period 2002 to 2004.
During 2001, ICI, mainly via ICI India, acquired a 51% stake in Quest
India from Hindustan Lever Limited for $33m.
Fragrance
Fragrance had a strong year in 2001 with 5% comparable sales
growth, despite more difficult market conditions in the second half of
the year. The introduction of new products, most notably in personal
care, contributed to the growth, with higher sales also achieved in
fragrance ingredients. Fine fragrance sales were up significantly in
the first half of the year but slowed in the second half, reflecting the
market downturn. Improved sales mix and supply chain improvements
contributed to improved gross margin percentages, and, as a result,
trading profit was well ahead for the year. Trading profit growth was
achieved in all the major regions.
ICI ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS AND FORM 20-F 2002
Review of 2001 business results
operating and financial review 31
Food
Food had a more difficult year in 2001 but comparable sales grew by
2%. Food ingredients grew, particularly in Asia Pacific, while Flavours
did well in North America and there was continued strong sales
growth with most key customers. Flavour sales were slower in Europe.
Culinary sales were lower, but this was offset, in particular, by strong
growth in snacks and dairy. The associated adverse sales mix effects
and higher raw material prices, partially offset by cost containment
programmes during the year, caused trading profits to be lower than
in 2000.
Performance Specialties
Overall, 2001 was a disappointing year for Performance Specialties,
with sales of £832m, 2% lower on a comparable basis and trading profit
of £68m, 10% lower on a comparable basis. The extent of the profit
decline was, however, considerably limited by cost saving initiatives
in Uniqema.
As reported sales were 1% lower with foreign exchange effects
partially offsetting the 2% lower comparable performance. As reported
profits 9% lower, were similarly affected.
Uniqema
Uniqema experienced the effects of the global economic downturn,
particularly in industrial sectors in North America. These were
heightened by the impact of significantly lower glycerine prices after
the first quarter, particularly in Europe and North America, which
reduced profits by some £8.5m worldwide. Sales were down 5% on
a comparable basis, although the Health and Personal Care business
continued to grow. Overall, comparable fixed costs were 3% below
2000 levels with reductions taking effect in the second half, but the
savings were insufficient to make up for the sales shortfall, and profits
were well down on the previous year. Demand in the process
intermediates sector remained strong in Europe in the first half of the
year, but weakened somewhat in the second half. Market conditions
in the US were difficult throughout 2001. Synthetic lubricants showed
strong volume growth year on year despite competitive pressures, but
the polymers sector slowed with industrial markets generally,
particularly in Europe in the second half of the year.
As announced in November 2001, Uniqema in Europe is implementing
programmes to improve supply chain efficiencies and undertake site
restructuring at an estimated cash expenditure of £25m. In July 2001,
Uniqema also completed the sale of its ester manufacturing plant at
Baleycourt, France to Ineos Chlor.
Synetix
Synetix had an excellent year in 2001. Higher sales and improved
gross margins delivered significant trading profit growth and the total
business sales were ahead by 13% on a comparable basis. In January
2001, Synetix completed the acquisition of the ‘CelActiv’ catalyst
business from Celanese Chemicals Europe GmbH, and this business
has performed well since acquisition.
Other Specialty Businesses
Within other businesses, Security Systems increased its sales and
profits in 2001.
Paints
Comparable sales growth of 2% was achieved for 2001 despite a
slowdown in the US and economic difficulties in parts of Latin
America. Performance in Asia was excellent, with 11% comparable
sales growth and trading profit well ahead over prior year. Trading
profit for Paints of £176m was up 1% on 2000 on a comparable basis,
with a halving of trading profits in Latin America more than offset by
profit growth in all other regions.
As reported sales were up 4% with foreign exchange effects, +3%,
less divestments, –2% and acquisitions +1%, accounting for the
differences from the comparable performance. Trading profits as
reported were 1% lower with divestment effects –1% and acquisition
effects –1%, accounting for the differences from the comparable
performance.
The worldwide spend on media and publicity for the year was up 3%.
The following commentary on the four geographical regions where
Paints operates refers to performance measured on a comparable
basis.
In Europe, sales were 1% ahead in a slowing European economy,
with growth in the UK, France and Ireland offsetting lower sales in
Germany. Trading profits were also ahead as a result of both the
growth in sales and the benefits of successful restructuring in France.
In North America, the business delivered sales growth of 5%, with the
US Consumer business doing well, and sales from the business’s US
Stores returning to modest levels of growth towards the end of 2001.
The business was significantly impacted in the short-term by events
of September 11th but recovered early in the fourth quarter. Profits 
for the year were ahead of 2000. During the fourth quarter, the next
phase of restructuring the North American Decorative business was
announced. Cost reduction projects included the closure of a

manufacturing facility as well as a number of loss-making stores at
an estimated cash expenditure of £15m. This simplification of supply
chain infrastructure is expected by management to deliver both cost
and working capital reductions.
Sales growth in Asia of 11% was achieved despite slowing economic
growth in the region. There were strong performances in China, India
and Thailand. Selling and marketing resources were increased,
particularly in India and China, and overall profits were still well up. The
divestment of the India Motors business was completed in April 2001.
In Latin America, sales declined 18% in 2001 compared with 2000 and
profit was well down. The major influence on sales was the significant
devaluation of the Real in Brazil, which continued to impact results
throughout the year, particularly by inflating imported raw material
costs. In the second half, the deteriorating economic situation in
Argentina depressed the paint market, reducing sales and causing a
significant reduction in profits for the year overall.
The Packaging business delivered comparable sales growth of 3% and
comparable profits in line with prior year. Sales growth was good in
Europe. Investments in projects to improve the supply chain in Europe
resulted in higher costs in the year, but were expected by
management to deliver benefits in 2002.
Regional and Industrial
Regional and Industrial sales for 2001, at £821m, were 8% below
2000 due to several small disposals during the year. Trading profits
were £4m, £13m below 2000. Turnover included £275m of “nil margin
sales” (2000 £328m) and also included sales of methanol under a
tolling agreement which ceased in April 2001 and supply contracts
involving businesses that have been divested.
Pakistan
The world and Asian PTA markets showed no improvement, and the
PTA business made a small trading loss during the year. Sales and
trading profits were also lower in polyester fibre, although the Soda
Ash business continued to perform well. Overall, trading profits were
slightly below the prior year.
India
Trading profits for the regional businesses in India were down 8% in
2001, compared to 2000, due to the divestment of the polyurethanes
business during the year, and costs associated with the restructuring
of the rubber chemicals business. The explosives and nitrocellulose
businesses continued to do well.
Argentina
Sales in Argentina for 2001 were significantly below 2000, with the
performance of both the wine chemicals and performance chemicals
businesses adversely affected by the difficult economic conditions.
Consequently, a trading loss was recorded for 2001.
Discontinued operations
No businesses became discontinued in 2001. board of directors

Corporate governance
The Group is committed to high standards of corporate governance.
The Board is accountable to the Company’s shareholders for good
governance and this statement describes how the relevant principles
of governance are applied to the Company. Throughout the year the
Company has been in compliance with the provisions set out in the
Combined Code for Corporate Governance appended to the Financial
Services Authority Listing Rules.
The ICI Board currently comprises the Non-Executive Chairman,
the Chief Executive, four other Executive Directors and four Non-
Executive Directors including the Senior Non-Executive Director,
Lord Butler. Their biographies appear on page 33. These demonstrate
a range of business, financial and global experience, which is vital
to the successful direction of a multi-national company. All the Non-
Executive Directors are independent of management. The Board is
balanced both numerically and in experience.
All Directors are equally accountable under the law for the proper
stewardship of the Company’s affairs. The Non-Executive Directors
have a particular responsibility to ensure that the strategies proposed
by Executive Directors are fully discussed and critically examined, not
only against the best long-term interests of shareholders, but also to
ensure that they take proper account of the interests of employees,
customers, suppliers and the many communities within which ICI
is represented. The Non-Executive Directors also test fully the
operational performance of the whole Group. The Board has
prescribed reserved powers which reinforce its control of the
Company. There is a procedure for Directors to obtain independent
professional advice at the Company’s expense in the performance of
their duties as Directors.
To enable them to do this all Directors have full and timely access to
all relevant information. The Board meets at least eight times a year
and there is frequent contact between meetings to progress the
Company’s business.
The Non-Executive Directors fulfil a vital role in corporate
accountability. The remits and memberships of the three relevant
Board Committees are set out on page 36. The Remuneration and
Nomination Committee and the Audit Committee, which comprise
solely Non-Executive Directors, meet at least quarterly and report
regularly to the Board.
Remuneration and Nomination Committee
The Chairman and Chief Executive are in attendance at the
Remuneration and Nomination Committee for appropriate items but
are always excluded when their own performance and remuneration
are under review. The Chairman is not a member of the Remuneration
and Nomination Committee except when it meets as the Nomination
Committee. He attends all remuneration discussions except when
his own position is being discussed. The Chairman from time to time
promotes discussion with the Executive Directors about Non-
Executive Directors’ remuneration based on external comparisons.
Any recommendations are tabled to the full Board. Non-Executive
Directors have the option of taking part of their remuneration in the
Company’s shares.
The Remuneration Report, on pages 38 to 46, includes details
on remuneration policy and practices, and on the remuneration
of Directors.
Lord Butler acts as the Company’s Senior Non-Executive Director.
In this position he promotes discussion at appropriate times about
the Company chairmanship and succession to it.
The Non-Executive Directors normally meet twice a year with the
Chairman and Chief Executive to discuss and evaluate Board
and individual Directors’ performance and succession plans. At
appropriate times the Chief Executive and then the Chairman
absent themselves so their performance can be assessed. The
final discussion is led by the Senior Non-Executive Director and
there is feedback to individuals.
Appointments to Executive Director are fully discussed by the
Chairman and Chief Executive with the Remuneration and Nomination
Committee before a proposal is formally made to the Board by the
Chairman of that Committee. Possible new Non-Executive Directors
are suggested by all members of the Board against the requirements
of the Company’s business and the need to have a balanced Board.
In appropriate cases recruitment consultants are used to assist the
process. Possible candidates are discussed with all Directors before
any approach is made to them. All Directors are subject to re-election
at least every three years.
Audit and internal control
In accordance with the guidance for directors on internal control
(The Turnbull Guidance), the Board confirm that there is a process
for identifying, evaluating and managing the significant risks to the
achievement of the Group’s strategic objectives. The process has
been in place throughout 2002 and up to the date of approval of 
the Annual Report and Accounts and Form 20-F, and accords with
The Turnbull Guidance. The effectiveness of this process has been
reviewed regularly by the Audit Committee who report their findings
for consideration by the Board.
The processes used by the Audit Committee to review the
effectiveness of the system of internal control include:
• Discussions with management on risk areas identified by
management and/or the audit process;
• The review of internal and external audit plans;
• The review of significant issues arising from internal and external
audits; and
• The review of significant Group risks reported by the Group Risk
Committee.
The Audit Committee reports to the Board the results of their review
of the risk assessment process. The Board then draws its collective
conclusions as to the effectiveness of the system of internal control.
The Group Risk Committee (GRC) consolidates and prioritises for
the Board the inputs received from management of the Businesses
and corporate functions. The GRC comprises the heads of major
corporate functions, the Group Internal Auditor and the General
Counsel. The GRC meets on a regular basis to review updated
input from business and corporate management and to report its
conclusions to the Audit Committee.
The internal audit function reviews internal controls in all key activities
of the ICI Group, typically over a three year cycle. It acts as a service
to the Businesses by assisting with the continuous improvement
of controls and procedures. Actions are agreed in response to
its recommendations and these are followed up to ensure that
satisfactory control is maintained. Quarterly reviews are also
conducted between internal audit management and the senior
management of the Businesses and major functions to assess
their current control status and to identify and address any areas
of concern. corporate governance
36
ICI ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS AND FORM 20-F 2002
The Board is responsible for maintaining and reviewing the
effectiveness of the Group’s system of internal controls. The internal
control systems are designed to meet the Group’s particular needs
and the risks to which it is exposed and are designed to manage
rather than eliminate the risk to the achievement of business
objectives and can only provide reasonable and not absolute
assurance against misstatement or loss.
The Group’s strategic direction is regularly reviewed by the Board,
and the Executive Management Team considers the strategy for the
individual Businesses through an integrated disciplined process on a
biennial basis.
Annual plans and performance targets for each Business are set by
the Chief Executive and are reviewed in total by the Board in the light
of the Group’s overall objectives.
The processes to identify and manage the key risks to the success
of the Group are an integral part of the internal control environment.
Such processes, which are reviewed and improved as necessary,
include strategic planning, the appointment of senior managers, the
regular monitoring of performance, control over capital expenditure
and investments and the setting of high standards and targets for
safety, health and environmental performance.
Within the financial and overall objectives for the Group, agreed by the
Board, the management of the Group as a whole is delegated to the
Executive Management Team. The conduct of ICI’s Businesses is
delegated to the individual Executive Vice Presidents. They are
accountable for the conduct and performance of their Businesses
within the agreed Business strategy. They have full authority to act
subject to the reserved powers and sanctioning limits laid down by
the Board and to Group policies.
Businesses are responsible for meeting the defined reporting
timetables and compliance with Group accounting manuals which
set out accounting policies, controls and definitions.
The Executive Management Team receives a monthly summary
of financial results from each Business, and the Group’s published
quarterly financial information is based on a standardised and timely
reporting process.
There is a process in place which requires post event reviews to be
undertaken following the completion of all major investments. This
process aims to improve the quality of business judgements through
the understanding and experience gained.
Responsibility for monitoring compliance with Group policies and
guidelines rests with the Executive Vice Presidents and Chief
Executive Officers for operating Businesses and with senior managers
for the Corporate Centre. Annual statements of compliance are
provided to the Board, and these statements are reviewed by the
relevant functional leader for each policy area. In turn, there is an
annual report to the Audit Committee, on behalf of the Board, on the
degree of compliance with Group policies and guidelines. Corrections
to any weaknesses found are monitored and controls are developed
to match changing circumstances.
Sarbanes-Oxley Act 2002
The Company monitors its legal and regulatory obligations following
the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in the United States. It is
the Company’s intention to comply with the legal and regulatory
requirements introduced pursuant to this new legislation, in so far
as they are applicable to the Company.
Disclosure controls and procedures
In accordance with recommendations issued by the US Securities and
Exchange Commission, the Company has established a Disclosure
Committee comprising appropriate senior executives from the ICI
Corporate Centre: the Chief Financial Officer, the General Counsel, the
Company Secretary, the Group Internal Auditor, the Investor Relations
Director and the Group Financial Controller. The Committee designs,
maintains and evaluates the Company’s disclosure controls and
procedures and reports its evaluation to the Chief Executive and
Chief Financial Officer.
Principles of business conduct
As a leading international company, ICI’s reputation for high ethical
standards is central to its business success. A Code of Business
Conduct which provides guidance in this area has been
communicated throughout the Group.
Communications
Communications with shareholders are given a high priority. The
Annual Review is sent to shareholders and a full Annual Report and
Accounts and Form 20-F is available on request. In addition, at the
half year, an interim report is produced and sent to shareholders and
the quarterly results are published via the London Stock Exchange
and by press release. Individual shareholders have the opportunity at
the Annual General Meeting to question the Chairman directly. As an
alternative, shareholders can leave written questions for response by
the Company. After the Annual General Meeting, shareholders can
meet informally with the Directors. There is regular dialogue with
individual institutional shareholders as well as presentations to
analysts after the quarterly results.

Directors’ remuneration and interests
A statement of Directors’ remuneration and their interests in the
shares, debentures and options of the Company and its subsidiaries

Employment policies
ICI’s vision is based on inspiring and developing outstanding people
and the Company is committed to cultural diversity and equal
opportunities.
Respect for the individual is enshrined in the Company’s Code of
Business Conduct, launched in October 2000, which states that: “ICI’s
policy is to treat individuals in all aspects of employment solely on
the basis of ability irrespective of race, religion, colour, age, disability,
gender, sexual orientation or marital status”. The practical application
of this policy is a matter for individual ICI businesses throughout
the world.
The Company is committed to fair treatment of people with disabilities
in relation to job applications, training, promotion and career
development. Every effort is made to find appropriate alternative
jobs for those who are unable to continue in their existing job due
to disability.
ICI believes also that knowledgeable and well informed employees
are essential to its success and that there should be clear channels
of communication and opportunities for consultation and dialogue on
issues which affect both business performance and employees’
working lives. The mechanisms for achieving this aim vary between
different countries and between different businesses in the ICI Group.
A European Works Council (EWC) exists which enables employee
representatives in the UK and Continental Europe to discuss overall
business issues with senior management of the Group. The EWC
holds two meetings each year at one of which the Chief Executive
attends to discuss Company strategy.
ICI has a mixture of unionised and non-unionised operations across
the world and is committed to fostering a positive employee relations
environment at all its locations.
Payment to suppliers
The Company agrees terms and conditions for its business
transactions with suppliers. Payment is then made to these terms,
subject to the terms and conditions being met by the supplier.
Payment terms can differ in the many markets in which ICI trades.
Trade creditors of the Company at 31 December 2002 were equivalent
to 59 days (2001 60 days) purchases, based on the average daily
amount invoiced by suppliers to the Company during this year.
Political and charitable donations
The Group’s worldwide charitable donations in 2002 amounted to
£2.5m. Of this total, £0.6m was spent in the UK. The Group made
no donations for political purposes.
Auditor
KPMG Audit Plc has expressed its willingness to continue in office as
auditor of the Company and a resolution to propose its re-appointment
and to authorise the Directors to agree its remuneration will be
submitted to the Annual General Meeting.
The remuneration and expenses of the Auditor in respect of the
statutory report to the members of the Company for the year 2002
amounted to £61,000 (2001 £66,000). The total figure for the Group
was £2.8m (2001 £2.8m) which includes charges for audits of
subsidiary companies in the UK and overseas, both for the purposes
of consolidation into the Group accounts and to meet statutory
requirements of the countries in which subsidiaries operate.
Fees paid to the Auditor (and its associates) of the Company for
services other than statutory audit supplied to the Group during 2002
totalled £3.3m (2001 £3.1m) of which £2.1m (2001 £0.9m) was for
audit-related services, principally in connection with the Rights Issue
and divestment transactions, £1.1m (2001 £1.8m) was for taxation
services and £0.1m (2001 £0.4m) was for other services. These fees
have been fully reviewed by the Audit Committee.
Going concern
The operation of the Group’s control procedures gives the Directors 
a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to
continue in operation for the foreseeable future. Accordingly they
continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the Group
accounts.
Annual General Meeting
The Notice of Annual General Meeting to be held on
Thursday, 22 May 2003 is contained in a separate letter from

Remuneration Committee
Role and membership
The Remuneration Committee determines, on behalf of the Board,
the Company’s policy on the remuneration of Executive Directors.
The Committee determines the total remuneration packages for these
individuals including any compensation on termination of office. This
provides the framework for remunerating all senior executives.
The Remuneration Committee is comprised exclusively of independent
Non-Executive Directors of the Company. The members of the
Remuneration Committee during the year were:
Mr R N Haythornthwaite (Chairman)
Mr A Baan
Lord Butler
Mr J T Gorman.
The Committee members have no personal financial interest, other
than as shareholders, in the matters to be decided.
The constitution and operation of the Committee comply with
the Combined Code for Corporate Governance of the Financial
Services Authority.
Advisers
To ensure that ICI’s remuneration practices are market competitive,
the Remuneration Committee has access to detailed external research
on market data and trends from independent and experienced
international consultants. Since 1 January 2002, the Committee has
received material advice from Towers Perrin, Mercer Human Resource
Consulting and New Bridge Street Consultants. These advisers have
been appointed by the Remuneration Committee. In relation to other
services provided to the Group, Towers Perrin also provides actuarial
and administrative services in respect of the Group’s Netherlands
pension plan and all three consultants provide certain employee
benefit services and/or remuneration advice to the Group below Board
level. The Chairman, Chief Executive, Executive Vice President Human
Resources and Vice President Compensation & Benefits are normally
invited to attend meetings to respond to specific questions raised by
the Committee. This specifically excludes any matter concerning the
detail of their own personal remuneration. The Company Secretary
acts as Secretary to the Committee.
Remuneration policy
Executive Directors
The Company’s ongoing remuneration policy for Executive Directors
is to provide remuneration in a form and amount which will attract,
retain, motivate and reward high calibre individuals. To achieve this,
the remuneration package is based upon the following principles:
• Incentives should align the interests of executives and shareholders,
reward the creation of long-term value and minimise risk for
shareholders.
• Reward elements should be designed to reinforce the link between
performance and reward. Performance related elements should form
a significant proportion of the total remuneration package.
• The total remuneration package for on-target performance should
be fully competitive in the relevant market.
• Packages can be structured flexibly to meet critical resource needs
and retain key executives.
Personal shareholdings
In order to align the interests of our most senior employees with those
of shareholders, our Executive Directors and senior executives are
expected to build up personal shareholdings of ICI Ordinary Shares 
through the retention of shares acquired via Company share-based
plans. For Executive Directors this shareholding is as follows: 
Target value of shareholding
Chief Executive Two times base salary
Executive Directors One times base salary
External directorships
Executive Directors are encouraged to take an external Non-Executive
Directorship. In order to avoid any conflict of interest all appointments
are subject to the approval of the Remuneration Committee and the
Board. Directors retain payments received in respect of these
appointments.
Non-Executive Directors
The remuneration policy for Non-Executive Directors is determined
by the Board, within the limits set out in the Articles of Association.
Remuneration comprises an annual fee for acting as a Non-Executive
Director of the Company and an additional fee for acting as the
Chairman of a Board Committee or as the Senior Non-Executive
Director. Non-Executive Directors are not eligible to participate in
incentive plans.
ICI operates a scheme which enables Non-Executive Directors to
receive payment of part of their fees in the form of ICI Ordinary Shares.
Remuneration packages for Executive Directors
The remuneration package for Executive Directors comprises five
elements:
• base salary;
• Annual Incentive Plan;
• Performance Growth Plan;
• share option schemes; and
• post-retirement and other benefits.
The performance related elements, when valued at target performance
levels, comprise more than 50% of the package (excluding post-
retirement benefits).
Each of the above elements is explained in the pages which follow.
Base salaries
Base salaries are a fixed annual sum recognising ongoing market
value. The Company’s policy is to set the salary for each Executive
Director within a range around the market median for similar positions
in large, international, publicly quoted companies. Salaries for
individual Directors are reviewed each year by the Remuneration
Committee, recognising the individual’s performance and experience,
and developments in the relevant employment market.
Annual Incentive Plan
The Annual Incentive Plan rewards Executive Directors for the
achievement of annual financial and strategic goals of ICI and its
businesses.
The financial targets which are set under the Annual Incentive Plan are
derived from the strategic and annual planning processes for ICI and
its businesses. During 2002, bonus targets focused on the delivery of
Economic Profit, cash generation and the achievement of key
strategic objectives. Targets are established by the Board and
approved by the Remuneration Committee.
Economic Profit is ICI’s key internal financial measure. This measure
is based on profit after tax, less a charge for the use of capital.
Economic Profit encourages both profitable growth and the efficient
use of capital to generate sustainable shareholder value. Within ICI
Economic Profit is referred to as Net Contribution to Value (NCV). 39

(1) Mr R N Haythornthwaite joined the Board on 20 February 2001, Mr T A Scott was appointed on 23 May 2001 and Mr A Baan joined the
Board on 25 June 2001. Lord Simpson, Mr A G Spall and Sir Roger Hurn retired on 20 February 2001, 23 May 2001 and 31 July 2001,
respectively. Mr C Miller Smith retired on 31 December 2001 and Lord Trotman was appointed Non-Executive Chairman of the Company with
effect from 1 January 2002. All amounts reported for individuals are in respect of the part year for which they were employed as Directors.
(2) A performance related retention arrangement linked to Annual Incentive Plan payments applies to Dr B R O’Neill only. The Remuneration
Committee has determined that for each of the years 2002 to 2005 inclusive an additional cash sum equal to 50% of the earned annual
bonus will be deferred and paid in 2006, normally subject to Dr O’Neill’s continued employment with the Group. This arrangement will
operate for the first time in 2002 and the deferred payment for 2002 is £180,810 (2001 and prior years £nil). This is excluded from the table
above and will be included when paid.
(3) In 2002, Mr P J Drechsler and Mr T A Scott received matched shares provided by the Company as matched shares under the Bonus
Conversion Plan in respect of their 1998 bonus. This plan was operated for the last time in respect of the 1999 financial year. A bonus
recipient could elect to have shares purchased with part or all of their net bonus after tax. After three years, shares purchased in the plan
are released, and matched by an equal number of shares by the Company, provided the individual remains employed by ICI. Directors took
up their full entitlement under the Rights Issue in respect of shares held in the Plan. In accordance with the rules of the Plan the number
of matched shares has been increased by an equal number to the new shares purchased by each Director. Mr Drechsler received 9,450
matching shares, with a market value of £29,200 (2001 1,954 shares with a market value of £7,992). Mr Scott received 4,621 matching
shares with a market value of £14,279 (2001 nil). The bonus shares for Mr Drechsler and Mr Scott were originally purchased on 29 April 1999
at £6.57 each (adjusted for the Rights Issue £5.45).
(4) In 2002 Mr W H Powell received a base salary of US$682,500 (2001 US$682,500). The year on year change in the sterling value is due to
translation at the average exchange rate for each year.
(5) For 2002 the remuneration of Non–Executive Directors comprised an annual fee of £30,000 (2001 £30,000). An additional £10,000 per
annum (2001 £10,000) was paid to the Chairman of a Board Committee and, with effect from 1 April 2002, to Lord Butler due to his position
as Senior Non-Executive Director.
(6) Mr A Baan and Mr R N Haythornthwaite elected to receive 50% of their fees for 2002 in the form of ICI Ordinary Shares.
(7) For 2002 the figures reported are the annual base salary or fee in payment at 31 December 2002 except in respect of Mr T A Scott whose
annual base salary at that date was £325,000 and Lord Butler whose annual fee at that date was £40,000.
(8) Includes non-cash benefits relating to medical insurance, company car, and life insurance (where not provided within pension benefit plans).
(9) No payments were made during 2002 or 2001 in connection with: (i) compensation for loss of office or termination of qualifying services,
(ii) expense allowances paid in respect of qualifying services chargeable to UK income tax.
Annual Incentive Plan (continued) 
The performance measures are set by the Remuneration Committee
on an annual basis and it is the intention to set targets on this basis
for 2003.
The bonus opportunity available to Executive Directors for 2002 for
the achievement of on-target performance was 50% of base salary.
A maximum bonus opportunity of 100% of base salary was possible
for the significant over-achievement of the defined targets.
In the difficult economic climate of 2002, all of ICI’s International
Businesses achieved comparable sales growth over 2001 – with both
Paints and National Starch also growing their trading profit. Strong
cash generation and excellent management of working capital
enhanced the operating performance of most businesses during the
past year. ICI Group targets for Economic Profit improvement and
cash flow were exceeded. In some cases, the level of incentive
payments additionally reflects delivery against key strategic objectives
to strengthen individual businesses and the balance sheet of ICI. remuneration report

Performance Growth Plan
The Performance Growth Plan (PGP) drives and rewards longer-term
business performance improvement. The Plan strengthens the
alignment with shareholders by placing a greater emphasis on
sustained long-term value creation.
For the Executive Directors, the Plan makes conditional awards of ICI
shares linked to performance over a fixed three year period measured
as follows:
• for the Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer, the number of
shares earned under the PGP will depend wholly on how the Total
Shareholder Return (TSR) for ICI compares with the TSR of each of
the companies in ICI’s Peer Group over the performance period (see
across). TSR is the change in the Company’s share price plus
reinvested dividends;
• for the other Executive Directors, who are responsible for the
performance of ICI’s International Businesses, reward will also be
based on the performance of their own areas of responsibility;
• 50% of their award will depend on the Economic Profit
performance over three years of the business for which the
Executive Director is responsible; and
• the other 50% of their award will be based on the relative TSR
performance of the Company;
• in addition, the Remuneration Committee must be satisfied that the
underlying performance of ICI justifies the receipt of any shares.
TSR has been selected as a performance condition to align the
interests of Executive Directors and shareholders. It rewards the
relative out-performance of ICI versus its global competitors. TSR
calculations are performed independently by Mercer Human Resource
Consulting and are approved by the Remuneration Committee.
For those Directors accountable for the International Businesses,
Economic Profit is critical as a measure of profitable growth and
efficient use of capital to generate sustainable shareholder value.
The shares required to make awards under this Plan are provided via
a trust funded by ICI. There is no dilution of ICI’s issued share capital.
The maximum conditional award is 100% of base salary per annum
(200% in the case of US Directors). For the maximum awards to be
paid on the TSR element, performance must be at least upper quartile
versus the Peer Group. For achieving median TSR performance, 40%
of this maximum award will be paid and no award will be paid for
below median performance.
The targets which relate to Economic Profit growth are set at a
level consistent with achieving the Company’s TSR goals and ICI’s
strategic targets.
The Peer Group for the TSR element represents ICI’s key global
competitors and has been selected on the basis of market location,
size, diversity and performance. The Peer Group of companies for the
conditional awards made in 2002 was: Air Products and Chemicals;
Akzo Nobel; Clariant; Crompton Corporation; Cytec Industries; Ciba
Specialty Chemicals; Danisco; Degussa; Engelhard Corporation;
Givaudan; Henkel; H.B. Fuller Company; International Flavors &
Fragrances; Rhodia; Rohm and Haas Company; The Sherwin-Williams
Company. The Peer Group for the 2003 awards will comprise a similar
set of companies.
For the 2000 – 2002 performance period, ICI’s TSR ranked 13 out of
the 17 companies in the Peer Group and, as a result, all awards under
the TSR performance measure for this cycle lapsed. Two Directors
received awards under the Economic Profit measure and these are
shown on page 41.
Details of the Ordinary Shares of the Company conditionally awarded
to Executive Directors under the Performance Growth Plan and
outstanding at 31 December 2002 are shown in the table below.
Target Setting Process
ICI’s financial objectives derive from a combination of top down
goals set by market expectations and a biennial strategic planning
process. These strategic financial objectives then form the basis of
all financial targets set under the PGP.

Awards under the Performance Growth Plan (continued)
(3) Prior to being appointed Directors, Mr W H Powell and Mr T A Scott participated in cash based long-term incentive plans operated by the
Group. The performance period relating to these awards ended on 31 December 2002. Mr Powell will receive no payment in respect of his
units. During 2003 Mr Scott will receive £9,773 in respect of his service as a Director during the performance period.
(4) The number of shares comprising the awards is determined by the average share price of ICI Ordinary Shares for the month of December
prior to the commencement of the performance period. In the case of the grant made on 28 March 2002 the December average share
price was adjusted for the effect of the Rights Issue. However, in accordance with the Directors’ Remuneration Report Regulations 2002
the Company is required to state the market price of its shares on the date of the award and these were as follows: 25 May 2000 £5.24,
5 March 2001 £5.33 and 28 March 2002 £3.42. Prices for 2000 and 2001 are not adjusted for the impact of the Rights Issue.

Share option schemes
(audited)
The share option schemes reward Executive Directors for longer-term
corporate performance as reflected in share price appreciation.
Options to purchase the Company’s Ordinary Shares may be granted
each year. Individual option grants to Executive Directors during 2002
were in a range of 125% to 200% of salary, reflecting market practice
(UK or US, as appropriate), and individual performance and potential
impact on longer-term business results. Grants are made subject to a
performance condition that over a three year period in the life of the
option the growth in ICI’s earnings per share (excluding both
amortisation of goodwill and exceptional items) must be equal to, or
greater than, the increase in the UK Retail Prices Index plus 3% per
annum. In the light of the Company’s current business outlook and
the quantum of the grants involved, the Remuneration Committee
considers this to be an appropriately challenging condition for option
grants made in 2002.
Options must be held for a minimum of three years from grant before
they can be exercised and lapse if not exercised within ten years.
The shares to meet rights granted do not dilute ICI’s issued share
capital as they are bought in the market.
In the USA, grants are made as stock appreciation rights (SARs) and,
on exercise, the gain is delivered in the form of American Depositary
Receipts (ADRs). Each ADR represents four ICI Ordinary Shares. The
grants are subject to similar rules.
No gains were realised on the exercise of share options during 2002
or 2001.

Grants awarded under the UK “save-as-you-earn” Sharesave Scheme in which UK Executive Directors may participate. No performance conditions are
attached to options granted under this scheme as it is an all–employee share option scheme.
(1) The number of shares under option as at 1 January 2002 and their exercise prices are stated after adjustment for the impact of the Rights
Issue using adjustment factors determined by the Remuneration Committee as detailed on page 86. No other variations were made to
Directors’ options or the terms and conditions of any Directors’ options.
(2) The earliest date from which an option is exercisable is subject to any outstanding performance condition being met.
(3) The market price of the shares at 31 December 2002 was £2.30 and the range during 2002 was £2.03 to £3.57 (£4.30 pre rights). The
Register of Directors’ Interests (which is open to inspection by shareholders) contains full details of Directors’ shareholdings and options
to subscribe for shares.
(4) Non-Executive Directors are not eligible for share option grants.
(5) In accordance with the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority, the 1999 annual grant of share options to Executive Directors and
certain individuals involved with the proposed disposal of businesses to Huntsman ICI Holdings LLC was delayed. As a result of this delay,
those participants were granted fewer options at a higher exercise price than would have been the case had the grants been made to them
at the same time as they were made to all other participants at an exercise price of £4.333 (adjusted for the Rights Issue). The Remuneration
Committee decided that those individuals so affected should receive the same gross gain at the time they exercise their options as if the
grant had not been delayed.
(6) Mr W H Powell’s options are awarded in the form of SARs, denominated in ADRs, but for the purpose of this table have been disclosed in
terms of Ordinary Share option equivalents.
(7) Since 1998, grants under share option schemes have been made subject to the earnings per share performance condition outlined on
page 42.
(8) During the period 1 January 2003 to 10 February 2003 there were no changes in the interests of Directors in options.
(9) No amount was paid for the award of any options. remuneration report

Retirement benefits
ICI provides retirement benefit plans for its executives which take
account of local practice in the countries in which it operates. These
plans are designed, as part of the total remuneration package, to
attract the quality of staff needed by the business and to aid mobility
between countries where necessary. In keeping with the Group’s
philosophy on “fixed” elements of reward, they are normally positioned
around the median of the local market.
Except where Defined Benefit plans already exist for current
executives, retirement benefits are provided on a “defined
contribution” basis so that Company costs are stable and predictable.
Where possible, plans provide flexibility and choice to increase
employee commitment, and enable executives to make their own
contributions as well as the Company. 
In this way, ICI encourages and supports its executives to play an
active role in planning for their individual retirement needs.
It is ICI’s policy to match retirement benefit liabilities where possible
by external funds rather than by Group assets.
Details of the accrued pension to which each Director is entitled on
leaving service, and the transfer value of those accrued pensions
are shown in the table below. A transfer value is the present value
lump sum equivalent of the accrued pension and is calculated in
accordance with the Guidance Note published by the Institute and
Faculty of Actuaries (GN 11).

(2) The accrued annual pension at the end of the year, payable at normal retirement age (or date of retirement).
(3) The changes in transfer values over the year reflect any changes in pensionable pay and the service of each Director. They also take into
account changes in the actuarial assumptions, particularly those related to equity and bond returns. As a result, changes in transfer values
may be positive or negative, depending on investment conditions.
(4) Dr B R O’Neill participates in the ICI Pension Fund in respect of salary up to the Inland Revenue earnings cap (currently £97,200 for 2002/3).
He also belongs to a funded unapproved retirement benefits scheme, in respect of salary above this cap, for which the contributions are
subject to income tax and are set out above.
(5) Mr P J Drechsler participates in the ICI Pension Fund.
(6) Dr J D G McAdam and Mr T A Scott participate in the ICI Specialty Chemicals Pension Fund. Pensionable salary under this plan includes
annual bonus, subject to a maximum of 20% of base salary for Dr J D G McAdam and 15% of base salary for Mr T A Scott.
(7) Mr W H Powell participates in the National Starch and Chemical Company Pension Plan for Salaried Employees and the Supplementary
Retirement and Savings Plan of National Starch and Chemical Company. Under these Plans, pension is based on average pay, including
annual bonus, during the previous five years, during which time Mr Powell was promoted to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of National
Starch and Chemical Company. He also participates in two defined contribution plans, for which the employer’s contributions are set out
above.
(8) No Director received an enhancement to his contractual pension benefit during the year.
(9) The Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority are different from the Directors’ Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 and require the
following disclosures for defined benefit plans which are calculated on an alternative basis to those disclosed in the table above.

All Directors took up their full entitlement to new ICI Ordinary Shares under the Rights Issue. Consistent with the policy on personal
shareholding, no Directors have disposed of shares acquired via Company share-based plans except to meet consequent income tax
liabilities. 
In addition to the interests in the table above, on 10 February 2003 Mr P J Drechsler and Dr J D G McAdam became entitled to Ordinary
Shares awarded to them under the Performance Growth Plan (PGP), as detailed in the table of “Shares Vested” on page 41. They also have
conditional interests in PGP awards made on 5 March 2001 and 28 March 2002, see page 40.
All Directors’ shares are held beneficially.
(1) Lord Trotman’s interest in shares at 1 January 2002 comprised 500 Ordinary Shares and 11,500 ADRs (representing 46,000 Ordinary
Shares). At 31 December 2002 his interest comprised 818 Ordinary Shares and 18,818 ADRs (representing 75,272 Ordinary Shares).
(2) Mr P J Drechsler’s interest in shares at 1 January 2002 comprised 49,134 Ordinary Shares and 2,602 ADRs (representing 10,408
Ordinary Shares). At 31 December 2002 his interest comprised 86,069 Ordinary Shares and 4,257 ADRs (representing 17,028
Ordinary Shares).
(3) Mr W H Powell’s interest in shares at 1 January 2002 comprised 10 Ordinary Shares and 11,427.5 ADRs (representing 45,710 Ordinary
Shares). At 31 December 2002 his interest comprised 16 Ordinary Shares and 18,999 ADRs (representing 75,996 Ordinary Shares).
(4) Mr J T Gorman’s interest in shares at 1 January 2002 comprised 2,000 ADRs (representing 8,000 Ordinary Shares). At 31 December
2002 his interest comprised 3,272 ADRs (representing 13,088 Ordinary Shares).
(5) These Directors are potential beneficiaries of the Company’s employee benefit trust, which is used to satisfy awards under the senior
staff share plans, and are therefore treated as interested in the 9.3m (2001 5.6m) shares (including ADRs expressed as Ordinary Share
equivalents) held by the trustee.
(6) Certain Executive Directors have a contingent interest in matched shares under the Bonus Conversion Plan provided in respect of the
1999 bonuses, which was operated for the last time in respect of that financial year – as described in note 3 to the Directors’
emoluments table on page 39. A bonus recipient could elect to have shares purchased at market value with part or all of his bonus after
tax. After three years, shares purchased in the plan are released and matched by an equal number of shares by the Company, provided
the individual remains employed by ICI.
During the period 1 January 2003 to 10 February 2003 there were no changes in the interests of Directors in shares. remuneration report

Directors’ service agreements and letters of engagement
(not subject to audit)
It is the Remuneration Committee’s policy that Executive Directors are employed on contracts subject to no more than 12 months’ notice, in
accordance with current corporate governance best practice. The Remuneration Committee strongly endorses the principle of mitigation of
damages on early termination of a service agreement.
The dates of current Executive Directors’ service agreements, the dates on which their appointments took effect and the current expiry dates of
their agreements are as follows:
Executive Directors Date of service agreement Effective date Expiry date
Dr B R O’Neill 01.98 11.05.98 Terminable on 12 months’ notice
P J Drechsler 10.03.99 01.03.99 Terminable on 12 months’ notice
Dr J D G McAdam 10.03.99 01.03.99 Terminable on 12 months’ notice
W H Powell 17.02.00 02.02.00 Terminable on 12 months’ notice (note 1)
T A Scott 11.05.01 23.05.01 Terminable on 12 months’ notice (note 2)
(1) The appointment as an Executive Director of ICI, which is non-remunerative, is terminable by either party giving not less than 12 months’
notice in writing. Mr W H Powell is separately employed by National Starch and Chemical Company as Chairman and Chief Executive. Mr
Powell’s employment with National Starch and Chemical Company is terminable on 12 months’ notice.
(2) In addition to the normal notice provisions, the Company may also terminate Mr T A Scott’s service agreement at any time with immediate
effect on payment in lieu of notice equivalent to 12 months’ gross basic salary together with the gross value of the other benefits Mr Scott
is entitled to receive under his service agreement (see the table of Directors’ emoluments on page 39 for a description of these benefits) as 
at the date of termination.
There are no express provisions for compensation payable upon early termination of an Executive Director’s contract as at the date of termination
other than as detailed above.
The dates of the Chairman’s and current Non-Executive Directors’ letters of engagement, the date on which their appointment took effect and the
current expiry dates are as follows:
Chairman and Non-Executive Directors Date of letter
of engagement Effective date Expiry date
Lord Trotman 31.01.02 01.01.02 Terminable on 12 months’ notice (note 1)
A Baan 24.07.01 25.06.01 (note 2)
Lord Butler 12.06.98 01.07.98 (note 2)
J T Gorman 25.10.00 20.09.00 (note 2)
R N Haythornthwaite 22.02.01 20.02.01 (note 2)
(1) Lord Trotman was appointed as a Non-Executive Director on 1 July 1997 and, by an agreement dated 31 January 2002 between ICI and
Lord Trotman, as Non-Executive Chairman with effect from 1 January 2002.
(2) Non-Executive Directors are appointed for an unspecified term pursuant to letters of engagement. They stand for re-election at the first
Annual General Meeting following appointment and stand for re-election by rotation under Article 96 of the Articles of Association of the
Company. It is the normal practice of the Company for Non-Executive Directors to serve two three-year terms. Non-Executive Directors,
apart from Lord Trotman, have no right to compensation on the early termination of their appointment.

directors’ responsibilities
Directors’ responsibilities in respect of the financial statements
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for
each financial year which give a true and fair view of the state of affairs
of the Company and Group and of the profit or loss for that period. 
In preparing those financial statements, the Directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them
consistently;
• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
• state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed,
subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the
financial statements; and
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless
it is inappropriate to presume that the Group will continue in
business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records
which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial
position of the Company and Group and to enable them to ensure that
the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985.
The Directors have a general responsibility for taking such steps as
are reasonably open to them for safeguarding the assets of the Group
and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities. independent auditors’ report

ICI ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS AND FORM 20-F 2002
Independent Auditors’ report to the Members of Imperial Chemical
Industries PLC 
We have audited the financial statements on pages 50 to 115. We have
also audited the information in the Directors’ remuneration report that is
described as having been audited.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in
accordance with section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our audit work
has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members
those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and
for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not
accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and
the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or
for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and Auditors
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report, the
Directors’ remuneration report and Form 20-F. As described on page
47, this includes responsibility for preparing the financial statements
in accordance with applicable United Kingdom law and accounting
standards; the Directors have also presented additional information
under United States requirements. Our responsibilities, as independent
auditors, are established in the United Kingdom by statute, the
Auditing Practices Board, the Listing Rules of the Financial Services
Authority, and by our profession’s ethical guidance.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements
give a true and fair view and whether the financial statements and the
part of the Directors’ remuneration report to be audited have been
properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.
We also report to you if, in our opinion, the Directors’ report is not
consistent with the financial statements, if the Company has not kept
proper accounting records, if we have not received all the information
and explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified
by law or the Listing Rules regarding Directors’ remuneration and
transactions with the Group is not disclosed.
We review whether the statement on pages 35 to 36 reflects the
Company’s compliance with the seven provisions of the Combined
Code specified for our review by the Listing Rules, and we report if
it does not. We are not required to consider whether the Board’s
statements on internal control cover all risks and controls, or form
an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s corporate governance
procedures or its risk and control procedures.
We read the other information contained in the Annual Report,
including the corporate governance statement and the unaudited
part of the Directors’ remuneration report, and consider whether
it is consistent with the audited financial statements. We consider
the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent
misstatements or material inconsistencies with the financial
statements.
Basis of audit opinion 
We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards issued
by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on
a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements and the part of the Directors’ remuneration
report to be audited. It also includes an assessment of the significant
estimates and judgements made by the Directors in the preparation of
the financial statements, and of whether the accounting policies are
appropriate to the Group’s circumstances, consistently applied and
adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the
information and explanations which we considered necessary in
order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable
assurance that the financial statements and the part of the Directors’
remuneration report to be audited are free from material misstatement,
whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our
opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of
information in the financial statements and the part of the Directors’
remuneration report to be audited.
Opinion
In our opinion
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of
affairs of the Company and the Group as at 31 December 2002 and
of the profit of the Group for the year then ended; and
• the financial statements and the part of the Directors’ remuneration
report to be audited have been properly prepared in accordance
with the Companies Act 1985.

ICI ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS AND FORM 20-F 2002
As used in the financial statements and related notes, the term
‘Company’ refers to Imperial Chemical Industries PLC; the terms ‘ICI’
and ‘Group’ refer to the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries but
not to associates.
The financial statements are prepared under the historical cost
convention and in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and
applicable accounting standards. Accounting policies conform with
UK Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“UK GAAP”).
The following paragraphs describe the main accounting policies.
The accounting policies of some overseas subsidiaries do not conform
with UK Accounting Standards and, where appropriate, adjustments
are made on consolidation in order to present the Group financial
statements on a consistent basis. Note 42 describes the significant
differences between UK GAAP and US Generally Accepted Accounting
Principals (“US GAAP”) and presents a reconciliation of net income
and shareholders’ equity from UK GAAP to US GAAP as a result of
each difference.
Turnover
Turnover excludes Intra-Group sales and value added taxes. Revenue
is recognised at the point at which title passes.
Depreciation
The Group’s policy is to write-off the book value of each tangible fixed
asset excluding land to its residual value evenly over its estimated
remaining life. Reviews are made annually of the estimated remaining
lives of individual productive assets, taking account of commercial and
technological obsolescence as well as normal wear and tear. Under
this policy it becomes impracticable to calculate average asset lives
exactly; however, the total lives approximate to 35 years for buildings
and 14 years for plant and equipment. Depreciation of assets
qualifying for grants is calculated on their full cost. No depreciation
has been provided on land.
Pension costs
The pension costs relating to Group retirement plans are assessed
in accordance with the advice of independent qualified actuaries.
The amounts so determined include the regular cost of providing the
benefits under the plans which should be a level percentage of current
and expected future earnings of the employees covered under the
plans. Variations from the regular pension cost are spread on a
systematic basis over the estimated average remaining service lives
of current employees in the plans.
Research and development
Research and development expenditure is charged to profit in the year
in which it is incurred.
Exceptional items
Exceptional items are material items which derive from events or
transactions that fall within the ordinary activities of the Group and
which individually or, if of a similar type, in aggregate, need to be
disclosed by virtue of their size or incidence if the financial statements
are to give a true and fair view.
Foreign currencies 
Profit and loss accounts in foreign currencies are translated into
sterling at average rates for the relevant accounting periods. Assets
and liabilities are translated at exchange rates ruling at the date of the
Group balance sheet. Exchange differences on short-term foreign
currency borrowings and deposits are included with net interest
payable. Exchange differences on all other balances, except relevant
foreign currency loans, are taken to trading profit. In the Group
accounts, exchange differences arising on consolidation of the net
investments in overseas subsidiary undertakings and associates are
taken to reserves, as are differences arising on equity investments
denominated in foreign currencies in the Company accounts.
Differences on relevant foreign currency loans are taken to reserves
and offset against the differences on net investments in both Group
and Company accounts.
Financial derivatives
Hedge accounting
The Group uses various derivative financial instruments to reduce
exposure to foreign exchange risks. These include currency swaps,
forward currency contracts and currency options. The Group also
uses interest rate swaps, forward rate agreements and interest rate
caps derivatives to adjust interest rate exposures. The Group
considers its derivative financial instruments to be “hedges” (i.e. an
offset of foreign exchange and interest rate risks) when certain criteria
are met. Under hedge accounting for currency options, the Group
defers the instrument’s impact on profit until it recognises the
underlying hedged item in profit. Other material instruments do not
involve deferral since the profit impact they offset occurs during the
terms of the contracts.
Foreign currency derivative instruments:
The Group’s criteria to qualify for hedge accounting are:
• The instrument must be related to a foreign currency asset or liability
that is probable and whose characteristics have been identified;
• It must involve the same currency as the hedged item; and
• It must reduce the risk of foreign currency exchange movements on
the Group’s operations.
Interest rate derivative instruments:
The Group’s criteria to qualify for hedge accounting are:
• The instrument must be related to an asset or a liability; and
• It must change the character of the interest rate by converting a
variable rate to a fixed rate or vice versa.
Derivative financial instruments reported in the financial statements:
• The unamortised premium paid on purchased currency options is
included in debtors in the balance sheet.
Cash flows related to foreign currency derivative transactions are
reported along with related transactions in net cash inflow from
operating activities or returns on investments and servicing of finance,
as appropriate, in the Statement of Group cash flow.
Currency swaps
Principal amounts are revalued at exchange rates ruling at the date of
the Group balance sheet and included in the sterling value of loans. In
accordance with SSAP20 and FRS 3 exchange gains/losses are
included in the Statement of Group total recognised gains and losses
along with similar movements in the values of the investments being
hedged.
Forward currency contracts
Those forward currency contracts hedging transaction exposures
(purchases and sales held in the books of account) are revalued to
balance sheet rates with net unrealised gains/losses being shown
as debtors/creditors. Both realised gains and losses on
purchases/sales and unrealised gains/losses on forward contracts are
recognised in trading profit. 51
Financial derivatives (continued)
Forward currency contracts (continued)
Those contracts used to change the currency mix of net debt are
revalued to balance sheet rates with net unrealised gains/losses being
shown as part of the debt they are hedging. The difference between
spot and forward rate for these contracts is recognised as part of net
interest payable over the period of the contract. Realised and
unrealised exchange gains/losses are shown in the financial
statements in the same place as the underlying borrowing/deposit.
Currency options
Option premia are recognised at their historic cost in the Group
balance sheet as ‘other debtors’. At maturity, the option premia net of
any realised gains on exercise, are taken to the financial statements as
trading profit.
Interest rate swaps and forward rate agreements
Interest payments/receipts are accrued with net interest payable. They
are not revalued to fair value or shown on the Group balance sheet at
period end. If they are terminated early, the gain or loss is spread over
the remaining maturity of the original instrument.
Interest rate caps
The option premia are recognised on the Group balance sheet as
‘other debtors’. The option premia, net of any realised gains on
individual caplets, are taken to net interest payable and spread evenly
over the lifetime of the cap.
Associates
Associates are undertakings in which the Group holds a long-term
interest and over which it actually exercises significant influence. The
Group’s share of the profits less losses from associates are included in
the Group profit and loss account on the equity accounting basis. The
holding value of associates in the Group balance sheet is calculated
by reference to the Group’s equity in the net assets of such
undertakings, as shown by the most recent accounts available.
Interests in joint arrangements that are not entities are included
proportionately in the accounts of the investing entity.
Investments
Investments are held at cost less provisions for impairment.
Taxation
Full provision for deferred tax is made for timing differences between
the recognition of gains and losses in the consolidated financial
statements and their recognition in the tax computation, using current
tax rates except as otherwise required by FRS 19. The Group does not
discount these balances. No deferred tax is provided in respect of
any future remittance of earnings of foreign subsidiaries or associates
where no commitment has been made to remit such earnings.
Taxation on exchange differences on relevant foreign currency loans
used to finance net investments in subsidiary undertakings and
associates is taken to reserves to be consistent with the treatment of
the underlying exchange differences on the loans and net investments.
Stock valuation
Finished goods are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value,
raw materials and other stocks at the lower of cost and net realisable
value; the first in, first out or an average method of valuation is used.
In determining cost for stock valuation purposes, depreciation is
included but selling expenses and certain overhead expenses are
excluded.
Environmental liabilities
The Group is exposed to environmental liabilities relating primarily
to its past operations, principally in respect of soil and groundwater
remediation costs. Provisions for these costs are made when
expenditure on remedial work is probable and the cost can be
estimated within a reasonable range of possible outcomes.
Goodwill
On the acquisition of a business, fair values are attributed to the
net assets acquired. Goodwill arises where the fair value of the
consideration given for a business exceeds the fair value of such
net assets. For purchased goodwill arising on acquisitions after
31 December 1997 goodwill is capitalised and amortised through the
profit and loss account over a period of 20 years unless the Directors
consider it has a materially different useful life, either on acquisition
or subsequently, if a shorter life is indicated. For goodwill arising on
acquisitions prior to 31 December 1997 purchased goodwill was
charged directly to reserves in the year of acquisition. On subsequent
disposal or termination of a previously acquired business, the profit or
loss recognised on disposal or termination is calculated after charging
the amount of any related goodwill previously taken to reserves.
Employee Share Ownership Plan “ESOP”
The financial statements of the Group include the assets and related
liabilities of Imperial Chemical Industries PLC Employee Benefits Trust 
and Impkemix Trustees Limited, a subsidiary company of the Group,
which acts as trustee for the Group’s employee share ownership plan.
The shares held by the ESOP are stated at the lower of cost and
estimated net realisable value. group profit and loss account

ICI ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS AND FORM 20-F 2002
1 Basis of presentation of financial information
New UK Accounting Standards
UK Accounting Standards which have been adopted, in whole or in part, for the first time in these financial statements are as follows:
FRS No. 17 Retirement benefits
This Standard sets out revised requirements for the accounting and disclosure of an employer’s retirement benefit obligations and related funding.
Increasing levels of disclosure of amounts measured in accordance with the Standard, have been required over the years 2001 and 2002 with
recognition in the primary statements for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2005 following suspension by the Accounting
Standards Board. The Group has followed the transitional requirements of the Standard. In 2001 information on financial assumptions to calculate
the projected benefit obligations of Group schemes and details of scheme assets, expected rates of return, liabilities and net (liabilities) assets
were disclosed in note 37. In 2002 further analysis covering the amounts to be charged in future years to trading profit, other finance income and
the Statement of Group total recognised gains and losses is provided in note 37. Upon full adoption in 2005, comparative financial statement
information will be restated. The requirements of the Standard will have no impact on cash flows.
FRS No. 19 Deferred Tax
This Standard requires full provision to be made for deferred tax assets and liabilities arising from timing differences between the recognition of
gains and losses in the financial statements and their recognition in a tax computation except as otherwise required by FRS No. 19. It also
requires deferred tax assets to be recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more likely than not that they will be recovered. The Standard
allows the optional discounting of all or none of the deferred tax assets or liabilities and the Group has elected not to discount. Prior to the
adoption of FRS No. 19, deferred tax was only provided on a partial provision basis. The standard is implemented in these financial statements
and all primary statements and notes relating to the accounts have been restated.
Compliance with FRS No. 19 has increased the 2001 deferred tax provision by £81m (2000 £33m). The tax charge on profit before goodwill
amortisation and exceptional items has increased by £27m in 2001 (2000 £34m) resulting in a restated effective tax rate for 2001 of 28.9% (2000
31.6%), compared with 22.2% (2000 24.0%) originally reported. The net profit for 2001 decreased by £41m (2000 increase £21m). The estimated
impact on the current year’s profit before goodwill amortisation and exceptional items if FRS No. 19 had not been adopted would be to reduce the
underlying effective tax rate from 29% to approximately 22%. The impact on profit before tax has not been quantified as it is impractical to do so.
The new standard has no impact on cash flows.
Both FRS No. 17 and FRS No. 19 were published in 2000 since which time no new UK Standards have been published.
Continuing and Discontinued Operations and Classes of Business
For UK reporting purposes, the results in these accounts differentiate between the Group’s continuing and discontinued operations. As defined
in FRS No. 3 - Reporting Financial Performance, discontinued operations are material, clearly separate operations which have been sold or
permanently terminated either during the financial year or during the subsequent period up to the date of approval of the financial statements.
All other operations are classified as continuing operations.
Discontinued operations, in these financial statements, comprise:
Chlor-Chemicals, Klea and Crosfield businesses
Methanol business
50% equity shareholding in Phillips-Imperial Petroleum Ltd
Where businesses have been reclassified as discontinued operations, comparative segmental data has been restated in all cases. Net interest
payable and tax on profit (loss) on ordinary activities have been allocated to discontinued operations to reflect the legal entity incidence of these
items within the business divested.
Non co-terminous year ends
Owing to local conditions and to avoid undue delay in the presentation of the Group accounts, three subsidiaries made up their accounts to dates
earlier than 31 December, but not earlier than 30 September; additionally seven subsidiaries made up their accounts prior to 30 September but
interim accounts to 31 December were drawn up for consolidation purposes.
Cash
In the statement of Group cash flow and related notes “cash” includes cash at bank, deposits repayable on demand and overdrafts; deposits are
repayable on demand if they are, in practice, available within 24 hours without penalty.
Estimates
The preparation of the Consolidated financial statements in conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles requires management to
make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 57
2 Directors’ and Officers’ remuneration and interests
Information covering Directors’ remuneration, interests in shares, debentures, share options and pension benefits is included in the Remuneration
report on pages 38 to 46.
The aggregate remuneration paid to or accrued for all Directors and Officers of the Company for services in all capacities during the year ended
31 December 2002 was £6.0m (2001 £4.8m; 2000 £6.4m); Directors £4.0m (2001 £3.2m; 2000 £3.9m); Officers £2.0m (2001 £1.6m; 2000
£2.5m). The aggregate amount set aside or accrued to provide pension, retirement and similar benefits for Directors and Officers of the Company
during the year ended 31 December 2002 was £1.0m (2001 £1.0m; 2000 £0.8m); Directors £0.7m (2001 £0.7m; 2000 £0.6m); Officers £0.3m
(2001 £0.3m; 2000 £0.2m). At 10 February 2003 shares held by and options granted to Directors and Officers to subscribe for Ordinary Shares in

Under UK GAAP, exceptional items are material items which derive from events or transactions that fall within the ordinary activities of the Group
and which individually or, if of a similar type, in aggregate, need to be disclosed by virtue of their size or incidence if the financial statements are to
give a true and fair view. Under US GAAP, exceptional items would be included in operating income, unless they relate to discontinued operations. 59
4 Segment information

UK and overseas taxation has been provided on the profits (losses) earned for the periods covered by the Group accounts. UK corporation tax has
been provided at the rate of 30% (2001 30%; 2000 30%).
The exceptional tax charge (credit) in 2002, 2001 and 2000 are in respect of disposal and restructuring programmes, as discussed in note 3.

The main factors affecting the total tax charge in future periods will be any changes to the corporation tax rates in force in the countries in which
the Group operates and the mix of profits between those territories.
No taxes have been provided for liabilities which may arise on the distribution of unremitted earnings of subsidiaries and associates, except where
distributions of such profits are planned. Cumulative unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries and associates totalled approximately £996m
at 31 December 2002 (2001 £887m; 2000 £828m). The remittance of these amounts would incur tax at substantially lower than statutory rates
after giving effect to foreign tax credits. ICI ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS AND FORM 20-F 2002

Deferred tax assets of £93m (2001 £89m) at 31 December 2002 have not been recognised due to the degree of uncertainty over the utilisation
of the underlying tax losses and deductions in certain tax jurisdictions. Deferred tax assets on operating losses of £140m (2001 £70m) less a
valuation allowance of £73m (2001 £58m) are carried forward and available to reduce future taxable income of certain subsidiaries in a number of
foreign jurisdictions. £3m of these deferred tax assets on operating losses, net of valuation allowance, have expiration dates through to 2005 and
£64m can be carried forward indefinitely.
The deferred tax adjustments to net income and net equity to conform with US GAAP are disclosed in note 42.

There are no options, warrants or rights outstanding in respect of unissued shares except for the share option scheme for employees
(note 23). Earnings per £1 Ordinary Share before exceptional items have been calculated to show the impact of exceptional items as these
can have a distorting effect on earnings and therefore warrant separate consideration.
On 4 February 2002, the Company announced a Rights Issue and, following approval of the required resolutions at the subsequent
Extraordinary General Meeting, 463m new Ordinary Shares were issued at 180p per share on the basis of 7 new Ordinary Shares for every
11 existing Ordinary Shares.
The actual cum rights price on 25 February 2002, the last day of quotation cum rights, was 319p per share and the theoretical ex rights price 
for an ordinary share was therefore 265p per share. The comparative earnings per share are shown after applying the factor 265/319 to the
published figures for 2001 and 2000, after adjusting for deferred tax (see note 1) in order to adjust for the bonus issue within the Rights Issue.

Substantially all of the Group’s goodwill arose on the purchase of Acheson Industries Inc. and of the European Home Improvement business of
Williams Plc in 1998. The Directors estimate that the useful economic life of this goodwill is at least 20 years and it is amortised over 20 years 
in accordance with FRS 10.

£125m (2001 £nil) in relation to the sale of ICI’s interests in Huntsman International Holdings LLC (see below).
The management of current asset investments is discussed in note 38.
Huntsman International Holdings LLC
Under the terms of a Sale and Purchase Agreement dated 14 June 2002, ICI agreed to sell its interests in Huntsman International Holdings
LLC (“HIH”), which comprise (1) a holding of subordinated loan notes in HIH (“HIH Notes”) and (2) ICI Alta Inc., the wholly owned subsidiary of
the Company which holds ICI’s 30% equity interest in HIH and ICI’s rights under the option Agreement with Huntsman Specialty Chemicals
Corporation (“HSCC”) dated 2 November 2000 (the “Option Agreement”), as amended 20 December 2001, to CSFB Global Opportunities
Partners, L.P. (now Matlin Patterson Global Opportunities Partners L.P.). The aggregate purchase price is $440m (£283m). Of this amount, $160m
(£109m) has been received. The remaining $280m (£174m) (with an amount equivalent to interest from 15 May 2002 to the date of payment)
will be payable on 15 May 2003, with the purchaser having the option to pay all or part of the amount due prior to 15 May 2003 by means of
instalment payments. As security for a portion of the outstanding purchase price, the HIH Notes have been pledged back to ICI, otherwise the
agreement is effectively without recourse to Matlin Patterson Global Opportunities Partners L.P. This pledge will be released when ICI has received
in aggregate at least $260m of the total purchase price. When ICI has received at least $350m of the total purchase price, ICI will release ICI Alta’s
existing pledge over 21% of the 30% equity interest in HIH pledged to ICI by HSCC and reduce the amount due from HSCC to ICI Alta under the
Option Agreement by approximately 50%. If no installment payments are made, the Option Agreement will remain in place on its existing terms.
The sale of ICI Alta (and the indirect transfer of ICI’s 30% equity interest in HIH) is permitted by the Option Agreement; however, due to separate
constraints on members of HIH transferring any interests in HIH to third parties, the purchaser may be obligated to obtain the written consent of
HSCC prior to transfer of ownership of ICI Alta.
Ownership of the HIH Notes has been transferred, subject to the pledge arrangements above, and ownership of ICI Alta will be transferred when
the full purchase price has been received. The HIH Notes have been accounted for as sold, with some of the purchase price outstanding, and
the equity interest in HIH accounted for as an investment rather than an associate undertaking. As the transaction has not been completed the
estimated net overall gain of approximately £55m has not been recognised. The outstanding purchase price on the HIH Notes of $100m (£62m)
and the loss on the HIH Notes of approximately £40m, together with the equity interest in HIH (£23m) are held in the Group balance sheet as
current asset investments until such time as the total purchase price of $440m (£283m) has been received in full. At that date, the overall profit on
the transaction will be recorded. Although not expected at this time, a failure by Matlin Patterson Global Opportunities Partners L.P. to complete
all aspects of the Sale and Purchase Agreement, would require the Group to review and amend the above accounting treatment in the light of the
circumstances then prevailing.
In general, HIH is required to make certain distributions in respect of taxes payable by its members (“tax distributions”), and may make other
distributions upon approval of a majority of its board of directors, subject to two restrictions. First, under Delaware law, HIH may not make a
distribution to its members if, after such distribution, HIH’s liabilities would exceed the fair value of its assets. Second, with certain exceptions
(including for tax distributions), the terms of HIH’s outstanding indebtedness (which mature in 2009) generally prohibit HIH from making any
distributions or payments on or with respect to HIH’s equity while such indebtedness is outstanding.

Disposal provisions
ICI commenced reshaping its portfolio of businesses in 1997 consistent with plans to focus its resources on Paints and Specialty Products. In pursuit 
of this strategy, the Group announced that it intended to divest most of its Industrial Chemicals businesses.
Prior to 2000
(i)  Polyurethanes, Tioxide and selected Petrochemicals businesses
In June 1999 the Group sold its Polyurethanes, Tioxide and selected Petrochemicals businesses (aromatics, hydrogen and North Tees Logistics
businesses, together with the Olefines supply business) to Huntsman International Holdings LLC. Total provisions charged were £312m mainly in
respect of termination costs (£38m) for 360 employees, pension costs relating to employees transferring to the purchaser (£35m), transaction costs
(£42m), separation costs (£23m), IT related costs (£26m), site clearance costs (£13m), asset write-downs (£13m) and long-term residual costs (£91m).
During 2002, revisions were made to the estimated costs of this disposal resulting in £2m being released as an exceptional profit, and £9m being
created in relation to the rehabilitation of a site in Tasmania. At 31 December 2002, £114m remained to be spent principally relating to the cost of
long-term employee benefits (£13m), site clearance costs (£6m), IT related costs (£4m), transaction and related legal costs (£3m), and long-term
residual costs (£65m). With the exception of the long-term residual costs and long-term employee benefits, the majority of the provisions are expected
to be substantially utilised by the end of 2003.
(ii)  Other disposals
Other significant disposals prior to 2000, where provisions remain, include the Polyester polymer intermediates business excluding operations in
Pakistan, the Explosives operations in Canada, Latin America and Europe and the explosives distribution business in the USA, the Polyester film
business, the Forest Products business based in Canada, the UK based Fertilizer business, the Teesside Utilities and Services business, the Acrylics
business, the Automotive refinish business, the Fluoropolymer business, Ethylene Oxide and the Methylamines and derivatives business.
Disposal provisions of £830m were made for these disposals. During 2002, revisions were made to the estimated costs of these disposals resulting in
£9m being released as an exceptional profit. At 31 December 2002, provisions remaining to be spent were £141m, including termination costs (£24m)
where some 101 jobs are still to be terminated, environmental and site clearance costs (£31m), separation costs (£16m) and long-term residual costs
(£52m). With the exception of the environmental, site clearance and long-term residual costs, the majority of the provisions are expected to be utilised
by the end of 2003. 84
22 Disposal and restructuring provisions (continued)
2000
(i)  Chlor-Chemicals, Klea and Crosfield businesses
The Group announced the divestment of its Chlor-Chemicals, Klea and Crosfield businesses in December 2000 and completed the divestment
in January 2001 (see note 40). The total pre-tax loss for the divestment was £503m, recorded as a fixed asset write-down of £133m, goodwill 
of £41m charged as a loss and £329m as a provision for the anticipated loss. Included in the calculation of the anticipated loss were disposal
provisions of £305m. These provisions include long-term residual costs (£121m), pension transfer costs (£55m), termination costs (£39m) relating
to 230 employees, transition and separation costs (£33m), transaction costs (£17m) and environmental costs (£15m). During 2002, revisions were
made to the estimated costs of this disposal resulting in £6m being released as an exceptional profit. At 31 December 2002, £150m remained to be
spent principally on transition and separation costs (£4m), pension costs relating to employees transferring to the purchaser (£8m), termination
costs (£8m) relating to some 37 employees, and long-term residual costs (£129m). With the exception of the long-term residual costs these
provisions are expected to be substantially utilised by the end of 2003.
(ii)  Other disposals
The Group also divested some smaller businesses including its 50% interest in Phillips-Imperial Petroleum and its Methanol business. Provisions
of £37m were raised for these disposals including termination costs (£9m) for 73 employees. At 31 December 2002, £10m remained to be spent
principally on long-term costs (£6m). The provisions are expected to be substantially utilised by the end of 2003.
2001
The principal disposal in 2001 was the Group’s Eutech engineering consultancy subsidiary. During 2002, revisions were made to the estimated
costs of this disposal resulting in £2m being released as an exceptional profit. The remainder of the provisions were utilised in 2002.
2002
(i)  Synetix
The Group completed the sale of its catalyst business, Synetix, outside India in November 2002 and in India in December 2002. Provisions charged
were £46m, mainly in respect of transition and separation costs (£19m), pension costs relating to employees transferring to the purchaser (£14m),
termination costs (£2m) relating to 31 employees, transaction costs (£7m) and environmental costs (£2m). At 31 December 2002, £30m remained to
be spent including separation costs (£6m) and pension costs transferring to the purchaser (£6m). The majority of the provisions are expected to be
utilised over the next two years.
(ii)  Other disposals
The Group also divested some smaller businesses including the 51% owned pharmaceutical business of ICI India, its Security Systems business
and the UK Nitrocellulose and Energetic Technologies businesses. In addition, IFI, the Irish Fertilizer business in which the Group has a 49% interest
ceased trading. Provisions of £37m were raised for these transactions, mainly in respect of separation costs (£14m), costs relating to employees
transferring to the purchaser (£13m) and transaction related costs (£5m). At 31 December 2002, £13m remained to be spent including termination
costs (£1m) for 16 people, separation costs (£4m), and transaction related costs (£4m). The majority of the provisions are expected to be utilised
over the next two years.

Restructuring provisions
Prior to 2000
In 1999 the Group undertook a series of restructuring actions across its portfolio, affecting the following segments: National Starch, Quest, Paints,
Discontinued businesses, and reorganisation of the Corporate Centre.
The total exceptional provisions before tax of £172m for these restructuring programmes was charged against 1999 profits. The total included
£80m related to termination of 1,030 employees, £31m to asset write-downs and £61m for other costs. During 2002, revisions were made to these
provisions resulting in £3m being released as an exceptional profit. At 31 December 2002, £22m of these provisions remained to be spent, including
£9m relating to the termination of some 72 employees. The provisions are expected to be substantially utilised by the end of 2003.
2000
The £14m restructuring charge in 2000 relates to additional restructuring of the Group’s Corporate Centre announced in 1999. At 31 December
2002, £1m of these provisions remained unspent. These provisions are expected to be utilised in 2003.
2001
In 2001 the Group undertook a series of restructuring actions in the following business segments:
(i) National Starch – staff reductions and the closure and sale of several sites in the USA, Europe and Asia Pacific. Most of the restructuring relates
to the Specialty Polymers and Adhesives business groups in North America and Europe.
(ii) Quest – upgrading of business systems, processes and capabilities and the rationalisation of manufacturing sites, together with the streamlining
of management and support services.
(iii) Performance Specialties – programmes to improve cost effectiveness in Uniqema Europe including the harmonisation of business processes 
and systems.
(iv) Paints – restructuring the North American decorative business including the closure of a manufacturing facility and the closure of loss 
making stores.
The total exceptional charge before tax for these restructuring programmes was £143m, which has been charged against 2001 profits. The total
included £78m relating to the termination of some 1,300 employees, £17m for asset write-downs and £48m for other costs. During 2002, revisions
were made to the estimated costs of this programme resulting in £3m being charged as an exceptional loss. At 31 December 2002, £41m
remained to be spent including £33m relating to termination of some 340 employees. The majority of the provisions are expected to be substantially
utilised by the end of 2003. 86

Rights Issue
ICI’s rights issue closed on 20 March 2002. A total of 463m Ordinary Shares of £1 each were issued at 180p per share in a 7 for 11 rights issue. Of the
total £807m raised net of £27m expenses, £463m was credited to share capital and £344m to the share premium account.
Authorised share capital
Authorised share capital was increased at the Extraordinary General Meeting on 25 February 2002.
Employees’ share option schemes and other share based plans
ICI granted share options and other market based units to Executive Directors, senior executives and certain key employees under four main plans: 
the Performance Growth Plan and other share based plans, the Share Option Scheme (Senior Staff Scheme), the Bonus Conversion Plan (which
operated for the last time in respect of the 1999 performance year) and the Stock Appreciation Rights Plan (SARP). These schemes are described 
on pages 39 to 43. The Company also operates a savings related share option scheme (UK – Sharesave) for all UK employees meeting minimum
service requirements. Following ICI’s rights issue in 2002, the numbers of shares under option as at 1 January 2002 and their exercise prices were
adjusted for the impact of the Rights Issue using adjusted factors determined by the Remuneration Committee of the Board. The option prices under
these schemes were reduced by a factor of approximately 0.830 and the number of shares under option was increased, by a factor of approximately
1.204 calculated using the standard theoretical ex-rights price (“TERP”) adjustment to preserve the aggregate exercise price. The narrative and tables
below set out the adjusted amounts.
At 31 December 2002 the maximum number of ordinary share equivalents which could be awarded under the Performance Growth Plan was
2,471,791 (2001 1,496,648). The maximum number awarded in 2002 was 1,151,150, with lapses during the year of 176,007 (2001 50,382). 1,072,385
(2001 650,235) would be awarded for achieving median TSR/on target Economic Profit performance.
The prices at which options are granted under the Senior Staff Scheme must not be less than the nominal value of an Ordinary Share nor less than the
average of the middle market quotation of an ICI Ordinary Share on the London Stock Exchange on the five business days immediately preceding the
date on which the option is offered. Options under this scheme expire after 10 years. Grants under the SARP are made on the same terms as the
Senior Staff Scheme. On exercise the participant receives the gain payable in American Depositary Shares – ADSs (for grants prior to 1998 paid two-
thirds in cash and one-third in ADSs).
At 31 December 2002 there were 572,885 shares outstanding representing the matched shares under the Bonus Conversion Plan to be delivered as
the Company’s Ordinary Shares or in the form of ADSs.
The Group has acquired, or is committed to acquire under forward contracts, 36.2m shares or ADSs to hedge its obligations under the Senior Staff
Scheme, the Performance Growth Plan, the Stock Appreciation Rights Plan and the Bonus Conversion Plan. 9.8m shares have been purchased in the
market by a trust (see note 14). In addition, the trust has entered into forward commitments to purchase 26.4m shares at a weighted average cost of
£4.61 per share (total commitment £122m) in the period 2003 to 2005, these forward commitments include collateral requirements related to the
prevailing share price of the Company. At 31 December 2002, no collateral deposits had been made. These shares are intended to satisfy requirements
for share options exercisable in the period 2003 to 2012.
Under the UK – Sharesave Scheme the price at which options are granted must not be less than the greater of the nominal value of an Ordinary Share,
or 80% of the average market value of an Ordinary Share on the three business days preceding the day on which the offer of options is made. The total
purchase cost in respect of options granted under the UK – Sharesave Scheme is deducted from salary over a period of three or five years at the
choice of the employee. The maximum number of shares made available under this scheme for issue under option during a 10 year period is 5% of
the Company’s Ordinary Share Capital in issue on 21 March 1994.
Options granted to Directors are shown in the Remuneration report on pages 42 and 43. 87

The prior periods have been restated for the adoption of FRS No. 19 Deferred Taxation. This has resulted in a decrease in shareholders’ funds at 31 December
2001 of £81m (31 December 2000 – decrease £33m, 31 December 1999 – decrease £42m).
At the end of 2002, the cumulative goodwill offset against profit and loss account amounted to £4,027m (2001 £4,049m; 2000 £4,041m). The transfer
of goodwill in 2001 relates to adjustments to the purchase price of the 1997 acquisitions. Included in this figure was negative goodwill the cumulative
amount of which at 31 December 2002 was £1m (2001 £1m; 2000 £1m).
In the Group accounts, £157m of net exchange gains on foreign currency loans (2001 gains £8m; 2000 losses £128m) have been offset in reserves
against exchange losses (2001 losses; 2000 gains) on the net investment in overseas subsidiaries and associates.
The cumulative exchange gains and losses on the translation of foreign currency financial statements into pounds sterling are taken into account in the
above statement of Group reserves. US GAAP – SFAS No.52, Foreign Currency Translation, requires the separate disclosure of the cumulative amount
of the foreign currency translation effects on shareholders’ funds, as follows:

There are no significant statutory or contractual restrictions on the distribution of current profits of subsidiary undertakings or associates except 
as regards Huntsman International Holdings LLC, see note 17; undistributed profits of prior years are, in the main, permanently employed in the
businesses of these companies. The undistributed profits of Group companies overseas may be liable to overseas taxes and/or UK taxation (after
allowing for double taxation relief) if they were to be distributed as dividends. No provision has been made in respect of potential taxation liabilities
on realisation of assets at restated or revalued amounts or on realisation of associates at equity accounted value.

The Articles of Association of Imperial Chemical Industries PLC state that borrowings after deducting cash, current asset investments and short-term
deposits, must not exceed two and a half times the shareholders’ equity after adding back sums, calculated in accordance with US GAAP, equivalent
to the unamortised balance of goodwill arising on acquisitions made after 1 January 1986. Any borrowings, cash or short-term investments held by
subsidiaries in their capacity as trustee of a Group pension fund are excluded from the calculation. For the purpose of calculating the basis of the
borrowing limits, in accordance with the Articles of Association, the total of the sums standing to the credit of capital and revenue reserves of the
Company and its subsidiary undertakings, to be added to the nominal amount of the share capital of the Company, was £2,970m at 31 December 2002
(2001 (restated – note 1) £2,693m; 2000 (restated – note 1) £2,680m).

34 Statement of Group cash flow: Basis of preparation
The Statement of Group cash flow is prepared in accordance with UK FRS No.1 (Revised 1996) – Cash Flow Statements, the objective of which is
similar to that set out in the US Standard SFAS No. 95 – Statements of Cash Flows. The two statements differ, however, in their definitions of cash and
their presentation of the main constituent items of cash flow.
The definition of cash in the UK Standard is limited to cash plus deposits less overdrafts/borrowings repayable on demand without penalty. In the US,
the definition in SFAS No. 95 excludes overdrafts but is widened to include cash equivalents, comprising short-term highly liquid investments that are
both readily convertible to known amounts of cash and so near their maturities that they present insignificant risk of changes in value: generally, only
investments with original maturities of 3 months or less qualify for inclusion. Calculated in accordance with SFAS No. 95, cash and cash equivalents at
31 December 2000, 2001 and 2002 and the movements during the years ending on those dates were as follows:
2002 2001 2000
£m £m £m
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash 267 301 255
Investments and short-term deposits which were within 3 months of maturity when acquired 158 135 317

Cash inflow (outflow) during year 2 (119) 114
Acquisitions and disposals (1) (14) 3
At end of year 425 436 572
The format of the UK statement employs some nine headings compared with three in SFAS No. 95. The cash flows within the UK headings of
“Operating activities”, “Dividends received from associates”, “Returns on investments and servicing of finance” and “Taxation” would all be included
within the heading of “Net cash provided by operating activities” under SFAS No. 95. Likewise, the UK headings of “Capital expenditure and financial
investment” and “Acquisitions and disposals” correspond with “Cash flows from investing activities” under SFAS No. 95, and “Equity dividends paid”,
“Management of liquid resources” and “Financing” in the UK, subject to adjustments for cash equivalents, correspond with “Cash flows from financing
activities” in the USA. 95

The Group continues to report on employee retirement benefits in accordance with the UK Standard SSAP 24 – Accounting for Pension costs and,
in respect of post-retirement healthcare in compliance with the sixth Abstract of the Urgent Issues Task Force – Accounting for Post-Retirement
Benefits other than Pensions. In 2002, additional analysis is also provided in accordance with the Accounting Standard, FRS No. 17 – Retirement
Benefits (FRS 17). Although none of the amounts calculated in accordance with this Standard requires to be recognised in the primary statements
until accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2005, full disclosure is being made progressively, by way of note, commencing during the
year ending 31 December 2001 and will be complete by the year ending 31 December 2003.
Analysis is also provided in note 42 of the aggregate net periodic benefits cost and funded status of the Group’s major post-retirement schemes
restated in accordance with US GAAP and in compliance with the requirements of SFAS No.87 – Employers’ Accounting for Pensions, SFAS No.
88 – Employers’ Accounting for Settlements and Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension Plans and for Termination Benefits, SFAS No.106 –
Employers’ Accounting for Post-Retirement Benefits other than Pensions and SFAS No.132 – Employers’ Disclosures about Pensions and Other
Post-Retirement Benefits.
Pensions (SSAP 24)
Group
The Company and most of its subsidiaries operate retirement plans which cover the majority of employees (including Directors) in the Group.
These plans are generally of the defined benefit type under which benefits are based on employees’ years of service and average final
remuneration and are funded through separate trustee-administered funds. Formal independent actuarial valuations of the Group’s main plans
are undertaken regularly, normally at least triennially and adopting the projected unit method.
The actuarial assumptions used to calculate the projected benefit obligation of the Group’s pension plans vary according to the economic
conditions of the country in which they are situated. The weighted average discount rate used in determining the actuarial present values of the
benefit obligations was 6.0% (2001 6.1%). The weighted average expected long-term rate of return on investments was 6.1% (2001 6.3%). The
weighted average rate of increase of future earnings was 4.0% (2001 4.1%).
The market value of the fund assets of these plans at the date of the latest actuarial valuations was sufficient to cover 99% (2001 99%) of the
benefits that had accrued to members after allowing for expected future increases in earnings; their market value was £7,721m (2001 £7,843m).
The total pension cost for the Group for 2002 was £89m (2001 £70m; 2000 £85m). Accrued pension costs amounted to £9m (2001 £11m) and
are included in other creditors (note 19); provisions for the benefit obligation of a small number of mainly unfunded plans amounted to £148m
(2001 £179m) and are included in provisions for liabilities and charges - pensions (note 21). Prepaid pension costs amounting to £525m (2001
£510m) are included in debtors (note 16).
ICI Pension Fund
The ICI Pension Fund accounts for approximately 87% of the Group’s plans in asset valuation and projected benefit terms.
From the date of the actuarial valuation of the ICI Pension Fund as at 31 March 1994 the Company has been making payments into the Fund to
reflect the extra liabilities arising from early retirement as retirements occur. Based on a Funding Review as at 31 March 1997, the Company
agreed to make six annual payments into the Fund of £100m per annum from 1998 through 2003, subject to a review in 2000. The latest actuarial
valuation of the Fund, as at 31 March 2000, disclosed a solvency ratio of 98% and the Company has agreed to make a further six annual
payments into the Fund of £30m per annum from 2001 to 2006, subject to a review in 2003. The deficit, together with the prepayment, is taken
into account in arriving at the employer’s pension costs charged in the accounts by being amortised as a percentage of pensionable emoluments
over the expected working lifetime of existing members. In 2002 this gave rise to a charge of £16m (2001 £13m).
Healthcare (UITF Abstract 6)
The Group provides in North America, and to a lesser extent in some other countries, certain unfunded healthcare and life assurance benefits for
retired employees. At 31 December 2002 approximately 20,000 (2001 20,000) current and retired employees were eligible to benefit from these
schemes. The liabilities in respect of these benefits are fully accrued over the expected working lifetime of the existing members.
The total post-retirement healthcare cost for the Group for 2002 was £12m (2001 £10m; 2000 £13m) and the provision at the year end was
£179m (2001 £199m).
The Group has adopted the measurement basis of the US Standard, SFAS No.106 - Employers’ Accounting for Post-Retirement Benefits other
than Pensions as the basis of its UK GAAP reporting. Costs and provisions were determined on an actuarial basis. The assumptions relating to
the US plans, which represent a substantial proportion on the Group total, are set out in the table on note 42.
The healthcare cost trend has a significant effect on the amounts reported. For the Group, increasing the assumed health care cost rates by 1% in
every year would increase the accumulated post-retirement benefit obligation as of 31 December 2002 by £11m (2001 £8m) and the aggregate of
the service and interest cost components of net periodic post-retirement benefit cost for the year ended 31 December 2002 by £2m (2001 £1m).

Retirement benefits – Pensions and healthcare (FRS 17)
The most recent actuarial valuations of the Group’s major defined benefit pension schemes and post-retirement healthcare schemes have been

The applicable weighted average interest rates for fixed rate financial liabilities are: Sterling 7.9% (2001 7.8%); US dollar 6.7% (2001 6.7%);
Euro 4.7% (2001 4.4%); Japanese yen 0.7% (2001 0.7%); other currencies 14.6% (2001 15.6%).
The applicable weighted average period for which rates are fixed are: Sterling 4 years (2001 4 years); US dollar 4 years (2001 3 years); 
Euro 5 years (2001 5 years); Japanese yen 3 years (2001 3 years) and other currencies 2 years (2001 2 years).
The figures shown above take into account various interest rate swaps, currency swaps and forward exchange contracts used to manage the
interest rate and currency profile of financial assets and liabilities.
(b) Currency exposures on monetary assets and liabilities
As explained in the Operating and Financial Review, on page 23, the Group’s policy is, where practicable, to hedge all exposures on monetary
assets and liabilities. As a result there are no significant non functional currency exposures.
(c) Maturity of financial liabilities
The maturity profile of the Group’s financial liabilities, as defined in section (a) above, at 31 December 2002 was as follows:
2002 2001
£m £m
In one year or less 726 1,668

Expiring in more than one year 883 –
Expiring in more than two years 425 1,232
1,509 1,744
(e) Net debt management
The Group manages the currency and interest rate exposure which arises on borrowings and cash not immediately required by the business on 
a net basis through the use of currency swaps, forward exchange contracts, interest rate swaps and interest rate caps. 
The most significant consequences of this approach are:
– to manage the currency exposures arising from loans by holding cash and through currency swaps.
– to reduce the proportion of the Group’s fixed interest rate liabilities arising from loans through the use of fixed to floating rate swaps.
The financial instruments used in debt management are accounted for as described in the Group’s accounting policies on pages 50 and 51.
The notional principal amounts and fair values, net of associated hedges, of the Group’s financial assets and financial liabilities were as follows:

The Group has assumed that the fair value approximates to the carrying value.
The fair value of the Group’s long-term publicly quoted debt is based upon quoted market prices. The fair value of the Group’s non-publicly
quoted debt, all swaps, and caps have been estimated from discounted anticipated cash flows utilising a zero coupon yield curve.
The total decrease in the fair value of long-term debt net of associated hedges for the year ended 31 December 2002 of £1,067m arose from
the net repayment of loans (£966m), favourable movements on foreign exchange (£152m) and adverse movements due to changes in interest
rates (£51m).
A portfolio approach is adopted to create the Group’s target proportion of fixed and floating rate debt by currency. The maturity profile of the net
fixed rate exposure is spread over several years to reduce re-pricing risk. Short term borrowings include balances relating to forward exchange
contracts. These balances are further analysed in section (g).
Where interest rate and currency instruments are designated to a group of borrowings or cash and cash equivalents with similar characteristics,
altering their interest rate or currency profile, the net cash amounts to be received or paid on the agreements are accrued in current assets or
liabilities and recognised as an adjustment to interest income or expense (“accrual accounting”).

notes relating to the accounts 38 Financial risk management (continued)
(e) Net debt management (continued)
The Group is exposed to credit related losses in the event that counterparties to off-balance-sheet financial instruments do not perform according
to the terms of the contract. In the opinion of management, the counterparties to the financial instruments are creditworthy parties and the Group
does not expect any significant loss to result from non-performance. The immediate credit exposure of financial instruments is represented by
those financial instruments that have a positive fair value at 31 December 2002.
At 31 December 2002 the aggregate value of all financial instruments with a positive fair value (assets) was £62m for currency swaps, £96m for
interest rate swaps, £12m for forward contracts, nil for interest rate caps and £2m for currency options.
There were no net material gains or losses deferred at 31 December 2002 (2001 nil).

103 38 Financial risk management (continued)
(g) Currency management
The Group hedges its net transactional currency exposure arising on stocks, trade debtors and creditors (trade working capital) fully through the
use of forward foreign exchange contracts. The Group selectively hedges its anticipated currency cash flow exposures for up to 12 months ahead
through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts and selective purchase of currency options.
Surplus funds are invested in instruments in a variety of currencies. Forward foreign exchange contracts are used to hedge these back to the
currencies that are appropriate for the net debt portfolio.
The financial instruments used in currency management are accounted for as described in the Group’s accounting policies on pages 50 and 51.
The notional principal amounts and fair values of forward exchange contracts used in currency management are as follows:

Forward contracts to sell currency (620) (1,409)
* ( ) = liability
The carrying values of currency hedging instruments do not materially differ from the fair values based on quoted market prices.
(h) Management of current asset investments
Surplus funds are invested in high quality liquid marketable investments, including money market instruments, government securities and asset
backed securities. Investments are of a plain vanilla nature with no embedded interest rate options. The majority of asset backed securities have
some risk of early redemption, but are of a floating rate nature and hence have minimal fixed interest rate risk. There are no investments of a fixed
rate nature with maturity greater than one year and consequently the fair value of investments is considered to be materially the same as the value
in the Group’s balance sheet. Investments are classified as ‘available for sale’.
The Group’s exposure to credit risk is controlled by setting a policy for limiting credit exposure to counterparties, which is reviewed annually, and
reviewing credit ratings and limiting individual aggregate credit exposures accordingly. The Group considers the possibility of material loss in the
event of non-performance by a financial counterparty to be unlikely.
The notional amounts of financial instruments used in debt and currency management do not represent amounts exchanged by the parties and,
thus, are not a measure of the credit risk to the Group arising through the use of these instruments. The immediate credit risk of these instruments
is represented by the fair value of contracts with a positive fair value.
39 Statutory and other information
Remuneration of the Auditor charged in the Group accounts for the statutory audit was £2.8m (2001 £2.8m; 2000 £2.9m); fees paid to the
Auditor (and its associates) of the Company for services other than statutory audit supplied to the Group during 2002 totalled £3.3m (2001
£3.1m; 2000 £5.1m) of which £2.1m (2001 £0.9m; 2000 £1.8m) was for audit related services, principally in connection with the Rights Issue
and divestment transactions, £1.1m (2001 £1.8m; 2000 £0.7m) was for taxation services, and £0.1m (2001 £0.4m; 2000 £2.6m) was for other
services.
The remuneration and expenses of the Auditor in respect of the statutory report to the members of the Company for the year 2002 amounted
to £61,000 (2001 £66,000; 2000 £60,000).
Included in debtors in 2000 and 2001 was an interest free loan of £7,000 to Dr J D G McAdam. This was repaid during 2002.
In accordance with the Company’s policy of providing housing assistance to staff on international assignment, a subsidiary has guaranteed a
housing loan for an officer to the extent of £131,000 (2001 £123,000; 2000 £126,000).

Contingent liabilities existed at 31 December 2002 in connection with
guarantees and uncalled capital relating to subsidiary and other
undertakings and guarantees relating to pension funds, including the
solvency of pension funds. There was no contingent liability in respect
of guarantees of borrowings and uncalled capital for the Group at 
31 December 2002 (2001 £nil); the maximum contingent liability for
the Company, mainly on guarantees of borrowing by subsidiaries, 
was £1,441m (2001 £2,308m).
The Group is also subject to contingencies pursuant to environmental
laws and regulations that in the future may require it to take action to
correct the effects on the environment of prior disposal or release of
chemical substances by the Group or other parties. The ultimate
requirement for such actions, and their cost, is inherently difficult to
estimate, however provisions have been established at 31 December
2002 in accordance with the Group’s accounting policy noted on page
51. It is believed that, taking account of these provisions, the cost of
addressing currently identified environmental obligations is unlikely to
impair materially the Group’s financial position and results of
operations.
The Glidden Company (“Glidden”), a wholly owned subsidiary of ICI, is
a defendant, along with former lead paint and pigment producers as
well as other lead product manufacturers and their trade associations,
in a number of suits in the United States. These suits seek damages
for alleged personal injury caused by lead-based paint or the costs of
removing lead-based paint. An alleged predecessor of Glidden
manufactured lead pigments until the 1950s and lead-based consumer
paint until the 1960s. Due to the nature of the suits, Glidden is unable
to quantify the amount being claimed although the suits are likely to
involve substantial claims for damages.
The cases presently pending against Glidden include: a suit filed in
1989 by the New York City Housing Authority in New York state court
seeking the removal of all lead-based paint from two housing projects;
a purported statewide personal injury class action filed in 1998 on
behalf of all lead poisoned children in New York state court; a personal
injury suit filed in 1999 on behalf of six lead poisoned minors in state
court in Maryland, and a personal injury action filed in 2002 on behalf
of a lead poisoned adult in state court in Mississippi. Five other
individual personal injury actions were filed in 2000 and 2001 against
Glidden and other members of the lead industry in Maryland state
court, however, these actions have not been served on any of the
defendants and no activity is expected for the foreseeable future. 
One additional personal injury action was filed in late 2002 in New
York state court but Glidden has not been served in that case.
Glidden has been dismissed from seventeen cases in 2002 and was
not named as a defendant in more than two dozen lead paint lawsuits
filed this year. Glidden continues to believe that it has strong defences
to all of the pending cases and has denied all liability and will continue
to vigorously defend all actions.
ICI Chemicals & Polymers Limited (C&P), a subsidiary, is involved in
arbitration proceedings in Singapore regarding PTA technology
exchange and licence arrangements with PT Polyprima Karyareksa
(Polyprima). Fees due under these arrangements are being claimed
against Polyprima who, in response, has claimed damages totalling 
up to $130m for alleged breach of contract, alleged fraud, deceit,
misrepresentation and concealment, allegations which C&P rejects
and intends to resist vigorously, C&P’s claim against Polyprima was
heard before an arbitration tribunal in Singapore in May 2002 and the
decision of the tribunal is awaited.
The Group is also involved in various other legal proceedings,
principally in the United Kingdom and United States, arising out of 
the normal course of business. The Directors do not believe that the
outcome of these other proceedings will have a material effect on the
Group’s financial position.
In recent years, the Group has carried out a programme of strategic
disposals, in the course of which we have given to other parties in
these transactions certain indemnities, warranties and guarantees,
including indemnities, warranties and guarantees relating to known
and potential latent environmental, health and safety liabilities. There
are also a number of contracts relating to businesses which we exited
as part of our disposal programme which have not been novated to
the purchasers of these businesses.
The Group’s 50% interest in Teesside Gas Transportation Ltd (TGT)
was sold, during 1996, to a subsidiary of its other shareholder, Enron
Europe Ltd (Enron) which is currently in administration. TGT
contracted with the owners of a distribution network (the CATS
parties) for pipeline capacity for North Sea gas and the commitment 
is guaranteed severally on a 50:50 basis by the Company and Enron 
(the present value of the commitment guaranteed by the Company is
estimated at £163m). On the sale of the Group’s interest in TGT to
Enron the Company received the benefit of a counter guarantee from
Enron’s parent, Enron Corp. Enron Corp. sought Chapter 11
bankruptcy protection in the USA on 2 December 2001.
The Group’s interest in Teesside Power Ltd (TPL) was sold on 31
December 1998 to Enron Teesside Operations Ltd (ETOL). TPL had
previously contracted with certain gas sellers for the purchase of gas.
Enron Corp. and the Company had guaranteed on a several basis the
liability of TPL to the gas sellers in the proportions 70% and 30%
respectively. On the sale of the Group’s interest in TPL to ETOL, the
Company received the benefit of a counter indemnity from ETOL and a
guarantee from Enron Corp. in respect of the Company’s 30%
guarantee commitment to the gas sellers. As mentioned above, Enron
Corp. has sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the USA. The
present value of this commitment is estimated at £285m. The
subsidiaries from which the Company has indemnities are currently
operating. The numbers quoted above are current estimates of the
Company’s maximum potential liability.
105 41 Related party transactions
40 Commitments and contingent liabilities (continued)
The following information is provided in accordance with FRS No. 8 –
Related Party Transactions, as being material transactions with related
parties during 2002.
Related party: Huntsman International Holdings LLC (HIH), disclosed
as a principal associate during the year.
Transactions:
a) Sales of naphtha and condensate to HIH amounted to £127m (2001
£152m; 2000 £201m).
b) Purchase of ethylene and titanium dioxide from HIH amounted to
£149m (2001 £177m; 2000 £153m).
c) Amounts payable by the Group relating to the above transactions at
year end amounted to £2m (2001 debtor £1m; 2000 debtor £1m).
Related party: IC Insurance Ltd and its subsidiaries, disclosed as a
principal associate on page 75.
Transactions:
a) Insurance claims settled by IC Insurance Ltd with ICI amounted
to £nil (2001 £nil; 2000 £0.2m).
b) Funds on deposit with ICI Finance PLC amounted to £10m
(2001 £10m; 2000 £10m).
Related party: Irish Fertilizer Industries Ltd, an equity accounted
associate in Ireland, which went into liquidation during the year.
Transactions: Loans totalling £5.6m (2001 £5m; 2000 £5m)
have been provided to the associate by ICI. The maximum amount
outstanding during 2002 was £5.6m. Interest is payable at a rate
of 72.37 basis points above the prevailing 2 year fixed rate.
ICI has also provided the associate with a revolving credit facility
under which £5.6m (2001 £3.1m; 2000 £nil) has been borrowed.
The maximum amount outstanding during 2002 was £5.6m. Interest
is payable at a rate of 150 basis points above the prevailing 1 month
Euro LIBOR rate.
The loans to the company have been written off during 2002
(see Note 3, footnote (c)).
In connection with the disposal of the Group’s Chlor-Chemicals
business to Ineos Chlor, Ineos Chlor has made a £65 million claim
against the Group relating to expenditure allegedly required in relation
to the Runcorn site, which the Group is disputing. As yet, legal
proceedings have not been commenced by Ineos Chlor but it is
possible that they will be in the near future.
Ineos Chlor has also approached the UK Department of Trade and
Industry to seek Regional Selective Assistance for certain capital
projects and is also seeking financial support from its parent company
and the Group. ICI has received reports that Ineos Chlor may seek to
close part or all of its business if this financial support is not
forthcoming. If such a closure was to occur, a number of
Chlor-Chemicals contracts in the Group’s name which have not yet
been novated to Ineos Chlor and certain environmental liabilities could
revert to the Group or be accelerated.
In connection with the sale of the Chlor-Chemicals business, the
Group agreed to provide or guarantee up to £100m of future financing
to Ineos Chlor. These facilities were available at market related rates,
for 5 years and may, if necessary, be extended for a further 2 years.
As at 31 December 2002 Ineos Chlor had borrowed £70 million from
the Company under these facilities. In addition the book value of the
PIK notes which the Group received from Ineos Chlor as part of the
consideration for the sale was £29 million at 31 December 2002.
Whilst the Group has not waived Ineos Chlor’s obligations in respect
of the loan facility or PIK notes, discussions to date with Ineos Chlor
indicate that some uncertainty exists as to the extent to which and
period over which these amounts will be recovered. As a result, as
mentioned in note 3(g) on page 58 the Group has provided for these
amounts.
The loan facilities together with Ineos Chlor’s obligation to assume
various Chlor-Chemicals contracts are secured in favour of the Group.
While any of these liabilities remain outstanding, the Group has certain
rights under a shareholders’ agreement including, in the event of an
Ineos Chlor default, the right, for no consideration, to take control of
Ineos Chlor if the Group judges that it is in its best interests to do so.
The Group’s 15% shareholding in Ineos Chlor Limited, is subject to put
and call options in certain circumstances.
The only significant take-or-pay contract entered into by subsidiaries
is the purchase of electric power, which commenced in the second
quarter of 1998, for 15 years. The present value of this commitment
at the year end is estimated at £162m.
The ultimate outcome of the matters described above is subject to
many uncertainties, including future events and the uncertainties
inherent in litigation. The Group has made provision in its financial
statements for such matters to the extent losses are presently
considered probable and estimable. However, these matters involve
substantial sums, and an unfavourable outcome of one or more of
these matters could have a material effect on the Group’s results of
operations, liquidity and financial position.
106
ICI ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS AND FORM 20-F 2002
notes relating to the accounts The accompanying Group financial statements included in this report
are prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted
Accounting Principles (UK GAAP). The significant differences between
UK GAAP and US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (US
GAAP) which affect the Group’s net income and shareholders’ equity
are set out below:
(a) Accounting for pension costs
There are five significant differences between UK GAAP under
SSAP 24 and US GAAP in accounting for pension costs:
(i) SFAS No. 87 Employers’ Accounting for Pensions, requires that
pension plan assets are valued by reference to their fair or market
related values, whereas UK GAAP permits an alternative
measurement of assets, which, in the case of the main UK
retirement plans, is on the basis of the discounted present value
of expected future income streams from the pension plan assets.
(ii) SFAS No. 87 requires measurements of plan assets and obligations
to be made as at the date of financial statements or a date not
more than three months prior to that date. Under UK GAAP,
calculations may be based on the results of the latest actuarial
valuation.
(iii) SFAS No. 87 mandates a particular actuarial method – the
projected unit credit method – and requires that each significant
assumption necessary to determine annual pension cost reflects
best estimates solely with regard to that individual assumption. UK
GAAP does not mandate a particular method, but requires that the
method and assumptions, taken as a whole, should be compatible
and lead to the actuary’s best estimate of the cost of providing the
benefits promised.
(iv) Under SFAS No. 87 a negative pension cost may arise where a
significant unrecognised net asset or gain exists at the time of
implementation. This is required to be amortised on a straight-line
basis over the average remaining service period of employees.
Under UK GAAP, the Group’s policy is to not recognise pension
credits in its financial statements unless a refund of, or reduction
in, contributions is likely.
(v) SFAS No. 88 Employers’ Accounting for Settlements and
Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension Plans and for Termination
Benefits, requires immediate recognition of previously
unrecognised gains or losses when certain events meeting the
definition of a plan settlement or curtailment occur. Under UK
GAAP, such gains or losses are recognised over the expected
service life of the remaining employees.
(b) Purchase accounting adjustments, including the amortisation and
impairment of goodwill and intangibles
In the Group’s financial statements, prepared in accordance with
UK GAAP, goodwill arising on acquisitions accounted for under the
purchase method after 1 January 1998 is capitalised and amortised.
Prior to that date such goodwill arising on acquisitions by the Group
was and remains eliminated against retained earnings. Values were
not placed on intangible assets. Additionally, UK GAAP requires that
on subsequent disposal or closure of a previously acquired asset,
any goodwill previously taken directly to shareholders’ equity is then
charged in the income statement against the income or loss on
disposal or closure.
Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 142 Goodwill and other Intangible
Assets, on 1 January 2002, under US GAAP all goodwill was
capitalised and amortised through charges against income over its
estimated life not exceeding 40 years. Also, under US GAAP, it was
normal practice to ascribe fair values to identifiable intangibles and for
the purpose of the adjustments to US GAAP, included in the tables
below, identifiable intangible assets of the Group were amortised to
income over the lower of their estimated lives or 40 years. Provision
under US GAAP was made where there was a permanent impairment
to the carrying value of capitalised goodwill and intangible assets,
based on a projection of future undiscounted cash flows.
The Group adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 142 from 1 January
2002. The standard requires that intangible assets with finite lives
be amortised over their estimated useful lives. Intangible assets with
indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment annually in lieu of being
amortised. Goodwill is no longer amortised on a straight-line basis
over its estimated useful life but instead is tested for impairment
annually and whenever indicators of impairment arise (see section
(l) below.)
(c) Capitalisation of interest
There is no requirement in the UK to capitalise interest and the Group
does not capitalise interest in its Group financial statements. Under
US GAAP, SFAS No. 34 Capitalization of Interest Cost requires interest
incurred as part of the cost of constructing fixed assets to be
capitalised and amortised over the life of the asset.
(d) Derivative instruments and hedging activities
In June 1998 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued
SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Certain
Hedging Activities. In June 2000 the FASB issued SFAS No. 138,
Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging
Activities, an Amendment of SFAS No. 133. SFAS No. 133 and SFAS
No. 138 require that all derivative instruments be recorded on the
balance sheet at their respective fair values. SFAS No. 133 and SFAS
No. 138 are effective for all fiscal quarters of all fiscal years beginning
after 30 June 2000; the Group adopted SFAS No. 133 and SFAS No.
138 on 1 January 2001. In accordance with the transition provisions
of SFAS No.133, the Group recorded, at 1 January 2001, a net-of-tax
cumulative-effect-type increase of £4m in accumulated other
comprehensive income within shareholders’ equity to recognise at fair
value all derivatives that were previously designated as cash flow
hedging instruments. A fair value adjustment increased debt by £35m
which was offset by a corresponding amount to record derivatives
previously designated as fair value hedging instruments. All of the
transition adjustment that was recorded in accumulated other
comprehensive income has been reclassified into earnings as of
31 December 2001. The fair value adjustment to debt is being
amortised over the period of the debt in accordance with the
transitional rules. Upon adoption, the Group’s management decided
not to designate any of its derivative instruments as hedges for
US GAAP accounting purposes. Derivatives previously designated
as cash flow and fair value hedges are now marked to market.
Consequently, the Group’s earnings under US GAAP may be more
volatile because of the effect of derivative instruments. Under US
GAAP, the forward contracts to purchase the Company’s Ordinary
Shares by the employee share trust in order to hedge obligations
in respect of options issued under certain employee share option
schemes, are recognised in the balance sheet at fair value, with
changes in the fair value recognised in net income.
42 Differences between UK and US accounting principles
107 42 Differences between UK and US accounting principles (continued)
(e) Restructuring costs
Under UK GAAP, provisions are made for restructuring costs once
a detailed formal plan is in place and valid expectations have been
raised in those affected that the restructuring will be carried out.
Provision is made for voluntary redundancy payments to the extent
that it is expected that volunteers will come forward. US GAAP
requires a number of specific criteria be met before restructuring
costs can be recognised as an expense. Among these criteria is the
requirement that all significant actions arising from the restructuring
plan and their completion dates must be identified by the balance
sheet date. Under US GAAP voluntary severance benefits are accrued
when the terms are accepted by the individual employee. Also, to the
extent restructuring costs are related to the activities of the acquired
company, US GAAP allows them to be recognised as a liability upon
acquisition, provided certain specific criteria are met, whereas UK
GAAP does not. Accordingly, timing differences arise between the
UK GAAP and US GAAP recognition of such costs. SFAS No. 146
will be adopted from 1 January 2003 (see section (m) below).
(f) Foreign exchange
Under UK GAAP, on the sale of a foreign enterprise cumulative foreign
exchange differences within reserves are not considered in arriving at
a gain or loss on disposal. Under US GAAP, on the sale of a foreign
enterprise the cumulative foreign currency differences within reserves
are taken to net income in arriving at the gain or loss on disposal.
(g) Discontinued operations
Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 144 Accounting for the Impairment
or Disposal of Long Lived Assets, as described below, the criteria for
treatment of a disposal as a discontinued operation under US GAAP
was different from the criteria under UK GAAP. A description of the UK
GAAP criteria and a list of businesses which have been treated as
discontinued operations under UK GAAP is included in note 1. No
businesses met the criteria for discontinued operations under US
GAAP. On 1 January 2002 the Group adopted SFAS No. 144.
SFAS No. 144 requires the disposal of a component of an enterprise
meeting certain conditions, and which comprises operations and cash
flows that can be clearly distinguished, operationally and for financial
reporting purposes, from the rest of the entity, be disclosed as a
discontinued operation. Under US GAAP, the Synetix disposal meets
these conditions and, therefore, Synetix is classified as a discontinued
operation. Accordingly, under US GAAP, the results of the operations
and the gain on the disposal of Synetix are classified within
discontinued operations. Prior period results have been restated.
Under US GAAP, the gain on sale in 2002 amounted to £107m and
Synetix sales were £121m, £143m and £125m for 2002, 2001 and
2000 respectively. Additionally, UK GAAP sets out that for an
operation to be treated as discontinued its disposal should have
a material effect on the nature and focus of a reporting entity’s
operations and represent a material reduction in operating facilities.
The Synetix disposal does not meet these requirements and has been
classified as continuing under UK GAAP.
In 2000, the Group recorded the disposal of its Chlor-Chemicals
business. The disposal, for UK financial reporting purposes, was
classified as a discontinued operation. However, under US GAAP Staff
Accounting Bulletin (SAB) Topic 5E, due principally to the continuing
15% equity interest of the Group in the disposed operations and a
commitment by the Group to provide additional funding to finance the
Ineos-Chlor business, the entity should not be deconsolidated. US
GAAP accounting for the Chlor-Chemicals business may therefore
differ from that under UK GAAP and may involve applying an equity
method of accounting for any future losses that may arise up to
the full amount of the Group’s investment and committed funding.
The approximate gross assets and gross liabilities of Chlor-Chemicals
are £155m and £155m respectively under UK GAAP at 31 December
2002.
In 2002, the Group entered into an agreement to dispose of its
investment in Notes and equity of Huntsman International Holdings
LLC (HIH) to the same counterparty, for completion by 15 May 2003. 
A substantial deposit was received on the sale of the Notes (£109m),
but none in respect of the equity which is therefore regarded as an
option for US GAAP purposes. The sale of the HIH Notes is at a loss
to the Group, while the equity transaction, if consummated under the
agreed terms, will result in a gain in excess of the loss on the HIH
Notes. The Group believes it is highly likely that both transactions will
be completed and, accordingly, under UK GAAP, the Group has not
recognised the loss on the HIH Notes, of approximately £40m nor 
the estimated net overall gain of approximately £55m and has
discontinued the application of the equity method of accounting for 
its investment in HIH to reflect the change in economic benefits.
Further explanation of the accounting for this complex transaction
under UK GAAP is given in Note 17.
Under US GAAP, the Notes transaction and the potential equity
transaction have been accounted for as separate transactions since
they are not interdependent. Accordingly, under US GAAP, a loss has
been recognised on the sale of the HIH Notes (approximately £40
million), and the gain on the equity transaction (approximately £95m)
will be recognised when it occurs. Additionally, under US GAAP, the
Group has continued to account for its equity investment in HIH under
the equity method of accounting, and therefore has continued to
recognise its proportionate share of HIH’s operating results. The
equity accounted results from 18 June 2002 (a pre-tax loss of £10m)
have been included in the US GAAP net income reconciliation.
(h) Employee share trust arrangements
An employee share trust has been established in order to hedge
obligations in respect of options issued under certain employee share
option schemes. Under UK GAAP, the Company’s Ordinary Shares
held by the employee share trust are included at the lower of cost and
estimated net realisable value in fixed asset investments. Under US
GAAP, such shares are treated as treasury stock and included in
shareholders’ equity at historic cost.
(i) Ordinary dividends
Under UK GAAP, the proposed dividends on Ordinary Shares, as
recommended by the directors, are deducted from shareholders’
equity and shown as a liability in the balance sheet at the end of the
period to which they relate. Under US GAAP, such dividends are only
deducted from shareholders’ equity upon declaration of the dividend.
(j) Taxation
The Group adopted FRS No. 19 Deferred Tax in 2002 for UK GAAP
purposes. Consequently, the consolidated financial statements as
of 31 December 2001 and 2000, and the three year period ended
31 December 2002 have been restated and disclosures have been
modified to reflect retroactively the impact of the adoption of FRS 19
on such financial statements as required by UK GAAP. FRS 19
requires that full provision for deferred tax is recognised in the financial
statements. The adoption of FRS 19 has eliminated most of the
differences that previously existed between UK GAAP and US GAAP.
As a result, the adjustment for taxation now primarily relates to the tax
effect of other US GAAP adjustments.

(k) Share compensation expense
In the Group’s consolidated financial statements prepared under UK
GAAP, no compensation expense is recognised in respect of the
Group’s share option schemes. Under US GAAP, compensation cost
has been recognised for all options, including arrangements under
the Group’s UK Sharesave scheme. The cost is calculated as the
difference between the option price and the market price at the end of
the reporting period for all option plans including performance related
criteria. In the Group’s UK Sharesave scheme, the cost is calculated
as the difference between the option price and the market price at
date of grant. The cost is amortised over the period from the date the
options are granted to the date they are first exercisable, that is, the
vesting date. Following the issue of EITF 00–23, Issues Related to the
Accounting for Share Compensation under APB Opinion No. 25 and
FASB Interpretation No. 44, the cost of the 2002 grant under the
Group’s UK Sharesave scheme is treated in accordance with all other
plans. At 31 December 2002, the Group had a number of share-based
compensation plans, which are described in note 23 of the Group’s
financial statements. The Group recognises compensation costs for
US GAAP purposes in accordance with the requirements of APB
Opinion No. 25. Had compensation costs for the Group’s share option
plans been determined based on the fair value at the grant date for
awards under those plans consistent with the method of SFAS No.
123 Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, the Group’s net
income of £9m in 2002 would have been reduced to £3m. The basic
earnings per share as reported of 0.8p would be 0.3p on a proforma
basis (2001 restated 1.5p would be 0.5p; 2000 no material difference).
(l) New US Accounting Standards implemented in the period
SFAS No. 142 Goodwill and Intangible Assets
In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Intangible
Assets, which superseded APB 17, Intangible Assets. SFAS No. 142
eliminated the previous requirement to amortise goodwill and
intangible assets. Upon adoption of SFAS No.142 an impairment test
must be carried out on all intangible assets with indefinite useful lives
and goodwill. The test for intangible assets with indefinite useful lives
and of goodwill must be carried out annually. In addition, the useful
economic lives of definite life intangibles are to be reviewed. Any
impairment loss identified on the date of adoption of SFAS No. 142 is
accounted for as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle.
The Group adopted the requirements of SFAS No. 142 on 1 January
2002, when the Group had unamortised goodwill of £3,757m and
intangible assets with a gross carrying amount of £300m less
accumulated amortisation of £135m, under US GAAP. The definite
life intangible assets are being amortised over a period of 10 years
(amortisation expense for the period £30m). Amortisation of intangible
assets with indefinite useful lives and goodwill ceased from 1 January
2002, resulting in an increase in US GAAP net income of £131m (basic
earnings per Ordinary Share 11.8p, diluted earnings per Ordinary
Share 11.7p). If the standard had been applied in the year ended
31 December 2001 and 2000 US GAAP net income would have been
£134m (EPS 15.4p higher – basic and diluted) higher (2000 £126m,
and 14.5p higher – basic and diluted)
The goodwill balance under US GAAP at 31 December 2002
amounted to £3,507m (2001: £3,757m). The segmental analysis of
this goodwill, based on the Group’s defined segments is as follows:
National Starch £1,967m (2001: £2,038m), Quest £742m (2001:
£770m), Performance Specialties £256m (2001: £280m), Paints
£523m (2001: £662m) and Regional and Industrial £19m (2001: £7m).
The significant movements in the period include the impairment of the
goodwill relating to Paints Latin America (£122m) as described below,
the disposal of Synetix and the related goodwill (£13m) and exchange.
In the period to 31 December 2002, an impairment of £122m was
recognised, representing the entire goodwill in the Paints Latin
America reporting unit. Under UK GAAP, the majority of the goodwill
related to acquisitions prior to 1998 and has been eliminated against
reserves. This impairment resulted from the current difficult economic
environment in the region and has been disclosed in the US GAAP
reconciliation under the heading “Purchase accounting adjustment”.
The fair value of the reporting unit, as required under the first stage of
impairment in SFAS No.142, was calculated using a present value
technique. This involved discounting the future cash flows of the
reporting unit at an appropriate risk adjusted discount rate for the
region. In calculating the fair value, significant management judgement
was applied for example, the quantification of the underlying cash
flows of the reporting unit including terminal growth values and the
selection of an appropriate discount rate. As the fair value of the
reporting unit was less than its book value, a second stage was
performed which compared the fair value of the unit’s goodwill to the
book value of its goodwill. Fair value procedures similar to those used
in a business combination were used in this stage.
SFAS No. 144 Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
Assets
In August, 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. SFAS No. 144 requires
long-lived assets to be reviewed for impairment whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an
asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability is measured by a
comparison of the carrying amount to future net cash flows expected
to be generated by the asset. SFAS No. 144 requires companies to
report separately discontinued operations and extends that reporting
to a component of an entity that either has been disposed of or is
classified as held for sale.
The Group was required to adopt the provisions of SFAS No. 144 from
1 January 2002 but there were no events or changes in circumstances
which indicated that the carrying values of assets might not be
recoverable nor components of the Group’s operations disposed of
(by sale, abandonment, or in a distribution to owners) or classified as
held for sale which required to be disclosed except as disclosed in
section (g).
EITF 01-09 Accounting for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a
Customer (Including a Reseller of the Vendor’s Products)
EITF 01–09 was issued in November 2001 by the Emerging Issues
Task Force (EITF). The pronouncement codifies and reconciles the
consensus reached on EITF 00-14, 00-22 and 00-25, which
addresses the recognition, measurement and profit and loss account
classification of certain selling expenses. The adoption of this issue
has resulted in the reclassification of certain selling expenses including
sales incentives, slotting fees, buydowns and distributor payments
from cost of sales and administrative expenses to a reduction in sales.
The Group has calculated that the adoption of EITF 01-09 in the year
ended 31 December 2002 decreased sales and cost of
sales/administrative expenses as reported under UK GAAP by £55m
(2001 £50m, 2000 £52m). The adoption of EITF 01-09 had no effect
on trading profit. 110
ICI ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS AND FORM 20-F 2002
(m) New US Accounting Standards and pronouncements not yet
effective
In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset
Retirement Obligations. SFAS No. 143 requires the Company to
record the fair value of an asset retirement obligation as a liability in
the period in which it incurs a legal obligation associated with the
retirement of tangible long-lived assets that result from the acquisition,
construction, development and/or normal use of the assets. SFAS No.
143 is applicable for 2003. The Group has not yet completed
evaluating the effect of this standard on its financial statements.
SFAS No. 146 Accounting for the Costs Associated with Exit or
Disposal Activities, requires that a liability for a cost associated with
an exit or disposal activity should be measured at fair value and
recorded when it meets the definition of a liability in FASB Concepts
Statement No.6 - Elements of Financial Statements. SFAS No. 146
superseded EITF 94-3 Liability Recognition for Certain Employee
Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (Including
Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring) which required recognition
of a liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity
initiated after 31 December 2002. Restatement of prior periods is not
required. Since SFAS No. 146 applies to future activities which may
not yet have been envisaged, the impact of the application of SFAS
No.146 cannot be determined in advance.
FASB Interpretation No. 45, Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure
Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of
Indebtedness of Others was issued in November 2002. This
interpretation addresses the disclosure to be made by a guarantor in
its financial statements about its obligation under guarantees. FIN No.
45 also requires the guarantor to recognise a liability for the non-
contingent component of the guarantee, that is the obligation to stand
ready to perform in the event that specified triggering events or
conditions occur. The initial measurement of this liability is the fair
value of the guarantee at inception. The Group has adopted the
disclosure requirements of FIN No. 45 and will apply the recognition
and measurement provisions for all guarantees entered into or
modified after 31 December 2002. There are a number of contracts
relating to businesses which we exited as part of our disposal
programme which have not been novated to the purchasers of these
businesses. Note 40 discloses the nature and circumstances of the
material guarantees together with their present value. The maximum
potential amount of future undiscounted payments under all ICI’s
guarantees as defined by FIN No. 45, including those disclosed in
Note 40, with terms ranging between 1 to 15 years, amounted to
£1,217m at 31 December 2002. After taking into account various
mitigating and recourse factors, mainly the ability to procure products
from other sources and to onward sell the various products and
services, the maximum potential amount of future undiscounted
payments is reduced to £311m.
In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148 Accounting for
Stock Based Compensation – Transition and Disclosure – an
amendment of FASB No. 123. SFAS No. 148 permits two additional
transition methods for entities that adopt the fair value based method
of accounting for stock-based employee compensation. The
statement also requires new disclosures about the ramp-up effect of
stock-based employee compensation on reported results and that
those effects be disclosed more prominently by specifying the form,
content, and location of those disclosures. The transition guidance
and annual disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 148 are effective fiscal
years ending after 15 December 2002, with earlier application
permitted in certain circumstances. The interim disclosure provisions
are effective for financial reports containing financial statements for
interim periods beginning after 15 December 2002. The Group has not
decided yet if it will adopt either of the transition method alternatives
of SFAS No.148.
FASB Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities,
was issued in January 2003. The interpretation addresses
consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities and
requires such entities to be consolidated, even if it is not controlled as
a subsidiary, if the equity investor is subject to a majority of the risk of
loss from the variable interest entity’s activities. The consolidation
requirements of Interpretation No. 46 apply immediately to variable
interest entities created after 31 January 2003 and apply to older
entities from 15 June 2003. The Group does not expect the impact of
FIN No. 46 to have an impact on its financial statements.

The effect of applying US GAAP to items other than those directly affecting net income or shareholders’ equity is dealt with in other notes relating
to the accounts. The disclosures required by SFAS No. 130 Reporting Comprehensive Income have been made in the Group’s financial
statements in the statement of total recognised gains and losses, in note 24 and in the disclosure relating to pensions and other post-retirement
benefits (US GAAP) in the next section of this note.
Pensions and other post-retirement benefits (US GAAP)
For the purposes of the disclosure in accordance with US GAAP, the pension cost of the major UK retirement plans and of the retirement plans of
the major non-UK subsidiaries have been presented in the following tables, on a Group basis, in accordance with the requirements of SFAS No.
87 Accounting for Pensions and of SFAS No. 132 – Employers’ Disclosures about Pensions and Other Post-Retirement Benefits. The actuarial
liabilities of these plans comprise a substantial portion of the Group total.
Assumed discount rates and rates of increase in remuneration used in calculating the projected benefit obligations together with long-term rates
of return on plan assets vary according to the economic conditions of the country in which the retirement plans are situated. The weighted
average rates used in the Group’s major pension plans for SFAS No. 87 purposes in the Group are shown in the table below, together with the

ICI ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS AND FORM 20-F 2002
Taxation
The following discussion is intended as a general guide, only.
Shareholders who are in any doubt with regard to tax matters, or who
are resident in countries other than the United Kingdom or USA should
consult their tax adviser.
The Double Taxation (Income) Convention of 1975 (“the Current
Convention”) between the United Kingdom and the United States has
been renegotiated and an agreed text of a new Convention (“the New
Convention”) has been published. As at 12 February 2003, the new
Convention has not been ratified by the US government. The New
Convention will not come into force until after ratification. Until then
the Current Convention remains in force.
The following summary of the principal UK and certain US tax
consequences of ownership of Ordinary Shares or ADSs, held as
capital assets by US resident shareholders is based on current UK and
US Federal tax law and practice and in part on representations of
JPMorgan Chase Bank as Depositary for ADSs and assumes that
each obligation in the deposit agreement among the Company, the
Depositary and the holders from time to time of ADSs and any related
agreement will be performed in accordance with its terms. The US
Treasury has expressed concerns that parties to whom ADSs are pre-
released may be taking actions that are inconsistent with the claiming,
by US holders of ADSs, of foreign tax credits for US federal income tax
purposes. Accordingly, the analysis of the creditability of UK taxes
described below could be affected by future actions that may be taken
by the US Treasury.
Taxation of dividends paid to US Shareholders
For US federal income tax purposes, the sum of the dividend paid and
any associated tax credit or UK withholding tax considered to have
been paid with respect to the dividend is includible in gross income by
US resident shareholders that claim the benefits of the Current
Convention and, for foreign tax credit limitation purposes, is foreign
source income treated separately, together with other items of
“passive income” (or, in the case of certain holders, “financial services
income”). The withholding is treated as a foreign income tax which
may, subject to certain restrictions and limitations, be eligible for credit
against a US resident shareholder’s US federal income tax liability
(or deductible by such shareholder in computing taxable income).
Changes to UK tax law in relation to dividends paid on or after 6 April
1999 result in no effective repayment of any part of the tax credit
associated with a dividend paid on or after 6 April 1999 being
available under the Current Convention. However, US resident
shareholders that claim the benefits of the US-UK income tax treaty
may elect to include in gross income an amount equal to a tax credit
of one-ninth of the cash dividend paid and, subject to certain
restrictions and limitations, claim a foreign tax credit for an equal
amount of withholding tax.
Shareholders should note that upon ratification of the New Convention 
(if in its current form) no foreign tax credit will be available in respect of
any associated tax credit or UK withholding tax considered to have
been paid with respect to any dividend payment.
No dividends received deduction is allowed to US resident corporate
shareholders with respect to dividends paid by the Company. 
Taxation on capital gains
In certain circumstances, when a shareholder in the UK sells shares,
liability to tax in respect of capital gains is computed by reference to
the market value of the shares on 31 March 1982. The market value of
ICI Ordinary Shares at 31 March 1982, for the purposes of capital
gains tax, was 309p.
ICI and Zeneca demerged on 1 June 1993. Post-demerger ICI shares
inherited a base cost for capital gains equivalent to 0.50239 of their
pre-demerger base cost.
For the purposes of UK taxation of capital gains (“CGT”), the issue of
new ICI shares in the rights issue is regarded as a reorganisation of
the share capital of ICI. New shares acquired by taking up an
entitlement under the rights issue are treated as the same asset as,
and having been acquired at the same time as and at the same
aggregate cost as, the existing holding of ICI shares. The subscription
money for the new shares is added to the base cost of the existing
holding. (In the case of shareholders within the charge to corporation
tax, indexation allowance will apply to the amount paid for the new
shares only from the date the amount is paid or liable to be paid.)
Under the Current Convention each contracting state may, in general,
tax capital gains in accordance with the provisions of its domestic law.
Under present UK law, individuals who are neither resident nor
ordinarily resident in the UK, and companies which are not resident in
the UK will not generally be liable to UK tax on capital gains made on
the disposal of their Ordinary Shares or ADSs, unless such Ordinary
Shares or ADSs are held in connection with a trade, profession or
vocation carried on in the UK through a branch or agency. However,
an individual who is temporarily resident outside the UK may, in certain
circumstances, be subject to tax on gains realised whilst he or she is
resident outside the UK.
A US resident shareholder will recognise capital gain or loss for US
federal income tax purposes on the sale or exchange of the Ordinary
Shares or ADSs in the same manner as such holder would on the sale
or exchange of any other shares held as capital assets. Any gain or
loss will generally be US source income or loss. US resident
shareholders should consult their own tax advisors about the
treatment of capital gains.
UK inheritance tax
Under the current Double Taxation (Estates) Convention (the “Estate
Tax Convention”), between the US and the UK, Ordinary Shares or
ADSs held by an individual shareholder who is domiciled for the
purposes of the Estate Tax Convention in the US, and is not for the
purposes of the Estate Tax Convention a national of the United
Kingdom, nor resident in the UK for the last seven out of ten tax years,
will generally not be subject to the UK inheritance tax on the
individual’s death nor on a chargeable gift of the Ordinary Shares or
ADSs during the individual’s lifetime provided that any applicable US
federal gift or estate tax liability is paid, unless the Ordinary Shares or
ADSs are part of the business property of a permanent establishment
of the individual in the UK or, in the case of a shareholder who
performs independent personal services, pertain to a fixed base
situated in the UK. Where the Ordinary Shares or ADSs have been
placed in trust by a settlor who, at the time of settlement, was a US
resident shareholder, the Ordinary Shares or ADSs will generally not
be subject to UK inheritance tax unless the settlor, at the time of
settlement, was not domiciled in the US or was a UK national. In the
exceptional case where the Ordinary Shares or ADSs are subject both
to UK inheritance tax and to US federal gift or estate tax, the Estate
Tax Convention generally provides for double taxation to be relieved
by means of credit relief. 119
RISK FACTORS
ICI operates in competitive markets. If the Group does not continue
to compete in its markets effectively by developing innovative
products and responding effectively to the activities of its
competitors, it could lose customers and its results of operations
could be adversely affected.
ICI has a wide portfolio of business units competing across a diverse
range of geographic and product markets. The Group’s business may
be adversely affected if it does not continue to develop innovative
products that satisfy customer needs and preferences, develop new
technology or enhance existing technology that supports product
development or provides cost or other advantages over its
competitors, and attract and retain skilled employees that are key to
creating new products. Because the Group is subject to price
competition from its competitors, it must also continue to satisfy these
objectives while maintaining a competitive cost base.
In addition, some of ICI’s competitors in certain markets are larger and
have greater financial resources than the Group, which may enable
them to deliver products on more attractive terms or to invest larger
amounts of capital into their businesses, including expenditures for
research and development. If any of the Group’s current or future
competitors develop proprietary technology that enables them to
produce new products or services or to deliver existing products or
services at a significantly lower cost, its products and services could
be rendered uneconomical or obsolete.
While some of the Group’s product range comprises products and
services that are protected by proprietary knowledge or patents, some
of its businesses use technology that is widely available. Accordingly,
certain product segments of the Group’s business may be vulnerable
to new competitors and may be adversely affected by increased price
competition. Any of these developments could lead to a loss of
customers and could adversely affect the Group’s results of
operations.
The price volatility of some of the raw materials ICI uses could
adversely affect its results of operations
ICI uses significant amounts of various chemicals and other materials
as raw materials in manufacturing its products. Prices for some of
these raw materials are volatile and are affected by cyclical
movements in commodity prices, availability of such raw materials,
demand for a variety of products which are produced using these raw
materials, levels of price competition among local and global suppliers
and general economic conditions. The Group’s diverse portfolio of
value added products provides some ability to pass on higher input
prices to its customers, but this ability is, to a large extent, dependent
upon market conditions. There may be periods of time in which the
Group is not able to recover increases in the cost of raw materials for
some products due to weakness in demand for such products or the
actions of its competitors. This may adversely affect the Group’s
results of operations.
The occurrence of major operational problems could have an
adverse effect on the Group’s results of operations and cash flow.
The Group’s revenues are dependent on the continued operation of its
various manufacturing facilities. Operational risks include:
• equipment and systems failures,
• failure to comply with applicable regulations and standards and to
maintain necessary permits and approvals,
• raw material supply disruptions,
• labour force shortages or work stoppages, 
• events impeding or increasing the cost of transporting products,
• natural disasters, and
• terrorist attacks.
While the Group maintains insurance at levels that it believes are
typical for its industry, some of these operational risks and problems
could result in uninsured losses or liabilities or in losses and liabilities
in excess of its insurance coverage. The occurrence of major
operational problems resulting from the above or other events may
have an adverse effect on the results of operations of a particular
manufacturing facility, or with respect to certain of these risks, the
results of operations and cash flow of the Group as a whole.
ICI derives a significant percentage of its revenue in some of its
businesses from sales to major customers, and if it is unable to
retain these customers, its results of operations could be adversely
affected.
While no single customer accounted for more than 10% of Group
sales in 2002, sales to major customers in some of its businesses,
particularly in the Paints and Quest businesses, are significant. 
ICI believes that the wide selling range and nature of the specialty
products it supplies reduce the potential adverse consequences of 
the loss of business from any one customer for any one of its products
or in any one of its businesses. Nevertheless, the loss of major
customers, without replacement, could have an adverse effect on
results of operations.
The Group’s reliance on key suppliers in some of its businesses
could result in an adverse effect on results of operations.
Some of the Group’s business units rely on a small number of
suppliers for their key raw materials. If any of these suppliers is unable
to meet its obligations or increases its prices, the Group may not be
able to find a replacement supplier that is able to provide such raw
materials on similar terms. Consequently, the Group may be forced to
pay higher prices to obtain raw materials, which it may not be able to
pass on to its customers in the form of increased prices for its finished
products. In addition, some of the raw materials used may become
unavailable, and there can be no assurance that the Group will be able
to obtain suitable and cost effective substitutes. Furthermore, any
consolidation in the industries that supply the Group’s raw materials
could further reduce the number of available suppliers. Any
interruption of supply or price increases caused by these or other
factors, which the Group is not able to mitigate by securing
satisfactory replacement suppliers, could have an adverse effect on 
its results of operations.
ICI’s indebtedness and leverage could reduce its operational and
competitive flexibility, increase its vulnerability to adverse economic
and industry conditions, increase its interest costs and adversely
affect results of operations and cash flow.
ICI’s outstanding net indebtedness amounted to £1.67bn as of 
31 December 2002. ICI’s indebtedness could affect the Group in
adverse ways, in particular by requiring the Group to dedicate a
significant portion of its operational cash flow to service payments
on such indebtedness, and by limiting its ability to borrow additional
funds or refinance existing indebtedness on attractive terms.
Furthermore, its indebtedness could increase its vulnerability to
adverse economic and industry conditions, limit its ability to fund
future capital expenditures, research and development and other
general corporate requirements and limit its flexibility to react to
changes in its business and the industries in which the Group operates. 120
ICI ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS AND FORM 20-F 2002
RISK FACTORS continued
In addition, like many other companies, ICI is dependent on its ability
to obtain short-term financing to fund a portion of its financing
requirements. While ICI has access to £1.5bn in committed and
undrawn bank facilities as of 31 December 2002, any limitation on its
ability to access short-term financing could increase its interest costs
and could adversely affect its results of operations and cash flow.
A decision by the rating agencies to downgrade ICI’s credit rating
would reduce its funding options, increase its cost of borrowings
and have an adverse impact on results of operations and cash flow.
The Group is currently rated investment grade by the major U.S. rating
agencies. A number of factors, some of which are not within its
control, may, individually or in combination, affect the rating agencies’
view of the Group’s credit profile and lead them to place the Group on
credit watch or downgrade its credit rating, including:
• the failure to receive sales proceeds from the disposal of non-core
businesses or assets within a time period acceptable to the rating
agencies,
• a significant deterioration in the Group’s trading position,
• a significant deterioration in the economic environment in which the
Group operates,
• the incurrence of substantial costs arising from the Group’s
contingent liabilities, or
• the occurrence of any of the events described in the other risk
factors contained in this Annual Report and Accounts and Form 20-F.
Any downgrade of the Group’s credit rating would reduce its funding
options, including a loss of access to the major commercial paper and
money markets, significantly increase its cost of borrowings and have
an adverse effect on results of operations and cash flow.
Recently disposed businesses may expose ICI to costs that could
have an adverse effect on its results of operations, cash flow and
financial condition.
In recent years, ICI has carried out a programme of strategic
disposals, in the course of which it has given to other parties in those
transactions certain indemnities, warranties and guarantees, including
indemnities, warranties and guarantees relating to known and
potential latent environmental, health and safety liabilities. There are
also a number of contracts relating to businesses that ICI exited as
part of its disposal programme which have not been novated to the
purchasers of these businesses.
In connection with the Group’s disposal of its Chlor-Chemicals
business to Ineos Chlor, Ineos Chlor has made a £65 million claim
against the Group relating to expenditures allegedly required on the
Runcorn site, which the Group is disputing. As yet, legal proceedings
have not been commenced by Ineos Chlor but it is possible that they
will be in the near future. Ineos Chlor has also approached the UK
Department of Trade and Industry to seek Regional Selective
Assistance for certain capital projects and is also seeking financial
support from its parent company and ICI. The Group has received
reports that Ineos Chlor may seek to close part or all of its business if
this financial support is not forthcoming. If such a closure were to
occur, a number of Chlor-Chemicals contracts in ICI’s name which
have not yet been novated to Ineos Chlor and certain environmental
liabilities could revert to ICI or be accelerated.
In connection with the sale of ICI’s interests in Teesside Gas
Transportation Ltd and Teesside Power Ltd, the Group received 
counter guarantees from Enron Corp. for guarantees that it had given
(and which currently remain in place) for certain pipeline capacity and
gas purchase contracts. While the two businesses for which ICI have
provided these guarantees continue to operate normally, Enron Corp.
has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the United States. As
of 31 December 2002, the estimate of the Group’s maximum potential
liability under these guarantees was £448m.
The extent to which ICI will be required in the future to incur costs
under any of the indemnifications, warranties, guarantees or contracts
discussed above or any similar contractual provision which the Group
entered into in connection with its disposal programme, is not
predictable and, if the Group should incur such costs, the costs could
have an adverse effect on results of operations, cash flow and
financial condition.
On 17 June 2002, ICI announced it had reached agreement with CSFB
Global Opportunities Partners L.P. (now Matlin Patterson Global
Opportunities Partners L.P.) for the sale of ICI’s interests in Huntsman
International Holdings LLP. US$160m has been received to date with a
further US$280m due prior to 15 May 2003. Any delay or failure by
Matlin Patterson Global Opportunities Partners L.P. in completing this
purchase, or in the event of such a failure, any failure by Huntsman
Specialty Chemicals Corporation to complete the purchase of ICI’s
30% equity interest under the Option Agreement, could have an
adverse effect on the Group’s cash flow and financial condition.
Risks associated with the Group’s international operations could
adversely affect its results of operations.
ICI is an international business with operations located in over 50
countries and conducts business in many currencies. These
operations are subject to the risks associated with international
operations which include:
• slowdown or recession in global, regional or national economic
growth,
• tariffs and trade barriers,
• exchange controls,
• fluctuations in national currencies,
• social and political risks,
• national and regional labour disputes,
• required compliance with a variety of foreign laws, regulations and
standards, and
• the difficulty of enforcing legal claims and agreements through some
foreign legal systems.
Furthermore, ICI’s Regional and Industrial businesses are subject to
cyclical fluctuations in the industries and economies in which they
operate. Finally, like all international businesses ICI faces the risk of
exposure when costs arise in a different currency than sales and the
risk arising from the need to translate foreign currency denominated
profits into pounds sterling, the Group’s reporting currency. Any of the
risks discussed above could adversely affect its results of operations.
Economic, social and political conditions in developing economies
could adversely affect the Group’s results of operations and future
growth.
ICI has operations in many developing economies in Asia and Latin
America, and its strategy includes continuing to expand its business in
these regions. However, many developing economies have recent
histories of economic, social and political instability brought about by 
shareholder information
continued 121
a number of factors, including unexpected changes in local laws,
regulations and standards, substantial depreciation and volatility in
national currencies, the imposition of trade barriers, and wage and
price controls. In particular, ICI’s businesses in Argentina and Brazil
have been, and may continue to be, affected by recent economic
conditions in those countries. Any of these factors could adversely
affect ICI’s results of operations and future growth.
ICI’s exposure to consumer markets exposes it to legal risks,
regulation and potential liabilities from product liability claims
asserted by consumers which could have an adverse effect on
results of operations and financial condition.
A significant proportion of the Group’s products is sold directly or
indirectly to end-user consumers, even if it does not itself provide
these products directly to consumers. This exposure to consumer
markets exposes the Group to legal risks, regulation by relevant
authorities and potential liabilities to consumers of these products,
which may not be covered by the Group’s existing insurance coverage
or may exceed its insurance coverage. Any of these factors could
have an adverse effect on the Group’s results of operations and
financial condition.
Certain companies in the Group are defendants in various lawsuits
which, if successfully asserted against them, could have an adverse
effect on its results of operations and financial condition.
Certain companies in the Group are defendants in various lawsuits.
These lawsuits concern issues such as alleged product liability,
contract disputes and property damage matters. For a more detailed
discussion of these lawsuits, see note 40 to the consolidated financial
statements.
One of ICI’s subsidiaries, Glidden, is a defendant, along with other
former lead paint and pigment producers as well as other lead related
products manufacturers and their trade associations, in a number of
lawsuits in the United States, including a class action lawsuit and two
lawsuits by municipal authorities. Lawsuits have been served on
Glidden because an alleged predecessor company of Glidden
manufactured lead pigments until the 1950’s and lead-based
consumer paints until the 1960’s. Due to the nature of the suits,
Glidden is unable to quantify the amount being claimed although the
suits are likely to involve substantial claims for damages. These
lawsuits relate to alleged injury caused by lead related products or for
the costs of removing lead-based paint.  Rulings adverse to Glidden or
other defendants could lead to additional claims. 
The successful assertion of claims made under these or other current
or future lawsuits could have an adverse effect on the Group’s results
of operations and financial condition.
Violations of environmental, health and safety and other laws,
regulations and standards could restrict the Group’s operations,
expose it to liability, increase its costs and have an adverse effect
on its results of operations, cash flow and financial condition.
ICI is subject to a broad range of laws, regulations and standards in
each of the jurisdictions where it operates, relating to pollution, the
health and safety of employees, protection of the public, protection of
the environment and the generation, storage, handling, transportation,
treatment, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and
waste materials. These regulations and standards are becoming
increasingly stringent. For example, the U.S. Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, or CERCLA,
imposes liability, without regard to fault or the legality of a party’s
conduct, on certain categories of persons (known as “potentially
responsible parties”) who are considered to have contributed to the
release of hazardous substances into the environment.
In the ordinary course of business ICI is subject to inspections and
monitoring by the appropriate enforcement authorities. ICI also
requires relevant permits and approvals for its operations which
require compliance with their terms and which may be subject to
renewal, modification and, in some circumstances, revocation.
It is the Group’s policy to require that its subsidiaries comply with
relevant laws, regulations and standards. However, violations of
applicable laws, regulations and standards, in particular provisions of
environmental, health and safety laws (including spills or other
releases of hazardous substances to the environment) or of permit or
approval requirements, could result in restrictions on the operation of
the Group’s facilities, damages, fines or other sanctions, increased
costs of compliance as well as reputational damage. ICI is also subject
to environmental laws and regulations, principally in respect of soil and
groundwater remediation, that in the future may require it to take
action to correct effects on the environment of prior disposal or
release of chemical substances by the Group or other parties.
ICI has established provisions in respect of future environmental,
health and safety liabilities that are not covered by enforceable
indemnities from third parties, for which expenditure is probable and
the cost of which can be estimated within a reasonable range of
outcomes. These actual and potential liabilities, however, are
inherently difficult to predict and to quantify. Existing provisions could
therefore be inadequate to cover these liabilities, and additional costs
to meet such actual and potential obligations could have an adverse
effect on the Group’s results of operations, cash flow and financial
condition.
ICI has given undertakings and guarantees relating to pension
funds, including the solvency of the ICI UK Pension Fund, which
could have an adverse effect on its results of operations and cash
flow.
ICI provides retirement benefits for the majority of its former and
current employees through a variety of defined benefit and defined
contribution schemes. These include the ICI UK Pension Fund, which
is ICI’s largest defined benefit scheme and which, at 31 December
2002, had liabilities of approximately £6.5bn. This fund accounts for
approximately 87% of ICI’s retirement benefit schemes by asset value
and projected benefit terms and covers approximately 82,000 former
and current employees in the UK.
ICI has guaranteed the solvency of the ICI UK Pension Fund. Based on
the last actuarial valuation at 31 March 2000 which included funding
shortfalls amounting to 2% of the liabilities ICI is currently making
additional contributions to it of £30m per year until 31 March 2006 to
cover past funding shortfalls. A further actuarial valuation is due to
take place at 31 March 2003. At 31 December 2002, over 75% of the
fund’s assets were invested in fixed-income securities, which should
reduce volatility in the market value of the fund. The balance of the
fund’s assets were invested almost exclusively in equities.
Accordingly, ICI is exposed to the financial performance of its
retirement benefit schemes and particularly to the financial
performance of the ICI UK Pension Fund. In the event that the market
value of the ICI UK Pension Fund’s assets declines in relation to its
liabilities, ICI may be required, including as a consequence of the
31 March 2003 actuarial valuation, to increase its additional
contributions to cover any further funding shortfalls in the ICI UK
Pension Fund. This could have an adverse impact on the Group’s
results of operations and cash flow. 122
ICI ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS AND FORM 20-F 2002
Material contracts
The following material contracts (not being contracts entered into in
the ordinary course of business) have been entered into by a member
of the Group within the period of two years to February 2003.
(a) an agreement dated 20 December 2001 among (1) ICI, (2) ICI Alta
Inc. (“ICI Alta”), and (3) Huntsman Specialty Chemicals Corporation
(“HSCC”) amending certain terms of the option agreement dated
2 November 2000 (the “Option Agreement”) in relation to the
completion of ICI’s put option and providing that, subject to the
satisfaction of certain conditions (principally regulatory), HSCC
would acquire the 30% equity interest held by ICI Alta in HIH for
a basic purchase price of $365m (together with an amount
equivalent to interest from December 2001 until completion),
payable in the third quarter of 2003. An additional amount of
$32.7m would be payable unless HSCC exercised its right to
complete the purchase at the beginning of the third quarter of
2003. The amount payable may separately be reduced by up
to $20m if HSCC makes advance payments. In support of its
obligations under the Option Agreement, HSCC pledged to ICI
half of its 60% equity interest in HIH;
(b) an Underwriting Agreement dated 4 February 2002 between ICI
and UBS Warburg, Goldman Sachs and Merrill Lynch (together
the “Underwriters”), pursuant to which the Underwriters agreed,
subject to certain conditions, to underwrite the new ICI Shares to
be issued pursuant to the Rights Issue up to a maximum amount
of 463,277,500 new ICI Shares. The Underwriting Agreement
contained warranties, undertakings and indemnities given by ICI
in favour of the Underwriters;
(c) a Sale and Purchase Agreement dated 14 June 2002 among 
(1) ICI, (2) ICI Americas Inc., (3) ICI Alta, (4) ICI Finance PLC, 
(5) BNAC, Inc. and (6) CSFB Global Opportunities Partners, L.P.
(now Matlin Patterson Global Opportunities Partners L.P.) for the
sale of ICI’s interests in HIH, which comprise (A) a holding of
subordinated loan notes in HIH (the “HIH Notes”) and (B) ICI Alta
which holds ICI’s 30% equity interest in HIH and ICI’s rights under
the Option Agreement. The sale of ICI Alta (and the indirect transfer
of ICI’s 30% equity interest in HIH) is permitted by the Option
Agreement and is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions
(principally regulatory). The aggregate purchase price for the HIH
Notes and ICI Alta is $440m before interest. Of this amount,
$160m has been received. The remaining $280m (with an amount
equivalent to interest from 15 May 2002 to the date of payment)
will be payable on 15 May 2003, with the purchaser having the
option to pay all or part of the amount due prior to 15 May 2003 by
means of instalment payments. Ownership of the HIH Notes has
been transferred, subject to the pledge below, and ownership of
ICI Alta will be transferred when the full purchase price has been
received. As security for a portion of the outstanding purchase
price, the HIH Notes have been pledged back to ICI, otherwise the
agreement is effectively without recourse to Matlin Patterson Global
Opportunities Partners L.P. This pledge will be released when ICI
has received in aggregate at least $260m of the total purchase
price. When ICI has received at least $350m of the total purchase
price, ICI will release ICI Alta’s existing pledge over 21% of the 30%
equity interest in HIH pledged to ICI by HSCC and reduce the
amount due from HSCC to ICI Alta under the Option Agreement by
approximately 50%. If no instalment payments are made, the
Option Agreement will remain in place on its existing terms; and
(d) an agreement dated 23 September 2002 between (1) ICI and 
(2) Johnson Matthey Public Limited Company (“Purchaser”) for 
the sale of the Synetix Business of ICI and its subsidiaries and

Radioactive Diagnostic Services Canada, Inc. The total
consideration for the transaction was £260m of which ICI received
£241m on 1 November 2002 with £19m being paid to ICI India
Limited on 2 December 2002 in respect of that part of the Synetix
Business which was operated by ICI India Limited. The agreement
contains various warranties indemnities and covenants made by ICI
for the benefit of the Purchaser;

The following table sets forth, for the years, months and dates
indicated, the noon buying rate in New York City for cable transfers in

The noon buying rate on 19 February 2003 was $1.60 = £1
(1) All figures have been taken directly or derived from figures released
through the Public Information Office of the Federal Reserve in
Washington, D.C. or New York City.
(2) The noon buying rate on such dates differed from the rates used in
preparation of the Group’s financial statements as of such dates.
(3) The average is the average of the noon buying rate on the last day of
each month during the period indicated.
Fluctuations in the exchange rate between the pound sterling and
the US dollar will affect the US dollar equivalent of the pound sterling
prices of the Ordinary Shares of Imperial Chemical Industries PLC on
the London Stock Exchange and, as a result, will affect the market
prices of ADSs on the New York Stock Exchange. Cash dividends, 
if any, will be paid by the Company in respect of Ordinary Shares in
pounds sterling, and exchange rate fluctuations will affect the US
dollar amounts received by holders of ADSs on conversion by the
Depositary of such dividends.
A substantial proportion of the Group’s assets, liabilities, revenues and
expenses are denominated in currencies other than pounds sterling.
Accordingly, fluctuations in the value of the pound sterling relative to
other currencies can have a significant effect on the translation into
sterling of non-sterling assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses (see
Operating and financial review, page 23). In this document the following words and expressions shall, unless the context otherwise requires, have the following meanings:
ADR American Depositary Receipt evidencing title to an ADS
ADS American Depositary Share representing four underlying Ordinary Shares 
of Imperial Chemical Industries PLC
bn billion – 1,000 million
Company Imperial Chemical Industries PLC
Comparable performance References to “comparable” performance excludes the effect of currency translation differences and 
the impact of acquisitions and divestments on the results reported by the International Businesses.
Performance is measured on a consistent basis over two or more financial periods. Comparable results 
for both 2002 and 2001 are translated at constant exchange rates, which equate to the annual average
exchange rates for 2000, and exclude the results of divested businesses and the impact of acquired
businesses from the relevant periods.

Directors The Directors of Imperial Chemical Industries PLC
EBIT Profit on ordinary activities before interest and taxation
Earnings before interest, tax, 
depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) ICI defines EBITDA as trading profit before interest, tax, depreciation and goodwill amortisation. ICI’s total
depreciation before exceptional asset write-downs was £196m (2001 continuing operations £209m; 2000
continuing operations £199m and discontinued operations £34m). Management believes EBITDA and related
measures of cashflow serve as important financial indicators. However, EBITDA should not be considered in
isolation, or as an alternative to operating or net income or cash flows from operating activities, in each case,
determined in accordance with UK or US GAAP as appropriate.
Effective tax rate Effective tax rate is calculated as taxation (excluding tax on exceptional items) divided by
profit before tax, before goodwill amortisation and exceptional items.
ESOP Employee Share Ownership Plan
FRS Financial Reporting Standard (UK)
ICI, ICI Group or the Group Imperial Chemical Industries PLC and its subsidiaries
Interest cover Calculations of interest cover are based on the sum of ICI’s trading profit before goodwill
and exceptional items and net associate company income (associate trading profit less associate
interest) divided by ICI’s interest cost (excluding associate interest).

Includes Synetix catalyst business, divested in 2002. LORD TROTMAN CHAIRMAN BRENDAN O’NEILL CHIEF EXECUTIVE Our mission is to be the vital
ingredient for our customers,
consumers, employees,
communities, and the
environment, making ICI a vital
part of our investors’ portfolio.
Our vision is to be the industry
leader in creating value for
customers and shareholders. 6
chairman’s statement
mainly due to business disposals and exchange translation effects.
Proﬁt before tax at £400m was essentially the same as in 2001 
and earnings per share for 2002 were 23.7p, both quoted before
goodwill amortisation and exceptional items. The dividend for the
year was 7.5p.
As we look to 2003, we believe it would be prudent to assume that
the competitive environment will continue to be challenging and
that high levels of customer satisfaction will require the very
highest levels of quality, value and technology. This standard of
performance must be achieved with world-class productivity and
overall business efﬁciency to achieve satisfactory ﬁnancial results.
The ICI team is dedicated to achieving these imperatives. We have
a highly skilled and motivated management and workforce and
immense technological capability. Our products number in the tens
of thousands and we compete in a wide range of market
segments, including food, personal care, home improvement and
adhesives. We believe that our extensive product and technology
base provides us with a solid foundation on which to build. As in
2002, the efﬁcient use of capital will be of the highest priority. We
will continue to compete vigorously in all of the world’s major
market places and will place particular emphasis on the high
growth countries.
And ﬁnally, a comment on governance. ICI has a long history of
adhering to a strong ethical code. It is a tradition of which we are
proud and, as custodians of that tradition, we are deeply conscious
of the trust that you have placed in us. I want to assure you that
your Board of Directors continues to be dedicated to the highest
standards of corporate governance, ﬁnancial control and reporting.
I would like to thank you again for your support for the Rights Issue
in early 2002 and, on behalf of the entire ICI team, give you our
pledge that we will continue to do all in our power to deliver value
to you, our shareholders.
As we looked ahead at the beginning of 2002, we shared the
widespread optimism that we would see a recovery in the
major economies around the globe, stronger stock markets
and rising consumer conﬁdence. Instead, as the year
progressed, it became clear that 2002 would be another very
challenging year for business. The majority of our major
markets, with the notable exception of China, experienced
little or no economic growth and fragile consumer conﬁdence.
The weakness in global stock markets and the effect on individual
and household net worth and consumer sentiment gave cause for
widespread concern, as did the continuing anxiety over the threat
of terrorism and, particularly in the latter half of the year, the
increased threat to global security.
When one adds to this mix of negative factors, the shocking
revelations of corporate malfeasance and large corporate 
failures, principally in the United States, during the year, it is
perhaps surprising that consumer behaviour was not even more
seriously affected.
With this as the geo-political and economic backdrop, I am
pleased to record that ICI ﬁnished the year in sounder shape,
ﬁnancially, than it was a year earlier. Thanks to strong shareholder
support for the Rights Issue in the ﬁrst quarter, combined with the
proceeds from the sale of assets and tightly focused management
of working capital, your Company’s balance sheet has been
substantially strengthened. These actions to reduce Group debt
were successful in protecting our credit rating. With the actions
taken during 2002 behind us, the shape and structure of the Group
is now essentially set and our primary focus for the future will be on
the growth and development of our International Businesses.
Despite the weak economic environment, the International
Businesses turned in a creditable performance. The Group
achieved sales of £6,125m in 2002, 5% lower than in 2001, 
Lord Trotman Chairman 7
chief executive’s statement
lower, on a comparable basis. Given the weakness in most major
Western economies, this was a creditable performance. Overall
gross margin percentages in the International Businesses were
maintained at last year’s level and ﬁxed costs were well controlled.
The Group’s net operating cash ﬂow improved substantially for the
year, particularly with the beneﬁts of further working capital
efﬁciency improvements in the International Businesses.
The International Businesses achieved comparable sales growth 
in three regions of the world, with the strongest growth in Asia. 
The Group also performed well in North America and Europe, seen
against the backdrop of lower economic growth. And, whilst sales
in hard currency terms were down in Latin America, the signiﬁcant
weakening of the exchange rates in Argentina and Brazil were
primary contributors to this.
Paints once again led the way, despite the difﬁcult economic
conditions in Latin America, with continued double-digit sales and
proﬁt growth in Asia and good performances in both Europe and
North America.
National Starch improved sales and proﬁt with excellent progress
in Asia and a return to growth in North America. Its electronics
businesses grew sales by 6% in difﬁcult markets and, in the
second half, adhesives returned to top-line growth. Food and
Industrial Starches and Specialty Synthetic Polymers also delivered
good sales growth.
Uniqema made a weak start to the year, with industrial demand
down. The picture improved somewhat as the year progressed,
but year-on-year comparable proﬁts fell 24%, although the high
growth potential areas of lubricants and personal care were more
encouraging, with sales growth of 9% and 4% respectively.
Quest achieved good sales growth in North America and Asia. 
Fine fragrances performed particularly strongly. However, problems
2002 was a signiﬁcant year for ICI and, although the hoped-
for global economic upturn did not materialise, we emerged 
in substantially better shape than a year earlier.
The early months of the year were dominated by the successful
execution of the Rights Issue, which raised net proceeds of just
over £800m, making it one of the largest to date in London. 
It received excellent and much appreciated support, with
shareholders taking up more than 91% of the rights. Once again,
I’d like to thank shareholders for conﬁrming their conﬁdence that
ICI’s strategy is the right one to deliver long-term success.
The intended sale of Synetix, our catalyst business, was
announced in February. A sale agreement with Johnson Matthey
was concluded in September and the divestment was subsequently
completed with gross proceeds of £260m. In June we also
reached agreement with CSFB Global Opportunities Partners for
the sale of ICI’s interest in Huntsman International Holdings. 
We received an initial cash payment of $160m (£109m) with the
balance of $280m (£174m) payable before the end of May 2003.
The combination of the Rights Issue, divestment proceeds and our
success in improving organic cash generation, reduced the level 
of year-end debt from almost £3bn in 2001 to less than £1.7bn in
2002. Interest cover for the year rose from 3.5 to 4.3 times.
With structurally lower levels of debt, ICI exited 2002 with a
balance sheet that provides a solid foundation from which to grow
the proﬁt of our core specialty products and paints businesses.
Performance 2002
In performance terms, our businesses once again demonstrated
resilience in economically difﬁcult times. Proﬁt before tax, goodwill
amortisation and exceptional items of £400m was only £1m lower
than last year. Our International Businesses delivered comparable
sales growth of 1% and trading proﬁt of £543m that was only 1% chief executive’s statement continued
instant success in the UK. Our science and technology function
continues to enhance its reputation. National Starch researchers,
for example, are working with the US Army Research Laboratories
developing sealants and encapsulants to protect tomorrow’s
ﬂexible ﬂat screens from moisture and oxygen. Some of our largest
global customers have expressed interest in understanding how
ICI businesses’ technology and know-how might be leveraged in
collaborations to generate long-term added value for their product
development programmes.
ICI is focused on growth and we have an increasing number of
people in the regions with signiﬁcant potential. In China, an
important growth market, we now have 1,400 employees, up from
some 900 only four years ago, and we continue to invest in
manufacturing and marketing facilities in the country. ICI is global,
but our success is often built on local management able to
understand and respond to local consumer and customer
requirements.
In May we published “The ICI Report on the Secrets of the
Senses”, Dr Charles Spence of Oxford University’s ground
breaking research into the importance of sensory experience for
health and emotional wellbeing. This helped focus attention on
ICI’s expertise in the growth areas of the science of sight, scent,
taste and touch, the heart of our business today.
Our people
In conclusion, I want to thank our employees all around the world for
the dedication and effort that delivered commendable results under
difﬁcult conditions. When the tide turns, I know we will be ready.
in the second quarter with new supply chain systems caused an
order backlog at our major Food site in the Netherlands. Although
the problem was largely rectiﬁed by October, production was
disrupted for a period. Quest is determined to restore its reputation
for excellent customer service.
For our Regional and Industrial businesses, higher proﬁts in
Pakistan and Argentina were offset by the loss of proﬁts from
divested businesses and a legal provision.
Despite the respectable overall performance, I regret that I cannot
report the improvement in ICI’s share price for which we are all
working. Against our selected peer group, our ranking in terms of
Total Shareholder Return remained 13 of 17. This performance is
disappointing. The Board and I continue to believe that ICI has all
the necessary components for an improved placing and are
committed to achieving that improvement.
I remain convinced that, given the improved strength of our
balance sheet, our stated goals – organic sales growth of 4 to 5%
(1 to 2% above global GDP), plus another 1 to 2% growth from
synergistic bolt-on acquisitions – are achievable, once economies
improve. We believe that this, in combination with improved
operational effectiveness, will provide the basis for consistent,
longer-term proﬁt growth.
Exciting progress
We’re already making progress on a number of fronts. We are
launching innovative new products across the Group, such as
Paints’ one-coat elastomeric ‘Polycell Basecoat’, which was an

and costs down in 2003.
9 driving success through
creative people
Being a great place for great people to work is one of ICI’s goals. People are the vital ingredient for our success,
this year, next year and every year. Joining one of ICI’s businesses opens up a world of opportunities that spans
consumer and business-to-business industries around the globe. With some 100 operating units, manufacturing
and selling over 50,000 products in more than 55 countries, an ICI career can offer a great diversity of work
experience. 
scent of an artist 
Today there’s no such person as a “typical” 
ICI employee. Creative and ﬂamboyant,
Rodrigo Flores-Roux was born in Mexico,
trained in France, and now lives and works 
in New York, where he is one of Quest’s top
perfumers specialising in ﬁne fragrances.
Bob Golownia, formulation chemist,
spent part of his Christmas break
testing Dulux ‘Fortis’ exterior paint in
35°F weather to make certain that
applying it in cold, wet conditions did
not impair the ﬁnish. It was typical of
the attention to detail behind the
hugely successful launch of ‘Fortis’
into the US trade sector in spring
2002. Members from the 25-strong
team of research and development,
manufacturing, market research,
ﬁnance and sales people visited all 
50 states and left no stone unturned
to ensure the products delivered the
goods from Alaska to the Everglades. 11
An extraordinary range of talent
Interior designers, perfume “noses”, bakers, chefs and food
ﬂavourists, webmasters, and oil exploration technicians are hardly
typical employees for a specialty products and paints company.
Yet, within ICI, they are as vital as sales and marketing people,
production teams, chemists, engineers, technologists, IT
specialists and administrators in getting things done. 
Getting the best from such a diverse mix of skills and disciplines
requires strong leadership within a performance culture. The Group
addresses management and leadership development globally, with
a three-tier management training and leadership programme
designed to groom people for the next level of responsibility. It is a
process that aims to turn promising young professionals into team
leaders, then into seasoned managers with the skills and expertise
to run businesses and, ultimately, to provide a grounding in
developing strategy. 
Skill building programmes are underway across ICI as well as 
in every business and function. Training objectives are simple: 
to develop staff with the professional and team skills required for
optimum job performance and personal development, so that
competence and conﬁdence are enhanced at the same time as
ensuring that ICI operations are safe, stimulating and enjoyable
places to work. 
Boosting performance
In recent years, ICI has taken steps to ensure that staff rewards
reﬂect individual, team and business performance. Variable pay
schemes are in place for a growing proportion of our professional
and managerial employees, cementing the link between targets,
achievement and team and individual rewards. 
Outstanding people thrive on stimulation and challenge,
and the obvious reward for promising managers is early
responsibility. Catherine Bright joined ICI in ﬁnance as 
a group strategic planner in 1997, moved to Quest’s
Fragrance division as vice-president of ﬁnance in 1999,
and was promoted to manage fragrance development for
the home and personal care business six months later.
Now she’s running Uniqema’s personal care business
world-wide. 
Tony Suggitt keeps a bag packed in case one of
his customers – the major oil companies – needs
him at the well-head at short notice. Every oil
well and crude plant conﬁguration is unique so
standard solutions don’t work. Tony’s skill and
speed in formulating crude oil processing
ingredients for particular ﬁeld conditions is vital
to his customers’ business success in keeping
oil ﬂowing.
Angela Parkin’s wide-ranging
interest in the issues facing the
chemical industry has made her 
the UK chemical industry’s young
person of 2002. A research process
engineer specialising in the mixing
of complex ﬂuids at our Strategic
Technology Group, Angela has
worked with all four International
Businesses in less than two years
with ICI. She is currently acting as
an ambassador for the UK chemical
industry in addition to her ICI work.  12
growing stronger on
local knowledge 
Sticking close to the action
Our people know ﬁrsthand where economic activity is stirring and
where it’s slowing. In emerging markets, rising sales of packaging
adhesives are often the ﬁrst indicators of industrial growth. And
where adhesives lead, our other businesses follow. 
We were ready for the lift in China and India. These will continue 
to be growth markets, particularly for National Starch and Paints.
We remain convinced that Latin America, despite severe recession,
has exciting long term prospects. This year Quest opened a
creative studio in Brazil, which is emerging as a personal care
market with signiﬁcant growth potential. Central and Eastern
Europe is buoyant, all our businesses report, with household
appliance manufacturing showing particular strength for Uniqema. 
Cash rich, time poor 
It is human nature to want quality brands and advanced products
when prosperity makes them accessible to the mass market. 
But greater wealth often means less free time, hence the growth 
in eating out and prepared meals, sectors that ICI has targeted in
recent years and which have become sizeable markets in the
developed world. The food industry represented 14% of ICI sales
in 2002. The £110 billion personal care industry continues 
to grow fast around the world. 
Our diversity of products, customers and geographic markets 
has been a vital ingredient in ICI’s resilient performance in a
challenging year. 
Around the world ICI targets the industries, customer segments and national markets offering the greatest
potential for profitable growth. Innovative ideas, proprietary technology and knowledge and strong customer
relationships are key to success in every sector. Producers of consumer goods look to ICI for sensory signatures
like flavours and fragrances; industrial customers want specialty solutions and distinctive performance properties.
In developing economies, our experience of when and how to invest in new operations has resulted in a broad
geographic spread of businesses with strong market positions. 
ICI Paints’ rapid growth in Asia continues.
China, India, Indonesia and Vietnam are all
delivering double-digit growth in sales value,
while the longer-established operations in
Malaysia and Thailand continue to increase
volumes and market share. 
Uniqema’s ‘Cirrasol’ polypropylene ﬁbre-
ﬁnish developed for disposable nappies
(diapers) helps to keep the baby dry and
comfortable. The ﬁnish helps moisture 
to pass away more quickly from the skin
to the diaper’s absorbent core, resulting
in a signiﬁcantly improved product, and 
a happier baby. hairstyles that bounce back 
Every woman wants fabulous hair, even after 
a vigorous workout or a walk in wild weather. 
Our ‘DynamX’ polymers from National Starch, 
now being incorporated into styling products, 
give hair “shape memory”. Gels, mousses and
sprays with ‘DynamX’ technology combine free
movement and soft texture with lasting hold so
hair falls naturally back into place. The new
generation of products has great growth potential
and takes ICI beyond hair spray polymers into the
broader hair care sector, which ﬁlls millions of 
feet of retail shelf space worldwide. 
Consumers can ﬁnd painting areas of wood and metal
messy and difﬁcult. To make life easier, ICI Paints has
invented the easycan. Made from lightweight plastic,
easycan’s waisted shape is easier to hold, and the 
screw-top lid easier to open than standard paint pots.
Easycan also features a built-in brush rest and wipe. 
No fuss, less mess, pure innovation.
Quest virtually swept the board at Brazil’s
fragrance awards, winning several categories
including the best new men’s fragrance. We are
in great shape and getting stronger in body-
conscious Brazil, tipped to become the world’s
second largest personal care market by 2010.  bubbling out of 
the laboratory
ICI’s research pipeline has developed real momentum and it’s clear that ICI’s science skills and technology
investment strategy are bearing fruit. Three key technology platforms relevant to all our businesses – sensory
science, targeted delivery and high throughput experimentation – occupy centre stage, over and above the
research individual businesses perform in support of their specific product development and customer needs. 
ICI also calls on top academic experts for advice and guidance. 
fabulous foam 
Foam is everywhere in ICI and getting foam science right is vital to
success for all our businesses. Shampoo, beer, refrigerator lubricants,
bath oils, mousses (edible and otherwise), bread, paint and packaging
materials are just some of the foam applications that ICI businesses 
are investigating. Better understanding of the creation, elimination 
and control of foams and foaming could reveal further opportunities, 
like creamy foams that don’t sting the eyes for use in personal care
products. In addition to this research, our central science group is using
high throughput screening techniques to study visual aspects of foam. 
Products from ICI have therapeutic beneﬁts in satisfying
sensory needs often overlooked by modern society.
According to “The ICI Report on the Secrets of the
Senses”, by Dr Charles Spence of Oxford University, 
a craving for colour, taste, scent and touch is essential
for emotional health as well as physical wellbeing. 
Dr Spence, one of the world’s leading authorities in
experimental psychology of the human senses, sees 
ICI at the forefront of a revolution in multi-sensory
understanding and application, christened sensism.  15
Sensory science
That colour, scent, taste and texture are powerful feel-good factors
has been known since time began. ICI undertakes and sponsors
research into physiological responses to sensory stimuli to
establish how the senses affect human health and emotions.
Armed with this knowledge, we can tailor molecules that target
visual, smell, taste and touch receptors with precision. This helps
our customers to package sensory pleasure to relieve the stresses 
of modern life, making people healthier and more productive.
Intelligent materials 
Materials science underpins about two-thirds of ICI sales. Using
concepts borrowed from nature, ICI is developing new composite
synthetic materials with complex microstructures to improve on
nature; scuff-resistant acrylic-reinforced paints are an example.
Such work centres on the study of polymer architecture and ﬁnal
physical form. The goal is to provide customers with control over
effects, such as delaying the release of fragrance molecules in
detergents until laundry is dried or ironed, or protecting ﬂavours
until water is added. 
Fast chemistry
High throughput experimentation is a technique, adopted by ICI
three years ago, that uses miniaturised, automated equipment to
accelerate screening the properties of thousands of chemical
formulations, enabling chemists to explore many more possibilities
at much lower cost than formerly. Time to discovery is reduced
and the number of choices is increased so our businesses can
respond quicker to market and customer challenges.
From the lab to the customer 
A new phase began in spring 2002 when the Group’s technology
team launched an initiative to strengthen and widen scientists’
connections with commercial and marketing teams across ICI. 
As well as inspiring ideas for new product development or market
applications within ICI, wider understanding of the Group’s newest
technology identiﬁes more opportunities to offer additional
customer beneﬁts. As a result, ICI is better leveraging its
technology investment, a vital ingredient in the creation of 
the next generation of products. 
Chosen for jewellery because it doesn’t corrode or
tarnish, gold is an almost inert metal. Managing heat
stress is critical in computers and telecommunication
devices. In close collaboration with customers,
Emerson & Cuming developed gold-ﬁlled thermal
interface material delivering the reliability needed for
ground-to-space data transmission in satellites.
Replacing silver with gold eliminates the risk of
corrosion from water vapour trapped in the device 
and manages extreme temperatures too. It’s also 
easier and, surprisingly, cheaper to use.
Materials are also the passion of Dr Paul Calvert,
Professor of Materials Science and Engineering 
at the University of Arizona and formerly at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology. As aspects
of Dr Calvert’s pioneering research promise to be
of signiﬁcant value for ICI businesses, we take his
blue-sky science very seriously indeed and
welcome Paul as a key science adviser to ICI. 
Tony Ryan, the new ICI Professor of Physical Chemistry 
at Shefﬁeld University in the UK, believes science should
aim to improve on natural materials. He’s fascinated by 
the physics and chemistry of creating new effects from
polymers and surfactants, and committed to sharing his
excitement. In a series of TV lectures, seen in Asia as 
well as the UK, he showed the molecular miracles behind
everyday objects, including trainers, mobile phones, ice
cream, soap, shampoo and sticking plasters (band-aids). 16
sustaining our future
Sustainable development means meeting our needs today without compromising the ability of future generations
to meet theirs. Reducing the environmental impact of its business activities is ingrained in ICI’s thinking, as is
growing profits. For decades our operations have sought ways to be both successful and responsible. 
programmes include working with our suppliers to achieve
equivalent standards as part of our overall life cycle approach. 
We also want our activities to support the wider community. 
Our businesses all over the world help with health care and
education, building local infrastructure, funding clinics, environmental
projects, sponsoring schools and ﬁnancing tuition and books for
disadvantaged students. In countries where educational provision
is limited, such programmes beneﬁt everyone, including ICI, by
improving the availability of skilled talent. 
Still strong on SHE
For more than a decade ICI has been signiﬁcantly reducing its
environmental impact, a process accelerated by the transformation
of the business portfolio. Equally the improvement in our health and
safety performance has been substantial, putting us among the
best. We maintain our focus on SHE and, in the second year 
of our current ﬁve-year programme, are on plan to meet the majority
of our Challenge 2005 objectives and have actions in place to
address those areas where we are behind. Full details are published
in our Sustainability Report and on our website, www.ici.com.
“Stimulating Young Minds” is a global
programme that encourages ICI staff to
become involved in science education
with schools and colleges, helping
teachers and students make the
connection between science classes
and the products that they use daily.
From Bridgewater, New Jersey, to
Yokohama, Japan; Mumbai, India 
to Gouda in the Netherlands, ICI’s
educational liaison is an important
contribution to community relations. 
National Starch’s Hazleton adhesives plant in
Pennsylvania began a waste water recycling
programme in 2001 that has cut water efﬂuent by
70%. Now the plant also treats a neighbouring
factory’s waste water, generating revenue for the
business and, with capacity to spare, is talking to
other potential customers. 
ICI recognises that reputation is a vital ingredient in business
performance. Our “licence to operate” requires that we follow
sound and principled environmental and social practices. 
Our record is acknowledged by socially responsible investment
funds and places us among the leaders in the chemical sector; 
the Group is a benchmark in some rankings. Our policy is to conduct
business responsibly, with integrity and with respect for the interests
of all those affected by our operations. We believe our activities
should generate economic beneﬁts; create opportunities for an
enhanced quality of life; respect the environment, and be a positive
inﬂuence on the community everywhere we operate. We are
developing social investment equivalents for our highly regarded
Safety, Health and Environmental (SHE) performance metrics. 
Ethics and effectiveness
All ICI research and development is about improving standards
including activities such as ﬁnding renewable resources, safer or
superior substitute materials, or production methods that are
energy-efﬁcient and reduce waste. Our product stewardship Sensory enjoyment is so central to
today’s ICI that we’ve become attuned
to the difﬁculties of anyone lacking full
use of the senses. We recently adopted
Sense, representing people who are
both deaf and blind, as our corporate
relationship charity. ICI lends its name
and proﬁle to help Sense generate
media attention for its work and
increase awareness of the challenges
that deafblind individuals face.

cleaning up dry cleaning 
Uniqema, working with Linde Gas, has
developed a “green” dry cleaning process.
Washpoint reduces the environmental and
health concerns associated with traditional dry
cleaning methods. Pressurised carbon dioxide
(CO

booster gives excellent cleaning results on
fabrics and leather. Washpoint also consumes
less energy, smells better and poses lower 
risk to the environment, the workforce or 
the consumer. With dry cleaners almost
everywhere in Europe and America, there’s 
an opportunity for Uniqema to clean up.  18
around the world with
50,000 products
Many of the products ICI makes and markets around the world today are specialty added-value formulations for
speciﬁc applications. Our products for industrial use are often customised for particular manufacturing plants or
process requirements. From paint to soft drink cans, air fresheners to snack ﬂavours, seed coatings to food
packaging, oilﬁeld drilling ﬂuids to automotive lubricant, construction components to high tech electronic gadgetry,
factories, ofﬁces, hospitals and homes around the world contain products incorporating ICI ingredients. Creative
marketing, detailed local or customer knowledge, in-depth application understanding and advanced technology are
the other vital ingredients.

Some 70% of Uruguayans live in houses with ﬂat asphalt roofs.
Many want to use the roof as extra outdoor living space in summer
but don’t, fearing that walking on the roof might make it leak. In
2002, the local ICI Paints business launched a new formula
elastomeric waterprooﬁng paint that was tough enough to walk on
and pleasantly springy underfoot. When the advertising campaign
ran, sales went through the roof, with volumes almost ﬁve times
greater than those of the original waterproof paint in 2001.

corporate governance
Corporate governance
The Group is committed to high standards of
corporate governance. The Board is accountable
to the Company’s shareholders for good
governance and this statement describes how
the relevant principles of governance are applied
to the Company. Throughout the year the
Company has been in compliance with the
provisions set out in the Combined Code for
Corporate Governance appended to the
Financial Services Authority Listing Rules.
The ICI Board currently comprises the Non-
Executive Chairman, the Chief Executive, four
other Executive Directors and four Non-
Executive Directors including the Senior Non-
Executive Director, Lord Butler. Their biographies
appear on page 21. These demonstrate a range
of business, financial and global experience,
which is vital to the successful direction of a
multi-national company. All the Non-Executive
Directors are independent of management. 
The Board is balanced both numerically and 
in experience.
All Directors are equally accountable under the
law for the proper stewardship of the Company’s
affairs. The Non-Executive Directors have a
particular responsibility to ensure that the
strategies proposed by Executive Directors are
fully discussed and critically examined, not only
against the best long-term interests of
shareholders, but also to ensure that they take
proper account of the interests of employees,
customers, suppliers and the many communities
within which ICI is represented. The Non-
Executive Directors also test fully the operational
performance of the whole Group. The Board has
prescribed reserved powers which reinforce its
control of the Company. There is a procedure for
Directors to obtain independent professional
advice at the Company’s expense in the
performance of their duties as Directors.
To enable them to do this all Directors have full
and timely access to all relevant information. 
The Board meets at least eight times a year and
there is frequent contact between meetings to
progress the Company’s business.
The Non-Executive Directors fulfil a vital role in
corporate accountability. The remits and
memberships of the three relevant Board
Committees are set out on page 23. The
Remuneration and Nomination Committee and
the Audit Committee which comprise solely Non-
Executive Directors, meet at least quarterly and
report regularly to the Board.
Remuneration and Nomination Committee
The Chairman and Chief Executive are in
attendance at the Remuneration and Nomination
Committee for appropriate items but are always
excluded when their own performance and
remuneration are under review. The Chairman 
is not a member of the Remuneration and
Nomination Committee except when it meets 
as the Nomination Committee. He attends all
remuneration discussions except when his own
position is being discussed. The Chairman from
time to time promotes discussion with the
Executive Directors about Non-Executive
Directors’ remuneration based on external
comparisons. Any recommendations are tabled
to the full Board. Non-Executive Directors have
the option of taking part of their remuneration 
in the Company’s shares.
The Remuneration Report, on pages 24 to 27,
includes details on remuneration policy and
practices, and on the remuneration of Directors.
Lord Butler acts as the Company’s Senior Non-
Executive Director. In this position he promotes
discussion at appropriate times about the
Company chairmanship and succession to it.
The Non-Executive Directors normally meet
twice a year with the Chairman and Chief
Executive to discuss and evaluate Board and
individual Directors’ performance and succession
plans. At appropriate times the Chief Executive
and then the Chairman absent themselves so
their performance can be assessed. The final
discussion is led by the Senior Non-Executive
Director and there is feedback to individuals.
Appointments to Executive Director are fully
discussed by the Chairman and Chief Executive
with the Remuneration and Nomination
Committee before a proposal is formally made to
the Board by the Chairman of that Committee.
Possible new Non-Executive Directors are
suggested by all members of the Board against
the requirements of the Company’s business and
the need to have a balanced Board. In
appropriate cases recruitment consultants are
used to assist the process. Possible candidates
are discussed with all Directors before any
approach is made to them. All Directors are
subject to re-election at least every three years.
Audit and internal control
In accordance with the guidance for directors 
on internal control (The Turnbull Guidance), 
the Board confirm that there is a process for
identifying, evaluating and managing the
significant risks to the achievement of the 
Group’s strategic objectives. The process has
been in place throughout 2002 and up to the
date of approval of the Annual Report and
Accounts and Form 20-F, and accords with 
The Turnbull Guidance. The effectiveness of this
process has been reviewed regularly by the
Audit Committee who report their findings for
consideration by the Board.
The processes used by the Audit Committee to
review the effectiveness of the system of internal
control include:
• Discussions with management on risk areas
identified by management and/or the audit
process;
• The review of internal and external audit plans;
• The review of significant issues arising from
internal and external audits; and
• The review of significant Group risks reported by
the Group Risk Committee.
The Audit Committee reports to the Board the
results of their review of the risk assessment
process. The Board then draws its collective
conclusions as to the effectiveness of the
system of internal control.
The Group Risk Committee (GRC) consolidates
and prioritises for the Board the inputs received
from management of the Businesses and
corporate functions. The GRC comprises the
heads of major corporate functions, the Group
Internal Auditor and the General Counsel. The
GRC meets on a regular basis to review
updated input from business and corporate
management and to report its conclusions to 
the Audit Committee.
The internal audit function reviews internal
controls in all key activities of the ICI Group,
typically over a three year cycle. It acts as a
service to the Businesses by assisting with the
continuous improvement of controls and
procedures. Actions are agreed in response to
its recommendations and these are followed up
to ensure that satisfactory control is maintained.
Quarterly reviews are also conducted between
internal audit management and the senior
management of the Businesses and major
functions to assess their current control status
and to identify and address any areas of
concern.
The Board is responsible for maintaining and
reviewing the effectiveness of the Group’s
system of internal controls. The internal control
systems are designed to meet the Group’s  23
particular needs and the risks to which it is
exposed and are designed to manage rather
than eliminate the risk to the achievement of
business objectives and can only provide
reasonable and not absolute assurance against
misstatement or loss.
The Group’s strategic direction is regularly
reviewed by the Board, and the Executive
Management Team considers the strategy for
the individual Businesses through an integrated
disciplined process on a biennial basis.
Annual plans and performance targets for each
Business are set by the Chief Executive and are
reviewed in total by the Board in the light of the
Group’s overall objectives.
The processes to identify and manage the key
risks to the success of the Group are an integral
part of the internal control environment. Such
processes, which are reviewed and improved as
necessary, include strategic planning, the
appointment of senior managers, the regular
monitoring of performance, control over capital
expenditure and investments and the setting of
high standards and targets for safety, health and
environmental performance.
Within the financial and overall objectives for the
Group, agreed by the Board, the management
of the Group as a whole is delegated to the
Executive Management Team. The conduct of
ICI’s Businesses is delegated to the individual
Executive Vice Presidents. They are accountable
for the conduct and performance of their
Businesses within the agreed Business strategy.
They have full authority to act subject to the
reserved powers and sanctioning limits laid
down by the Board and to Group policies.
Businesses are responsible for meeting the
defined reporting timetables and compliance
with Group accounting manuals which set out
accounting policies, controls and definitions.
The Executive Management Team receives a
monthly summary of financial results from each
Business, and the Group’s published quarterly
financial information is based on a standardised
and timely reporting process.
There is a process in place which requires post
event reviews to be undertaken following the
completion of all major investments. This
process aims to improve the quality of business
judgements through the understanding and
experience gained.
Responsibility for monitoring compliance with
Group policies and guidelines rests with the
Executive Vice Presidents and Chief Executive
Officers for operating Businesses and with senior 
managers for the Corporate Centre. Annual
statements of compliance are provided to the
Board, and these statements are reviewed by
the relevant functional leader for each policy
area. In turn, there is an annual report to the
Audit Committee, on behalf of the Board, on 
the degree of compliance with Group policies
and guidelines. Corrections to any weaknesses
found are monitored and controls are developed
to match changing circumstances.
Sarbanes-Oxley Act 2002
The Company monitors its legal and regulatory
obligations following the enactment of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act in the United States. It is
the Company’s intention to comply with the legal
and regulatory requirements introduced pursuant
to this new legislation, in so far as they are
applicable to the Company.
Disclosure controls and procedures
In accordance with recommendations issued by
the US Securities and Exchange Commission,
the Company has established a Disclosure
Committee comprising appropriate senior
executives from the ICI corporate centre: the
Chief Financial Officer, the General Counsel, the
Company Secretary, the Group Internal Auditor,
the Investor Relations Director and the Group
Financial Controller. The Committee designs,
maintains and evaluates the Company’s
disclosure controls and procedures and reports
its evaluation to the Chief Executive and Chief
Financial Officer.
Principles of business conduct
As a leading international company, ICI’s
reputation for high ethical standards is central 
to its business success. A Code of Business
Conduct which provides guidance in this area
has been communicated throughout the Group.
Communications
Communications with shareholders are given
a high priority. The Annual Review is sent to
shareholders and a full Annual Report and
Accounts and Form 20-F is available on request.
In addition, at the half year, an interim report is
produced and sent to shareholders and the
quarterly results are published via the London
Stock Exchange and by press release. Individual
shareholders have the opportunity at the Annual
General Meeting to question the Chairman
directly. As an alternative, shareholders can
leave written questions for response by the
Company. After the Annual General Meeting,
shareholders can meet informally with the
Directors. There is regular dialogue with individual
institutional shareholders as well as presentations
to analysts after the quarterly results.

The following is a summary of the full
Remuneration Report that is contained in the 
ICI Annual Report and Accounts and Form 20-F
for 2002.
Remuneration Committee
Role and membership
The Remuneration Committee determines, 
on behalf of the Board, the Company’s policy 
on the remuneration of Executive Directors. 
The Committee determines the total
remuneration packages for these individuals
including any compensation on termination of
office. This provides the framework for
remunerating all senior executives.
The Remuneration Committee is comprised
exclusively of independent Non-Executive
Directors of the Company. The members of
the Remuneration Committee are shown on
page 23.
The Committee members have no personal
financial interest, other than as shareholders,
in the matters to be decided.
The constitution and operation of the Committee
comply with the Combined Code for Corporate
Governance of the Financial Services Authority.
Advisers
To ensure that ICI’s remuneration practices 
are market competitive, the Remuneration
Committee has access to detailed external
research on market data and trends from
independent and experienced international
consultants. Such advisers are appointed by the
Remuneration Committee. Where ICI executives
are invited to attend meetings to respond to
specific questions raised by the Committee in
respect of matters under consideration, this
specifically excludes any matter concerning the
detail of their own personal remuneration.
Remuneration policy
Executive Directors
The Company’s ongoing remuneration policy for
Executive Directors is to provide remuneration in
a form and amount which will attract, retain,
motivate and reward high calibre individuals. 
To achieve this, the remuneration package is
based upon the following principles:
• Incentives should align the interests of
executives and shareholders, reward the creation
of long-term value and minimise risk for
shareholders.
• Reward elements should be designed to
reinforce the link between performance and
reward. Performance related elements should
form a significant proportion of the total
remuneration package.
• The total remuneration package for on-target
performance should be fully competitive in the
relevant market.
• Packages can be structured flexibly to meet
critical resource needs and retain key
executives.
Personal shareholdings
In order to align the interests of our most senior
employees with those of shareholders, our
Executive Directors and senior executives are
expected to build up personal shareholdings of
ICI Ordinary Shares through the retention of
shares acquired via Company share-based
plans. For Executive Directors this shareholding
is as follows:
Target value
of shareholding
Chief Executive Two times base salary
Executive Directors One times base salary
External directorships
Executive Directors are encouraged to take an
external Non-Executive Directorship. In order to
avoid any conflict of interest all appointments
are subject to the approval of the Remuneration
Committee and the Board. Directors retain
payments received in respect of these
appointments.
Non-Executive Directors
The remuneration policy for Non-Executive
Directors is determined by the Board.
Remuneration comprises an annual fee for
acting as a Non-Executive Director and an
additional fee for acting as the Chairman of
a Board Committee or as the Senior
Non-Executive Director. Non-Executive Directors
are not eligible to participate in incentive
plans.
ICI operates a scheme which enables
Non-Executive Directors to receive payment
of part of their fees in the form of ICI Ordinary
Shares.
Remuneration packages for Executive
Directors
The remuneration package for Executive
Directors comprises five elements:
• base salary;
• Annual Incentive Plan;
• Performance Growth Plan;
• share option scheme; and
• post-retirement and other benefits.
The performance related elements, when valued
at target performance levels, comprise more
than 50% of the package (excluding post-
retirement benefits).
Base salaries
Base salaries are a fixed annual sum recognising
ongoing market value. The Company’s policy is
to set the salary for each Executive Director
within a range around the market median for
similar positions in large, international, publicly
quoted companies. Salaries for individual
Directors are reviewed each year by the
Remuneration Committee, recognising the
individual’s performance and experience, and
developments in the relevant employment
market.
Annual Incentive Plan
The Annual Incentive Plan rewards Executive
Directors for the achievement of annual financial
and strategic goals of ICI and its businesses.
The financial targets which are set under the
Annual Incentive Plan are derived from the
strategic and annual planning processes for ICI
and its businesses. During 2002, bonus targets
focused on the delivery of Economic Profit, cash
generation and the achievement of key strategic
objectives. Targets are established by the Board
and approved by the Remuneration Committee.
The bonus opportunity available to Executive
Directors for 2002 for the achievement of on-
target performance was 50% of base salary. 
A maximum bonus opportunity of 100% of base
salary was possible for the significant over-
achievement of the defined targets.
In the difficult economic climate of 2002, 
all of ICI’s International Businesses achieved
comparable sales growth over 2001 – with 
both Paints and National Starch also growing
their trading profit. Strong cash generation 
and excellent management of working capital
enhanced the operating performance of most
businesses during the past year. ICI Group
targets for Economic Profit improvement and
cash flow were exceeded. In some cases, the
level of incentive payments additionally reflects
delivery against key strategic objectives to
strengthen individual businesses and the 
balance sheet of ICI.
Economic Profit is ICI’s key internal financial
measure. This measure is based on profit 
after tax, less a charge for the use of capital.
Economic Profit encourages both profitable
growth and the efficient use of capital to
generate sustainable shareholder value.
summary remuneration report 25
Performance Growth Plan
The Performance Growth Plan (PGP) drives and
rewards longer-term business performance
improvement. The Plan strengthens the
alignment with shareholders by placing a greater
emphasis on sustained long-term value creation.
For the Executive Directors, the Plan makes
conditional awards of ICI shares linked to
performance over a fixed three year period
measured as follows:
• Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer: 
Total Shareholder Return (TSR) vs ICI’s peer
group (see below).
• Business Heads: TSR (as above) and Economic
Profit of their own business.
• In addition, the Remuneration Committee must
be satisfied that the underlying performance of
ICI justifies the receipt of any shares.
TSR calculations are performed by independent
consultants and are approved by the
Remuneration Committee.
The shares required to make awards under this
Plan are provided via a trust funded by ICI.
There is no dilution of ICI’s issued share capital.
The maximum conditional award of 100% of
base salary per annum (200% for US Directors)
is linked to at least upper quartile performance
versus the peer group. For median TSR
performance, 40% of this maximum award will
be paid. No TSR award is paid for below
median performance.
Economic Profit targets are consistent with the
achievement of the Company’s TSR goals and
ICI’s strategic targets.
The peer group for the TSR element represents
ICI’s key global competitors and has been
selected on the basis of market location, size,
diversity and performance. The peer group of
companies for the conditional awards made in
2002 was: Air Products and Chemicals; Akzo
Nobel; Clariant; Crompton Corporation; Cytec
Industries; Ciba Specialty Chemicals; Danisco;
Degussa; Engelhard Corporation; Givaudan;
Henkel; H.B. Fuller Company; International
Flavors & Fragrances; Rhodia; Rohm and Haas
Company; The Sherwin-Williams Company. 
The peer group for the 2003 awards will
comprise a similar set of companies.
For the 2000 – 2002 performance period, ICI’s
TSR ranked 13 out of the 17 companies in the
peer group and, as a result, all awards under
the TSR performance measure for this cycle
lapsed. Two Directors received awards under 
the Economic Profit measure and these are
shown on page 27.
Share Option Scheme
The Share Option Scheme rewards Executive
Directors for longer-term corporate performance
as reflected in share price appreciation.
Options to purchase the Company’s Ordinary
Shares may be granted each year. Individual
option grants to Executive Directors during 2002
were in a range of 125% to 200% of salary,
reflecting market practice (UK or US, as
appropriate), and individual performance and
potential impact on longer-term business results.
Grants are made subject to a performance
condition that over a three year period the
growth in ICI’s earnings per share (excluding
both amortisation of goodwill and exceptional
items) must be equal to, or greater than, the
increase in the UK Retail Prices Index plus 3%
per annum. In the light of the Company’s current
business outlook and the quantum of the grants
involved, the Committee considers this to be an
appropriately challenging condition for option
grants made in 2002.
Options must be held for a minimum of three
years from grant before they can be exercised
and lapse if not exercised within ten years.
The shares to meet rights granted do not dilute
ICI’s issued share capital as they are bought in
the market.
No gains were realised on the exercise of share
options during 2002 or 2001.
Retirement benefits
ICI provides retirement benefit plans for its
executives which take account of local practice
in the countries in which it operates. These
plans are designed, as part of the total
remuneration package, to attract the quality of
staff needed by the business and to aid mobility
between countries where necessary. In keeping
with the Group’s philosophy on “fixed” elements
of reward, they are normally positioned around
the median of the local market.
Except where defined benefit plans already exist
for current executives, retirement benefits are
provided on a “defined contribution” basis so
that Company costs are stable and predictable.
Where possible, plans provide flexibility and
choice to increase employee commitment, and
enable executives to make their own
contributions as well as the Company.
In this way, ICI encourages and supports its
executives to play an active role in planning for
their individual retirement needs.
It is ICI’s policy to match retirement benefit
liabilities where possible by external funds rather
than by Group assets.
Performance graphs
The first graph below shows indices of the TSR
performances of ICI and of the Peer Group of
companies for the Performance Growth Plan. 
The second graph, as required by the Directors’
Remuneration Report Regulations 2002,

“broad equity market index” over the past five
years: the index shown is the FTSE 100 as ICI
has been a constituent of this index throughout
the five year period.

2 A performance related retention arrangement linked to Annual Incentive Plan payments applies to Dr B R O’Neill only. The Remuneration Committee has determined that for each of the
years 2002 to 2005 inclusive an additional cash sum equal to 50% of the earned annual bonus will be deferred and paid in 2006, normally subject to Dr O’Neill’s continued employment
with the Group. This arrangement will operate for the first time in 2002 and the deferred payment for 2002 is £180,810 (2001 and prior years £nil). This is excluded from the table
above and will be included when paid.
3 In 2002, Mr P J Drechsler received 9,450 Ordinary Shares, with a market value of £29,200 (2001 1,954 shares with a market value of £7,992) and Mr T A Scott received 4,621
Ordinary Shares with a market value of £14,279 (2001 nil). These matched shares were provided under the Bonus Conversion Plan which operates for the last time in respect of
bonuses earned from the 1999 financial year. A bonus recipient could elect to have shares purchased with part or all of their net bonus after tax. After three years, shares purchased 
in the plan are released.
4 For 2002 the figures reported are the annual base salary or fee in payment at 31 December 2002 except in respect of Mr T A Scott whose annual base salary at that date was
£325,000 and Lord Butler whose annual fee at that date was £40,000.

5 Since 1998, share option grants are made subject to the earnings per share performance condition outlined on page 25.
6 Certain Executive Directors have a contingent interest in matched shares under the Bonus Conversion Plan provided in respect of the 1999 bonus plan which was operated for the last
time in respect of that year. Matched shares are released to the participants after three years provided the individual remains employed by ICI.
7 Certain option grants made in 1999 were subject to delay, in accordance with the Financial Services Authority Listing Rules. The Remuneration Committee decided that those individuals
so affected should receive the same gross gain at the time they exercise their options as if the grant had not been delayed.
8 Prior to being appointed Directors, Mr W H Powell and Mr T A Scott participated in cash based long-term incentive plans operated by the Group. The performance period relating to
these awards ended on 31 December 2002. Mr Powell will receive no payment in respect of these units. During 2003 Mr Scott will receive £9,773 in respect of his service as a Director
based on the performance of ICI’s International Businesses over the three years to 31 December 2002.

Directors’ service agreements and letters of engagement
It is the Remuneration Committee’s policy that Executive Directors are employed on contracts subject to no more than 12 months’ notice, in accordance
with current corporate governance best practice. The Remuneration Committee strongly endorses the principle of mitigation of damages on early
termination of a service agreement.
The Chairman and Executive Directors are employed pursuant to agreements which terminate on 12 months’ notice. Non-Executive Directors are
appointed for an unspecified term pursuant to letters of engagement. Further details of these are contained in the full Remuneration Report in the Annual
Report and Accounts and Form 20-F 2002, copies of which are available from the Company Secretary.

The Group’s 2002 financial performance was creditable in what
was a persistently challenging economic environment.
Comparable International Business sales were 1% ahead of last
year, with growth in North America, Europe and Asia more than
offsetting lower sales in Latin America. Comparable trading profit
for the International Businesses was only 1% lower, with growth
in Paints and National Starch being offset by lower profits in 
Quest and Performance Specialties. Group profit before tax,
goodwill amortisation and exceptional items was £400m, 
essentially in line with 2001.
Cash flow improved substantially in 2002. Increased operating
cash flow, the successful completion of the Rights Issue and the
divestment of Synetix contributed to a £1,250m reduction in year
end net debt, to £1,667m. Interest cover also improved significantly,
to 4.3 times for 2002, compared to 3.5 for 2001 and 3.2 for 2000.
Trading results
The results before goodwill amortisation, exceptional items, interest and taxation of the Group’s
continuing operations for last year compared to 2002 can be summarised as follows:

Interest
The Group net interest charge for the year was
£123m compared to £162m in 2001, primarily
as a result of lower average net debt during the
year, following the successful completion of the
Rights Issue, and lower interest rates.
Profit before tax
Profit before tax, goodwill amortisation and
exceptional items for the year was £400m, £1m
lower than last year. Lower trading profits for the
International Businesses, and a trading loss for
the Regional and Industrial businesses were
almost entirely offset by lower interest costs.
Profit before tax, but after goodwill amortisation
and exceptional items was £317m compared to
£205m in 2001.
During 2002 the adverse currency translation
effect compared to last year on the Group’s
reported profit before tax, goodwill amortisation
and exceptional items was £11m.
Taxation
Taxation on profit before goodwill amortisation
and exceptional items was £115m, £1m lower
than last year, with the Group effective tax rate
being maintained at 29%. 2001 has been
restated for the effect of FRS 19.
Exceptional items
Exceptional items charged after trading profit for
the year comprised a £50m profit from the sale
or closure of businesses, a £3m profit on the
disposal of fixed assets and £99m written off
investments. The pre-tax profit from the sale or
closure of operations included a £90m profit on
the sale of our catalyst business, Synetix, and a
profit on the sale of Security Systems. These
were partially offset by a £32m loss on the
divestment of the UK Nitrocellulose and
Energetic Technologies businesses and a £27m
loss due to the liquidation of Irish Fertilizer
Industries, in which the Group has a 49%
interest. Amounts written off investments of
£99m related to a provision against ICI’s existing
investments in Ineos Chlor, where uncertainty
exists as to the extent to which, and period over
which these amounts will be recovered.
Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share before goodwill
amortisation and exceptional items for the year
were 23.7p, compared to 29.8p in 2001. The
lower amount in 2002 was due to the increased
number of shares in issue as a result of the
Rights Issue.
Net profit after goodwill amortisation and
exceptional items was £179m, compared to
£80m in 2001. Basic earnings per share after
goodwill amortisation and exceptional items
were 16.1p compared to 9.2p in 2001.

Prior year profit and earnings per share figures
have been restated for the effects of the bonus
element of the Rights Issue and for FRS 19. 
The weighted average number of shares in issue
in 2002 was 1,114m, compared to 869m in 2001.
Dividend and dividend policy
As previously stated, the Group’s dividend policy
is that dividends should represent about one
third of net profit before goodwill amortisation
and exceptional items. In line with this policy,
the Board has recommended a second interim
dividend of 4.5p, to bring the total dividend for
2002 to 7.5p.
Performance and value based management
The Group remains committed to value based
management and further progress was made
during the year. The Group continued to focus
on better utilisation of both fixed and working
capital, and average working capital as a
percentage of sales in the International
Businesses was reduced by over 1% on a
comparable basis. Despite lower trading profits
for the International Businesses, the return
on average net assets for the International
Businesses of 20% remained unchanged
from 2001.
Cash flow
The following analysis of Group cash flow
distinguishes between cash flows relating to
operating activities and those related to portfolio
reshaping and legacy issues. Included within
“reshaping and legacy” are gross proceeds from
divestments, cash expenditures following
divestments (including tax paid and payments
against divestment provisions which, in some 
cases, will continue for a number of years), 
the ICI UK Pension Fund top-up payments, 
and loans to associates and other investments.
Operating cash flow
The Group’s net operating cash flow improved
significantly in 2002.
Group earnings before interest, tax, depreciation
and goodwill amortisation for the year, at
£729m, were 7% below 2001, mainly as a result
of the lower trading profit for the International
Businesses. However, the benefits of working
capital efficiency improvements resulted in a
small cash inflow from working capital of £13m
for the year, some £43m better than 2001.
Capital expenditure, of £219m, was also £16m
lower, while other cash items, including
exceptional outflows against restructuring
provisions, were at a similar level to 2001.
Consequently, the Group delivered an operating
cash inflow after capital expenditure of £434m,
£2m better than for 2001.
Net interest and tax payments (excluding tax on
divestments) during 2002 amounted to £191m,
some £33m lower than 2001, primarily as a
result of the cash interest benefits of the Rights
Issue. Dividend payments, at £127m, were also
£78m lower than last year, following
implementation of the revised dividend policy. 
Acquisition expenditure was £17m, £51m below
2001.
Overall for 2002, the Group generated a much
improved net operating cash flow which, at
£99m, was £164m better than for 2001.
Reshaping and legacy cash flows
Reshaping and legacy cash flows benefited from
the successful completion of the divestment of
Synetix (delivering gross proceeds of £260m)
and the proceeds (£109m) from the first
installment in relation to the sale of ICI’s interests
in Huntsman International Holdings LLC. Overall,
2002 divestment proceeds of £458m were
£114m more than for 2001. Tax payments
resulting from divestments were £8m, down 
from £21m in the prior year.
Payments against divestment provisions were
also significantly lower than last year, down
£165m to £133m. 
The top-up payment to the ICI UK Pension Fund
for the year was maintained at £30m. The next
triennial actuarial review of the fund will take
place at 31 March 2003.
Overall, the 2002 cash flow due to reshaping
and legacy items was an inflow of £250m,
£296m higher than 2001.
Tim Scott Chief Financial Officer
Movement in net debt
Cash flow before financing for the year, at
£349m, was £460m better than in 2001. 
This, together with the net Rights Issue proceeds
of £807m and a favourable non-cash exchange
rate translation impact of £94m, led to a £1,250m
reduction in net debt at the end of the year, 
to £1,667m.

Treasury policies
The Group’s Treasury seeks to reduce financial
risk, to ensure sufficient liquidity is available to
meet foreseeable needs and to invest cash
assets safely and profitably. It operates within
policies and procedures approved by the Board,
which include strict controls on the use of
financial instruments in managing the Group’s
risk. The Group does not undertake any trading
activity in financial instruments. The Group
reviews the credit quality of counterparties and
limits individual and aggregate credit exposures
accordingly.
Financing
The Group’s policy is to finance the Group
mainly through a mixture of retained earnings
and debt. Debt is principally sourced from long-
term loans, medium-term notes, commercial
paper, securitised receivables and bank debt.
The Group’s borrowings are primarily raised
centrally by Group finance companies and on-
lent to operating subsidiaries on commercial
terms. The Group borrows in the major global
debt markets in a range of currencies at both
fixed and floating rates of interest, and uses
derivatives to generate the desired currency 
and interest rate profile of borrowings. 
The Group’s exposure to interest rate
fluctuations on its borrowings is managed
through the use of interest rate swaps and
forward rate agreements. The Group’s policy is
to maintain between 40% and 60% of its long-
term borrowings at fixed rates for periods of up
to 5 years.
In March 2002, the Group received net proceeds
of £807m following the successful completion of
the Rights Issue. These proceeds, along with
those from the divestments completed during
the year, were used to pay down debt, thus
significantly strengthening the Group’s balance
sheet, improving its interest cover and securing
a stable credit rating in 2002.
Liquidity and investments
At 31 December 2002 the Group had at its
disposal £1.509bn equivalent of committed
borrowing facilities with varying maturities up to
the year 2006. Of this, a $1,100m committed
borrowing facility is maturing in January 2004
and some £201m of short-term committed
borrowing facilities have varying maturities of
less than one year. These facilities provide back-
stopping for short-term funding as well as
flexibility to supplement future cash flows.
The Group’s net debt position has historically
changed over the course of a year and, in
particular, short-term debt has generally
increased in the early part of the year to fund
working capital requirements. These working
capital needs arise principally from the
seasonality of the Paints business, which
experiences higher sales, and thus working
capital, during the North American and European
summer. The Group’s commercial paper
programmes and other short-term borrowings
are used to fund these working capital
fluctuations. At 31 December 2002, the Group
had £226m of short-term borrowings
outstanding.
During 2002, the principal movements in long-
term debt were a $200m (£129m) 10 year note
maturity, and $500m and $250m (£484m) 5 year
note maturities. Also in 2002, the Group
redeemed £300m in FRPS (fixed rate
redeemable preference shares) reducing the
amount outstanding at 31 December 2002 
to £100m. The Group runs a receivables
securitisation programme in the US, with £95m
outstanding, out of a total available facility of
£111m, at 31 December 2002.
During 2003, £500m of loans will be maturing,
which, in addition to various bonds and notes,
includes the £100m of FRPS and £95m from the
receivables securitisation programme. These are
expected to be refinanced through new debt
issues.
On 17 June 2002, ICI announced it had reached
an agreement with Matlin Patterson Global
Opportunities Partners L.P. for the sale of ICI’s
interests in Huntsman International Holdings LLC
(HIH) for $440m (£283m). Of this amount,
$160m (£109m) has been received. The
remaining $280m (£174m) will be payable on
15 May 2003, with the purchaser having the
option to pay all or part of the amount due prior
to 15 May 2003 by means of installment
payments. Other than the $160m (£109m)
already received, sums due from the purchaser
carry interest from May 2002 to the date of
payment.
Pensions
Despite significant movements in the world’s
equity markets, as at 31 March 2002, the
estimated solvency of the ICI UK Pension Fund
(ICI’s largest defined benefit scheme
representing approximately 87% of the Group’s
retirement benefit schemes by asset value and in
projected benefit terms) was not significantly
changed from the level two years ago when the
last actuarial valuation took place. Over the last
five years, the ICI Pension Fund’s Trustee Board
has steadily reduced exposure to equities. The
final phase of this switch, in late 2000 and early
2001, was particularly well timed. At 31
December 2002, over 75% of the Fund’s assets
were invested in fixed income securities, which
should reduce volatility in the market value of
the Fund. Based on the last actuarial valuation 
at 31 March 2000 ICI continues to pay
additional contributions into the Fund of £30m
per year until 31 March 2006 to cover past
funding shortfalls. The next triennial actuarial
valuation is due to take place at 31 March 2003.
FRS 17 Retirement Benefits
The Group continues to report on employee
retirement benefits in accordance with SSAP 24.
However, in 2002, additional analysis is also
provided in accordance with FRS 17. This
Standard sets out revised requirements for the
accounting and disclosure of an employer’s
retirement benefit obligations and related
funding. Although none of the amounts
calculated in accordance with this Standard
require to be recognised in the primary
statements until accounting periods beginning
on or after 1 January 2005, full disclosure is
being made progressively, by way of note, in the
Group’s Annual Report and Accounts and Form
20–F. The net recognised deficit and the net
liability (after deferred tax) for 2001 and 2002
are presented below, analysed into their main
components, and distinguishing between the

New Accounting Standards: FRS No. 19 Deferred Taxation
Financial Reporting Standard No.19 Deferred Taxation (FRS 19) has been adopted for the first time in these financial statements. Where applicable, 
the financial statements of prior periods have been restated. This has resulted in a decrease in shareholders’ funds at 31 December 2001 of £81m 
(31 December 2000 – decrease £33m); the net profit for the year to 31 December 2001 decreased by £41m.
Earnings per share: Rights Issue
On 4 February 2002, the Company announced a Rights Issue and, following approval of the required resolutions at the subsequent Extraordinary General
Meeting, 463m new Ordinary Shares were issued at 180p per share on the basis of 7 new Ordinary Shares for every 11 existing Ordinary Shares.
The actual cum rights price on 25 February 2002, the last day of quotation cum rights, was 319p per share and the theoretical ex rights price for an
Ordinary Share was therefore 265p per share. The comparative earnings per share are shown after applying the factor 265/319 to the published figures
for 2001, after adjusting for deferred tax (see note above), in order to adjust for the bonus issue within the Rights Issue.

ICI Ordinary Shares are listed on the London
Stock Exchange and other major European
Stock Exchanges. They are also listed in the
form of ADSs on the New York Stock Exchange.
The Company from time to time files reports
with the United States Securities and Exchange
Commission. Reports filed since 4 November

Capital Gains Tax
In certain circumstances, when a shareholder in
the UK sells shares, liability to tax in respect of
capital gains is computed by reference to the
market value of the shares on 31 March 1982.
The market value of ICI Ordinary Shares at 
31 March 1982, for the purposes of capital
gains tax, was 309p.
ICI and Zeneca demerged on 1 June 1993.
Post-demerger ICI shares will inherit a base cost
equivalent to 0.50239 of their pre-demerger
base cost.
For the purposes of UK taxation of capital gains,
the issue of new ICI Ordinary Shares under the
Rights Issue, launched in February 2002, is
regarded as a reorganisation of the share capital
of ICI.
Shareholders who are in any doubt as to their
tax position should seek specific advice from
their financial advisers.
