CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT BUSINESS PROFILE AND KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS
I am pleased to report that Booker 
Group has delivered another good 
performance. In the 52 weeks to 24 
March 2017 sales rose by 6.7% to £5.3bn 
and operating profi t rose to £176.1m. 
Customer satisfaction was strong. 
The fi nancial performance was good 
and the Group ended the fi nancial 
year with net cash of £160.7m. Our 
‘Drive’ plans are working well with 
progress on the catering and retail sides 
of the business. Our like-for-like sales to 
caterers were up by 4.4%. Our like-for-like 
sales to retailers declined by 0.6% 
primarily due to tobacco legislation. 
The plans to ‘Broaden’ the business 
are going well. In the 52 weeks to 24 
March 2017 Booker distributed £2.3bn 
of product to our customers’ premises 
versus £1.8bn last year as we continue 
to expand our delivered service. Digital 
sales were £1,072m compared to 
£979m in the previous year and Booker 
India is making progress. 
On 14 September 2015, Budgens and 
Londis joined the Group. They are 
performing well.
Basic earnings per share were 8.66 
pence, up from 7.24 pence last 
year. Given the strong operational 
performance and cash fl ow of the 
business the Board recommends the 
payment of a fi nal dividend of 4.97 
pence per share (2016: 4.03 pence per 
share) which, together with the interim 
dividend, makes a total dividend for the 
year of 5.60 pence per share (2016: 4.60 
pence per share). The fi nal dividend is 
payable on 7 July 2017 to shareholders 
on the register on 9 June 2017.
In addition to the fi nal dividend, the Board 
is recommending a special dividend 
to shareholders of 3.02 pence per 
ordinary share (at a cost of approximately 
£54m, based on the current issued 
share capital of the Group). This follows 
the capital return of 3.20 pence per 
share to shareholders in July 2016 and  
3.50 pence per share in each of July 
2014 and July 2015. 
I should like to thank all our colleagues 
for their contribution to the success of 
the Group in the year just ended.
On 27 January we announced the 
planned merger with Tesco to form 
the UK’s leading food business. 
This combination should improve 
choice, quality, prices and service 
for the UK consumer. It should also 
help the Booker catering, retail and 
small business customer prosper in a 
challenging market. We are continuing 
to assist the UK competition authorities 
in their ongoing consideration of the 
merger and it is expected that the 
merger will complete in late 2017 / early 
2018, subject to, amongst other things, 
the necessary shareholder approvals. 
During this process Booker will ensure it 
is “Business as Usual”. We are excited by 
the opportunities the merger creates for 
consumers, our customers, suppliers, 
colleagues and shareholders.
Outlook
The Group’s revenue in the fi rst seven 
weeks of the current fi nancial year is 
ahead of last year.  
As a result of the proposed merger,  we 
are in an offer period as defi ned in the 
Takeover Code.  We will not be making 
forward looking statements for the 
duration of the offer period.
Annual General Meeting
Our Annual General Meeting will be held 
on 5 July 2017. The notice of Annual 
General Meeting will be issued to 
shareholders in due course.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
• In 2010 we launched Farm Fresh. 
Sales in the year to 24 March 2017 
were £76m. 
• We launched CleanPro in 2014. 
This range of professional cleaning 
products has been well received 
by customers. We have 50,000 
customers buying CleanPro each 
week with sales of £44m per annum.
• We continue to improve the ‘good, 
better, best’ of the offer in order to 
satisfy all customers. For example, 
Chefs Essentials chips grew at 31% 
and Chefs Larder chips at 9%. We 
launched Chefs Larder Premium 
Chips, these are gluten free and have 
already achieved sales of £4m.  We 
have won ‘Best Frozen Product’ 
at The Caterer Product Excellence 
Awards and ‘Best Frozen Food’ at the 
Wholesale Q Awards.
• We have also been growing with 
branded suppliers.
Since November 2005 we have been 
seeking to ‘Focus, Drive and Broaden’ 
Booker Group. 2016 was another  good 
year in a challenging market Tobacco 
legislation depressed our retail customer 
sales and there has been signifi cant 
movement in commodity prices. Despite 
these challenges the Group continued 
to make good progress on both the 
catering and retail sides of the business.
FOCUS (commenced 
November 2005)
Booker seeks to become the most 
effi cient operator in our sector. We 
continue to improve business effi ciency. 
We ‘stop, simplify and standardise’ work 
and invest most of the resulting savings 
in customer service. We extended the 
use of ‘self-scan’ and improved stock 
management. Our close attention to 
cash has resulted in having £161m of 
net cash, whilst keeping the Group cost 
base in line with last year (pre Budgens 
and Londis).
DRIVE (commenced March 2006)
Booker Wholesale/Makro, our cash and 
carry businesses had a good year. We 
continue to ‘Drive’ choice, price and 
service for our customers. Each year 
we survey 45,000 customers to identify 
where improvements can be made. 
Customer satisfaction is a key measure 
within the business and we have made 
signifi cant progress since 2006. 
Choice Up
Booker seeks to grow brand and own 
brand sales.
• In October 2016 we launched 
Blackgate signature beef. The quality 
is superb and it is already being 
bought by 7,000 customers with 
annualised sales of £17m.

“Thanks to the hard work of everybody in 
the Group, our plan to Focus, Drive and 
Broaden the business remains on track. 
Booker Group had a good year; customer 
satisfaction was strong, sales and profi ts 
were the best we’ve ever achieved.” Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
Booker’s Pricing vs Cash & Carry Market
Prices Down
• We operate in a very price 
competitive market. Every week we 
monitor prices versus competitors 
and during the year our price index 
remained competitive (see graph). 
We are continuing to keep our 
core line prices at market leading 
levels to provide the best possible 
margin for our customers. Booker 
has consistently offered low prices 
on core products and maintains its 
promise of helping the customer 
during challenging times.
Better Service
• Our people are doing a brilliant job. 
Our customers rate Booker people 
highly. Business Centre teams 
across the Group have been trained 
in PRIDE to help improve the Parking, 
Reception, Internal, Delivery and Exit 
experience.
• We have continued to expand and 
improve our delivery service.
• We have more specialist butchers 
and greengrocers within the business 
than last year. We also have skilled 
fishmongers operating in our Makro 
Business Centres.
• Booker offers a seven days a 
week multi-temperature delivery 
service to both retail and catering 
customers (70% of the fleet has 
multi temperature capacity). Our 
delivery customers pay the same 
price for goods as our collect 
customers. Our delivery business 
continues to grow (from £600m in 
2008/9 to £2.3bn in 2016/17).
Caterers/Small Business
• We are privileged to serve 441,000 
catering customers and 641,000 
small businesses. Our catering 
customers include restaurants, fast 
food outlets, licenced premises and 
cost centre caterers. These can be 
independent, single site locations, 
Group Accounts and National 
Chains. All customers can draw 
upon the Booker, Makro, Classic 
and Chef Direct infrastructures.  
This has helped strengthen caterer 
satisfaction and grown like-for-
like catering sales by 4.4%. This is 
despite price deflation in the catering 
market. 
• We have also made good progress 
with Group Accounts, such as 
Enterprise Group and Rick Stein, 
where we serve these accounts from 
Booker and Makro. 
• Our Chef Direct business, which 
serves national accounts from our 
distribution centre in Didcot, has 
also had a good year serving clients 
including Byron Burgers, Carluccios, 
Prezzo, Aramark and Wagamama.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW CONTINUED
Retailers
• We serve 94,000 independent retailers. 
Our largest retail customers tend to 
be our Premier, Londis, Budgens 
and Family Shopper symbol club 
members. We also serve our retail club 
members, unaffiliated independents 
and retail national accounts.
Premier
• Premier, Booker’s symbol group, 
grew to 3,306 stores (3,213 stores last 
year). The retail development team 
has put a lot of work into building the 
sales and profits of existing Premier 
stores.  Premier was voted the best 
symbol group by consumers at the 
CTP Awards.
• Premier operates a no cost model for 
members, and has the advantage for 
retailers of providing deliveries and 
also the ability to top-up at their local 
Booker branch. We install the fascia 
and imagery free of charge and also 
provide a market leading promotion 
every four weeks. All goods are 
delivered at cash and carry prices.
Family Shopper
• We continue to develop Family 
Shopper, a local discount format. 
This is doing well. At May 2017, we 
have 63 stores and the response to 
this format has been encouraging.
Budgens & Londis
• On 14 September 2015 Budgens 
and Londis joined the Group. 
Budgens serves 156 retailers. The 
Budgens consumer is typically ABC1. 
Londis serves 1,850 retailers with 
approximately 49% of consumers 
being ABC1. Since completion of the 
acquisition, the teams at Budgens 
and Londis have “joined forces” with 
the Group.  They have embraced the 
Booker approach to cash, customer 
satisfaction and health & safety.  In the 
year we have opened a net 381 Londis 
and 6 Budgens outlets.  As a result the 
sales have grown strongly. 
• Budgens and Londis were acquired 
for £40m and, to March 2017, in 
relation to this acquisition we have 
generated net cash of c.£42m.
• Thanks to a lot of hard work by our 
IT and central colleagues, we have 
integrated the Londis/Budgens 
systems into the Booker platforms. 
All the teams have done a fantastic 
job of growing both brands. It is a 
credit to our teams and the wonderful 
retailers we serve via Premier, Londis, 
Budgens, Family Shopper, Shop 
Locally and all our other retailers that 
we have seen strong growth.
Booker Direct
• Booker Direct serves national retail 
chains from our distribution centres 
with customers including Marks & 
Spencer, most of the cinema chains 
in the UK and the prison service in 
England and Wales. Together the 
Group can now serve any independent 
retailer, Group Accounts and National 
Chains throughout the UK.
BROADEN (commenced  
April 2007)
In the UK, Booker seeks to offer the best 
choice, price and service to caterers, 
retailers and small business. We also 
seek to become the suppliers’ preferred 
route to market. In addition, we want 
to sell new products and services and 
reach new customers. In India we seek 
to become the best supplier to Kirana 
stores. To achieve these objectives, 
we are ‘Broadening’ the business. 
‘Broaden’ includes:
Digital 
• Sales at booker.co.uk were £1,072m, 
up from £979m last year and £15m 
in 2005. All these sales are delivered 
to our customers’ premises. We have 
569,000 customers registered on 
the website compared to 490,000 
last year. Customers can view their 
account details and order products. 
There are double the number of stock 
keeping units available to a typical 
customer on the website through our 
special order system. 
 Ritter-Courivaud
• Ritter-Courivaud is a speciality foods 
supplier to the UK’s leading restaurants. 
Ritter had a good year growing sales 
through the Makro business centres 
and direct to customers.
Booker India 
• In September 2009 we opened our 
first business centre in Mumbai. We 
now have four branches in Mumbai, 
one in Surat and one joint venture 
branch in Pune. These serve 21,000 
customers, and have also launched 
200 Happy Shopper symbol retailers 
which harness the lessons learned 
from Premier in the UK for the Kirana 
stores of Mumbai. We continue 
to review growth options in India 
and look forward to developing the 
Booker offer to become the best 
choice, price and service supplier to 
Kirana stores and caterers.
Sustainability
• Carbon Trust Standard held for both 
Carbon and Waste.
• Over 31,000 customers are now 
recycling with the Group through 
our packaging and used cooking oil 
recycling services. This helps our 
customers save money, increase 
recycling levels and support more 
sustainable communities throughout 
the UK.
• LED lighting now installed in 35 
business centres, one distribution 
centre and two distribution centre 
freezer rooms with an average overall 
energy saving of 22%.
• Over 10.5 million litres of used 
cooking oil has been recycled, up 
57% on last year.
• Waste to landfill down 73% versus 
last year.
• We donated surplus food equivalent 
to over 800,000 meals to local 
charities in the last year and have 
donated over two million meals in the 
last five years.
• We are committed to helping our 
retail and catering customers serve 
communities throughout the United 
Kingdom. Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW CONTINUED
People 
• Again our team have done a brilliant 
job this year. We are committed to 
continuing to make Booker better and 
safer for colleagues. We continue to 
develop talent. To ensure succession 
needs for our Fresh Departments 
are fulfilled with the right people, we 
have developed another cohort of 
Trainees through our successful in 
house Fresh Training Programmes. 
This year, a further 52 Butchers, 12 
Fishmongers and 55 Greengrocers 
graduated and went on to work in 
these key departments, supporting 
our customers. 
• There are currently a further 116 
colleagues participating in this year’s 
schemes who are due to graduate in 
Autumn 2017 and we intend to run all 
three schemes again in 2017/18. 
• To build on the expertise of our 
Butchery teams further, we have been 
working with The Institute of Meat to 
raise and recognise the skill level of 
our Butchery teams. In February 
2017, 8 of our Butchery Managers 
were officially awarded the Institute 
of Meat, Master Butcher Award. This 
puts them amongst an elite group of 
just 29 Butchery Professionals in the 
UK to hold this award currently. This 
is part of a longer term plan to up-
skill and develop our future Butchery 
Managers who are all currently 
working through an in house Craft 
Butcher training programme, which 
has been developed with and is 
endorsed by The Institute of Meat. 
• Investment in our delivery teams 
has continued, with development 
programmes to ensure drivers and 
managers have the knowledge and 
skills to operate safely and efficiently, 
whilst providing a great service for 
our customers:
 – Our drivers and managers have 
inductions and annual refreshers 
covering Safe, Secure and Legal 
training and our vocational 
drivers complete training for the 
Driver Certificate of Professional 
Competence (CPC), which is run 
by our team of in-house trainers 
and delivery support managers. 
 – Following a trial last year, we have 
fully launched a Driver Academy, 
open to internal and external 
colleagues who wish to develop 
their career with Booker; ensuring 
we have the right drivers in place 
to fulfil succession in this growing 
area of the business. We currently 
have over 50 Drivers working 
towards becoming a Van or Large 
Goods Vehicle Driver in our Booker 
and Makro Business Centres. 
• For the twelfth year running, the 
performance of the business means 
our people have shared in our 
success through our bonus system. 
With this great team of people, Booker 
will continue to make progress in the 
year ahead. 
Merger with Tesco
On 27 January we announced the  
planned merger with Tesco to form 
the UK’s leading food business. This 
combination should improve choice, 
quality, prices and service for the UK 
consumer. It should also help the Booker 
catering, retail and small business 
customer prosper in a challenging 
market. We are continuing to assist 
the UK competition authorities in their 
ongoing consideration of the merger 
and it is expected that the merger will 
complete in late 2017 / early 2018, 
subject to, amongst other things, the 
necessary shareholder approvals. 
During this process Booker will ensure 
it is “Business as Usual”. We are 
excited by the opportunities the merger 
creates for consumers, our customers, 
suppliers, colleagues and shareholders.
Overall
Booker Group had another good 
year.  Our plan to Focus, Drive and 
Broaden the business remains on track.  
Customer satisfaction was strong and 
sales and profits were the best we 
have ever achieved.  We are planning 
to merge with Tesco to create the UK’s 
leading food business.  This merger 
should deliver significant benefits 
for consumers, Booker customers, 
suppliers, colleagues and shareholders.  
We are very grateful for the support of 
our customers, suppliers and everybody 
in the Group and look forward to making 
progress in the year ahead.

GROUP FINANCE DIRECTOR’S REPORT
Overall Group revenue increased by 
6.7% to £5.3bn. Non tobacco like-for-
like sales increased by 2.8% while like-
for-like tobacco sales decreased by 
4.6%.  Sales at Budgens and Londis 
were £0.7bn (2016: £0.3bn).  In 2016 
their results were consolidated from 14 
September 2015, the date of acquisition.
Operating margin (before exceptional  
items) increased by 0. 19 percentage points 
to 3.30% (2016: 3.11%) increasing Group 
operating profi t (before exceptional items) 
by £21.0m to £176.1m. 
The net fi nance costs of £2.1m (2016: 
£2.0m) relates mainly to the unwinding 
of discount on property provisions and 
interest on pension scheme liabilities.
Profi t before tax rose £23.2m to 
£174.0m (2016: £150.8m), an increase 
of 15%.
The effective tax rate for the Group of 
11.6% (2016: 15.3%) was below the 
standard rate of corporation tax in 
the UK of 20% (2016: 20%). This was 
due principally to the utilisation of tax 
assets unrecognised in prior years. 
The Group holds tax assets, including 
those inherited as a result of the 
acquisition of Budgens and Londis, 
which continue to be unrecognised 
as there continues to be uncertainty 
regarding their recoverability in the 
individual companies in which they 
reside.  Depending on the extent to 
which the Group is able to utilise these 
assets, the underlying effective rate of 
tax could remain marginally below the 
standard rate for the next three years.
Profi t after tax was £153.8m, an 
increase of £26.0m compared to 2016.
Basic earnings per share rose to 8.66 
pence, up 20% from 7.24 pence in 2016.
Returns to shareholders
On 27 January 2017, it was announced 
that we were intending to merge 
with Tesco PLC (Tesco). In this 
announcement the arrangements for 
any future dividends in relation to the 
year ended 24 March 2017 and beyond 
to completion of the merger were 
explained. 
In relation to the year ended 24 March 
2017 the cost of the fi nal ordinary 
dividend can be set at up to 65% of 
profi t after tax less the cost of the 
interim dividend announced on 13 
October 2016. In addition to the ordinary 
dividends, a special dividend can also 
be paid, in an aggregate amount of up to 
100% of profi t after tax less the cost of 
the interim and fi nal ordinary dividends.
a) Ordinary Dividend
  Consistent with the arrangements 
explained above, the Board is 
proposing a fi nal dividend of 4.97 
pence per share (2016: 4.03 pence per 
share), subject to shareholder approval 
at the Annual General Meeting, to be 
held on 5 July 2017. Together with the 
interim dividend of 0.63 pence per 
share, the fi nal dividend increases 
the total dividend for the year to 5.60 
pence per share (2016: 4.60 pence 
per share). 
b) Special Dividend
  Consistent with the arrangements 
explained above, the Board is also 
proposing a special dividend to 
shareholders of 3.02 pence per 
ordinary share (2016: nil pence 
per share), subject to shareholder 
approval at the Annual General 
Meeting.

c) Capital Return
  Consistent with the arrangements 
explained above and the absence 
of further distributable reserves, the 
Board is not proposing a return of 
capital (2016: 3.20 pence per share). 
The full year ordinary dividend and the 
special dividend will together produce 
a total return to shareholders of 8.62 
pence per share (2016: 7.80 pence 
per share) including capital return, an 
increase of 11%. 
Pensions
The Booker Pension Scheme is a defined 
benefit scheme that was closed to new 
members in 2001, and was closed to 
future accruals for existing members 
in 2002. Booker Retail Partners GB 
Ltd (‘BRP’) also has two much smaller 
closed defined benefit schemes.
At 24 March 2017, the Group had an 
aggregate net IAS 19 deficit of £46.9m 
(2016: £29.6m), comprising scheme 
assets of £751.0m and estimated 
liabilities of £797.9m.  A consistent 
approach has been adopted in deriving 
the three schemes’ assets and liabilities.  
Following the 2013 Booker Pension 
Scheme Triennial valuation, there were 
no cash contributions required in the 
year. 
The 2016 Booker Pension Scheme 
Triennial valuation has been agreed with 
the Pension Fund Trustee and reflects 
a Scheme Funding deficit of £41.1m 
at 31 March 2016.  The deficit is to be  
recovered by £5.4m p.a. of scheduled 
payments for six years from 1 April 2017 
and by an assumed outperformance 
of investment returns relative to the 
rate at which the future liabilities of the 
Scheme have been discounted, subject 
to the results of subsequent Triennial 
valuations.  The next Triennial valuation 
date is 31 March 2019.   
The most recent funding valuations of 
both BRP pension schemes were agreed 
in the year ended 25 March 2016, and no 
future contributions were required.
Property Provisions
The Group had property provisions at 
the balance sheet date of £37.9m (2016: 
£40.8m). The provisions mainly relate 
to the expected cost of dilapidations 
on leasehold properties and onerous 
costs on vacant and sublet leasehold 
premises.
Impairment
The net book value of tangible and 
intangible fixed assets on the balance 
sheet is £682.0m (2016: £696.5m). The 
goodwill carrying value is more than 
supported by expected future cash flows 
discounted back to present day values. 
Cash Flow
Management has continued to focus 
on cash generation resulting in a net 
inflow of £172.6m, before dividend 
payments in the year of £82.6m and the 
capital repayment of £56.7m. Net cash 
at 24 March 2017 was £160.7m (2016: 
£127.4m). 
Borrowing Facilities
The Group entered into a five year facility 
in August 2015 comprising an unsecured 
£120.0m revolving credit facility. 
The Group’s borrowings are subject to 
covenants set by the lenders. In the event 
of a failure to meet certain obligations, 
or if there is a covenant breach, the 
principal amounts due and any interest 
accrued are repayable on demand. 
The Group complied with its covenants 
throughout the year. 
Interest Rates 
Funds drawn on the revolving credit 
facility bear floating interest rates linked 
to LIBOR plus a margin of 0.80%, where 
the ratio of net debt/ EBITDA is less than 
one. A commitment fee is payable at 
0.28% of the unutilised facility.
Liquidity
At 24 March 2017, the Group held 
£160.7m in cash and cash equivalents 
and had undrawn facilities of £120.0m. 
The Group did not draw down on its 
revolving credit facility on a cleared 
basis in the year ended 24 March 2017, 
giving a minimum facility headroom in 
the year of £120.0m. 
Glossary of Terms
Like-for-Like sales is a measure of 
change in sales from UK operations from 
prior year to current year.  
No adjustments to sales are made when 
individual customers are gained or lost.  
If a Business Centre is closed, for the 
twelve months following the closure date 
the sales of the Business Centre are 
removed from the prior year comparative.  
If sales are transferred to a replacement 
Business Centre in the same vicinity no 
such adjustment is made.  If a Business 
Centre is opened where none previously 
existed, all sales for the first twelve 
months will be excluded.
Where a business is acquired, sales are 
excluded until the anniversary of the 
acquisition.

CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 
The Group recognises that it has social and environmental responsibilities arising from its operations and is committed to 
responsible business practices. These improve the welfare of colleagues and the communities in which we operate, and reduce 
our impact on the environment.
Colleagues
It is the Group’s policy to involve colleagues in the business and to ensure that matters of concern to them, including the Group’s aims 
and objectives and its financial performance, are communicated regularly in an open manner and, where appropriate, colleagues’ 
views are taken into account. This is achieved through the use of business briefings and other less formal communication. 
The Directors encourage colleagues to become shareholders in order to promote active participation in, and commitment to, the 
Group’s success. This policy has been extended to all colleagues through the provision of a SAYE share scheme. 
As at 24 March 2017, the following number of colleagues were contributing monthly to the following schemes:
• 2,959 colleagues – 2016 SAYE scheme;
• 2,847 colleagues – 2015 SAYE scheme; and
• 2,319 colleagues – 2014 SAYE scheme.
Booker is an inclusive organisation where no-one receives less favourable treatment on the grounds of gender, nationality, marital 
status, colour, race, ethnic origin, creed, sexual orientation or disability. The promotion of equal opportunities for all employees is 
regarded as an important Group priority. 
An analysis of Directors, senior managers and other employees by gender as at 24 March 2017 is as follows:
Male  
Number
Female 
Number
Directors 6 2
Senior managers 56 6
Other employees 9,519 3,851
The Group has a balanced workforce in terms of experience, with an average age of 41.1 (2016: 40.6).
Community
The Group believes that good community relations are important to the long term development and sustainability of the operating 
businesses. The Group aims to build sustainable relationships with its customers, who are mainly independent businesses at the 
heart of their communities, by improving the choice, price and service of products and services supplied. 
We are proud to assist our retailers in supporting their local communities with sponsorship of local football and rugby teams, fun 
days with free stock and raffle prizes, school healthy breakfast campaigns and work with the local university.
Each business centre, distribution centre and support centre has a nominated local charity. For the year ended 24 March 2017, 
colleagues raised £68,594 for these charities.
The Group also donates surplus food to local homeless charities from Booker business centres and distribution centres. During 
the year, the equivalent of over 800,000 meals were donated to charities across the UK, up 46% on last year, with an additional 
14 tonnes of food donated to animal charities. In the last five years we have donated over two million meals to local charities.
Human Rights
The Group is committed to the upholding and respect of human rights. We expect our suppliers to operate in a fair and honest 
way towards their employees and those with whom they do business.
Environment 
Resource Efficiency
Booker recognises its obligation to consider carefully its use of natural resources. We are taking steps to reduce our impact on 
the environment, both in our store operations and in our supply chain. 
Using energy efficiently, minimising our emissions to air and monitoring our energy consumption are key components of our 
environmental work. Examples of initiatives this year are:
• Following on from work started last year, 35 business centres, one distribution centre and two distribution centre freezer 
rooms have now been converted to LED energy efficient lighting with a projected annualised average saving of 22% electricity 
per annum. Roll out will continue across the remainder of the estate over the next two years. Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements

CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 
• Last year we committed to reducing business miles through the use of video conferencing across the business. We are 
pleased to report that video conferencing is now set up at all our main business locations. 
• As part of our on-going work to reduce emissions from our vehicles, a trial of heavy goods vehicles that comply with the 
European EURO VI emission standards have shown an improvement of 6% in fuel efficiency. Replacement of our fleet is due 
to begin in May 2017 and is forecast to save approximately 1,416 tonnes of CO
2
e per annum.
During the year, our absolute use of energy was 255 GWh compared with 235 GWh in the prior year, an 8.5% increase. The 
increase was due to additional energy consumption of 13 GWh by Booker Retail Partners, which is included for the first time for 
a full year, as well as an increase in gas usage during a colder winter period.
Greenhouse Gas Emissions
We report on the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for which we are responsible in accordance with The Large and Medium-
sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 (as amended). The statement below summarises the 
Group’s GHG emissions from fuel consumption and the operation of the Group’s facilities for the year ended 24 March 2017 and 
the prior year.

Notes:
• The Group has reported on all material emission sources for which it deems itself to be responsible, and the emissions data is 
reported using an operational control approach to define our organisational boundary;
• The methodologies and definitions used to derive the table above are based on the UK Government Environmental Reporting 
Guidance 2013 using the GHG Protocol and DEFRA GHG Conversion Factors 2016, expiring June 2017;
• Data collected for the Government Carbon Reduction Commitment Energy Efficiency Scheme (‘CRC scheme’) has been used 
to report energy consumption data for Ritter & Classic. The CRC scheme is a mandatory reporting and pricing framework to 
improve energy efficiency in large public and private organisations;
• The intensity measure selected is tonnes CO
2
e per £m of sales; 
• In respect of India, we have undertaken a materiality assessment and consider that the related emissions are not material. 
Emissions from these operations are, therefore, excluded from our reported emissions; and
• CO

CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY REPORT CONTINUED
Environment continued
Greenhouse Gas Emissions continued
Overall our total Scope 1, 2 and 3 GHG emissions have shown a decrease of 7,418 tonnes, or 4% due to a marked reduction in 
refrigerant gas emissions and reduction in electricity from a change in opening hours and LED lighting conversions.
The Carbon Trust Standard is a voluntary certification and mark of excellence that enables organisations to demonstrate their 
success in cutting their carbon footprint. The Standard can be achieved for Energy, Waste and Water. The Standard is awarded 
for a two year period, with Booker obtaining a fourth consecutive Carbon Trust Standard and second Carbon Trust Waste 
Standard in 2015. This accreditation externally verifies eight years of absolute carbon footprint emissions reductions and four 
years of improved waste management. Booker Group is the only wholesaler to have held the Standard for that length of time. The 
award demonstrates Booker’s long term commitment to successfully measuring, managing and reducing its carbon footprint.
Preventing Waste
Company Waste Prevention and Recycling
We continue to work to prevent waste, redistribute fit for purpose food, increase recycling and divert waste away from landfill. We 
use the Government’s ‘waste hierarchy’ which sets out five steps for dealing with waste ranked by their environmental impact, to 
ensure all waste is dealt with in the most environmentally positive way. Each store and distribution centre participates in surplus 
food donations, recycling paper, plastic, cardboard, metal and wood. We have invested across the estate in balers, instigated 
waste league tables and continually focus on improvements. During the year we reduced waste to landfill by 73% and now recycle 
99% of total Group waste.
Business to Business Engagement
In addition to our own achievements, we believe that working on sustainability initiatives with independent businesses in local 
communities can deliver further improvements in sustainability.
Customer Packaging Recycling
In April 2012 our packaging recycling service was launched with approximately 13,500 customers regularly using the service. 
Volumes of cardboard recycled in the year ended 24 March 2017 were up on the prior year at over 17,000 tonnes.
Customer Used Cooking Oil Recycling
Customers can arrange a collection of used cooking oil from their premises. The Group operates a simple rebate scheme of 20p 
per litre of waste oil recycled. Over 18,000 customers are using the service and over 10.5 million litres of waste oil have been 
recycled into sustainable bio fuels in the year ended March 2017 up 57% on last year. The bio fuel derived from the waste cooking 
oil is part of the diesel blend used by our HGV vehicles. 
Packaging Improvements
As a wholesaler of packaged goods, our primary objective is to ensure that our products are safe to eat and reach consumers 
in optimal condition. Packaging plays a critical role in achieving this and we review at every opportunity how we can use fewer 
materials. This includes improving packaging to protect stock from damage, thereby reducing food waste, and reducing the 
weight of the packaging. This year packaging changes on own label products have saved 45 tonnes of packaging material 
including reducing the weight of our Chef Larder vegetable tins, moving Euro Shopper Washing Up Liquid and Fabric Conditioner 
from cardboard to shrinkwrap outer case and improving the concentration of the fabric conditioner. Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements

CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY REPORT CONTINUED
Ethical Sourcing
A number of the ingredients in our own label products are grown in developing countries. We seek to understand, manage and 
mitigate any issues associated with a particular commodity or country.
We use the Fairtrade and Red Tractor Farm Assurance schemes and all prospective own brand suppliers are required to complete 
a sustainability and ethics questionnaire. Examples of our approach are:
Red Tractor Farm Assurance
Red Tractor is a UK food assurance scheme which covers production standards on safety, hygiene, animal welfare and the 
environment. The Red Tractor logo on packs means food or drink has met these responsible production standards and is fully 
traceable back to independently inspected farms in the UK. Red Tractor certifies that food has been produced to independently 
inspected standards right across the food chain from farm to pack. At 24 March 2017, the Group had 115 own label products 
displaying the Red Tractor logo across its retail and catering ranges and continues to work to widen the products covered by this 
standard.
Fairtrade
The objective of Fairtrade is to achieve better selling prices, decent working conditions, local sustainability and fair terms of trade 
for farmers and workers in the developing world. Fairtrade is an independent mark found on products where ingredients in the 
product have been produced by small-scale farmers that meet Fairtrade’s social, economic and environmental standards. The 
standards include the protection of workers’ rights and the environment, payment of a Fairtrade minimum price and an additional 
premium to invest in the farmers’ and workers’ community. The Group continues to expand its range of catering products that 
are certified as being Fairtrade, with all Chef’s Larder tea and coffee products now being Fairtrade accredited. The Lichfield 
Fairtrade range now has 24 products across tea, coffee, sugar and hot chocolate. In the calendar year 2016 Booker generated 
over £200,000 in Fairtrade Premiums, that tea and coffee farmers and workers invest in social, environmental and economic 
developmental projects to improve their businesses and their communities. 
Sustainable Palm Oil
Palm oil production has been well documented as a cause of substantial damage to the natural environment. Its impact includes 
deforestation, habitat loss of critically endangered species and a significant increase in greenhouse gas emissions. All Chef’s 
Larder, Happy Shopper and Euro Shopper biscuits and snacks support the production of certified sustainable palm oil by using 
palm oil sourced through RSPO-approved supply chain models. 
Sustainable Fish
We recognise the pressures placed on marine wildlife by commercial fishing practices and act where practicable to minimise our 
impact on marine wildlife conservation and sustainability. The three factors that influence sustainability are species, fishery region 
and fishing method. The Marine Conservation Society has identified a number of fish species which are from unsustainable, over-
fished, highly vulnerable or poorly managed fisheries. This also includes species associated with unacceptable levels of by-catch. 
Booker will not trade in endangered or unsustainable fish or seafood (fish identified as ‘Category 5’ by the Marine Conservation 
Society). Where species come under pressure, we work with our suppliers to improve the sustainability across our range of fish 
products. In addition, Chef Direct has achieved Marine Stewardship Council chain of custody accreditation. Our fresh farmed 
Salmon is sourced from either Norway or Scotland; the Norwegian fish is Global G.A.P . accredited and the Scottish fish is RSPCA 
Freedom food accredited. Global G.A.P. and RSPCA Freedom promote responsible sustainable farming.
Egg Sourcing Policy
Booker Group already offers cage free, free range eggs in pack sizes appropriate to both our retail and catering business 
customers.  Our intention is to move to full cage free sourcing of both branded and own label shell eggs by 2025, which will 
include all ‘eggs as ingredients’ in our own label lines. Cage free welfare provides hens with space to move freely, litter to scratch 
and dustbathe in, perches to rest on and nest boxes for hens to lay their eggs. PAGE TITLE

MANAGEMENT OF RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES
Internal Controls and Risk Management 
The Board attaches considerable importance to, and acknowledges its responsibility for, the Group’s systems of internal control 
and risk management and receives regular reports on such matters. The Board’s policy is to have systems in place which optimise 
the Group’s ability to manage risk in an effective and appropriate manner. The Board has delegated to the Executive Committee 
detailed responsibility for identifying, evaluating and monitoring the risks facing the Group and for deciding how these are to be 
managed. In addition to formal reviews of risk management by the Executive Committee, members are expected to report to the 
Executive Committee as necessary the occurrence of any material internal control issues, serious accidents or events that have 
had a major commercial impact, or any significant new risks which have been identified. Such matters are reported to the next 
Board meeting and/or Audit Committee meeting as appropriate. 
The Group also has in place systems and procedures for exercising control and managing risk in respect of financial reporting 
and the preparation of consolidated accounts which are monitored by the Audit Committee on the Board’s behalf and reviewed 
annually by the Board. These include:
• the formulation and deployment of Group accounting policies and procedures;
• Group policies governing the maintenance of accounting records, transaction reporting and key financial control procedures;
• monthly operational review meetings which include, as necessary, reviews of internal financial reporting issues and financial 
control monitoring; and
• ongoing training and development of financial reporting personnel. 
The Group’s systems and procedures are designed to identify, manage and, where practicable, reduce and mitigate the effects 
of the risk of failure to achieve business objectives. They are not designed to eliminate such risk, recognising that any system can 
only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
The Board formally reviews the operation and effectiveness of the Group’s system of internal controls on an annual basis. The 
latest review covered the financial year to 24 March 2017. No significant failings or weaknesses were identified from this review. 
The Board has a process for identifying, evaluating and managing the risks faced by the Group and the resources that our 
business devotes to them. This process is continual and has been in place for the year under review up to the date of this report, 
and is regularly reviewed by the Board in accordance with relevant guidance. There is an established framework of internal 
controls, which is set out in procedures approved by the Board and which include financial, operational and compliance controls 
and risk management. These procedures are readily accessible to staff, who follow their guidance. The most important elements 
of this framework are described below: 
Management Structure 
The Board has overall responsibility for the Company and the Executive Committee has responsibility for speciﬁc aspects of the 
Group’s affairs. The Board and each of its committees operate under a schedule of matters or terms of reference and the Board 
determines how the Chief Executive and the Executive Committee may operate within a framework of delegated authorities and 
reserved powers which seek to ensure that certain transactions which are significant in terms of their size or type, are undertaken 
only after Board review. 
The Executive Committee is chaired by Charles Wilson (Chief Executive) and comprises Jonathan Prentis (Group Finance Director), 
Guy Farrant (Chief Operating Officer), Mark Chilton (Company Secretary and General Counsel) and other senior executives 
representing the operational functions within the Group. It meets every two weeks to discuss operational matters, compliance, 
health and safety and trading performance. 
Corporate Accounting and Procedures 
Responsibility levels are communicated throughout the Group as part of the corporate communication procedure. Accounting, 
delegation of authority and authorisation levels, segregation of duties and other control procedures, together with the general 
ethos of the Group are included in these communications, and standardised accounting policies are in place reflecting this policy. 
These procedures are subject to review to ensure that improvements to enhance controls can be made. 
Quality and Integrity of Personnel 
The integrity and competence of personnel is ensured through high recruitment standards and subsequent training. Quality 
personnel are seen as an essential part of the control environment and the ethical standards expected are communicated 
through senior members of staff. 
Three Year Business Plan
Each year the Group produces a three year business plan which covers development of profits and cash flow generation over 
that period. Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
PAGE TITLE
Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 / Strategic Report
15
Budgetary Process 
Each year the Board approves the annual budget, which includes an assessment of key risk areas. Performance is monitored 
and relevant action taken throughout the year by regular reporting to the Board of updated forecasts together with information 
on key risk areas.
Risk Management
The Board assesses risk management throughout the Group aided by detailed reviews of internal controls and risk management 
procedures. The Group’s risk register is reviewed by the Board as part of annual strategic planning and budgetary cycles.
Investment Appraisal 
Capital expenditure is regulated by the use of authorisation levels. For all expenditure beyond specified levels, Board approval is 
required. 
Internal Audit 
The Group’s internal audit function, which reports to the Group Finance Director and Chairman of the Audit Committee, monitors 
the effectiveness of key internal controls and the adequacy of these controls to manage business risk and to safeguard the Group’s 
assets and resources, in accordance with a work plan approved and monitored by the Audit Committee. Its conclusions are 
communicated to the relevant level of management and the function has a direct reporting responsibility to the Audit Committee.
Principal Risks and Uncertainties
During the year the Board carried out a robust assessment of the prinicipal risks facing the company, including those that would 
threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity. The principal risks and corresponding mitigation set out 
below represent the principal uncertainties that the Board believes may impact the Group’s ability to deliver effectively its strategy 
in the future. The list does not include all risks that the Group faces and it does not list the risks in any order of priority.
Risk Impact Mitigating factors
Failure to respond 
to competition
The industry is extremely competitive  
with the market being served by numerous 
competitors, ranging from national 
multiple retailers to regional independent 
wholesalers. Failure to respond to 
competition could have an adverse impact 
on the Group’s sales, operating profits  
and cashflow.
We compete by closely monitoring the activities of our competitors 
and ensuring we continue to improve the choice, price and service 
to our customers.
Changes in 
regulation
The Group operates in an environment 
governed by strict regulations to ensure 
the safety and protection of customers, 
shareholders, employees and other 
stakeholders and the operation of an open 
and competitive market. These regulations 
include food hygiene, health and safety, 
tobacco, data protection, the rules of the 
London Stock Exchange and competition 
law. Changing laws and regulation may 
impact our ability to market or sell certain 
products or could cause the Group to incur 
additional costs or liabilities that could 
adversely affect its business.
In all cases, the Board takes its responsibilities seriously, and 
recognises that any breach of regulation could cause reputational 
and financial damage to the Group. Accordingly the Group seeks 
to operate in accordance with applicable laws and regulations and 
to monitor proposed changes.
Economic 
and political 
environment
Our operations and earnings may be 
adversely affected by political or economic 
instability.
The Group remains vigilant to any changes and events in the 
economic and political environment. The Group maintains an 
on-going dialogue with relevant authorities/institutions through its 
respective trade associations. PAGE TITLE

MANAGEMENT OF RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES CONTINUED
Principal Risks and Uncertainties continued
Risk Impact Mitigating factors
Product quality 
and safety
The quality and safety of our products is 
of critical importance and any failure in this 
regard would affect the confidence of our 
customers in us. This could have an adverse 
impact on the Group’s reputation, sales, 
operating profits and cashflow.
We work with our suppliers to ensure the integrity of the products 
supplied. Food hygiene practices are taken seriously throughout the 
Group, and are monitored both through internal audit procedures 
and by external bodies, such as environmental health departments, 
within local authorities. We have well prepared procedures for 
crisis management in order to act quickly when required. We are 
aware that if we fail, or are perceived to have failed, to deliver to 
our customers’ satisfaction the expected standards of quality and 
safety in our products, their loyalty to us may be impacted. This in 
turn could adversely impact our financial results.
Health and safety 
risks
A health and safety related incident could 
result in serious injury to the Group’s 
employees, contractors, customers and 
visitors, which could adversely affect 
our operations and result in reputational 
damage, criminal prosecution and civil 
litigation. This could affect the Group’s 
operating profits and cashflow.
The Group has developed an effective health and safety 
management system to ensure compliance with all legal duties 
placed on the organisation by law. All systems are subject to 
regular review with training provided as appropriate. 
The Group employs a Health and Safety manager to maintain 
the management system, along with the identification and 
remediation of specific risks, and ensuring employees are aware 
of regulatory requirements.
Failure of 
the Group’s 
information 
technology 
systems
The maintenance and development of 
information technology systems may result 
in system failures, including cyber security 
breaches which may adversely impact the 
Group’s ability to operate, which could 
affect the Group’s sales, operating profits 
and cashflow.
The Group has appropriate controls in place to mitigate the risk 
of systems failure, including systems back up procedures and 
disaster recovery plans, and also has appropriate virus protection 
and network security controls.
Employee 
engagement and 
retention
The continued success of the Group 
relies on investment in the training and 
development of our employees.
The Group’s employment policies, remuneration and benefits 
packages are designed to be competitive, as well as providing 
colleagues with fulfilling career opportunities. The Group 
continually engages with employees across the business to 
ensure that we keep strengthening our team at every level.
Supplier credit Availability of supplier credit is essential for 
the Group’s financial performance. If the 
providers of credit insurance withdraw or 
materially reduce the levels of cover they 
provide to the Group’s trade creditors in 
respect of the Group, this might affect the 
Group’s ability to obtain products from 
those suppliers on existing credit terms and 
could worsen the Group’s cashflow.
The Group Finance Director meets the key credit insurers to 
ensure that they have an up to date understanding of the Group’s 
financial position. Likewise, we keep suppliers updated of key 
developments in the Group, through amongst other things, key 
supplier conferences, and aim to be the suppliers' preferred route 
to market.
Pension funding A worsening funding position may require 
the Group to pay cash contributions 
or provide further assurance to cover 
future liabilities. This could worsen the 
Group’s cashflow.
The Group seeks to agree appropriate investment policies with the 
Trustees and closely monitors the funding position of the Pension 
Schemes with the Trustees. Both the Company and the Trustees 
take advice from independent qualified actuaries.
Resource 
management and 
energy efficiency
A long term increase in energy prices could 
have an adverse effect on the Group’s 
operating profits and cashflow with an 
increasing cost to operations to adapt to 
climate change and mitigate impact.
The Group has a continual focus on reducing our environmental 
impact and implementing changes to our operations to maximise 
opportunities such as recycling more waste and using more 
renewable sources of fuel. 
Substantial investment is made to improve environmental risk 
management, with a focus on energy efficiency when investing  
in new capital projects. Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements

Assessment of the Group’s Prospects
Going Concern 
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in 
operational existence for at least twelve months from the date of this report. Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going 
concern basis in preparing the Group’s and Company’s financial statements. Further information in relation to the Directors’ 
assessment of going concern is contained in note 1f to the financial statements.
Viability Statement
In accordance with provision C.2.2 of the UK Corporate Governance Code 2014, the Directors have assessed the Group’s 
viability over a three year period to March 2020. This period has been considered for the following reasons:
• The business model can be evolved for significant changes in market structure or government policy over the three  
year period;
• For major investment projects three years is considered by the Board to be a reasonable time horizon for an assessment 
of the outcome; and
• The Group’s strategic planning cycle covers a three year period.
The Group produces a forecast three year business plan which incorporates projections for income and cash flow. An 
analysis has been completed to evaluate the financial impact (including on sales, profitability and liquidity) of the Group’s 
principal risks, set out on pages 15 to 16, occurring whether individually or in unison over the period, including in a number 
of severe but plausible scenarios. Whilst each of the principal risks has a potential impact, the sensitvity analysis has been 
focussed on those considered to have the most significant impact. The analysis also assesses the potential impact on the 
Group’s available sources of funding and the range of mitigating actions that would be available to offset the effect of those 
risks, should they arise. 
Based on the results of this analysis, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company will be able to continue 
in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the three year period of their assessment.
Strategic Report Approval
The Strategic Report, outlined on pages 1 to 17 , (including the assessment of the Group’s prospects as set out above) incorporates 
the Highlights, the Business Profile and Key Performance Indicators, the Chairman’s Statement, the Chief Executive’s Review, the 
Group Finance Director’s Report, the Corporate Social Responsibility Report and the Management of Risks and Uncertainties 
sections of this document.
This report was approved by the Board of Directors on 17 May 2017.

The Strategic Report can be found on pages 1 to 17 and is 
incorporated by reference and deemed to form part of this 
report. The Strategic Report includes information on the 
principal risks and uncertainties facing the business.
Ordinary Dividends
An interim ordinary dividend of 0.63 pence per share was paid 
on 25 November 2016. The Directors have recommended a final 
ordinary dividend of 4.97 pence per ordinary share, being payable 
on 7 July 2017 to shareholders on the register of members at the 
close of business on 9 June 2017 , giving a total ordinary dividend 
for the year of 5.60 pence per ordinary share (2016: 4.60 pence). 
Special Dividend
Since 2014, the Company has annually returned capital to 
shareholders by way of a “B Share Scheme”. This year the 
Company will not be proposing a return of capital by way of a 
“B Share Scheme” but instead is proposing a return of value to 
shareholders by way of a special dividend. The Directors have 
recommended a special dividend of 3.02 pence per ordinary 
share, being payable on 7 July 2017 to shareholders on the 
register of members at the close of business on 9 June 2017, 
at a cost of approximately £54m based on the issued share 
capital of the Company at the date of this report.
Interests of Directors in Contracts
During the period, no Director had any material interest in any 
significant contract to which the Company or any subsidiary 
was a party.
Changes of Control
All of the Company’s share schemes contain provisions relating 
to a change of control. Outstanding options and awards normally 
vest and become exercisable on a change of control, subject to 
the satisfaction of any performance conditions at that time. The 
Company is not a party to any other significant agreements that 
take effect, alter or terminate upon a change of control following 
a takeover bid other than its bank facility agreement, which 
provides that on a change of control the lender shall not be 
obliged to fund a utilisation (except for a rollover loan) and, if it so 
requires, may cancel its commitment and declare its participation 
in all outstanding utilisations immediately due and payable. 
Furthermore, the Company is not party to any agreement with 
the Directors or employees providing for compensation for loss 
of office or employment (whether through resignation, purported 
redundancy or otherwise) that occurs as a result of a takeover bid 
other than with Charles Wilson, in that in the event of a change of 
control of the Company, Charles Wilson has the right to terminate 
his employment on 30 days’ notice and to receive a payment equal 
to his gross salary for his contractual notice period. On completion 
of the proposed merger with Tesco and change of control of the 
Company, Charles Wilson has agreed to waive his right to terminate 
his employment.
Directors
Biographies of the serving Directors of the Company are 
provided on pages 20 and 21 of this Report. They all served on 
the Board throughout the year. In addition, Lord Bilimoria served 
on the Board during the year until his retirement on 6 July 2016 
and Bryn Satherley served on the Board until his resignation on 
1 April 2016.
Appointment and Retirement of Directors
Subject to applicable law, from time to time the Board may 
appoint any person to be a Director. Under the Articles, any 
such Director shall hold office only until the next AGM and shall 
then be eligible for election. The Articles require that at each 
AGM at least one-third of the Board should retire as Directors 
by rotation, however, in accordance with the recommendations 
of the UK Corporate Governance Code, all Directors will retire 
and offer themselves for re-election at the 2017 AGM.
Directors’ and Officers’ Liability Insurance
The Company maintains appropriate directors’ and officers’ 
liability insurance in respect of itself and its Directors and 
Officers. The Directors may also be indemnified in accordance 
with the Company’s Articles of Association and to the maximum 
extent permitted by law, although no such indemnities are 
currently in place. The insurance does not, and any indemnities 
if granted would not, provide cover where the relevant Director 
or Officer has acted fraudulently or dishonestly.
Share Capital 
As at 24 March 2017, the Company’s share capital consisted of 
1,781,960,633 issued and fully paid Ordinary Shares with a nominal 
value of 1 pence per share and 4, 135,800 Redeemable Preference 
Shares with a nominal value of 3.2 pence per share. The rights 
and obligations attaching to these shares are contained in the 
Company’s Articles of Association. Each Ordinary Share carries 
the right to one vote on a poll, and to attend and speak at a general 
meeting of the Company, to appoint proxies to exercise full voting 
rights and to participate in any distribution of income or capital. 
There are no restrictions on transfer or limitations on the holding 
of the Ordinary Shares or the Redeemable Preference Shares, nor 
are there any requirements for prior approval for their transfer. The 
Redeemable Preference Shares carry no rights save for the right of 
redemption in accordance with the Articles of Association. 
The Directors may exercise all the powers of the Company 
subject to the provisions of relevant legislation, the Articles of 
Association and any directions given by the Company in general 
meeting, including those in relation to the issue and buy-back of 
shares. At each Annual General Meeting, the shareholders are 
requested to renew the Directors’ powers to allot securities in 
the Company up to the value specified in the notice of meeting 
and to renew the Directors’ powers to allot securities without the 
application of pre-emption rights up to the value specified in the 
notice of meeting in accordance with the Articles of Association.
DIRECTORS’ REPORT
The Directors present their report for the 52 week period ended 24 March 2017. The FCA’s Listing Rules and Disclosure Guidance 
and Transparency Rules also require the Company to make certain disclosures, some of which have been included in other 
appropriate sections of the Annual Report and Accounts. The following are incorporated into the Directors’ Report by reference:

Disclosure of Information to External Auditor
Each of the Directors who held office at the date of approval 
of this Directors’ Report confirms that, so far as he or she 
is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the 
Company’s External Auditor is unaware and that he or she 
has taken all the steps that he or she ought to have taken as 
a Director in order to make himself or herself aware of any 
relevant audit information and to establish that the Company’s 
External Auditor is aware of that information.
External Auditor
As more fully described in the Audit Committee report, following 
the announcement on 27 January 2017 that we were intending 
to merge with Tesco to create the UK’s leading food business, 
the Board has concluded that the Company’s best interests 
would be served by maintaining the status quo and ensuring 
stability until completion of the merger. Accordingly, we have 
agreed to, subject to shareholder approval, retain KPMG LLP 
(KPMG) as the Company’s External Auditor until completion 
of the merger with Tesco. Should the merger not complete, 
the Company would then look to re-tender the external audit 
engagement.  
This report was approved by the Board of Directors on  
17 May 2017.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT
Compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code
Throughout the year ended 24 March 2017 and to the date of this document, the Company complied with the provisions and 
applied the Main Principles of the UK Corporate Governance Code 2014 (the ‘Code’), being the version of the code applicable to 
the year under review.
This Corporate Governance Report, together with the Audit Committee Report, the Nomination Committee Report and the 
Remuneration Report, describes how the Company has complied with the provisions of the Code.
The Role of the Board and its Committees 
The Company is led and controlled by the Board of Directors (the ‘Board’) chaired by Stewart Gilliland. 
The Board currently consists of three Executive Directors and five Independent Non-Executive Directors. Following the resignation 
of Lord Bilimoria at the AGM held on 6 July 2016, Stewart Gilliland was appointed Chairman of the Nomination Committee and 
Karen Jones was appointed Senior Independent Director. Gary Hughes succeeded Andrew Cripps as Chairman of the Audit 
Committee on 1 December 2016.
All of the Non-Executive Directors are considered by the Board to be independent of management and free from any business or 
other relationship that could materially interfere with the exercise of their independent judgement in accordance with the Code. 
The independence of Non-Executive Directors is considered at least annually and is based on the criteria suggested in the Code. 
The Non-Executive Directors provide constructive challenge and bring independence to the Board and its decision making 
process. Further disclosure on the independence of Non-Executive Directors is covered in the Nomination Committee Report, 
which can found on pages 30 to 33.
The Board believes that it is appropriate to have a Senior Independent Non-Executive Director and Karen Jones has fulfilled this 
role since 6 July 2016. Karen Jones is available to shareholders where concerns have not been resolved through the normal 
channels and for when such contact would be inappropriate. 
The Board believes that it has sufficient members to contain a balance of skills and experience, but it is not so large as to be 
unwieldy. The Board contains a balance of Executive and Non-Executive Directors such that no individual, or group of individuals 
can dominate the Board’s decision making. No one individual has unfettered powers to make decisions. 
Details of the skills and experience of the Directors are contained in the Directors’ biographies on pages 20 and 21.
The Board meets regularly on at least twelve scheduled occasions during each year and more frequently, if necessary. There 
were twelve scheduled Board meetings held in the year under review.
Board attendance for scheduled meetings during the year are shown below:

Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements

The Board is responsible to shareholders for ensuring that the Group is appropriately managed and that it achieves its objectives. 
The Board has adopted a formal schedule of matters specifically reserved for decision by it, thus ensuring that it exercises control 
over appropriate strategic, financial, operational and regulatory issues. At its meetings, the Board reviews trading performance, 
ensures adequate financing, monitors strategy, examines investment and acquisition opportunities and discusses reports 
to shareholders. Matters not specifically reserved for the Board and its Committees under its schedule of matters and the 
Committees’ terms of reference, or for shareholders in general meeting, are delegated to members of the Executive Committee.
It is the Company’s policy that the roles of the Chairman and Chief Executive are separate, with their roles and responsibilities 
clearly divided and set out in writing. The Chairman’s main responsibility is the leadership and management of the Board and its 
governance. The Chairman’s commitment to the Company is usually two days per month. His other significant commitments are 
disclosed in his biography on page 20. The Board considers that these commitments do not hinder his ability to discharge his 
responsibilities to the Company effectively.
The Chief Executive is responsible for the leadership and day-to-day management of the Group. This includes formulating and 
recommending the Group’s strategy for Board approval in addition to executing the approved strategy.
Recommendations for appointments to the Board are made by the Nomination Committee. The Committee follows Board 
approved procedures (available on the Group’s website) which provide a framework for the different types of Board appointments 
on which the Committee may be expected to make recommendations. Appointments are made on merit and against objective 
criteria with due regard to diversity (including skills, experience and gender). Non-Executive appointees are also required to 
demonstrate that they have sufficient time to devote to the role.
Information and Professional Development 
Directors are continually updated on the Group’s businesses, the markets in which they operate and changes to the competitive 
and regulatory environment through briefings to the Board and meetings with senior executives. Board visits to Group business 
locations enable the Directors to meet with local management and employees and to update and maintain their knowledge and 
familiarity with the Group’s operations.
Non-Executive Directors are also encouraged to visit Group operations throughout their tenure to increase their exposure to  
the business.
The Chairman is responsible for ensuring that Directors receive accurate, timely and clear information. The provision of information 
to the Board was reviewed during the year as part of the performance evaluation exercise referred to below. To ensure that adequate 
time is available for Board discussion and to enable informed decision making, briefing papers are prepared and circulated to 
Directors in the week prior to scheduled Board meetings. All Non-Executive Directors are encouraged to make further enquiries 
as they feel appropriate of the Executive Directors and executives. In addition, Board Committees are provided with sufficient 
resources and the power to co-opt such additional support as they may require from time to time, to undertake their duties. 
All Directors are entitled to receive independent professional advice at the Company’s expense and have access to the services 
of a professionally qualified and experienced Company Secretary, who is responsible for the flow of information to the Board and 
advising the Board on corporate governance matters. This ensures compliance with Board procedures and applicable laws and 
regulation. The Board has responsibility for the appointment and removal of the Company Secretary.
On appointment, individual Directors undergo an induction programme covering, amongst other matters:
• the business of the Group;
• their legal and regulatory responsibilities as Directors of the Company;
• briefings and presentations from Executive Directors and senior executives; and
• opportunities to visit business operations.
Performance Evaluation
During the year, the Board conducted an evaluation of its own performance and that of its three principal committees. The individual 
performance of the Non-Executive Directors was also evaluated through one to one interviews with the Chairman. In April 2017 , each 
Director completed a questionnaire prepared by the Chairman and Company Secretary to rate the collective performance of the 
Board and its committees. The Company Secretary collated the evaluation results and the Chairman then reviewed an unattributed 
executive summary, highlighting key outcomes. A report of the findings was then presented to and discussed by the Board. No 
actions were considered necessary as a result of these evaluations and the Chairman confirms that each Director continues to make 
a valuable contribution to the Board and, where relevant, its Committees and devotes sufficient time to the role. The effectiveness of 
the Board and its Committees will be kept under review in accordance with corporate governance best practice.
As reported in the 2016 Annual Report and Accounts, an external evaluation process facilitated by Prism Communications & 
Management Ltd was undertaken in April 2016. On 27 January 2017, it was announced that we were intending to merge with 
Tesco. Should the merger not complete the next externally facilitated board evaluation will be conducted in April 2019. Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 / Governance

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT CONTINUED
Performance Evaluation continued
During the year, the Chairman and the Non-Executive Directors met without the Executive Directors being present. There was also 
one meeting of the Non-Executive Directors chaired by the Senior Independent Non-Executive Director at which the Chairman 
was not present in order to appraise the Chairman’s performance. The Senior Independent Director provided feedback to the 
Chairman of this review.
Board Committees 
The Board has established an Audit Committee, a Nomination Committee and a Remuneration Committee to oversee and debate 
issues of policy outside main Board meetings. Throughout the year, the Chairman of each Committee provided the Board with 
a summary of key issues considered at the committee meetings. Board committees are authorised to engage the services of 
external advisers as they deem necessary in the furtherance of their duties at the Company’s expense. 
The Audit Committee Report is on pages 25 to 29, the Nomination Committee Report is on pages 30 to 33 and the Remuneration 
Report is on pages 34 to 52.
Re-election of Directors 
All Directors are required by the Company’s Articles of Association to submit themselves to shareholders for re-election at the first 
Annual General Meeting after their appointment and thereafter by rotation at least once every three years. In accordance with the 
Code all Directors will, however, stand for re-election annually. 
Relations with Shareholders 
In fulfilling their responsibilities, the Directors believe that they govern the Group in the best interests of shareholders, whilst having 
due regard to the interests of other stakeholders in the Group including customers, employees and suppliers. 
The Code encourages a dialogue with institutional shareholders based on the mutual understanding of objectives. The Executive 
Directors have regular and ongoing communication with major shareholders throughout the year, by participating in investor 
roadshows and presentations to shareholders. Feedback from these visits is reported to the Board. The Executive Directors also 
have regular contact with analysts and brokers. The Chairman, Senior Independent Non-Executive Director and other Non-Executive 
Directors receive feedback on matters raised at the meetings with shareholders and are offered the opportunity to attend meetings 
with major shareholders. As a result of these procedures, the Non-Executive Directors believe that they are aware of shareholders’ 
views. In addition, Karen Jones, the Senior Independent Non-Executive Director, consulted our major shareholders with regards to the 
Directors’ Remuneration Policy to be put forward for approval at our upcoming AGM and is available to meet with major shareholders.
Arrangements can also be made through the Company Secretary for major shareholders to meet with newly appointed Directors.
The Group maintains a website at www.bookergroup.com which is regularly updated and contains information about the Group. 
The Code encourages boards to use the Annual General Meeting to communicate with investors and to encourage their 
participation. In compliance with the Code, the Board welcomes as many shareholders as possible to attend the Annual General 
Meeting to discuss any interest or concern, including performance, governance or strategy, with the Directors. 
All Directors are expected to attend the Annual General Meeting. The Chairs of the Audit, Nomination and Remuneration 
Committees are available at the Annual General Meeting to answer shareholder questions, through the Chairman of the Board, on 
the responsibilities and activities of their Committees. Shareholders also have the opportunity to meet with the Directors following 
the conclusion of the formal part of the meeting.
In compliance with the Code, at the Annual General Meeting, the Chairman will announce the level of proxies lodged on each 
resolution, the balance for and against and abstentions, and such details will be placed on the Group’s website following the 
meeting. A separate resolution will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting in respect of each substantially separate issue. 
Directors’ Conflicts of Interest
In accordance with the Company’s Articles of Association and section 175 of the Companies Act 2006, formal procedures for the 
notification and authorisation of potential and actual conflicts of interest have been approved by the Board. 
These procedures, which enable the Directors to impose limits or conditions when giving or reviewing authorisation, ensure 
that only Directors who have no interest in the matter being considered can authorise conflicts, and require the Board to review 
the register of Directors’ conflicts annually and on an ad-hoc basis when necessary. Any potential conflicts of interest in relation 
to newly appointed Directors are considered by the Board prior to appointment. These procedures have operated effectively 
throughout the current financial period.
This report was approved by the Board of Directors on 17 May 2017.

AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT
Chairman’s Introduction to the Audit Committee Report
I am pleased to present the Report of the Audit Committee for 2017. This Report provides shareholders with an overview of the 
activities carried out by the Committee during the year.
On 1 December 2016, I succeeded Andrew Cripps as Chairman of this Committee.
We reported last year that having tendered the external audit engagement we intended to appoint PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP 
(‘PwC’) as the Company’s statutory auditor for the year ending March 2018. This was intended to enable a smooth transition from 
KPMG to PwC, having completed the process of integrating Budgens and Londis into the Group’s accounting systems. 
On 27 January 2017 it was announced that we were intending to merge with Tesco. As a consequence, the Committee and the 
Board concluded that the Company’s best interests would be served by maintaining the status quo and ensuring stability until 
completion of the merger. Accordingly, we agreed to recommend KPMG as statutory auditor until completion of the merger with 
Tesco. Should the merger not complete, the Company would then look to re-tender the external audit engagement. 
I would like to take this opportunity to thank Andrew Cripps for his significant contribution to the Group over the past nine years 
and was pleased that, rather than retiring as planned, he has agreed to remain a member of the Board and Audit Committee. 
I will be available to shareholders at the forthcoming AGM to answer any questions relating to the role of the Committee.
On behalf of the Board.

AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT CONTINUED
Role and Responsibilities of the Committee
The Committee supports the Board in fulfilling its responsibilities in relation to financial reporting; monitoring the integrity of 
the financial statements and other announcements of financial results published by the Group; and reviewing and challenging 
the judgements and actions of management in relation to the financial statements. The Committee reviews the effectiveness 
of the Group’s internal financial control and financial risk management systems and the effectiveness of the Group’s Internal 
Audit function. On behalf of the Board, the Committee manages the appointment and remuneration of the External Auditor and 
monitors its performance and independence. The Group supports an independent and confidential whistleblowing procedure 
and the Committee monitors the operation of this facility.
In accordance with the Code, the Board requested that the Committee advise whether it believes the Annual Report and 
Accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to 
assess the Company’s position and performance, business model and strategy.
The Committee’s Terms of Reference reflect this requirement and can be found in the Investor Centre/Legal Documents section 
of the Group’s website. A copy may be obtained from the Company Secretary.

All members of the Committee are and were considered by the Board to be independent. 
The Committee members have been selected to provide the wide range of financial and commercial expertise necessary to fulfil 
the Committee’s duties and responsibilities. Both Gary Hughes and Andrew Cripps are Chartered Accountants and are both 
considered by the Board to have recent and relevant financial experience, as required by the Code. Gary Hughes and Andrew 
Cripps also have substantial and recent audit committee experience ensuring that the Committee remains abreast of accounting 
and regulatory developments. Karen Jones has substantial relevant commercial experience. Details of the skills and experience 
of the Directors are contained in the Directors’ biographies on pages 20 and 21 of the Annual Report and Accounts.
The Committee has good access to the Group’s finance team, to its Internal Audit function and to its External Auditor and can 
seek further professional training and advice, at the Group’s cost, as appropriate. 
The quorum necessary for the transaction of business is two, each of whom must be a Non-Executive Director. Only members 
of the Committee have the right to attend Committee meetings, however, during the year, Stewart Gilliland, as a Non-Executive 
Director and in his capacity as Chairman, Charles Wilson, Chief Executive, Jonathan Prentis, Group Finance Director, the Head of 
Internal Audit and representatives from KPMG, the External Auditor, were invited to attend meetings. The Committee also meets 
separately with the Head of Internal Audit and the External Auditor without management being present. 
The Company Secretary is Secretary to the Committee.
Meeting Frequency and Main Activities in the Year
The Committee met on four scheduled occasions during the year ended 24 March 2017. All members of the Committee attended 
every scheduled meeting. 
During the year ended 24 March 2017, the Committee reviewed and made recommendations to the Board on the Preliminary 
Results Announcement for the period to 25 March 2016, the 2016 Annual Report and Accounts and the Interim Results 
Announcement for the period to 9 September 2016. 
Since 24 March 2017, the Committee has met on two occasions to review and make recommendations to the Board on the 
Preliminary Results Announcement for the period to 24 March 2017 and the 2017 Annual Report and Accounts. Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 / Governance
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
27
In carrying out its reviews during the year, the Committee considered:
• whether the Group had applied appropriate accounting policies and practices both on a year on year basis and across the Group;
• the significant areas in which judgement had been applied in preparation of the financial statements in accordance with the 
accounting policies set out on pages 64 to 69 of the Annual Report and Accounts;
• the paper prepared to support the going concern and viability statement referred to on page 17 of the Annual Report and Accounts;
• reports from the Group Finance Director and the External Auditor;
• the clarity and completeness of disclosures and compliance with relevant financial reporting standards and corporate 
governance and regulatory requirements; and 
• whether the Annual Report and Accounts, taken as a whole, was fair, balanced and understandable and provided the 
information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s position and performance, business model and strategy.
The Committee also:
• approved the Internal Audit and External Auditor’s work plans for the Group;
• considered regular reports from the Head of Internal Audit on their findings;
• reviewed the External Auditor’s independence and objectivity, the effectiveness of the audit process and approved the External 
Auditor’s remuneration; 
• reviewed the recommendation to appoint PwC as statutory auditor for the year ending 30 March 2018 and recommended the 
re-appointment of KPMG as statutory auditor until completion of the merger with Tesco; and
• approved the appropriateness of the External Auditor providing non-audit services and related fees.
Significant Judgemental Areas
The significant areas of judgement considered by the Committee in relation to the accounts for the year ended 24 March 2017 
and how these were addressed are outlined below. Each of these areas received particular focus from the External Auditor, who 
provided detailed analysis and assessment of the matters in their report to the Committee.
Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension Schemes
The Group operates a variety of post employment benefit arrangements, as outlined in note 18 to the financial statements. 
Although the defined benefit schemes are closed to future accrual, they are sensitive to changes in actuarial assumptions. We 
challenged the valuations prepared by the Group’s pension advisors and, following discussions with management, were satisfied 
that the judgements exercised were appropriate. During their audit, KPMG evaluated the assumptions and methodologies used 
by the Group’s pension advisors and assessed whether the assumptions made were appropriate and not materially different 
from external benchmarks. KPMG reported to us on the assumptions used and the way that our schemes had been accounted. 
Property Provisions
The Group has recorded property provisions in the sum of £37.9m as outlined in note 19 to the financial statements, which, by 
their nature, are uncertain and highly judgemental. We scrutinised the key elements of judgement with management to assure 
ourselves as to the adequacy and appropriateness of the provisions. Following this review, we were satisfied that the judgements 
exercised were appropriate. As part of the year end audit, KPMG considered the nature of the provisions, the potential outcomes, 
any developments relating to specific claims, and the prior history of lease obligations, provisions and claims in order to assess 
whether the provisions recorded were appropriate.
Following discussions with the External Auditor, and the deliberations set out above, we were satisfied that the financial statements 
dealt appropriately with each of the areas of significant judgement.
The External Auditor also reported to the Committee on any misstatements that they had found in the course of their work. The 
Committee noted their work and were satisfied that no material amounts required adjustment.
Fair, Balanced and Understandable Assessment
One of the key compliance requirements of a group’s financial statements is for the Annual Report and Accounts to be fair, balanced 
and understandable. The coordination and review of Group wide contributions into the Annual Report and Accounts follows a well 
established and documented process, which is performed in parallel with the formal process undertaken by the External Auditor.
The Committee received a summary of the approach taken by management in the preparation of the 2017 Annual Report 
and Accounts to ensure that it met the requirements of the Code. This, and our own scrutiny of the document, enabled the 
Committee, and then the Board, to confirm that the 2017 Annual Report and Accounts taken as a whole, was fair, balanced 
and understandable and provided the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s position and performance, 
business model and strategy. Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 / Governance

AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT CONTINUED
Internal Controls and Risk Management Systems
The Committee is responsible, on behalf of the Board, for reviewing the effectiveness of the Group’s internal controls and risk 
management systems, including financial, operational and compliance controls.
In order to keep the Committee abreast of latest developments, the Head of Internal Audit reported to each meeting on 
developments and emerging risks to internal control systems and on the evolution of major risks. In addition, the Committee 
reviewed reports issued by both Internal Audit and the External Auditor and held regular discussions with the Group Finance 
Director, the Head of Internal Audit and representatives of the External Auditor. During the course of these reviews, the Committee 
has not identified nor been advised of any failings or weaknesses which it has determined to be significant.
Internal Audit
The Committee is responsible for monitoring and reviewing the operation and effectiveness of the Internal Audit function including 
its focus, work plan, activities and resources.
At the beginning of the financial year, the Committee reviewed and approved the Internal Audit plan for the year having considered 
the principal areas of risk in the business and the adequacy of staffing levels and expertise within the function. During the year, 
the Committee received regular verbal and written reports from the Head of Internal Audit summarising findings from the work of 
Internal Audit and the responses from management to deal with the findings. Amongst other topics, these included further reports 
on the operations in India, where the control environment continues to mature well.
The Committee monitors progress on the implementation of any action plans arising on significant findings to ensure these are 
completed satisfactorily and meets with the Head of Internal Audit in the absence of management.
External Audit
It is the responsibility of the Committee to monitor the performance, objectivity and independence of KPMG, the External Auditor. 
In February 2017, we met with KPMG to agree the audit plan for the year end, highlighting the key financial statement and audit 
risks, to ensure that the audit was appropriately focused. In addition, KPMG’s letter of engagement and independence was 
reviewed by the Committee in advance of the audit.
In May 2017, in advance of the finalisation of the financial statements, we received a report from KPMG on their key audit findings, 
which included the key areas of risk and significant judgements referred to above, and discussed the issues with them in order 
for the Committee to form a judgement on the financial statements. In addition, we considered the Letter of Representation that 
the External Auditor requires from the Board.
We meet with the External Auditor privately at least twice a year to discuss any matters they may wish to raise without management 
being present.
Assessment of Effectiveness of External Audit
The Committee obtained feedback on the effectiveness and efficiency of the audit process from key management personnel 
through a short questionnaire. The results were positive, confirming such areas as effective planning, appropriate focus on risk, 
continuity, commitment and integrity. The Committee then reviewed the audit process with KPMG and noted the beneficial effect 
of open discussion of potential issues early in the process.
The Committee concluded that the external audit process was operating effectively and KPMG continued to prove effective in its 
role as External Auditor.
Audit Tender
The current External Auditor was first appointed for the year ended 1 April 2005 and the external audit had not been tendered since 
then. We reported last year that following a tender process we intended that, following the completion of the audit of the financial 
statements for the year ended 25 March 2016, KPMG would be re-appointed as the Company’s External Auditor subject to approval 
by shareholders at the AGM on 6 July 2016, and that PwC would be appointed as the Company’s External Auditor, subject to 
approval by shareholders, at the AGM in July 2017. This was intended to enable a smooth transition to new auditors, during a year 
in which we are engaged in the process of integrating Budgens and Londis, particularly into the Company’s accounting systems.
On 27 January 2017 it was announced that we were intending to merge with Tesco to create the UK’s leading food business. As a 
consequence, the Committee recommended to the Board, and the Board concluded, that the Company’s best interests would be 
served by maintaining the status quo and ensuring stability until completion of the merger. Accordingly, we agreed to retain KPMG 
as statutory auditor until completion of the merger with Tesco. Should the merger not complete, the Company would then look to 
re-tender the external audit engagement. 
Accordingly, a resolution proposing the re-appointment of KPMG as the Company’s External Auditor will be put to shareholders 
at the AGM on 5 July 2017. 
There are no contractual obligations restricting the Company’s choice of External Auditor. The Committee will continue to review the 
auditor appointment and the need to tender the audit, ensuring the Group’s compliance with the Code and any related regulations. Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 / Governance

Non-Audit Services
The Committee recognises the potential for any non-audit services to compromise auditor independence. Hence as reported last 
year, the Committee reviewed its policy on non-audit services provided by the External Auditor to ensure that the External Auditor 
remains free from any actual or perceived conflict of interest, in accordance with professional and regulatory requirements. The 
principal requirements of the policy are that the External Auditor may not undertake prohibited services, which include:
• book keeping;
• the design and implementation of financial information systems or financial controls;
• outsourced internal audit services that relate to internal accounting controls, financial systems of financial statements;
• secondments to the Group where the audit firm secondee acts as an employee of the Group or performs any decision making, 
supervisory or ongoing monitoring function;
• remuneration related services;
• actuarial services;
• management functions; 
• tax services that depend for their effectiveness on a particular accounting treatment; and 
• legal services unrelated to the audit.
The Committee must approve any individual non-audit services above £25,000.
Discretion is used, subject to the controls set out above, in obtaining non-audit services from the External Auditor, although other 
accountancy firms are also used when appropriate. In accordance with the policy, a cumulative summary of non-audit fees paid 
to the External Auditor and third party providers is presented to the Committee on a scheduled basis. 
In view of their knowledge of the Group’s ways of working and the importance of efficient integration of the combined businesses, KPMG 
were asked to provide due diligence services in respect of the merger with Tesco. The aggregate fee for this amounted to £275,000.
Other non-audit work comprised the interim review, for which fees of £44,000 were charged, and other small assignments to 
assist with tax compliance, advice received in relation to India and other matters for aggregate fees of £133,080. The Committee 
believes that there are sound commercial and practical reasons for this work being conducted by the External Auditor and that it 
is not of a nature which would affect its independence as External Auditor. 
The Committee has taken note of the EU Audit Reforms which came into full force from June 2016 and only apply to financial years 
beginning on or after 17 June 2016. Accordingly the Committee is undertaking a review of its terms of reference and its policy on 
non-audit services applicable to the financial year ending 30 March 2018 to ensure that they are compliant.
Compliance with Competition and Markets Authority Order 2014
The Group complies with the Competition and Markets Authority Order 2014 relating to audit tendering and the provision of non-
audit services, as discussed further above.
Whistleblowing Programme
The Group has a whistleblowing programme in all of its operations whereby employees can, in confidence, report on matters 
where they feel a malpractice has taken or is taking place, or if health and safety standards have been or are being compromised. 
Additional areas that are addressed by this procedure include criminal activities, improper or unethical behaviour and risks to  
the environment.
The programme allows employees to raise their concerns with their line manager or, if that is inappropriate, to raise them on a 
confidential basis. An externally facilitated confidential helpline and confidential email facility are provided to protect the identity of 
employees in these circumstances. Any concerns are investigated on a confidential basis by the Human Resources Department 
and/or the Company Secretary and feedback is given to the person making the complaint as appropriate via the confidential email 
facility. An official written record is kept of each stage of the procedure and results are summarised for the Committee. 
Committee Effectiveness
The effectiveness of the Committee is reviewed on an annual basis by both the Board and the Committee itself and results are 
summarised for the Committee. The Audit Committee is charged to ensure that arrangements are in place for the proportionate 
independent investigation and appropriate follow up.
This report was approved by the Board of Directors on 17 May 2017.

NOMINATION COMMITTEE REPORT
I am pleased to present the Report of the Nomination Committee for 2017. This Report provides shareholders with an overview 
of the activities carried out by the Committee during the year.
On 6 July 2016, I succeeded Lord Bilimoria as Chairman of this Committee. 
On 27 January 2017, it was announced that we were intending to merge with Tesco. Prior to this announcement, the Committee 
had conducted a search with the assistance of The Zygos Partnership, for a candidate to replace Lord Bilimoria who was due to 
retire in 2016 having completed nine years of service. This search had resulted in the identification of a candidate, however both 
the Committee and the Board were firmly of the view that any change to the composition of the Board whilst merger discussions 
with Tesco were ongoing was inappropriate. Moreover, the Board considered that the Company would benefit from a stable 
Board following the announcement of the merger and were therefore delighted when Andrew Cripps, rather than retiring, agreed 
to continue as a Non-Executive Director and member of the Audit and Remuneration Committees.
Looking forward, the Committee will continue to review long term succession plans for the Board, with the aim of ensuring that 
an appropriate balance of skills, experience and diversity is maintained, mindful of any change in circumstances.
I will be available to shareholders at the forthcoming AGM to answer any questions relating to the role of the Committee. 
On behalf of the Board.

Notes:
1. Retired from the Board and as Chairman of the Committee.
All members of the Committee are and were considered by the Board to be independent. 
No member of the Committee nor any other Director participates in discussions concerning or votes on his or her own re-
election or evaluation of his own performance. Details of the skills and experience of the Directors are contained in the Directors’ 
biographies on pages 20 and 21. Their remuneration is set out in the Remuneration Report. 
The quorum necessary for the transaction of business is two, each of whom must be a Non-Executive Director. Only members 
of the Committee have the right to attend Committee meetings, however, during the year, Charles Wilson (Chief Executive) was 
invited to attend meetings. 
The Company Secretary is Secretary to the Committee.
Meeting Frequency and Main Activities in the Year
The Committee met on four scheduled occasions during the year ended 24 March 2017. All members of the Committee attended 
every scheduled meeting.
Since 24 March 2017, the Nomination Committee met on one occasion to review the Committee’s report within the 2017 Annual 
Report and Accounts and recommended its approval to the Board.
During the year ended 24 March 2017 the Committee:
• reviewed the size, structure and composition of the Board;
• continued the search for a new Non-Executive Director with appropriate skills and experience to replace Lord Bilimoria. Lord 
Bilimoria did not participate in the discussions or work of the Committee in relation to this topic;
• revisited the planned changes to the Non-Executive Director membership of the Board in light of the proposed merger with 
Tesco;
• recommended to the Board that all of the Directors who have indicated their willingness to stand for re-election be proposed 
for re-election as Directors at the forthcoming AGM; and
• reviewed the Committee’s report within the 2016 Annual Report and Accounts and recommended its approval to the 
Board. 
Board Composition/Succession Planning
The Board plans for its own succession with the support of the Committee. The Committee remains focused on behalf of the 
Board, on Board succession planning for both Executive and Non-Executive Directors. 
The Committee aims to ensure that:
• the succession pipeline for senior executive and business critical roles in the organisation is adequate;
• processes are in place to identify potential successors and manage succession actively;
• there is a structured approach to developing and preparing possible successors; and
• processes are in place to identify ‘at risk’ posts.  Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 / Governance

NOMINATION COMMITTEE REPORT CONTINUED
Board Composition/Succession Planning continued
On at least an annual basis each Director’s intentions are discussed with regard to continued service on the Board and their 
succession is considered in the context of the shape of the overall Board and the corporate governance guidance on Non-
Executive tenure. This transparency allows for an open discussion about succession for each individual, both for short-term 
emergency purposes as well as longer term plans.
As in previous years, we conducted an analysis of the balance of skills on the Board as a whole, taking account of the future 
needs of the business in the light of the business strategy, the Board changes set out above, and the knowledge, experience, 
length of service and performance of the Directors. In accordance with our policy, we also had regard to the requirement to 
achieve a diversity of characters, backgrounds and experience amongst Board members. 
Summary of Board Changes
• Gary Hughes succeeded Andrew Cripps as Chairman of the Audit Committee from 1 December 2016.
• Stewart Gilliand succeeded Lord Bilimoria as Chairman of the Nomination Committee from 6 July 2016.
Non-Executive Director Search
To assist it in the search for a new Non-Executive Director to succeed Lord Bilimoria the Committee again engaged The Zygos 
Partnership. The Zygos Partnership was provided with a detailed brief of the desired candidate profile based on merit and 
against objective criteria (including an assessment of the time commitment expected) and their services were used to conduct a 
thorough search to identify suitable candidates. The Committee considered a list of potential candidates with the skills, knowledge, 
independence and diversity in its widest sense (gender, nationality, age, experience, ethnicity and background) which would benefit 
the Company. The search had resulted in the identification of a female candidate, however due to the pending merger with 
Tesco we are not progressing with the appointment. Should the position change then the Board and the Committee would take 
appropriate steps to review the composition of the Board.
The Board confirms that The Zygos Partnership is not connected with the Company in any other way.
The Company did not use open advertising to search for suitable candidates for the role of Non-Executive Director, as we believe that 
the optimal way of recruiting for these positions is generally to use targeted recruitment based on the skills and experience required.
Skills Balance and Directors’ Performance Evaluation
During the year, the Committee also considered the membership of the Board and each of its Committees. The Committee 
continues to actively review the long term succession planning process for Directors to ensure the structure, size and composition 
of the Board and its Committees continue to be effective, thus ensuring appropriate levels of corporate governance and best 
practice and support for the Company as it pursues its strategy. 
As part of its review, the Committee considered the performance and independence of Stewart Gilliland, Helena Andreas, 
Andrew Cripps, Gary Hughes and Karen Jones, each of them having confirmed their willingness to stand for re-election at the 
forthcoming AGM. 
As announced on 30 March 2017, in light of the proposed merger with Tesco, the Committee considered the composition of the 
Board and its Committees and determined that the Company would benefit from stability, as well as retaining the knowledge 
and experience Andrew Cripps has gained of the Company. Accordingly, Andrew Cripps, rather than retiring from the Board and 
leaving the Company as had previously been proposed, has agreed to continue as a non-executive director and to offer himself 
for re-election at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
Having undertaken a performance evaluation, the Committee considered that the performance of each of the Non-Executive Directors 
proposed for re-election, being Stewart Gilliland, Helena Andreas, Gary Hughes, Karen Jones and Andrew Cripps, was effective and 
that they have each demonstrated a strong commitment to their role. The Committee has also undertaken a review of each of the 
Non-Executive Directors’ other interests and external time commitments, such review being particularly rigorous in accordance with 
the Code in the case of Karen Jones as she has served in excess of seven years on the Board and in the case of Andrew Cripps as 
he has served in excess of nine years on the Board, and has concluded that each of them is independent in character and judgement 
and that there are no relationships or circumstances likely to affect (or which appear to affect) his or her judgement.
In considering whether Andrew Cripps continued to be independent as he will have served on the Board for more than nine 
years, the Committee considered the time dedicated to his various roles as non-executive director, including Deputy Chairman of 
Swedish Match AB, Chairman of the Audit Committee of Howden Joinery Group plc and of Boparan Holdings Limited, where he 
is also Senior Independent Director and his contribution to the Board in discussions generally. The Committee was satisfied that 
he continued to remain independent, having regard to the Code’s independence criteria.
The Committee were satisfied that each of the Directors proposed for re-election had the appropriate balance of skills, experience, 
independence and knowledge of the Company to enable him or her to discharge the duties and responsibilities of a director 
effectively. Accordingly, the Committee recommended to the Board that they each be proposed for re-election as a Director at 
the forthcoming AGM. Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 / Governance

Diversity
We value diversity in the Boardroom and see it as a wider topic than simply gender. Our Directors come from different backgrounds, 
a wide range of professions and each brings unique capabilities and perspectives to our discussions. We are committed to 
maintaining a diverse Board. Appointments to the Board and throughout the Group will continue to be made on merit and overall 
suitability for the role against objective criteria with due regard to the benefits of diversity (including, but not limited to, ethnicity, 
experience and gender). 
We do not consider quotas appropriate as a target for ethnic minority or female representation on company boards, since they 
are likely to lead to compromised decisions on Board membership, quality and size. Whilst the Committee has not determined to 
set targets for the number of ethnic minorities or women on the Board, the Committee is mindful of the Women on Boards Davies 
Review, “Improving the Gender Balance on British Boards”, published in October 2015. The priority is and will remain, however, to 
continue to make appointments to the Board on merit and to recruit Directors who offer the right skills and complement the rest 
of the Board with a view to achieve effective diversity, in its widest sense. When recruiting, we require any search agency to have 
signed up to the ‘Voluntary Code of Conduct for Executive Search Firms’ setting out the seven key principles of best practice to 
abide by throughout the recruitment process.
An analysis of Directors by gender as at 24 March 2017 is as follows:
Male  
Number
Female  
Number
Director 6 2
As outlined on page 32 the search for a new Non-Executive Director resulted in the identification of a female candidate. Due to 
the potential merger with Tesco we are not progressing with the appointment. 
Statistical gender diversity employment data for the Group can be found in the Corporate Social Responsibility Report on page 
10.
Committee Performance and Effectiveness
The Board additionally undertook an annual review of the Committee’s performance and effectiveness and concluded that the 
Committee operated effectively.
This report was approved by the Board of Directors on 17 May 2017.

PAGE TITLE REMUNERATION REPORT
I am pleased to present the Report of the Remuneration Committee for 2017, which sets out the remuneration paid to the 
Directors in the year ended 24 March 2017.
The Committee has reviewed the existing Remuneration Policy, as it has now been in place for three years, and incentive 
framework in the context of the announcement that we are intending to merge with Tesco. In undertaking the review, we consulted 
with our major shareholders. As a consequence, the Committee and the Board has concluded that the Company’s best interests 
would be served by maintaining the status quo in order to support stability within the business until completion of the merger. The 
Committee will continue to ensure that, as now, remuneration is weighted towards variable pay and dependent on performance 
thus ensuring a clear link between the value created for shareholders and the amount paid to our Executive Directors.
Accordingly, we have decided to retain and seek approval from shareholders for the existing Remuneration Policy which has 
served the Company and shareholders so well to date, save for an increase in the PSP award opportunity from 150% to 200% 
of base salary. This accords with grants made to our two Executive Directors, excluding Charles Wilson, in the 2 previous years.
The Committee’s approach to remuneration remains that it should be kept as simple and transparent as possible. The 
Remuneration Policy of the Company has been broadly the same since 2008 and is intended to ensure: 
• Incentives for Executive Directors and executives are closely linked to performance, thus aligning the interests of Executive 
Directors, executives and shareholders; 
• Executive Directors’ rewards are correlated with those received by other employees of the business; and
• Executive Directors are not rewarded for failure.
The Committee is of the view that we have a structure of reasonable base pay, bonuses and long term incentives which are 
aligned to growing long term shareholder value. We are satisfied that the outcomes to date have reflected business performance 
and that the targets set are stretching in the context of the market in which we operate and, if delivered, will have added significant 
value for shareholders. 
Moreover, we believe that the remuneration policy and incentive framework in place which covers Executive Directors, executives, 
branch managers and sales teams, comprising approximately 1,700 colleagues in respect of the EBIT bonus scheme and 
over 1,100 colleagues in respect of the PSP scheme (in both cases excluding Charles Wilson) are working well to support the 
Company’s strategy and are helping to retain, recruit and motivate our management team.
In the context of our future performance goals the Committee reviewed and decided to maintain the stretching targets attached to 
PSP awards granted in 2016, which require the executive team to deliver over three years, compound annual growth in earnings 
per share of +12% and compound annual growth in total shareholder return of +15% in order to secure the maximum PSP vesting.  
Should the merger not complete, we would then look to review the existing Remuneration Policy and incentive framework. As 
the Performance Share Plan expires in 2018 the Committee will now defer reviewing the plan until that date, as part of the overall 
review of remuneration.
We look forward to hearing your views in the future and hope to receive your continued support at this year’s AGM.
On behalf of the Board.

• on the remuneration packages for the Executive Directors and executives including remuneration, annual bonus, share 
incentives and other benefits; and
• on the terms of service contracts with Executive Directors and executives and any compensation arrangements resulting from 
the termination of an Executive Director or executive’s service contract; and 
• concerning the grant and vesting of awards under the PSP.

REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED
Meeting Frequency and Main Activities in the Year continued
Since 24 March 2017, the Remuneration Committee met on two occasions to:
• Approve the 2017 bonus;
• Approve the Remuneration Report for the financial year ended 24 March 2017;
• Approve the Remuneration Policy for the 3 years from the 2017 AGM;
• Approve the 2017/18 Pay Award Strategy; and
• Approve the 2017/18 bonus scheme. 
Key Remuneration Principles
The principles supporting the Executive Directors’ reward packages are reviewed each year to ensure that they continue to 
underpin the Group’s strategy. 
The Committee’s overall policy is to provide competitive and potentially rewarding remuneration packages. The Company 
wishes to attract, retain and motivate Executive Directors and executives of the requisite quality. Accordingly, the Committee’s 
policy, in a competitive market, is to design remuneration packages which reward Executive Directors and executives fairly for 
their contribution. The Committee will take into account the pay and employment conditions of other Group employees when 
determining Executive Directors’ remuneration, particularly when determining base salary increases. 
Directors’ Remuneration Policy
The policy for Executive Directors remuneration, set out below, will if approved by shareholders apply from the date of the 2017 
AGM, and is available to view in the Annual Report & Accounts 2017 under the Investor Centre/Reports and Presentations section 
of the Group’s website. A copy may be obtained from the Company Secretary.
The Committee considers the remuneration policy annually to ensure that it continues to underpin the Group’s strategy. The policy 
set out below applies for three years from the 2017 AGM, however, in the event that the merger with Tesco does not complete, 
the Committee will undertake a further review of the remuneration policy.

When external benchmarking 
is used, the comparator groups 
are chosen having regard to:
•  Size – market capitalisation, 
turnover, profits and the 
number of employees; and
•  Diversity and complexity of 
the business.
Over the policy period, salaries 
for current Executive Directors will 
broadly increase in line with the 
range of increases applying to the 
employee population, other than 
where there is a change in role 
or responsibility, where there are 
major changes within the Group or 
where a significant variance to the 
market arises that warrants a more 
significant increase, or where the 
Committee judges that there is a risk 
in relation to attracting or retaining 
Executive Directors. Any such 
changes, should they occur, will be 
fully explained to shareholders in the 
next Remuneration Report.
Newly promoted or recruited 
Executive Directors may on occasion 
have their salaries set below the 
benchmark policy level while they 
become established in the role. 
In such cases, salary increases 
may be higher than the employee 
population until the target positioning 
is achieved.

Notes to Future Policy Table
Bonus 
The earnings before interest and tax (‘EBIT’) bonus scheme, which is consistent with the prior year’s bonus scheme, covers 
Executive Directors, executives, branch managers and sales teams, comprising approximately 1,700 colleagues of the Group. 
The aggregate bonus pool is determined each year by the level of improvement in Group EBIT year on year and no bonus 
is paid unless there is an improvement. The maximum bonus achievable for an Executive Director is 100% of basic salary. 
Charles Wilson, Chief Executive, does not participate in this bonus scheme. The Committee views this as appropriate given 
the alignment with shareholder interests which arise from his significant shareholding in the Company. Payments to Executive 
Directors are based upon a percentage of basic salary and do not form part of pensionable earnings. The proportion of the 
bonus pool accruing to Executive Directors is less than 15%. 
PSP 
The PSP scheme allows Executive Directors and approximately 1,100 employees to receive share awards, subject to the 
achievement of performance targets set by the Committee, measured over a three year period. Awards are made annually and, 
other than in exceptional circumstances, will not be more than 200% of annual salary for Executive Directors.
For the 2016/19 PSP cycle, the Committee resolved to grant maximum awards at 200% of base salary for the Executive 
Directors (excluding Charles Wilson). The Committee was keen to ensure that remuneration was weighted towards variable 
pay, dependent on performance, thus ensuring a clear link between the value created for shareholders and the amount paid 
to our Executive Directors. As a result, we reviewed the size of awards and decided to increase the award potentially payable 
to Executive Directors (excluding Charles Wilson) to 200% of salary. Vesting for points between Threshold and Maximum is 
calculated on a straight line basis, as follows:
• 50% of each award will be linked to an Absolute TSR performance target with 25% of this element vesting at 8% growth per 
annum and rising on a straight line basis with full vesting for 15% growth per annum, when measured over the 3 years from 
the award date.
• 50% of each award will be linked to an Absolute EPS performance target with 25% of this element vesting for achieving 
Absolute EPS growth of 6% per annum and rising on a straight line basis with full vesting requiring 12% growth per annum, as 
measured between March 2016 and March 2019.
In setting the TSR performance target, the Committee has taken into account the TSR returns achieved by companies in the 
FTSE350 commencing with the three year period to May 2002 and then walking forward on a weekly basis with the last data 
point being the returns of each company through to July 2012.
There is no re-testing of performance targets under the PSP, and awards lapse if they are not met.
The Committee will review the performance measures for the 2017/20 cycle for the Executive Directors (excluding Charles 
Wilson), in the context of our future performance goals. Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 / Governance

REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED
Fixed and Variable Pay Mix
Individual reward elements for all Executive Directors (excluding Charles Wilson, Chief Executive, who does not participate in 
any incentive schemes) are designed to provide a balance between fixed remuneration and variable ‘at risk’ reward, linked to 
the performance of the Company. Charles Wilson, Chief Executive, has chosen from the outset not to participate in the bonus 
scheme and does not participate in the PSP. The Committee views this as appropriate given the alignment with shareholder 
interests which arises from his significant shareholding in the Company. 
Illustrative scenarios
Below is an illustration of the value that could be received by each Executive Director under the Directors’ Remuneration Policy 
in respect of 2017/18, showing:
• minimum, which comprises base salary, benefits and employer pension contributions only (equivalent to 15% of base salary) 
(total fixed pay);
• on-target, which includes total fixed pay and assumes an on-target award for the Bonus (50% of salary) and 50% of maximum 
PSP vesting; and
• maximum, which includes total fixed pay and a maximum award under the Bonus (100% of salary) and 100% of maximum 
PSP vesting. 
The salaries included are those that will apply from 1 April 2017. The benefit values included are based on the amounts 
included in the table showing the single total figure for each Executive Director. The amounts shown in relation to Bonus and 
PSP do not take account of any share price appreciation or depreciation.
Use of Discretion by Remuneration Committee
Malus in Incentive Plans
The Committee has the discretion under both the Bonus scheme and the PSP to claw back bonus and unvested share awards 
in the following circumstances:
• misconduct that causes significant damage or potential damage to the Company’s prospects, finances or brand reputation; 
and/or
• actions that lead to material misstatement or restatement of accounts.
This feature helps ensure alignment between executive rewards and shareholder returns.

Other Uses of Discretion
The Committee will operate the Company’s incentive plans according to their respective rules, the policy set out in the table above 
and in accordance with the Listing Rules and HMRC rules where relevant.
The Committee retains discretion over a number of areas relating to the operation and administration of the incentive plans. These 
include, but are not limited to, determining who participates in the incentive plans, the time and size of awards, measurement of 
performance in the event of a change of control or reconstruction and the adjustments required in certain circumstances (e.g. 
rights issues, corporate restructuring, on a change of control and special dividends). The discretions that can be applied in the 
case of leavers under the Bonus and PSP are set out in the section on ‘Policy on Payment for Loss of Office’ below.
Any exercises of discretion by the Committee will be fully disclosed and explained in the relevant year’s Remuneration Report.
The Committee will also use its judgement as to what is appropriate within the terms of the Directors’ Remuneration Policy,  
to make decisions that do not involve the exercise of discretion.
Approach to Recruitment Remuneration
The remuneration of any new Executive Director will be determined in accordance with the Directors’ Remuneration Policy and 
the elements that would be considered by the Company for inclusion are:
• salary and benefits, including defined contribution pension participation and relocation costs, where appropriate;
• participation in the Bonus: pro-rated for the year of recruitment to reflect the proportion of the year remaining after the date of 
commencement of employment; and
• participation in the PSP: awards would be granted on the same terms and subject to the same performance conditions as 
those which apply to PSP awards granted to existing Executive Directors in the year of recruitment.
The maximum annual level of variable remuneration that may be granted to a newly recruited Executive Director (excluding any 
awards to compensate for incentives forgone on recruitment) would be in line with that of the existing Executive Directors:
• Bonus award: maximum 100% of salary; and
• PSP award: maximum 400% of salary for a full PSP cycle commencing after appointment, plus pro-rated awards in relation to 
PSP cycles outstanding at the time of recruitment (up to a further 200% of salary).
In addition, the Committee may, in its discretion, compensate a newly recruited Executive Director for incentives forgone from a 
previous employment as a result of their resignation. The Committee would seek validation of the value of any potential incentives 
forgone.
Awards made by way of compensation for incentives forgone would be made on a comparable basis, taking account of 
performance achieved (or likely to be achieved), the proportion of the performance period remaining and the form of the award. 
Compensation would, as far as possible, be in the form of awards under the PSP in order to immediately align a new Executive 
Director with Company performance.
Policy on Payment for Loss of Office
Contractual Notice Period and Pay in Lieu
All current Executive Directors have a rolling service contract with a notice period from the Company of 12 months. As an 
alternative, the Company may, at its discretion, pay in lieu of that notice. Neither notice nor a payment in lieu of notice will be given 
in the event of gross misconduct.
Payment in lieu of notice could potentially include up to 12 months’ salary and the cash equivalent of 12 months’ pension 
contributions, and other contractual benefits. Where possible, the Company will seek to ensure that where a leaver mitigates 
their losses by, for example, finding new employment, there will be a corresponding reduction in compensation payable for loss 
of office. The Company’s approach to the termination of contracts of service of Executive Directors is dictated by the relevant 
events, bearing in mind the circumstances of termination and the interests of the Company. A bonus element is not normally 
included in the termination payment, however, if the Company enforces the non-compete clause, up to 12 months on target 
bonus will be payable.
An Executive Director may have an entitlement to compensation in respect of their statutory rights under relevant employment 
legislation in the UK.
Under Charles Wilson’s contract, in the event of a change of control of the Company, Charles Wilson has the right to terminate 
his employment on 30 days’ notice and to receive a payment equal to his gross salary for his contractual notice period. In the 
event of the merger with Tesco and change of control of the Company, Charles Wilson has agreed to waive his right to terminate 
his employment. Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 / Governance

REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED
Policy on Payment for Loss of Office continued
Termination by Mutual Agreement
In certain circumstances it can be in the best interests of the Company for the Board to proactively manage succession planning 
and the development of the senior talent pipeline. In such circumstances, the Board may agree that an executive’s departure will 
be by mutual agreement. In order for this to apply, the Committee will need to be satisfied that the executive has demonstrated 
performance in line with expectations and where required they should have contributed to an orderly succession. The Company’s 
experience is that this approach is successful and has previously enabled the Company to recruit a former Executive Director to 
lead Makro on an interim basis immediately after its acquisition.
An Executive Director terminated by mutual agreement will be treated as a ‘good leaver’ for the purposes of the Bonus and PSP 
plans. If the termination date falls during the financial year, they will be eligible to be paid a pro-rated on target bonus and if they 
are employed at the end of the financial year, the bonus payable would be based on actual results.
Other than as set out above, the Committee does not anticipate using the discretion provided by the Bonus and PSP plan rules 
in respect of termination payments. There may, however, be unforeseen circumstances where this is in the best interests of the 
Company and its shareholders. Where such discretion is exercised, explanations will be provided in the next Remuneration 
Report and will comply with the Company’s overall remuneration policy aim that Directors should not be rewarded for failure.

The Committee has the discretion to determine that an individual should be treated as a Good Leaver for the purposes of the 
PSP. In exercising such discretion the Committee will consider factors such as personal performance and conduct, overall Group 
performance and the specific circumstances of the Executive Director’s departure including, but not restricted to, whether the 
Executive Director is leaving by mutual agreement with the Company. If an individual is not a Good Leaver then they will be treated 
as an Other Leaver, as set out above.
Committee Interaction with Stakeholders
The Committee engages with shareholders on remuneration matters. Discussions are held with a number of shareholders and 
with shareholder representative organisations over the year.
Legacy Arrangements
The Committee reserves the right to honour any remuneration payments and payments for loss of office not in line with the policy 
set out above where the terms of those payments were (i) entered into with current or former directors before this policy came 
into effect or (ii) at a time when the relevant executive was not a Director of the Company and, in the opinion of the Committee, 
the payment was not in consideration for the individual becoming a Director of the Company. 
For these purposes ‘payments’ includes payments of variable remuneration under the Bonus scheme and the PSP in line with the 
terms of the payment agreed at the time the award was granted.
The Committee may make minor changes to this policy, which do not have a material advantage to Directors, to aid its operation 
or implementation taking into account the interests of shareholders but without the need to seek shareholder approval.
Consideration of Employment Conditions elsewhere in the Group
The Committee takes into consideration the pay and conditions of employees throughout the Group when determining 
remuneration for its Executive Directors. 
Salary increases for Executive Directors will be broadly in line with the general workforce other than when there is a change in role 
or responsibility, or a significant variance to the market arises, warranting a larger increase.
Newly promoted or recruited Executive Directors to the Board may, on occasion, have their salaries set below the benchmark 
policy level while they become established in role. In such cases, salary increases may be higher than the general workforce until 
the target positioning is achieved.
Group employees’ salaries are compared to cross-industry standards to ensure fair pay for that job. The Company does 
not directly consult with employees as part of the process of determining Directors’ remuneration. While formal comparison 
measurements were not used in determining Executive Director remuneration, the Committee made decisions in the knowledge 
of incentive arrangements of the rest of the Group, upon which the Committee is briefed regularly.
Remuneration Policy for Other Employees
The Company’s policy on the remuneration of Executive Directors is consistent with that of other senior employees. This group of 
approximately 1,700 people also participates in and receives payments under the EBIT Bonus scheme. Eligibility to participate in 
the PSP extends to a similar set of around 1,100 employees in total.
Outside the senior employees’ group, the composition of remuneration differs. Over 8,800 employees, being approximately 65% 
of the Group’s total employees, may be eligible for a bonus payment based on ‘customer satisfaction’. Customer satisfaction 
is measured independently by calling 10,000 customers selected at random covering retailers, caterers, delivered and collect 
across our 199 branches each quarter to ask them to rate key areas of service. 
Around 1,600 logistics employees are eligible for a quarterly bonus payment based on achieving productivity and efficiency 
targets at the site at which they are employed. 
In addition from time to time certain incentive arrangements may be introduced for executives and colleagues in order to achieve 
particular objectives.
Eligibility for, and participation in, benefits and incentive plans differs depending on location, seniority, length of service and  
other factors.
Service Contracts and Notice Periods for Executive Directors
The Committee’s policy is for all Executive Directors to have rolling service contracts with a notice period of 12 months. All new 
appointments will have 12 month notice periods, unless, on an exceptional basis to complete an external recruitment successfully, 
a longer initial notice period reducing to 12 months is used.
This is in accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code.
All Executive Directors’ appointments and subsequent re-appointments are subject to election and annual re-election by 
shareholders at the AGM. Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 / Governance

All Executive Directors will stand for re-election at the 2017 Annual General Meeting.
External Appointments 
Executive Directors are not permitted to hold directorships or offices of companies whose shares are listed on a recognised stock 
exchange and, accordingly, no Executive Director serves as a Non-Executive Director of any such company.
Remuneration Policy for Non-Executive Directors
The policy for Non-Executive Directors will apply for three years from the date of the 2017 AGM, and is available to view in the 
Annual Report & Accounts 2017 under the Investor Centre/Reports and Presentations section of the Group’s website. A copy 
may be obtained from the Company Secretary.
The Non-Executive Directors do not receive bonuses or pension contributions and are not entitled to participate in any of the 
Company’s share schemes.

The Board has determined that the time commitment of Non-Executive Directors should be 12 days per annum, other than the 
Chairman whose time commitment should be 24 days per annum. The time commitment for Non-Executive Directors is set out 
in the relevant Non-Executive Director’s letter of appointment. In practice, the Non-Executive Directors exceed the minimum time 
commitment through their involvement in all aspects of the business.
Non-Executive Directors are entitled to be reimbursed for reasonable expenses incurred by them in carrying out their duties as 
Directors of the Company. 
Details of Letters of Appointment and Notice Periods for Non-Executive Directors
Non-Executive Directors have letters of appointment for an initial period of three years subject to termination on one month’s 
notice. In addition, the UK Corporate Governance Code requires that all Non-Executive Directors stand for re-election annually.
Non-Executive Director appointments are also subject to the Articles of Association of the Company.

Single Total Figure of Remuneration – Executive Directors (audited information) continued
Notes to Single Total Figure of Remuneration – Executive Directors
• Salary – salary received in the year.
• Taxable benefits – all taxable benefits in kind arising from the individual’s employment in 2016/2017.
• Bonus – the bonus relating to the Company’s performance in the year ended 24 March 2017, to be paid in June 2017.
• PSP – based on the share price at the date of actual vesting.
• Pension Benefits – the value of Company contributions to pension plans or any cash allowances paid in lieu of pension 
contributions. All Executive Directors receive a cash allowance and none are members of a defined benefit pension scheme 
operated by the Group.
• No consideration was paid to third parties for making available the services of any person as a Director of the Company during 
the year. 
Salary 
The Committee approved salary increases of 1.8% in line with the wider workforce for each of the current Executive Directors 
(excluding Charles Wilson). 
Bonus 
The level of pre-bonus earnings before interest and tax (‘EBIT’) achieved in 2017 gave rise to the following awards to the Executive 
Directors:
Director EBIT award as % of salary
Jonathan Prentis 48.58%
Guy Farrant 48.58%
The EBIT bonus scheme covers approximately 1,700 colleagues, including the Executive Directors (other than Charles Wilson). 
The scheme has been in operation since 2007 (albeit that up to 2012 it was based on increases in earnings before interest, tax, 
depreciation and amortisation) and is targeted on increasing the Group EBIT year on year. The Group EBIT increase before 
exceptional items of £21.0m to £176.1m resulted in a bonus being awarded to Executive Directors of 48.58% of salary. The 
maximum bonus payable under the scheme to Executive Directors was 100% of salary, had the Group EBIT exceeded £208m, 
an uplift on prior year of £53.3m. If EBIT had not increased year on year no bonus would have been paid. Bonus is paid on basic 
salary as at 31 March each year. The proportion of the total scheme bonus pool accruing to Executive Directors was less than 
15%, in accordance with the Company’s Directors’ Remuneration Policy.
Bonus payments awarded to each Executive Director, other than Charles Wilson who received no bonus, as a proportion of salary 
in the three previous financial years:
Financial Year Bonus Payment
2016 48.25%
2015 51.98%
2014 61.20%
Share Incentives (audited information)

Participation
As well as the Executive Directors, approximately 1,100 employees have been granted PSP options. In addition 2,959 employees 
participate in the 2016 SAYE scheme, 2,847 employees participate in the 2015 SAYE scheme and 2,319 participate in the 2014 
SAYE scheme. The Executive Directors have chosen not to participate in any of the current SAYE schemes. 
The high number of employees participating in these schemes is consistent with the Group’s policy of ensuring that the 
remuneration of the Executive Directors is aligned with that of the overall workforce and with the interests of shareholders. 
Statement of Directors’ Shareholdings (audited information)
Alignment to shareholder interests is a key element of the Group’s remuneration policy which maintains commitment over the 
long term and ensures that the interests of the Executive Directors are aligned with those of shareholders. The Committee sets 
shareholding guidelines for Executive Directors. The current guideline is to build and maintain, over time, a personal (and/or 
spousal) holding of shares in the Company equivalent in value to at least the Executive Director’s annual base salary. All of the 
Executive Directors currently meet these guidelines. Details of the share interests of all Executive Directors are shown below.

Relative Performance Graph
The Company’s performance from 27 March 2009 to 24 March 2017 measured by Total Shareholder Return (‘TSR’), is compared 
in the chart below with the performance of the FTSE 250 Index (excluding investment trusts). This is considered the most 
appropriate index against which to measure performance following the Company’s inclusion in the FTSE 250 Index in December 
2009. 
TSR is defined as the return a shareholder would receive if they held a notional number of shares and received dividends over 
a period of time. Assuming dividends are reinvested into the Company’s shares, it measures the percentage growth in the 
Company’s share price together with any dividends paid. 
The closing mid market price of an Ordinary Share on 24 March 2017 was 201.0p and the price range during the year was 158.9p 
to 212.3p.

as a director of the Company terminated on that date. He assisted the Company with an orderly transition and handover of 
responsibilities, and continued to receive his base salary and contractual benefits in full, until 1 April 2016. Bryn Satherley’s

Bryn Satherley did not receive a payment for loss of office. He was eligible to receive a bonus in respect of the year ending 25 
March 2016, calculated by reference to the performance targets that applied to the 2015/16 bonus plan. This bonus was paid in 
the normal way in July 2016. Bryn Satherley was not entitled to any bonus payment in respect of the 2016/17 financial year. As he 
retired, Bryn Satherley retained awards granted to him under the Booker Group Performance Share Plan 2008. These awards will 
vest on the normal vesting date, to the extent the performance conditions are met, and will be pro-rated to reflect the proportion 
of the vesting period which has elapsed on the date his employment terminated. 
The arrangements made in respect of the termination of Bryn Satherley’s employment are in line with the Remuneration Policy 
approved by shareholders at the 2014 AGM. 
No other payments for loss of office were made in 2017.

The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the Group and parent company financial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare group and parent company financial statements for each financial year. Under that 
law they are required to prepare the Group financial statements in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and applicable 
law and have elected to prepare the parent company financial statements in accordance with UK Accounting Standards, including 
FRS101 ‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’. 
Under company law the Directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and 
fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and parent company and of their profit or loss for that period. In preparing each of the 
Group and parent company financial statements, the Directors are required to: 
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
• for the Group financial statements, state whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU;
• for the parent company financial statements, state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject 
to any material departures disclosed and explained in the parent company financial statements; and
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the 
parent company will continue in business. 
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the parent 
company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the parent company and 
enable them to ensure that its financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They have general responsibility for 
taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group and to prevent and detect fraud and 
other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, the Directors are responsible for preparing a Strategic Report, Directors’ Report, 
Remuneration Report and Corporate Governance Report that comply with that law and those regulations. 
The Directors are also responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the 
company’s website. Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions.
Responsibility statement of the Directors in respect of the Annual Report and Accounts
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
• the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the applicable set of accounting standards, give a true and fair view of 
the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation 
taken as a whole; and
• the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report include a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the 
position of the issuer and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description of the 
principal risks and uncertainties that they face.
We consider the Annual Report and accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s position and performance, business model and strategy.

Opinions and conclusions  
arising from our audit
1.  Our opinion on the financial statements  
is unmodified
  We have audited the financial statements of Booker Group 
plc for the period ended 24 March 2017 set out on pages 
58 to 92. In our opinion:
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the 
state of the group’s and of the parent company’s affairs 
as at 24 March 2017 and of the group’s profit for the 
period then ended;
• the group financial statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards as adopted by the European 
Union;
• the parent company financial statements have been 
properly prepared in accordance with UK Accounting 
Standards, including FRS 101 Reduced Disclosure 
Framework; and
• the financial statements have been prepared in 
accordance with the requirements of the Companies 
Act 2006; and, as regards the group financial 
statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.

2. Our assessment of risks of material misstatement
In arriving at our audit opinion above on the financial statements, the risks of material misstatement that had the greatest effect 
on our audit, in decreasing order of audit significance, were as follows:
The risk Our response
Valuation of the defined 
benefit pension obligation
(£797.9m; 2016: £714.8m)
Refer to page 27 (Audit 
Committee Report), page 66 
(accounting policy) and page 
80 (financial disclosures)
Subjective valuation:
Significant assumptions are made in valuing 
the group's defined benefit obligation 
(before deducting scheme assets) including 
in particular the discount rate, inflation rates 
and the average life expectancy. Small 
changes in the assumptions used could 
have a significant effect on the results  
and financial position of the group.
Our procedures included: 
• Benchmarking assumptions: Challenging,  
with the support of our own actuarial specialists,  
the key assumptions applied, being the discount  
rate, inflation rate and mortality/life expectancy  
against externally derived data and internally 
developed benchmarks; and
• Assessing transparency: Considering the adequacy  
of the group’s disclosures in respect of the sensitivity 
of the deficit to these assumptions
Property provisions
(£36.9m; 2016: £39.8m)
Refer to page 27 (Audit 
Committee Report), page 69 
(accounting policy) and page 
83 (financial disclosures).
Subjective estimate:
Inherent uncertainty is involved in 
estimating these provisions as it requires 
a significant degree of judgement and the 
use of subjective assumptions, including the 
expected cash flows associated with the 
properties over the remaining lease term,  
the expected costs related to dilapidations 
and to removing asbestos and the rates 
used to discount future cash flows to 
account for risk and the time value  
of money. 
Our procedures included: 
• Historical comparison: Critically evaluating the 
expected cash outflows used in the calculations for both 
the dilapidations and asbestos provisions by comparing 
the assumptions against the historical trend of charges 
incurred and by comparing actual utilisation of the 
provision to the forecast cashflows at the prior year end.  
For the vacant/onerous lease provision we critically 
assessed actual utilisation of the provision compared to 
forecast cashflows. 
• Sensitivity analysis: Performing sensitivity analysis 
on the key drivers within the financial models, including 
forecast cash outflow and inflows to ascertain the extent 
of change in those assumptions that would be required 
for the provisions to be further increased or decreased 
and evaluating the likelihood of such movements 
through our historical comparison; 
• Benchmarking assumptions: Assessing the discount 
rate used against the market data;
• Inquiry of property specialists: Comparing the 
reasonableness of assumptions within the provision 
calculation through discussions with the in-house 
property specialist including the probability of sublet for 
properties, discussing the plans for the property estate 
in the future and the status of any negotiations with 
landlords; and
• Assessing transparency: Considering the adequacy  
of the group’s disclosures in respect of the sensitivity  
of the provisions to the assumptions made. Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 / Financial Statements

3. Our application of materiality and an 
overview of the scope of our audit
The materiality for the Group financial statements 
as a whole was set at £8.5m (2016: £7.6m), 
determined with reference to a benchmark of 
Group profit before tax of £174.0m (2016: £150.8m), 
of which it represents 4.9% (2016: 5.0%). 
We report to the Audit Committee any corrected 
or uncorrected identified misstatements exceeding 
£0.4m (2016: £0.35m), in addition to other identified 
misstatements that warranted reporting on 
qualitative grounds. 
Of the Group’s seven reporting components 
(2016: seven reporting components), we subjected 
four to audits for Group reporting purposes. For 
the three remaining components (2016: three 
remaining components), we performed analysis 
at an aggregated group level to re-examine our 
assessment that there were no significant risks of 
material misstatement within these. 
Our work covered 99% of the Group’s profit before 
tax, 99% of profit before exceptional items and tax, 
99% of revenues and 99% of total assets (2016:  
97% of the Group’s profit before tax, 99% of profit 
before exceptional items and tax, 99% of revenues 
and 99% of total assets).
The Group audit team carried out the work on 
all the components at the Group’s offices in 
Wellingborough, Deeside, Uxbridge and Eccles. 
Component materialities ranged between £2m and 
£6m (2016: between £1.1m and £6m). Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements

4. Our opinion on other matters prescribed by the 
Companies Act 2006 is unmodified
In our opinion:
• the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be 
audited has been properly prepared in accordance with 
the Companies Act 2006; and
• the information given in the Strategic Report and the 
Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the 
financial statements are prepared is consistent with the 
financial statements.
Based solely on the work required to be undertaken in the 
course of the audit of the financial statements and from 
reading the Strategic report and the Directors’ report:
• we have not identified material misstatements in those 
reports; and  
• in our opinion, those reports have been prepared in 
accordance with the Companies Act 2006.  
5. We have nothing to report on the disclosures  
of principal risks
Based on the knowledge we acquired during our audit, we 
have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to:
• the Strategic Report on pages 1 and 17, concerning the 
principal risks, their management, and, based on that, the 
directors’ assessment and expectations of the group’s 
continuing in operation over the three years to 27 March 
2020; or
• the disclosures in note 1 of the financial statements 
concerning the use of the going concern basis of 
accounting.
6. We have nothing to report in respect of the 
matters on which we are required to report by 
exception
Under ISAs (UK and Ireland) we are required to report to you 
if, based on the knowledge we acquired during our audit, 
we have identified other information in the annual report that 
contains a material inconsistency with either that knowledge 
or the financial statements, a material misstatement of fact, or 
that is otherwise misleading.
In particular, we are required to report to you if 
• we have identified material inconsistencies between the 
knowledge we acquired during our audit and the directors’ 
statement that they consider that the annual report and 
financial statements taken as a whole is fair, balanced and 
understandable and provides the information necessary 
for shareholders to assess the group’s position and 
performance, business model and strategy; or
• the Audit Committee Report does not appropriately 
address matters communicated by us to the audit 
committee. 
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to 
you if, in our opinion:
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the 
parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have 
not been received from branches not visited by us; or
• the parent company financial statements and the part of 
the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not 
in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
• certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by 
law are not made; or
• we have not received all the information and explanations 
we require for our audit.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review:  
• the directors’ statements, set out on page 17, in relation to 
going concern and longer-term viability; and   
• the part of the Corporate Governance Statement on page 
22 relating to the company’s compliance with the eleven 
provisions of the 2014 UK Corporate Governance Code 
specified for our review.
We have nothing to report in respect of the above 
responsibilities.  
Scope and responsibilities
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities 
Statement set out on page 53, the directors are  
responsible for the preparation of the financial statements 
and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view.  
A description of the scope of an audit of financial statements 
is provided on the Financial Reporting Council’s website  
at www.frc.org.uk/auditscopeukprivate. This report  
is made solely to the Company’s members as a body and  
is subject to important explanations and disclaimers 
regarding our responsibilities, published on our website  
at www.kpmg.com/uk/auditscopeukco2014a, which are

NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. General information
a) Overview
Booker Group plc is a public limited company incorporated in the United Kingdom (Registration number 05145685). The 
Company is domiciled in the United Kingdom and its registered address is Equity House, Irthlingborough Road, Wellingborough, 
Northamptonshire, NN8 1LT. The nature of the Group’s operations and its principal activities are set out in the Strategic and 
Directors’ Reports.
b) Basis of accounting
The group financial statements have been prepared and approved by the directors in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU (‘adopted IFRS’). The Company has elected to prepare its parent company accounts in 
accordance with UK Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (‘UK GAAP’) including FRS101 ‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’.
The group financial statements consolidate those of the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the ‘Group’). The 
parent Company financial statements present information about the Company as a separate entity and not about its Group.
The financial statements are presented in Sterling and rounded to the nearest hundred thousand. 
The financial statements for the current period have been prepared for a 52 week period to reflect internal management reporting.
c) Basis of consolidation
On 4 June 2007 the Company, then named Blueheath Holdings plc, became the legal parent company of Giant Topco Limited in 
a share-for-share transaction. Due to the relative values of the companies, the former Giant Topco Limited shareholders became 
the majority shareholders with 90.36% of the enlarged share capital. As part of the business combination Blueheath Holdings plc 
changed its name to Booker Group plc and changed its accounting reference date to 31 March. Following the transaction, the 
Company’s continuing operations and executive management were predominantly those of Booker Wholesale Holdings Limited. 
IFRS3 ‘Business Combinations’ defines the acquirer in a business combination as the entity that obtains control. Accordingly, the 
combination was accounted as a reverse acquisition i.e. as if Giant Topco Limited had acquired Blueheath Holdings plc in return 
for consideration equal to the fair value of the shares issued.
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. Control exists when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns 
from its involvement with an entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power to direct the relevant activities. 
In assessing control, potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are taken into account. The financial 
statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the 
date that control ceases.
d) Accounting standards adopted in the period
The following Adopted IFRSs have been issued and applied by the Group in these financial statements for the first time. 
New standards: None
Amendments and interpretations: 
• Disclosure Initiative – Amendments to IAS1
• Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2012 – 2014 Cycle
• Amendments to IAS16 and IAS28 ‘Clarification of Acceptable Methods of Depreciation and Amortisation’
• Amendments to IFRS11 ‘Accounting for Acquisitions of Interests in Joint Operations’
• Amendments to IFRS10, IFRS12 and IAS28 ‘Investment Entities: Applying the Consolidation Exception’
Their adoption does not have a material effect on the financial statements. Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements

e) New IFRS and amendments to IAS and interpretations
There are a number of standards and interpretations issued by the International Accounting Standards Board that are effective for 
financial statements after this reporting period but have not yet been endorsed by the European Union as follows:
Effective for accounting  
periods starting on or after
Amendments to IAS12 ‘Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for Unrealised Losses’ 1 January 2017
Disclosure Initiative – Amendments to IAS7 1 January 2017
Amendments to IFRS2 ‘Classification and Measurement of Share-based Payment Transactions’ 1 January 2018
IFRS15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’ 1 January 2018
IFRS9 ‘Financial Instruments’ 1 January 2018
IFRS16 ‘Leases’ 1 January 2019
IFRS15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customer’ – The standard was endorsed on 22 September 2016 and applies to an 
entity’s first annual statements beginning on or after 1 January 2018. The standard will replace IAS18 Revenue and IFRIC13 
Customer Loyalty Programmes. The standard introduces a new revenue recognition model that recognises revenue either at a 
point in time or over time. The model features a contract-based five-step analysis of transactions to determine whether, how much 
and when revenue is recognised. The cumulative impact on adoption of this standard is not expected to be significant.
IFRS9 ‘Financial instruments’ – The standard was endorsed on 22 November 2016 and applies to an entity’s first annual 
statements beginning on or after 1 January 2018. The revised standard replaces IAS39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and 
Measurement and introduces new guidance for classification and measurement, impairment of financial instruments, and hedge 
accounting. The cumulative impact on adoption of this standard is not expected to be significant.
IFRS16 ‘Leases’ – In January 2016, the IASB issued IFRS16 and it is expected to apply to an entity’s first annual statements 
beginning on or after 1 January 2019. IFRS16 changes fundamentally the accounting for leases by lessees. It eliminates the 
current IAS17 dual accounting model, which distinguishes between on-balance sheet finance leases and off-balance sheet 
operating leases and, instead, introduces a single, on-balance sheet accounting model that is similar to current finance lease 
accounting. In preparation for the adoption of IFRS16, in the financial statements for the year ending March 2020, management 
are in the process of assessing the potential impact.
f) Going concern
The risks noted in the Strategic Report are those known to the Directors at the date of this Report which the Directors consider 
to be material to the Group, but these do not necessarily comprise all the risks to which the Group is exposed. In particular, the 
Group’s performance could be adversely affected by poor economic conditions. Additional risks and uncertainties currently 
unknown to the Directors, or which the Directors currently believe are immaterial, may also have a material adverse effect on the 
business, financial condition or prospects of the Group. Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 / Financial Statements

NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
1. General information continued
In August 2015, the Group negotiated an unsecured bank facility of £120m for a period of 5 years. At the period end, the Group 
had net cash of £160.7m. In addition, the Group complied with all its covenants during the year. The Group’s forecasts and 
projections, taking account of possible changes in trading performance and considering the risks identified, show that the Group 
should be able to operate within the level of its bank facility. 
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in 
operational existence for at least twelve months from the date of this report. Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going 
concern basis in preparing the Group and Company financial statements. 
g) Use of assumptions and estimates
The preparation of accounts in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires the Directors to make 
judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, 
income and expenses. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other 
factors that are considered to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making the 
estimates about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may 
differ from these estimates.
These estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised 
in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future 
periods if the revision affects both current and future periods. 
Some of these policies require a high level of judgement and the Directors believe that the most critical accounting policies and 
significant areas of judgement and estimation arise from the accounting for:
• IAS19 ‘Employee benefits’. Defined benefit schemes are accounted for in accordance with the advice of an independent 
qualified actuary but significant estimates are required in relation to the assumptions for future salary and pension increases, 
inflation, investment returns and mortality that underpin their valuations. Sensitivities in relation to key assumptions are 
disclosed in note 18.
• IAS37 ‘Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets’. The Group is party to a number of leases on properties 
that are no longer required for trading. Judgement is applied in determining whether leases are onerous. Whilst every effort 
is made to profitably sub-let these properties, it is not always possible to do so. Where a lease is onerous to the Group, a 
provision is established for the difference between amounts contractually payable to the landlord and forecast amounts 
receivable from the tenants. In addition, provisions exist for the expected future dilapidation cost on leasehold properties and 
the expected future costs of removing asbestos from leasehold properties. The Directors consider that their estimates, which 
are based upon the advice of an in-house property department who monitor the UK property market, are appropriate. 
2. Accounting policies
The accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods presented in these 
Group financial statements. 
Intangible assets
a) Business combinations and goodwill
Subject to the transitional relief in IFRS1, all business combinations are accounted for by applying the purchase method. Goodwill 
represents amounts arising on acquisition of subsidiaries. In respect of business acquisitions that have occurred since 1 April 
2006, goodwill represents the difference between the cost of the acquisition and the fair value of the net identifiable assets and 
liabilities acquired. Identifiable intangibles are those which can be sold separately or which arise from legal rights regardless of 
whether those rights are separable.
Goodwill is capitalised and is subject to an impairment review, both annually and when there are indications that its carrying value 
may not be recoverable. 
For acquisitions on or after 1 January 2010, the Group measures goodwill at the acquisition date as:
• the fair value of the consideration transferred; plus 
• the recognised amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree; plus
• the fair value of the existing equity interest in the acquiree; less
• the net recognised amount (generally fair value) of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.  Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 / Financial Statements
65
When the excess is negative, a bargain purchase gain is recognised immediately in the income statement. Costs related to the 
acquisition, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, are expensed as incurred. Any contingent 
consideration payable is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. If the contingent consideration is classified as equity, it is 
not remeasured and settlement is accounted for within equity. Otherwise, subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent 
consideration are recognised in profit or loss.
b) Other intangibles
Customer relationships and know-how are capitalised and amortised on a straight-line basis over 5 years, which is considered to 
be the useful economic life, and charged to administrative expenses.
Revenue 
Revenue is recognised when goods are received by the customer and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to them. 
Revenue is measured at the fair value of consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods net 
of discounts, volume rebates and value added tax. Discounts are accounted for in the period they are earned. Provision is made 
for expected customer returns.
Cost of sales
Cost of sales represents all costs incurred, net of supplier rebates (see below), up to the point of sale including the operating 
expenses of the trading outlets.
Supplier rebates
A number of different types of rebate are negotiated with suppliers in connection with the purchase of goods for resale. Such 
rebates are only recognised when earned by the Group, which occurs when all obligations conditional for earning the rebate have 
been discharged, and the rebate can be measured reliably based on the terms of the contract. These rebates are recognised 
as a credit within cost of sales and, to the extent that the rebate relates to unsold stock purchases, as a reduction in the cost of 
inventory.
There are two main types of supplier rebates:
a)   Terms, which are generally annual agreements (not always coterminous with the Group’s year end), are signed by the Group 
and the supplier. Rebates are determined relative to volumes purchased or by other conditional arrangements as follows:
• Volume based rebates include guaranteed and targeted income. Rebates are accrued based on the Group’s purchasing 
volumes and the current agreement with the supplier. 
• Non-volume based rebates include marketing support, range promotion and product development. Amounts are recognised 
when the rebate is earned through the completion of any required obligations and confirmed by suppliers.
 Invoices are issued to suppliers periodically, quarterly or annually, depending on the terms of the agreement.
b)  Promotional funding, which relates to price investments by suppliers through promotional activity. The calculation of funding 
is mechanical and based on a formula agreed in advance of each promotion with the supplier. Funding is recognised in the 
Income Statement as units are sold and is invoiced throughout the year, shortly after each promotion has ended.
 Amounts relating to supplier rebates appear in a number of different balance sheet headings at the year end:
• Inventories: Where the rebate earned relates to inventories which are held by the Group at year end, the rebates are 
deducted from the cost of those inventories
• Trade receivables: Billed supplier rebates outstanding at the period end where the Group has no legal right to offset against 
trade payables
• Trade payables: Billed supplier rebates outstanding when the Group has a legal right to offset against payables
• Prepayments and accrued income: amounts due from suppliers in relation to supplier rebates which have been recognised 
but not yet invoiced
• Accruals and deferred income: amounts received in relation to supplier rebates that have not been earned at the year end Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 / Financial Statements

NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
2. Accounting policies continued
Employee benefits
a) Share based payments
The Group has issued equity settled share based payments to certain employees in exchange for services rendered by them. The 
fair value is measured using an option valuation model at the date of grant and is recognised as an employee expense over the 
period in which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the options, with a corresponding increase in equity, shown in 
a separate share option reserve. This valuation is based on estimates of the number of options that will eventually vest, based on 
related service and non-market vesting conditions that are expected to be met, such that the amount ultimately recognised as 
an expense is based on the number of awards that do meet the related service and non-market performance conditions at the 
vesting date.
The dilutive effect of outstanding options is reflected as additional share dilution in the computation of earnings per share.
b) Defined contribution plans
Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the income statement as 
incurred.
c) Defined benefit plans
The Group’s net obligation in respect of defined benefit pension plans is calculated by estimating the amount of future benefit 
that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods; that benefit is discounted to determine its 
present value, and the fair value of any plan assets (at bid price) is deducted. The discount rate is the yield at the balance sheet 
date on AA credit rated bonds that have maturity dates approximating to the terms of the Group’s obligations. The defined benefit 
obligation calculation is performed by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method.
All actuarial gains and losses were recognised as at 1 April 2006, the date of transition to Adopted IFRSs. In respect of actuarial 
gains and losses that arise subsequent to 1 April 2006 the Group recognises them in the period they occur directly in other 
comprehensive income.
Where the calculation results in a benefit to the Group, the asset recognised is limited to the present value of any future refunds 
from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan.
Under IAS19, the Group determines the net interest expense/(income) for the period on the net defined benefit liability/asset by 
applying the discount rate used to measure the defined benefit obligation at the beginning of the period to the net defined benefit 
liability/asset at the beginning of the period, taking into account any changes in the net defined benefit liability/asset during the 
period as a result of contributions and benefit payments. 
d) Short-term benefits
Short-term employee benefit obligations are expensed as the related service is provided. An accrual is recognised for the amount 
expected to be paid under short-term cash bonus or profit-sharing plans if the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation 
to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably.
Exceptional items
As required by IAS1 ‘Presentation of financial statements’, an item is disclosed separately if it is considered unusual by its nature 
and scale, and is of such significance that separate disclosure is required for the financial statements to be properly understood. 
Such items are referred to by the Group as exceptional items.  Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 / Financial Statements
67
Financial instruments
Financial instruments issued by the Group are treated as equity only to the extent that they meet the following two conditions: 
(a)  they include no contractual obligations upon the Group to deliver cash or other financial assets or to exchange financial assets 
or financial liabilities with another party under conditions that are potentially unfavourable to the Group; and 
(b)  where the instrument will or may be settled in the Company’s own equity instruments, it is either a non-derivative that includes 
no obligation to deliver a variable number of the Company’s own equity instruments or is a derivative that will be settled by the 
Company’s exchanging a fixed amount of cash or other financial assets for a fixed number of its own equity instruments.
To the extent that this definition is not met, the proceeds of issue are classified as a financial liability. Where the instrument so 
classified takes the legal form of the Company’s own shares, the amounts presented in these financial statements for called up 
share capital and share premium account exclude amounts in relation to those shares. 
Finance payments associated with financial liabilities are dealt with as part of finance expenses. Finance payments associated 
with financial instruments that are classified in equity are treated as distributions and are recorded directly in equity.
Non-derivative financial instruments
Non-derivative financial instruments comprise trade and other receivables, available for sale financial assets, cash and cash 
equivalents, loans and borrowings, and trade and other payables.
a) Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables are recognised initially at fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition they are measured at amortised 
cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment losses.
b) Trade and other payables
Trade and other payables are recognised initially at fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition they are measured at amortised 
cost using the effective interest method.
c) Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and deposits repayable on demand. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on 
demand and form an integral part of the Group’s cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents 
for the purpose only of the statement of cash flows.
d) Interest-bearing borrowings
Interest bearing borrowings are recognised in the balance sheet at amortised cost. Costs associated with extending the bank 
facility have been recognised in the income statement. All other borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement in the 
period in which they are incurred.
Foreign currency
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets 
and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at 
that date. Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the income statement. Non-monetary assets and 
liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of 
the transaction.
Guarantees
Third party property guarantees are initially recognised as a financial liability under IAS37 ’Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and 
Contingent Assets’. These are measured and recognised at fair value. These property guarantees are included within ‘Provisions’ 
on the balance sheet.  Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 / Financial Statements
68
NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
2. Accounting policies continued
Impairment 
The carrying values of the Group’s assets, other than inventories and deferred tax assets, are reviewed at each balance sheet 
date to determine whether there is any impairment. In performing the impairment reviews, the asset’s recoverable amount is 
estimated and compared to the carrying amount.
An impairment loss is recognised to the extent that the carrying value of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount and is 
recognised in the income statement.
Inventories 
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is based on either the weighted average principle or the 
FIFO basis and includes certain warehousing and distribution costs incurred in bringing the inventory to their existing location 
and condition less attributable supplier volume rebates (see above). Net realisable value is the estimated selling price less the 
estimated costs of disposal.
Investment in joint ventures
The Group conducts its joint venture arrangements through jointly controlled entities and accounts for them using the equity 
method of accounting. The Group records its share of the joint controlled entities’ post tax profit or loss within the income 
statement and its share of the net assets within investments. Where the Group transacts with its jointly controlled entities, 
unrealised profits and losses are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in the joint venture.
Leases
Payments made under operating leases are recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the 
lease. Where a lease has a minimum fixed increase, the total minimum lease payments are spread over the lease term. The total 
amount payable over the life of the lease remains unchanged but the timing of the income statement charge relative to the lease 
payments change. The excess of the rent charged over the cash payment in any period will be held on the balance sheet within 
‘Accruals and deferred income’.
Lease incentives received are recognised in the income statement as an integral part of the total lease expense. 
Net financing costs
Interest income and interest payable is recognised in profit or loss as it accrues, using the effective interest method. 
Operating segments
IFRS8 ‘Operating Segments’ requires that segments should be reported on the same basis as the internal reporting information 
that is provided to the Chief Operating Decision Maker (‘CODM’). The CODM has been identified as the CEO. In accordance with 
IFRS8, the Group may aggregate operating segments into one reportable segment to the extent that the criteria for aggregation 
in IFRS8 are met. These criteria include consideration of whether the operating segments have similar economic characteristics; 
similar nature of products and services; similar type or class of customers; similar methods used to distribute products or provide 
services; and similar regulatory environments.
The CODM receives turnover information analysed in a number of different ways (for example by customer and product types, by 
delivery channels and between Wholesale, Booker Direct, Chef Direct, and Ritter-Courivaud). However, none of these ‘possible’ 
segments have a unique management structure, products share the same supply chain and distribution channels, and there are 
a large amount of supplier rebates, expenses and assets/(liabilities) that are not specific. It is therefore not possible to analyse, 
and the CODM does not receive, information in respect of profitability or balance sheets in the same way in which turnover is 
analysed. Internal reports reviewed regularly by the CODM focus on the operations of the Group as a whole and report the results 
and financial position on an IFRS basis. 
As a result, the Group has not disclosed discrete financial information about any of the ‘possible segments’, which in any event 
would meet the criteria for aggregation under IFRS8, separately in these financial statements. 
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Where parts of an 
item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items of property, plant 
and equipment. Labour and associated costs that have been incurred specifically on the ‘Extra’ business centre conversions 
have been capitalised in leasehold improvements and are being depreciated over the lesser of 10 years or the number of years 
remaining on the lease. Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 / Financial Statements
69
Leases in which the Group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the leased asset are classified as 
finance leases. Where land and buildings are held under leases the accounting treatment of the land is considered separately 
from that of the buildings. Leased assets acquired by way of finance lease are stated at an amount equal to the lower of their 
fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments at inception of the lease, less accumulated depreciation and 
impairment losses. 
Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each part of an item of 
property, plant and equipment. The estimated useful lives are as follows:
• Freehold buildings   30 years
• Leasehold improvements   lesser of the unexpired term of the lease and 50 years
• Plant and equipment   3–20 years
• Motor vehicles    4 years
Freehold land is not depreciated. 
Depreciation expense is primarily charged in cost of sales with an immaterial amount in administrative expenses.
Provisions
A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a 
past event, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. If the effect is material, 
provisions are determined by discounting the expected, risk adjusted, future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects the time 
value of money and the risks specific to the liability.
Taxation
Tax expense included in the Income Statement comprises current and deferred tax.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the period, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at 
the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous periods.
Tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is 
recognised in equity, or to the extent it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income, in which case it is recognised 
in other comprehensive income.
Deferred tax is provided using the Balance Sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying 
amounts of assets (excluding goodwill) and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. 
The following temporary differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill and the initial recognition of assets or 
liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit other than in a business combination, to the extent that they will probably 
not reverse in the foreseeable future. The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or 
settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet 
date. Deferred tax is charged or credited in the Income Statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to 
equity, in which case deferred tax is also dealt with in equity. Deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent that, following 
an assessment of the quantum and timing of future taxable profits, it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against 
which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and the amount which is recognised is 
increased or reduced to the extent that it is then probable or no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to 
allow all or part of the asset to be recovered. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset against each other when they relate to 
income taxes levied by the same tax jurisdiction and when the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a 
net basis.
3. Segmental reporting
The Group has considered the principles of IFRS8 as well as its internal reporting, management and operating structure. The 
Directors’ conclusion is that the Group has a single reportable segment, that of wholesaling activities.
Other than the operation in India (which is immaterial), all of the Group’s revenue originates from the UK. The functional currency 
of the Indian operation is Rupees. 
The Group has no significant reliance on any individual customers. Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 / Financial Statements

Reductions in the UK corporation tax rate from 20% to 19% (effective from 1 April 2017) and to 18% (effective 1 April 2020) were 
substantively enacted on 26 October 2015, and an additional reduction to 17% (effective 1 April 2020) was substantively enacted 
on 6 September 2016. This will reduce the company’s future current tax charge accordingly. The deferred tax assets and liabilities 
as at 24 March 2017 have been calculated based on these rates. 
8. Earnings per share
a) Basic earnings per share
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit for the period attributable to the owners of the Group by the weighted 
average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period.

9. Business combination
During the prior period, the Group acquired the entire share capital of Musgrave Retail Partners GB Limited and its’ subsidiaries 
(‘Budgens and Londis’) for £40.0m on a cash/debt free basis with a normalised working capital level. This resulted in overall 
consideration of £110.9m being the sum of £40.0m plus net cash acquired of £66.4m and a working capital adjustment of £4.5m. 
Originally, it was acquired by Booker Group plc, but this was subsequently transferred to Booker Wholesale Holdings Ltd.
Through Booker, Budgens and Londis coming together, the Group seeks to become the UK’s leading wholesaler to independent 
retailers by:
• combining the best ranges from Booker, Budgens and Londis to improve the overall choice;
• consolidating buying volumes to improve prices for customers; and
• better utilisation of the supply chain network to reduce costs.

The fair value adjustments made on acquisition have primarily had the effect of:
• increasing the property valuations;
• increasing the pension surplus to reflect valuations of the schemes in accordance with IAS19;
• increasing provisions in respect of rents that are not in line with the market rent; and
• providing for deferred tax liabilities in respect of the above adjustments. Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 / Financial Statements

NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
9. Business combination continued
The goodwill is underpinned by the synergies that the Group is expected to obtain from improved cost prices from suppliers and 
logistics efficiencies. None of the goodwill recognised will be deductible for tax purposes.
In accordance with IFRS3 ‘Business Combinations’, the hindsight adjustment period for the acquisition ended on 14 September 
2016. There have been no further changes to the fair value of net assets acquired.

Goodwill arose in the Group from the following:
• the acquisition of Budgens and Londis in September 2015 (see note 9);
• the acquisition of the Big Food Group Limited by Giant Topco Limited in February 2005; and
• the acquisition of Ritter-Courivaud Limited in October 2010.
Under IAS36 ‘Impairment of Assets’, the Group is required to test goodwill for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if 
indicators of impairment exist. Impairment reviews compare the carrying value of goodwill, other intangible fixed assets and net 
operating assets contained in each cash generating unit (‘CGU’) with its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount of each CGU is considered to be its value in use, calculated by reference to the pre-tax cash flow 
projections of each CGU based on the Group’s approved budget for 2018 and three year plan to 2020. Cash flows beyond this 
period are extrapolated into perpetuity using an estimated growth rate of 2% (2016: 2%), being the Directors’ estimated view of the 
long term compound growth in the economy. This is considered appropriate because the CGU is considered to be a long term 
business. Risk adjusted pre-tax discount rates are applied to the cash flow forecasts to calculate the value in use of each CGU. 
The main assumptions on which the forecast cash flows are based include the level of sales, gross margin and expenses within 
the business and have been set by the Directors based on their past experience of the business and its industry together with 
their expectations of the market. The level of sales depends upon the size of the markets in which the Group operates together 
with the Directors’ estimations of its market share and competitive pressures. Gross margin is dependent upon the net costs to 
the business of purchasing products together with the level of supplier rebates and income to support sales activities. Expenses 
are based on the current cost base of the Group adjusted for variable costs and known plans for the business.  Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 / Financial Statements

NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
11. Intangible assets continued
The Directors believe that three CGUs exist within the Group:
a) Ritter – goodwill allocated £12.5m (2016: £12.5m)
A pre tax discount rate of 9.5% (2016: 9.4%) has been applied to the projected cash flows. 
A sensitivity analysis has been performed in order to review the impact of changes in key assumptions. With all other assumptions 
held constant, neither a 10% increase in the pre-tax discount rate, nor a decline in growth of 10% into perpetuity, would require 
an impairment to be made.
b) Budgens and Londis – goodwill allocated £3.1m (2016: £3.1m)
A pre tax discount rate of 12.0% (2016: 12.0%) has been applied to the projected cash flows. 
A sensitivity analysis has been performed in order to review the impact of changes in key assumptions. With all other assumptions 
held constant, neither a 10% increase in the pre-tax discount rate, nor a decline in growth of 10% into perpetuity, would require 
an impairment to be made.
c) Remaining business – goodwill allocated £448.9m (2016: £448.9m)
A pre tax discount rate of 9.5% (2016: 9.5%) has been applied to the projected cash flows. 
A sensitivity analysis has been performed in order to review the impact of changes in key assumptions. With all other assumptions 
held constant, neither a 10% increase in the pre-tax discount rate, nor a decline in growth of 10% into perpetuity, would require 
an impairment to be made.
The Directors consider that the assumptions used in the value in use calculations are reasonable and that no impairment is 
required.

Trade and other receivables represent amounts receivable from the sale of goods, together with amounts due from supplier 
rebates (see note 15) and are initially measured at fair value and then subsequently held at amortised cost.
Fair value of property guarantees have been estimated by discounting estimated future cash flows based on the terms and 
maturity and risk of each guarantee crystallising.
Fair value hierarchy
The table below analyses financial instruments measured at fair value, into a fair value hierarchy based on the valuation technique 
used to determine fair value:
• Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
• Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. 
as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices)
• Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).

Liquidity risk
The Group will finance operations and growth from existing cash resources, finance leases and committed borrowing facilities to 
ensure the constant availability of an appropriate amount of reasonably priced funding to meet both current and future forecast 
requirements.
In August 2015, the Group negotiated an unsecured bank facility of £120m for a period of 5 years. The revolving credit facility 
bears floating interest rates linked to LIBOR plus a margin of 0.8%. In the event of default of covenants on the bank facility, any 
drawn facility and any interest accrued are repayable on demand.

It is not possible to quantify the timing of the cash flows relating to the property guarantees.
The undiscounted cash flows for borrowings differ from their carrying value in the balance sheet due to the inclusion of contractual 
interest payments and the adjustment for non-cash items including unamortised borrowing costs. The undiscounted cash flows 
for financial instruments reflect the amounts payable on these instruments which differs from the fair value recorded on the 
balance sheet. There is no difference between the discounted and undiscounted cash flows associated with trade payables due 
to their short term nature.
Credit risk
The Group is predominantly a cash sales business with low levels of trade receivables in comparison to total sales for the year and 
has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of customers. It is the Group’s policy that 
all customers who wish to trade on credit terms are subject to credit verification procedures. The Group has an accounting policy 
to provide for certain overdue trade receivables based on past experience, and believe that there are no significant unprovided 
overdue financial assets.
Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk is relatively small to the Group, as there are no fixed borrowings and the revolving credit facility was not drawn  
during the year. Therefore the Group has chosen not to hedge its borrowings. 
Capital risk
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are:
• to safeguard the entity’s ability to continue as a going concern, so that it can continue to provide returns for shareholders and 
benefits for other stakeholders; and
• to provide an adequate return to shareholders by pricing products and services commensurately with the level of risk.
The Group sets the amount of capital in proportion to risk. The Group manages the capital structure and makes adjustments to it 
in the light of changes in economic conditions and the risk characteristics of the underlying assets. In assessing the level of capital 
all components of equity are taken into account (i.e. share capital and retained earnings). The Group has £160.7m of net cash as 
at 24 March 2017 and is not subject to externally imposed capital requirements. Management of capital therefore focuses around 
its ability to generate cash from its operations.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return 
capital to shareholders, issue new shares, or sell assets to raise funds. The Group believes it is meeting its objectives for 
managing capital as funds are available for reinvestment where necessary as well as being in a position to make returns to 
shareholders where this is felt appropriate.
Foreign currency risk
Less than 1% of purchases are denominated in foreign currencies. At the year end, there were no outstanding foreign exchange 
contracts.
The majority of sales are denominated in sterling, with the exception of sales made from the Group’s Indian operation which are 
denominated in rupees.
18. Post employment benefits
The Group operates a variety of post employment benefit arrangements, covering both funded defined benefit and funded 
defined contribution schemes to provide benefits to both full-time and part-time employees.  Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 / Financial Statements

Defined contribution schemes
Pension contributions of £8.3m (2016: £6.4m) were charged to defined contribution schemes in the period. Included within 
accruals is £0.5m (2016: £0.5m) of outstanding pension contributions.
Defined benefit schemes
The Group operates a number of defined benefit pension schemes, the assets of which are held in separate trustee-administered 
funds to meet future benefit payments. The schemes are established under trust law and comply with all relevant UK legislation. 
The Trustees are responsible for running the schemes in line with the Trust Deed and Rules and for complying with UK pension 
legislation. They are required to oversee the administration of the schemes, arrange timely and correct payment of benefits and 
manage the scheme’s funding and investments.
The main Group pension scheme is the Booker Pension Scheme (‘the Booker Scheme’), a funded defined benefit pension 
arrangement based on final salary and which was closed to new entrants in 2001 with benefits ceasing to accrue from 2002. 
However, active members’ benefits retain a link to their final salaries.
On 14 September 2015 the Group acquired Musgrave Retail Partners GB Limited, which operates the Budgens Pension Scheme 
(‘the Budgens Scheme’) and the Londis Pension Scheme (‘the Londis Scheme’), both trust based occupational defined benefit 
pension schemes. The Londis Scheme was closed to new entrants in 1991 and future benefit accrual in 2009. The Budgens 
Scheme closed to both new entrants and future accrual in 2010, albeit active member’s benefits retain a link to their final salaries.
The benefit obligations as at 24 March 2017 have been calculated by an independent actuary on an IAS19 basis, by rolling forward 
from the results of the latest actuarial funding valuation, which is 31 March 2016, 31 March 2015 and 1 April 2014 for the Booker 
Scheme, the Budgens Scheme and the Londis Scheme respectively.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation has been calculated using the projected unit credit method.

Female 23.8 23.9
Aged 40 retiring at 65 (future pensioner) Male 23.0 23.4
Female 25.4 25.8
At 24 March 2017, the weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation is approximately 17 years.

NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
18. Post employment benefits continued
Based on the rules of schemes, the sponsoring employers have an unconditional right to a refund of surplus once all the 
liabilities have run off. Therefore the provisions of IFRIC14 relating to an asset ceiling do not apply. Accordingly, the surpluses 
under both the Budgens Scheme and Londis Scheme have not been restricted and no additional liability has been recognised 
for the Booker Scheme.
The bid value of the assets was provided by each of the various fund managers in which the schemes are invested. All scheme 
assets have quoted prices in active markets. Around £91m of the Booker Scheme equity allocation relates to an equity liability 
driven investment. This provides a long term expected return in line with equities but with asset value movements which 
respond to changes to bond yields and inflation expectations – this helps smooth the funding level compared to holding a 
traditional equity investment.
The schemes do not hold any of the Group’s financial instruments or property as plan assets.
The defined benefit obligation at 24 March 2017 can be approximately attributed to the scheme members as follows: active 
members 8%, deferred members 46% and pensioner members 46%.

(g) Risks associated with defined benefit pension schemes
The list below summarises the principal risks associated with the Group’s defined benefit pension arrangements. The Group is 
not exposed to any unusual, entity specific or scheme specific risks.
Investment Risk: The present value of defined benefit liabilities is calculated using a discount rate set by reference to high quality 
corporate bond yields. To the extent that the return on plan assets is lower than the discount rate, the pension deficit may increase.
Interest Rate Risk: A fall in bond yields would increase the value of the liabilities. This would be partially offset by an increase in 
the value of bond investments held.
Inflation Risk: An increase in inflation would increase the value of pension liabilities. This would be partially offset by an increase 
in the value of index-linked bond investments held.
Longevity Risk: The present value of the defined benefit liabilities is calculated having regards to a best estimate of the mortality 
of scheme members. If members actually live longer than assumed, this will increase the liabilities.
(h) Sensitivities
Significant actuarial assumptions for the determination of the defined benefit obligation are the discount rate, RPI inflation, 
salary increases, pension increases, and life expectancy. The sensitivity analysis below shows the impact on the defined benefit 
obligation at the end of the reporting period of reasonably possible changes in these assumptions.
Consistent with the sensitivities disclosed last year, when calculating the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligations in the 
scheme to significant assumptions, the same method has been applied as when calculating the pension liability recognised within 
the balance sheet.
These impacts have been determined in isolation whilst holding all other assumptions constant:
Discount rate +/- 0.1% Decrease/increase in liabilities by £12m
RPI inflation rate +/- 0.1% Increase/decrease in liabilities by £9m
Rate of increases in salaries +/- 0.1% Increase/decrease in liabilities by £0.4m
Pension increases in payment +/- 0.1% Increase/decrease in liabilities by £5m
Life expectancy for current and future pensioners +/- 1 year Increase/decrease in liabilities by £25m
Changes in RPI inflation impact CPI inflation and pension increases both before retirement and in payment.
(i) Contributions to be paid
Booker Scheme – the last actuarial funding valuation was carried out at 31 March 2016, which revealed a shortfall of £41.1m at 
this date. This shortfall is expected to be recovered through Company deficit contributions of £5.4m per annum payable for six 
years, with effect from 1 April 2017 and the returns achievable on the assets of the Scheme. 
Budgens Scheme – the last actuarial funding valuation was carried out at 31 March 2015, which revealed a nil shortfall at this date.
Londis Scheme – the last actuarial funding valuation was carried out at 1 April 2014, which revealed a shortfall of £0.5 million 
at this date. This shortfall is expected to be recovered through returns on the scheme assets, and no contributions are required.

NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
19. Provisions continued
The property provisions principally relate to:
• the onerous leases on property currently vacant or sublet for less than the cost of the underlying head lease;
• the expected future dilapidation cost on leasehold properties; and
• the expected future costs of removing asbestos from leasehold properties. Although not a health risk, the Group is legally 
required to undertake a programme of removal.
The sensitivity below shows the impact on the property provisions at the end of the reporting period of reasonably possible 
changes in these assumptions, which have been determined in isolation whilst holding all other assumptions constant:
• a 1% reduction in the discount rate would increase the provisions by £2.9m
• a 10% reduction in the quantum of the cash flows in relation to distribution centre dilapidations would reduce the provisions 
by £1.3m
• a 10% increase in the quantum of the cash flows in relation to branch dilapidations would increase the provision by £1.0m
• a 10% increase in the cash flows in respect of onerous and potentially onerous leases would lead to an increase in the 
provision of £3.7m.
Approximately £4m is expected to be utilised in the year to March 2018.
Other provisions relate to third party property guarantees, for which the timing and quantum of payments is uncertain. Payment 
could be made on demand and the provision represents management’s current estimate of the future liability.

During the period, employees forfeited 0.2m (2016: 0.7m) PSP options for 0.7m (2016: 1. 1m) CSOP options, which were immediately 
exercised at a cost equal to the share price at the date the original PSP was granted.
24. Operating leases
The Group leases a number of trading properties under operating leases. The leases are typically of 5 to 15 years duration, 
although some have lessee only break clauses. Lease payments are reviewed as contracted and increases applied accordingly. 
The Group also leases certain items of plant and equipment.
Operating lease payments represent rents payable by the Group for certain of its wholesale, distribution and office properties and 
other assets such as motor vehicles. The leases have varying terms, escalation charges and renewal rights.
At the balance sheet date, the Group (including Booker Retail Partners (GB) Limited) had outstanding commitments for future 
minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases, which fall due as follows:

NOTES TO THE COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. Basis of preparation 
Booker Group plc (the ‘Company’) is a company incorporated and domiciled in the UK.
These financial statements were prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework 
(‘FRS101’). The amendments to FRS101 (2014/15 Cycle) issued in July 2015 have been applied.
In preparing these financial statements, the Company applies the recognition, measurement and disclosure requirements of 
International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU (‘Adopted IFRSs’), but makes amendments where necessary 
in order to comply with Companies Act 2006 and has set out below where advantage of FRS101 disclosure exemptions have 
been taken. 
In these financial statements, the company has applied the exemptions available under FRS101 in respect of the following 
disclosures:
• a Cash Flow Statement and related notes;
• Disclosures in respect of transactions with wholly owned subsidiaries;
• Disclosures in respect of capital management;
• The effects of new but not yet effective IFRSs; and
• Disclosures in respect of Key Management Personnel.
As the consolidated financial statements include the equivalent disclosures, the Company has also taken the exemptions under 
FRS101 available in respect of the following disclosures:
• IFRS 2 Share Based Payments in respect of group settled share based payments;
• Certain disclosures required by IAS36 Impairment of assets in respect of the impairment of goodwill and indefinite life intangible 
assets; and
• Certain disclosures required by IFRS13 Fair Value Measurement and the disclosures required by IFRS7 Financial Instrument 
Disclosures.
The Company intends to continue to apply the exemptions available under FRS 101.
Under section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the company is exempt from the requirement to present its own profit and loss 
account. 
2. Accounting policies
The accounting policies adopted for the Company are consistent with those used for the Group which are set out on pages 64 
to 69 to all periods presented in these financial statements.
Investments
Investments are stated at cost less any provision for impairment in value. The carrying values of investments are reviewed for 
impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying values may not be recoverable.
3. Profit and loss account
