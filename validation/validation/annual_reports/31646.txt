Laser material processing is a broad term which encompasses 
production processes such as ablating, bending, cutting, 
curing, forming, fusing, marking, micro-machining, sintering, 
thermal annealing, via drilling, and welding.
For these applications, we design and manufacture products 
which are used in laser cavities, to steer and control or to 
modulate the beam.
Printing 
In lithography and micro-lithography, the production process is 
inherently photonic in nature. Computer-to-plate technologies, 
flexographic, and offset printing production components utilize 
laser processing to create the printing tools.
We provide a variety of optical components into these 
applications where accurate transmitted wavefronts and high 
energy tolerance provide superior printed image quality and 
longevity in production.
Test and Measurement
Photonics is used across a wide variety of applications to ascertain 
quality, damage, motion, chemical composition, temperature, 
location, distance, and to automate these types of tests.
Sensing
Fibre optics are deployed in a wide variety of sensing applications. 
These applications may use fibre simply as the communication 
medium for speed, lack of ignition sources, or weight. They 
may also integrate fibre gratings as the sensor to leverage the 
superior resolution.
We supply fibre optic and acousto-optic sub-assemblies and 
components to equipment manufacturers and installers of  
these systems.
Telecommunications
We serve the more demanding applications within 
telecommunications. Our customers deploy our fibre-based

Set against a backdrop of favourable market conditions, your 
company has delivered a strong financial performance in 2017. 
This has been delivered through a mix of organic and 
acquisitive growth.
Demand for certain of Gooch & Housego’s products, particularly 
from the microelectronics and undersea fibre optic 
communications sectors, reached unprecedented levels during 
the year. The resulting record order book presented a significant 
challenge for some of the Company’s manufacturing operations. 
Investments made in recent years in “lean manufacturing” and 
“continuous improvement” meant that G&H was in part able to 
respond to this demand through an enhanced ability to match 
capacity with demand across the Company’s various 
manufacturing locations. Combined with significant investments 
during the year in people, and in the latest manufacturing 
equipment, these initiatives made it possible to satisfy the needs 
of our customers and begin to reduce lead times towards the 
year-end.
In February 2017 G&H acquired StingRay Optics LLC (StingRay), 
a USA based designer and manufacturer of specialist optical and 
opto-mechanical systems. StingRay was a particularly significant 
acquisition as it provides G&H with advanced optical systems 
design capabilities for harsh and demanding applications. These 
new capabilities support the Company’s twin strategic objectives 
of moving up the value chain and achieving greater diversification 
by enabling G&H to provide systems-level solutions to 
Aerospace & Defence (“A&D”) customers. In 2017 the StingRay 
acquisition helped sales into the A&D sector approach one third 
of total revenues. StingRay has delivered a consistently strong 
performance since acquisition. The acquisitions completed in the 
previous year (Alfalight and Kent Periscopes) also made valuable 
contributions in 2017.
The investment in people during 2017 represents an important 
enhancement of the skills-base of G&H, and bodes well for the 
future. In order to meet the challenges of greater scale and 
complexity G&H has chosen to focus on specific high growth 
products and markets. Recent recruitment has reflected the 
need for a higher level of specialisation across a wide range of 
business functions including manufacturing processes and 
systems, business development, human resources, supply-chain 
and research and development. These and planned future 
changes reflect a recent board review of the organisational 
structure of the G&H that had the objective of ensuring that it 
be optimised for delivering sustainable growth over the long 
term, as G&H grows both organically and by acquisition.
In successfully responding to the challenges of 2017 an 
exceptional effort was required by many people. I would like to 
express my thanks to my fellow directors and to all employees of 
Gooch & Housego. I am pleased to welcome David Bauernfeind, 
who joined the board as a non-executive director and Chair of 
the Audit Committee on 1 May 2017.
Gooch & Housego is stronger today than at any time in its past. 
With a sound financial foundation, new talents and capabilities, 
a pipeline of exciting new products and a record order book to 
start the year the Company is well-positioned to continue to 
deliver in 2018 and beyond.

STRA TEGIC REPORT
Overview
FY2017 Performance
Gooch & Housego (“G&H”) benefited from positive market 
conditions and strong demand across its main sectors of 
industrials, aerospace & defence (“A&D”) and life sciences. 
Demand was particularly high for critical components used in 
microelectronic manufacturing and high reliability fibre couplers 
used in undersea cable networks. 
FY 2017 has been a ‘watershed’ year for the company, as we 
passed through the £100 million sales barrier for the first time. 
Revenue of £112.0 million represents year on year growth of 
30.2%, or on a constant currency basis 18.7%. Adjusted PBT, 
which is less affected by foreign exchange fluctuations due to 
the natural hedging within the business, was £16.1 million, 
equating to a year on year profit growth of 13.7%.
Strategically important investments in people, processes, systems 
and the latest capital equipment were made during the year, 
enabling us to address high levels of demand in FY2017 and 
provide an important platform for G&H’s future growth.
Strategic Goals
Considerable progress has been made towards our strategic 
goals of further diversification and moving up the value chain. 
A&D and life sciences both provide a counter balance to the 
exposure that the industrial laser sector has to the global 
economic cycle. These business areas have customer bases which 
include tier one A&D and medical diagnostic companies, who 
often prefer G&H to provide sub systems or systems rather than 
solely critical components, providing a strong impetus to move 
up the value chain. When coupled with the regulatory hurdles 
inherent in both A&D and life sciences, these markets provide 
a defensible business model with a high barrier to entry. 
Our aim is to establish a ‘critical mass’ of business in both the 
A&D and life science sectors.
This has in large part been achieved in A&D, which now represents 
31.1% of G&H’s FY2017 revenue (2016: 23.2%); this was made 
possible due to a combination of organic growth and by the 
three acquisitions made in FY 2016 and FY 2017. Life sciences 
has undergone good organic revenue growth, in particular with 
products utilising our optical coherence tomography technology 
and laser surgery, but the sector still needs further acquisitions 
to achieve the desired ‘critical mass’.
Sub systems and systems now represent 22.1% of our business 
(2016: 15.1%), with the growth again helped by the recent 
acquisitions, most notably Kent Periscopes and StingRay. Kent 
Periscopes, acquired in FY 2016, moved to a larger custom fitted 
facility in St. Asaph, North Wales, during FY 2017. This was 
funded in large part by the Welsh Government. As well as being 
required for the growth of the existing Kent Periscopes business 
the facility is earmarked to become a hub for assembly of sub 
systems and systems across the Group.
Acquisitions 
Strategic acquisitions remain an important part of G&H’s 
business model and in February 2017 we acquired StingRay 
Optics LLC (“StingRay”). 
StingRay is a USA based specialist designer and manufacturer of 
high performance optical and opto-mechanical sub systems for 
demanding defence and commercial applications. Their product 
range is focused on laboratory, ground based, airborne, 
unmanned aerial vehicles (‘UAVs”) and space applications for 
key US defence customers. Synergies include leveraging G&H’s 
greater reach through our global sales teams and our expertise 
in manufacturing infrared precision optics and specialist coatings. 
The partnership has proven to be very successful so far, with 
StingRay’s performance exceeding our expectations and their 
talented workforce integrating well into the wider company.
Research and Development (“R&D”)
There has been continued benefit from concentrating our R&D 
efforts on fewer higher return projects. During FY 2017 we 
introduced a record 22 new products and we expect the full value 
of these products to peak over the next three years. Revenue 
generated from new products this year was £11.1 million.
“Gooch & Housego met its FY 2017 financial goals and was able 
to make strategically important investments in key skills, 
processes, systems and the latest capital equipment. Significant 
progress has been made towards meeting our strategic aims of 
diversifying the business and moving up the value chain, with 
A&D now representing 31.1% of our business. We acquired 
USA based StingRay in February 2017, which has integrated 
well into the wider organisation and performed strongly”
CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S STATEMENT GOOCH & HOUSEGO PLC
12  |  ANNUAL REPORT 2017
STRA TEGIC REPORT
Good progress has been achieved in our key R&D areas of 
interest, notable among which are the following:
Microelectronics is entering a new phase of nano technology 
and the UV lithography and via drilling techniques required to 
achieve this need a new generation of precision lasers and 
laser systems which are being developed with our laser 
manufacturer and laser system partners.
OCT technology dominates the retinal scanning and imaging 
arena, but the longer term development partnerships we have 
with medical diagnostic companies in the areas of cardiovascular 
disease and cancer detection are now moving to the prototype 
and early commercial model stage, with the prospect of new 
product launches in the near future.
Our space communication group has gone from strength to 
strength with European Space Agency and UK Space agency 
funded work in satellite communications and is now attracting 
commercial interest from the USA and elsewhere. In addition 
to the grant funded work we have enhanced our $4 million 
commercial contract to provide communication systems for 
near term satellite launches. We are also developing similar 
technology for the adjacent market of UAVs.
Various aspects of our R&D defence programmes in the US and 
Europe are classified, but we are able to say that we are making 
good headway in developing key parts of Kent Periscopes’ product 
portfolio, so they are compatible with USA military standards.
We have recently moved some of our R&D effort into sensing 
technology, focusing on use in harsh environments with 
ruggedised photonics technology. We have been able to bring 
some of our space communications experience to problem 
solving in this arena.
In order to accommodate the need for more system based 
projects, the Systems Technology Group (“STG”), primarily based 
at our Torquay site, has been expanded. The group consists of 
scientists and engineers who bring a wide range of skills such 
as electronic, software and mechanical engineering, which are 
required in order to present a complete sub system or system 
to our customers.
Performance Improvement Programme
In addition to the enhanced R&D performance outlined above, 
we have continued to expand our business development group, 
adding a microelectronic business development executive to 
the existing life science and A&D executives. The established 
business development executives have brought enhanced 
access to tier 1 A&D companies and multi-national medical 
diagnostic organisations and have been instrumental in the 
development of some of our most notable R&D projects. Our 
expectation is that with the addition of the new microelectronics 
business development executive we will be able to enhance 
our contribution to the new industrial laser systems that are 
currently in development.
G&H’s ongoing operational performance improvement programme 
was instrumental in enabling us to meet the challenge of this 
year’s high growth rate. The major infrastructure projects in 
Fremont, CA and Cleveland, OH are now substantially complete. 
Investment in key skills, lean processes and systems and the 
latest capital equipment was accelerated in sites that provide 
critical components for precision lasers used in microelectronic 
manufacturing, namely Ilminster, Fremont, CA and Torquay.
We have built on the good work done in previous years to further 
improve efficiency, customer service and to establish a more 
scalable organisational model for future growth. Our ten 
manufacturing sites have been organised into three 
manufacturing centres. They are based on our sites’ areas of 
technical expertise, namely Acousto Optic / Electro Optic, 
Precision Optics and Fibre Optics. Each manufacturing area has 
a leader and their role is to ensure best practice is shared; there 
is process harmonisation and optimal allocation of resource. 
G&H is in a strong positon financially and is well positioned to 
make further investment in the business.
Market and Applications
Industrial
The industrial sector represents 57.4% of G&H’s revenue and is 
composed of a diverse range of industrial applications aligned to 
our world class photonic technologies, including microelectronic 
manufacturing, semiconductor manufacturing and test, remote 
sensing, metrology and optical communications.
Our industrials division grew by £10.0 million or 18.4% compared 
to the previous year, reflecting a positive performance across 
the range of industrial products. 
Critical components for precision lasers used in microelectronic 
manufacturing were in particular demand. This was driven by the 
next generation of smart phones and tablets and the consequent 
change in manufacturing technology required to produce them. 
The aforementioned ‘cutting edge’ technology is primarily 
dependent on the latest solid state lasers and we worked closely 
with the laser manufacturers and laser system suppliers to meet 
these demands. 
Precision inspection equipment for real time calibration in smart 
phone and tablet production continued to deliver significant 
revenue for us during FY 2017.
The ongoing need for ever more data capacity from government, 
industry and the consumer continues to drive a strong optical 
telecommunications performance. G&H provides some of the 
more technically challenging elements to both land and undersea 
optical communications. Our ultra hi-reliability fibre couplers are

used in amplifiers that are a key part of undersea cable networks. 
Over the last couple of years there has been a positive step 
change in the requirement for these products, driven by 
technology firms laying their own cable networks in order to 
control the process of data delivery. This new level of demand 
has continued unabated throughout FY 2017. 
Aerospace & Defence
A&D represented 31.1% of our revenue and grew year on year by 
£14.9 million or 74.5%. This was due to a combination of organic 
growth and acquisition, as highlighted earlier. G&H is now able 
to bring a wide range of photonic capabilities that very much 
represent the “direction of travel” in this sector. These include 
target designation, range finding, ring laser and fibre optic 
gyroscope navigational systems, infra-red and RF counter 
measures, periscopes and sighting systems for armoured vehicles 
and opto-mechanical sub systems for unmanned aerial vehicles. 
Delivering product quality, reliability and performance in 
challenging environments is essential in the A&D arena and 
this very much plays to G&H’s strengths. Our customers 
encompass the major European and USA A&D companies.
Space satellite communication is undergoing a technology 
revolution. The use of fibre optic lasers to transmit information 
means the satellite communication systems are more efficient 
and robust, as well being significantly lighter. This has changed 
the economics of the sector and has led to smaller satellites and 
encouraged the move towards the use of satellite constellations 
as part of a communications network. The investment we have 
made in this area means we are at the forefront of some of 
these developments.
Life Sciences
Life Sciences represents 8.5% of G&H’s revenue and grew year on 
year by £1.7 million or 21.1%. Despite the increase in revenue the 
profit did decline year on year, which is primarily due to the 
investments made into future capabilities. Though life sciences 
is a relatively small sector for G&H we see this as a strategically 
important one going forward.  
The principal applications are in optical coherence tomography 
(“OCT”), laser surgery and microscopy. OCT is widely used in 
ophthalmology for 3D retinal scanning and G&H has a dominant 
position in supplying critical components and sub systems to 
the main equipment suppliers. We also have a number of R&D 
collaborations with medical diagnostic companies in 
cardiovascular and cancer detection.
Laser surgery is a fast growing area particularly in ophthalmology , 
prostate and cosmetic surgery and has significant potential to 
be exploited beyond these current areas of use.
There is potential for photonic technology to be used in minimally 
invasive surgery, endoscopy and robotic surgery and this sector 
remains an area where G&H will continue to invest in R&D and 
look for strategic acquisitions.
Scientific Research
G&H’s research market is dominated by a small number of “big 
science” projects in the fields of nuclear fusion research and 
synchrotron radiation sources. It provides 3.0% of our revenue. 
The year on year decline was due to the phasing of one of the 
projects. This is a profitable sector for G&H, where we have some 
unique capabilities, that has the capacity to deliver growth and 
we will continue to selectively invest in this area.
Outlook
G&H met its FY 2017 financial goals and was able to make 
strategically important investments in key skills, processes, 
systems and the latest capital equipment. Significant progress 
has been made towards meeting our strategic aims of 
diversifying the business and moving up the value chain, with 
A&D now representing 31.1% of our business by revenue. We 
acquired USA based StingRay Optics LLC in February 2017, 
which has integrated well into the wider organisation and 
performed strongly.
G&H will continue with an active policy of making further 
progress towards a more diverse and balanced business by 
building “critical mass” in A&D and life sciences, through a mix 
of investment in R&D and acquisitions.
We are committed to making further investment in R&D in our 
targeted high growth areas. These include fibre and solid state 
laser systems, precision inspection equipment for microelectronic 
manufacturing, OCT medical diagnostics, laser surgery, space 
satellite communications, A&D sub systems and fibre optic 
sensing systems.
G&H intends to take the performance improvement programme to 
the next level, by further investment in business development 
activity, focusing our global resources on a few high return R&D 
projects and continuing to improve operational efficiency. We 
believe the introduction of three well defined and focused 
manufacturing centres will provide a scalable platform for 
enhanced lean manufacturing practice
These strategic initiatives combined with a record year end 
order book mean the Board remains confident that G&H is well 
positioned to deliver further progress in FY 2018 and beyond

Applications, Products and Markets
Nuclear fusion research and energy laser technology is being 
used to recreate the conditions found in the core of the sun. At 
these temperatures and pressures isotopes of hydrogen fuse to 
form helium and in doing so release huge amounts of energy 
– the energy that powers the sun and stars. One of the most 
exciting potential applications of this research is using laser 
fusion to provide limitless quantities of clean, carbon-free energy 
to meet the world’s growing needs. The products supplied into 
this market utilise a wide range of the Company’s technologies 
including crystal growth, precision optics, thin-film coatings and 
fibre optics. Gooch & Housego supplies many of the world’s 
leading nuclear fusion energy research facilities. We are also the 
sole supplier of many critical optical components used in the 
world’s most powerful laser system at the National Ignition 
Facility (NIF) at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in 
Northern California.  
Instrumentation for applications in agricultural, solar, marine 
and industrial research. An example of an industrial research 
application is the development of Light Emitting Diode (LED) 
illumination systems. Instrumentation products are supplied from 
our Orlando facility and include photometers, radiometers, 
spectroradiometers and their associated calibration services. The 
customer base ranges from universities and research institutes 
to Government agencies and national standards laboratories.

FINANCIAL AND OPERATING REVIEW
Performance Overview
The business has once again delivered strong profitable growth.
Group revenue for the year was a record £112.0million. This 
represents an increase of £25.9 million, or 30.2% over the previous 
year of £86.1 million. During the year Gooch & Housego acquired 
StingRay Optics LLC, which contributed £5.3 million to Group 
revenue in the year, so organic revenue was up by 23.9%. On a 
constant currency basis revenue was 18.7% higher than the 
previous year.
During 2017, Gooch & Housego invested £5.8 million in property , 
plant and equipment and £5.7 million in acquisitions. Despite this 
the business has increased its net cash position to £14.9 million 
at 30 September 2017 (2016: £11.7 million), through sustained 
strong operating cash flows.
In the financial year under review, adjusted operating margins 
increased by £2.1 million in absolute terms to £16.4 million (2016: 
£14.3 million). At a percentage margin level, adjusted operating 
margins were 14.6%, compared to 16.6% in 2016, as a result of 
foreign exchange and planned investment in people and systems 
to support the growth.

The Group adjusted profit before tax amounted to 16.1 million 
(2016: £14.2 million) and represented a net margin of 14.4%. 
Statutory profit before tax was £12.6 million compared with 
£10.1 million last year.
The adjusted effective rate of tax was 25.2% (2016: 27.3%), 
the reduction caused by a number of factors including a lower 
applicable corporate tax rate in the UK, tax deductions being 
available on intangibles on recent US acquisitions and certain 
one off effects in the prior year. The effective rate of tax of 
29.4% (2016: 30.2%) was higher than the adjusted effective 
rate because of the effect of the interest charge on deferred 
consideration which is not subject to tax, and the restructuring 
and acquisition costs being incurred in the UK which has a lower 
tax rate than the overall rate for the Group. The rate reflects a 
combination of the varying tax rates applicable throughout the 
countries in which the Group operates, principally the UK and 
the USA.
The effective rate of tax should benefit in the future from further 
reductions in the UK tax rate, although the proportion of profit 
generated in the USA, where tax rates are higher, will affect this.

FINANCIAL AND OPERATING REVIEW
Non GAAP Measures
The Company uses a number of non GAAP measures which are 
shown in the table above and in the segmental analysis. These 
measures are used to illustrate the impact of non-recurring and 
non-trading items on the Company’s financial results. These are 
the impact of the amortisation of acquired intangible assets, costs 
associated with restructuring activities, interest on deferred 
consideration, impairment of goodwill and release of accrued 
contingent consideration. In 2016 they also included the 
provision for regulatory risk compliance and the gain on 
bargain purchase of Alfalight. 
Segmental Analysis
Industrial
Our Industrial business grew strongly during the year, with 
revenues of £64.3 million, compared with £54.3 million last year. 
This growth was largely driven by a combination of our industrial 
laser and telecommunications businesses. Revenue from the 
Group’s industrial laser business segment grew strongly, driven 
by high demand for precision lasers used in microelectronic 
manufacturing. Demand for the traditional Q Switch grew in 2017 
and represented 14.0% of total Group revenue (2016: 10.2%). 
Adjusted operating profit for the Industrial sector as a whole 
was 10.1% higher at £11.8 million, compared with £10.8 
million last year. 
Aerospace & Defence (A&D)
A&D revenue was £34.9 million, up 74.5% on last year, 
benefitting from the full year effect of the two acquisitions in 
FY16 and the acquisition of StingRay in FY17. These results 
reinforce our belief that this sector represents a growth 
opportunity for Gooch & Housego, as optical technologies 
continue to be increasingly deployed in this market. Operating 
margins in this sector increased reflecting the higher volume 
and strong margins achieved by StingRay in particular. 
Life Sciences
In 2017 Life Sciences revenue was up by 21.1% compared to the 
prior year. The majority of this growth was driven by a strong 
performance in our Optical Coherence Tomography (“OCT”) 
market driven largely by our customers’ development cycles.  
Despite this, adjusted operating margins in this sector were down 
on the previous year due to the competitive nature of the OCT 
market and the investment in this relatively small sector. 
Scientific Research
Our activities in the Scientific Research market are dominated by 
a small number of large, long-term programmes. This market was 
down in 2017 due to demand phasing.
Research and Development (R&D)
Gooch & Housego continues to invest in R&D in all areas of the 
business and regards this as fundamental to the continued 
growth of the company. There were a record 22 product releases 
in 2017, together with 7 new patents granted.
Expenditure on R&D in the year to 30 September 2017 increased 
by 16.2% from £7.4 million to £8.6 million. A proportion of this 
increase was funded through UK and European grant funding.  
R&D expenditure represented 7.7% of revenue (2016: 8.6%).  
The Group capitalised £0.7m (2016: £0.7 million) of 
development expenditure.
Operations
As reported in our Interim Statement, the Company has 
committed to upgrading its Cleveland, Ohio facility. This facility, 
which houses G&H’s world leading crystal growth capabilities, is 
a key contributor to current and future profitability and will benefit 
from the modernisation that has been taking place. The upgrade 
is substantially complete and we will have invested in the region 
of $5 million. The refurbishment will help drive much needed 
operational efficiency, provide greater capacity, as well as a more 
compelling showcase of our capabilities for customers. 
The Company has concluded a legal dispute with the landlord 
of its Fremont facility. As a result of this, a Californian court has 
awarded G&H in the region of $2 million in damages arising 
from the landlord’s non-performance in respect of the lease. 
This will be accounted for in FY18.
Investment in key skills, lean processes, systems and the latest 
capital equipment was accelerated in sites that provide critical 
components for precision lasers used in microelectronic 
manufacturing, namely Ilminster, Fremont, CA and Torquay.
We have built on the good work done in previous years to further 
improve efficiency, customer service and to establish a more 
scalable organisational model for future growth. Our ten 
manufacturing sites have been organised into three manufacturing 
areas. They are based on our sites’ areas of technical expertise, 
namely Acousto Optic / Electro Optic, Precision Optics and Fibre 
Optics. Each manufacturing area has a leader and their role is to 
ensure best practice is shared, there is process harmonisation 
and optimal allocation of resources.
Acquisitions
G&H will continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities that have 
the potential to accelerate delivery of the Company’s strategic 
objectives. Having established a presence in its target markets, 
G&H is now focussing on moving up the value chain in each of 
those markets. Whilst the business will continue to evaluate bolt 
on businesses in our core component technologies, continued 
strong focus is being placed on acquisition opportunities that 
enhance the Company’s ability to wrap electronics and software 
around core photonic products to yield system-level solutions.
In February 2017 G&H acquired StingRay Optics LLC, a US based 
specialist designer and manufacturer of high performance  GOOCH & HOUSEGO PLC

STRA TEGIC REPORT
optical and opto-mechanical subsystems for demanding defence 
and commercial applications.
StingRay was founded in 2004 and has established itself as a 
market leading designer, manufacturer and supplier of world class 
custom optical assemblies. The business has a proven capability 
in providing system level optical products for use in harsh 
environments to key US defence customers. StingRay’s product 
range covers laboratory, ground based, airborne, unmanned 
aerial vehicles and space applications.
The acquisition of StingRay is aligned with G&H’s strategic 
objectives of moving up the value chain and further diversification 
into the Aerospace & Defence sector. Potential synergies include 
leveraging G&H’s greater reach through our global sales teams 
and our expertise in manufacturing infrared precision optics 
and specialist coatings.
StingRay has performed very well since acquisition, contributing 
£5.3 million to Group revenue and £1.6 million in profit before 
tax in the year.
As a result of two key customers delaying the delivery of product 
from existing orders, Kent Periscopes did not reach its threshold 
for the first tranche of its earn-out to be triggered. Consequently , 
the provision for a proportion of this payment (approximately 
£0.6m), made under IFRS accounting rules, has been released to 
the income statement for the current year. Whilst the delay in 
delivery of these contracts has affected the anticipated results 
of Kent Periscopes for the earn-out period, the outlook for the 
business remains positive. The order book for the next two years 
remains very strong at approximately £12.5 million. Whilst the core 
value of this business remains strong, as part of its bi-annual 
review of the carrying value of goodwill, the Board has taken the 
decision to impair the goodwill of the Kent Periscopes acquisition 
to the sum of £0.6 million.
Non Trading Items
Restructuring costs of £0.5 million (2016: £1.7 million) related 
to the re-location of our Palo Alto facility to Fremont and to 
restructuring costs arising from the efficiency savings the 
business has put in place.
Balance Sheet
The Group’s total equity at the end of the year was £98.1 million, 
an increase of £8.0 million over the prior year. This increase 
comprised £6.6m from retained earnings, £2.0m from issues 
of share capital and a net reduction of £0.6m from foreign 
exchange and other movements.
Additions to property, plant and equipment totalled £5.8m 
(excluding acquisitions). The main additions related to investment 
in plant and machinery, the expansion of our Torquay facility, 
and the refurbishment of our Cleveland facility.
Working capital was 19.2% of revenue in the current year 
compared to 24.5% in 2016. This metric has benefitted from 
the year end GBP:USD exchange rate being higher than the 
average for the year, but also reflects management efforts to 
reduce working capital as a percentage of sales.
Inventory at the year end was £21.1 million, an increase of £2.1 
million over the prior year. Excluding the impact of currency and 
the inventory attributable to the acquisition, the underlying 
inventory increased by £1.6m, or 8.5%, in the year. This increase 
is reflective of the increased activity in the year.
Trade receivables were unchanged at £20.5m. The effect of a 
strong shipment profile towards the end of the year and the 
acquisition of StingRay were largely offset by movements in 
the dollar exchange rate.
Cash balances at 30 September 2017 were £26.4 million, 
compared with £23.2 million at 30 September 2016. Net cash 
flows from operating activities totalled £17.6 million, compared 
with £12.6 million last year, reflecting a cash generated from 
operations to adjusted operating profit rate of 119% (2016: 96%). 
During the year the business increased its net cash position from 
£11.7m to £14.9 million, despite investing £5.7m in the acquisition 
of StingRay and £5.8m in property, plant and equipment.

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
The Group objective is to deliver sustainable, long-term growth 
in revenue and profits. This is to be achieved through the 
execution of the Board’s strategies. 
In striving to achieve these strategic objectives, the main 
financial performance measures monitored by the Board are:
All amounts in £m 2017 2016 2015
At actual exchange rates 30% 9% 12%
At constant exchange rates 19% 3% 8%
The Board is focused on driving revenue growth by investing both 
organically and through acquisitions. The Group business has

Target market revenue 2017 2016 2015
Aerospace & Defence (£m) 34.9 20.0 19.8
Life Sciences (£m) 9.6 7.9 9.0
The Group targeted markets of Aerospace & Defence and Life 
Sciences provide a route to sustainable growth, and a more 
diversified revenue base. These markets also provide significant 
opportunities for Gooch & Housego to migrate up the value chain 
from materials and components to higher value sub-assemblies, 
modules and systems in response to the trend for our larger 
customers to outsource increasingly complex parts of their 
business. The increase in A&D revenue includes the full year 
effect of last year’s acquisitions, combined with the acquisition 
of StingRay in FY17.
Net cash analysis 2017 2016 2015
Net cash (£m) 14.9 11.7 17.3
In order to balance business risk with the investment needs of 
the Company, management closely monitors and manages net 
cash. This year, following the acquisition of StingRay and the 
investment in capital assets the net cash position increased 
from £11.7 million to £14.9m.
Earnings per share (EPS) 2017 2016 2015
Adjusted diluted EPS (pence) 48.5p 41.7p 38.9p
As a result of a strong trading performance, the business has 
been able to deliver growth in adjusted diluted EPS of 16.3%, 
from 41.7p to 48.5p in 2017.
The revenue, cash and earnings per share targets for the year 
were met.

PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES
Gooch & Housego adopts a formal risk identification and management process designed to 
ensure that risks are properly identified, prioritised, evaluated and mitigated to the extent possible. 
A formal Group wide risk register is maintained and approved by the Board on an annual basis. 
The following represent the significant risks identified in the Group’s risk register.
RISK MITIGATION
COMPETITION
The Group recognises the importance of retaining and developing  
its highly skilled management team and workforce in order to  
achieve its strategic objectives.
This is a key area of focus for the G&H management team. 
Fundamental to mitigating the effects of our competitors is to maintain 
our product quality and on-time delivery performance to ensure our 
customers’ expectations are fulfilled.
Our significant investment in R&D enabled us to launch 22 new 
products during FY2017.
The Group also has a cost reduction roadmap in place including the roll 
out of lean manufacturing practices across our sites, and the use of 
lower cost manufacturing partners where it is efficient to do so.
Our business development teams maintain a presence in the market 
place and attend key trade shows which enables them to monitor 
competitor activity and respond accordingly.
RETENTION OF KEY PERSONNEL
The Group recognises the importance of retaining and developing its 
highly skilled management team and workforce in order to achieve its 
strategic objectives.
Our people are at the heart of our business. We maintain development 
and reward schemes to encourage individuals to play a long term role in 
the future development of the Group.
CAPACITY PLANNING
Recent market trends have led to unprecedented demand for certain 
products which has exceeded the capacity of certain of our facilities 
during FY17.
There has been significant management focus on increasing efficiency 
during FY17 in order to increase capacity. This included investment in 
machinery and people, and removing bottlenecks from production lines. 
Significant progress has been made in increasing capacity at 
strategically important plants.
GLOBAL ECONOMIC TRENDS
Adverse changes in the major markets in which the Group operates can have 
a significant impact on the Group’s performance.   
Gooch & Housego PLC has seen substantial growth in its business in 
recent years. Through its strategies of market diversification and moving 
up the value chain, the Group seeks to provide routes to new markets and 
reduce its dependence on any one market sector. Whilst the continued 
growth in the business remains challenging to predict, the year-end order 
book was 37% higher than the previous year, including the impact of 
an acquisition.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT
The Directors present their report together with the audited 
consolidated financial statements for the year ended 30 
September 2017.
A review of the development and performance of the Group during 
the year and its future prospects is set out in the Financial 
Highlights on page 2 and in the Financial and Operating Review on 
pages 22 to 25. An outline of the business’s principal activities, 
strategy and the Group’s progress in the year towards these 
strategies is given in the Strategic Report on pages 10 to 27. 
An analysis of the segmental information by market sector is

Key Performance Indicators (“KPIs”)
The Group uses a selection of KPIs to monitor and review the 
performance of the business. These are detailed from page 25 
of the Financial and Operating Review. 
Dividends
During the year ended 30 September 2017 a final dividend of 
5.7p per share was paid for the previous financial year. The final 
2015 dividend of 5.2p per share was paid in the year ended 30 
September 2016. A further interim dividend of 3.7p per share was 
paid for the half year ended 31 March 2017 (2016: 3.3p).
For the year ended 30 September 2017, the Directors propose 
that a final dividend of 6.5p per share be paid.
Substantial shareholdings
As at 15 November 2017, the following shareholders had notified 
the Company that they held an interest in 3% or more of its 
issued ordinary share capital:
Shareholder Number % holding
Octopus Investments 3,835,243 15.64%
Investec Wealth & Investment 2,192,019 8.94%
Aberdeen Standard Investments 1,884,407 7.69%
Hargreave Hale 1,590,027 6.49%
Black Rock Investment Management 1,525,047 6.22%
Franklin T empleton Investment Management 1,297,550 5.29%
JM Finn & Co 776,825 3.17%
Save for these interests, the Directors have not been notified that 
any person is directly or indirectly interested in 3% or more of 
the issued ordinary share capital of the Company. 
Treasury Policies
The Group’s treasury policies are designed to manage financial 
risk to the Group that arises from operating in a number of foreign 
currencies and to maximise interest income on cash deposits, 
whilst maintaining the security of these deposits. As an 
international group of companies, the main exposure is in respect 
of foreign currency risk on the trading transactions undertaken 
by Group companies and on the translation of the net assets of 
overseas subsidiaries. This exposure is principally to the US dollar.
Monthly cash management reporting and forecasting is in place 
to facilitate management of this currency risk. The operations of 
Group treasury take place at head office.
All balances not immediately required for Group operations are 
placed on short-term deposit with leading international highly 
rated financial institutions.
At a transactional level, the Group seeks to offset its exposure to 
foreign exchange movements by contracting with significant 
supply partners in US Dollars and undertakes regular financial 
reviews to assess whether it would be appropriate for the Group 
to enter into currency hedging contracts to mitigate the currency 
risk. During the year there were no forward contracts in place.
The Group’s bank borrowings are denominated in US Dollars, 
which acts as a partial hedge of a net investment against its 
US Dollar denominated companies within the Group.
Research and Development
The Group has a continuing commitment to a high level of 
research and development. This commitment is to actively 
develop new technologies and capabilities that will become a 
key part of the Group’s future product portfolio and revenue.
Directors’ Indemnities
The Directors have the benefit of an indemnity which is a 
qualifying third party indemnity provision as defined by Section 
234 of the Companies Act 2006. The indemnity was in force 
throughout the last financial year and is currently in force.  
The Company also purchased and maintained throughout the 
financial year Directors’ and Officers’ liability insurance in respect 
of itself and its Directors.
Employee Involvement
The Group is committed to including all employees in the 
performance and development of the business. An established 
employee appraisal and reward scheme is in operation and 
employees are appraised regularly with relevant development 
support provided by the Group.
The Group attaches considerable importance to informing and 
involving its employees on matters which concern them and in 
the achievement of its business objectives. The Group has a 
formal employee communication plan involving regular meetings 
between management and employees and the provision of a 
comprehensive employee handbook.

The Board recognises the importance of good corporate 
governance and has put in place procedures it  
considers appropriate.   GOOCH & HOUSEGO PLC

Risk management and internal control
The Directors acknowledge that they are responsible for the 
Group’s system of internal financial control. The system can 
provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance against 
material misstatements and losses.  
There are defined lines of responsibility and delegation of 
authorities. There are also internal financial controls in existence 
which are centrally maintained and documented and provide 
reasonable assurance of the maintenance of proper accounting 
records and the reliability of financial information used within 
the business.
The Group does not have an internal audit department, but 
senior finance staff regularly visit the sites to perform reviews 
of controls and processes in place.
Annual budgets and three year strategic plans are prepared for 
each company. Financial and operational reports enable the 
Board to compare performance against budget and to take 
action where appropriate.

undertook Anti Bribery training.

objectives is contained in note 5.
Environmental Policy
The policy of the Group is to meet the statutory environmental 
requirements placed upon it and to apply good environmental 
practice in its operations while recognising that it is contractually 
obliged to meet its customer requirements.
Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report 
and Financial Statements in accordance with applicable law 
and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial 
statements for each financial year. Under that law the directors 
have prepared the Group financial statements in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by 
the European Union and parent company financial statements 
in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union. Under company law 
the directors must not approve the financial statements unless 
they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state 
of affairs of the Group and parent company and of the profit or 
loss of the Group for that period.  In preparing these financial 
statements, the directors are required to:
•  select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently;
•  state whether applicable IFRSs as adopted by the European 
Union have been followed for the Group financial statements and 
IFRSs as adopted by the European Union have been followed 
for the company financial statements, subject to any material 
departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements;
•  make judgements and accounting estimates that are 
reasonable and prudent; and
•  prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the company will 
continue in business. GOOCH & HOUSEGO PLC
32  |  ANNUAL REPORT 2017
GOVERNANCE
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Group and 
parent company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable 
accuracy at any time the financial position of the Group and 
parent company and enable them to ensure that the financial 
statements comply with the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards 
the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
The directors are also responsible for safeguarding the assets 
of the Group and parent company and hence for taking 
reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud  
and other irregularities.
The directors of the ultimate parent company are responsible for 
the maintenance and integrity of the ultimate parent company’s 
website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the 
preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ 
from legislation in other jurisdictions.
The directors consider that the annual report and accounts, taken 
as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the 
information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group and 
parent company’s performance, business model and strategy.
Each of the directors, whose names and functions are listed on 
pages 28 and 29 confirm that, to the best of their knowledge:
•  the parent company financial statements, which have been 
prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European 
Union, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities and 
financial position of the parent company; 
•  the Group financial statements, which have been prepared in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, give 
a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position 
and profit of the Group; and
•  the Annual Report and Financial Statements includes a fair 
review of the development and performance of the business 
and the position of the Group and parent company, together 
with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties 
that it faces. 
In the case of each director in office at the date the Directors’ 
Report is approved:
•  so far as the director is aware, there is no relevant audit 
information of which the Group and company’s auditors are 
unaware; and
•  they have taken all the steps that they ought to have taken as 
a director in order to make themselves aware of any relevant 
audit information and to establish that the Group and parent 
company’s auditors are aware of that information. 
Going Concern
Based on Management’s operating projections and cash flow 
forecasts, the Directors believe that the Group will generate 
sufficient cash and have access to working capital facilities to 
enable it to meet its funding requirements for at least the next 
12 months and will continue to comply with its banking covenants.
Accordingly, the Directors have formed a judgement, at the time 
of approving the financial statements, that there is a reasonable 
expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate 
resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable 
future. For this reason, the Directors continue to adopt the 
going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
Independent Auditors
A resolution to reappoint PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as 
auditors to the Company and the Group will be proposed at  
the Annual General Meeting.

and the assumptions underpinning management’s valuation thereof. The 
Committee satisfied itself that the acquisition accounting was reasonable.
GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT REVIEWS
Management perform annual impairment reviews of the carrying value 
of goodwill. These impairment reviews are based on future projected 
cash flows and are therefore inherently judgmental. The Audit 
Committee reviewed the key judgements underpinning the impairment 
reviews performed.
The Committee is satisfied that the impairment recognised in the  
year is appropriate and that the remaining carrying value of goodwill  
is supportable.
INVENTORIES
The Committee reviewed management’s estimates in relation to 
inventory ageing and obsolescence.
The Committee was satisfied that the provisions made adequately 
reflected the risk of impairment.
EXCEPTIONAL ITEMS
The Committee considered the appropriateness of the measure 
of adjusted profits, quality of earnings, and the classification and 
transparency of items separately disclosed as Exceptional items.
The Committee was satisfied that the presentation of normalised profit 
before tax provides a reasonable view of the underlying performance of 
the Group and that there was transparent and consistent disclosure of 
items shown separately as Exceptional items.
External auditors
Under its terms of reference the Committee is responsible for 
assessing the scope, fee, objectivity and effectiveness of external 
audits and for making a recommendation to the Board regarding 
the appointment, reappointment or removal of the auditor on 
an annual basis.
In line with professional standards, the Company’s external 
auditor (PwC LLP) has a policy of rotating engagement partners 
every five years. As FY16 was the fifth audit overseen by Colin 
Bates, a new partner, Mark Ellis, was appointed to undertake 
the FY17 audit. 
The Committee also regularly reviews the nature, extent, 
objectivity and cost of non-audit services provided by the 
auditors. In doing this the Committee does not approve additional 
services which would compromise the auditors’ independence. 
The auditors are required to make a formal report to the Audit 
Committee on an annual basis on the safeguards that are in place 
to maintain their independence and the internal safeguards in 
place to ensure their objectivity. To ensure compliance with 
this policy, the Audit Committee reviewed and approved the 
remuneration received by PwC for the audit service, audit-related 
services and non-audit work.

REMUNERATION COMMITTEE REPORT
Introduction
It is an objective of the Group to attract and retain high calibre 
Directors and employees and reward them in a way which 
encourages the creation of value for shareholders.
The incentive and remuneration schemes employed by G&H were 
largely developed and introduced in 2013, and few changes have 
been made to the schemes since then. The Group’s market 
capitalisation has increased threefold in less than five years, 
during which time there have also been significant changes to 
governance expectations. Accordingly, the Remuneration 
Committee felt it appropriate to update our remuneration 
schemes during 2017, to which end the Committee engaged 
FIT Remuneration Consultants to assist the Committee with a 
review of the G&H remuneration policy for Executive Directors 
and other senior management. This review confirmed that our 
schemes continue to be appropriate and that they are in line with 
practise not just on AIM, but also among many FTSE SmallCaps 
on the Main Market. However, following the review it was felt 
appropriate to make some adjustments to the Annual Bonus 
and Long Term Incentive Plan criteria. None of these proposed 
changes require shareholder approval, although we have 
consulted with our major shareholders who have been supportive 
of the proposals. Further detail of the changes are given in the 
Remuneration Policy table on the following page.
The Committee values all feedback from shareholders and 
hopes to receive your support at the forthcoming AGM.
Operation of the Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee is chaired by Brian Phillipson 
and comprises all the non–executive directors. 
Although not a member of the committee, the Chief Executive 
Officer submits a report outlining proposals and is usually 
requested to present the report to the committee. After 
presenting the report he withdraws from the meeting and 
does not participate in the decision making or voting processes.
The Committee has three scheduled meetings each year to deal 
with ordinary business. In addition to these, the Committee 
meets on an ad hoc basis when there are additional matters to 
deal with. Brian Phillipson gives an update on the Remuneration 
Committee’s activities at each Board meeting.

bonus payments based on the achievement of Group profitability 
and cash targets. In addition, Executive Directors participate in 
a share option scheme and receive benefits in kind, including 
medical expenses and insurance. 
Non-executive directors are paid a fee to attend board meetings 
and to serve as members of the Audit, Nomination and 
Remuneration committees. Further payments may be made  
in respect of additional services provided at the request of  
the Company.
2017 performance Related Bonuses
Gooch & Housego has continued to perform well in 2017, 
delivering strong financial performance and continuing to 
make progress in its key strategic goals of diversification and 
moving up the value chain.
In terms of financial performance, adjusted profit before tax 
increased by 13.7% to £16.1m. Once again a strong cash 
performance resulted in the Group reporting a net cash position 
of £14.9m, after significant investment in property, plant and 
equipment, and a successful acquisition. The increasing strength 
of the balance sheet meant that the Company was able to 
recommend a 13.3% increase in the total dividend for the year.
Delivering growth through diversification within our sectors 
and by moving up the supply chain to provision of higher value 
offerings, as well as improvements in operational performance, 
have continued to be the principal strategic themes of the 
business. The trend towards a more balanced spread of business 
across the Company’s principal market sectors has continued. 
New product development at both the operational sites and 
within the Systems Technology Group continues to deliver with 
22 new products being launched in 2017. The business has made 
progress on its drive for operational efficiency, through its 
continued adoption of lean principles, as well as investments 
in plant, equipment, staff and processes.  
The Executive Directors’ 2017 bonus outcomes were 69% of 
maximum, reflecting the strong results for the year. 
Directors’ Pension Arrangements
During the year the Company contributed to a money purchase 
pension scheme on behalf of the executive
Directors. The number of Directors who are currently accruing 
benefits under a pension scheme is 2 (2016: 2). Contributions to 
a scheme on behalf of continuing Directors amount to 10% of the 
Director’s basic salary. Gareth Jones sacrificed part of his salary 
in exchange for increased company pension contributions, until 
the arrangement ceased on 31 August 2016. Mark Webster has 
sacrificed his entitlement to company pension scheme 
contributions in exchange for an increase to his salary of an 
equal amount. Alex Warnock and Andrew Boteler have both 
sacrificed part of their pension entitlement for an increase in 
salary of the same amount during the year.
Directors’ Contracts
The Executive Directors have rolling service contracts that are 
subject to either six or twelve months’ notice. The Chairman and 
non-executive Directors do not have contracts of service.
Exercises of Share Options by Directors
Exercises of share options under the Long Term Incentive 
Scheme by the Directors are summarised below. Gareth Jones’ 
exercises relate to L TIPs awarded to him during his tenure as 
an Executive Director.  He no longer holds any unvested or 
unexercised share options.

Shareholding Guidelines
Following the review during the year, formal Executive Director 
shareholding guidelines have been introduced. Executive 
Directors are required to acquire and maintain a qualifying interest 
in the ordinary shares of the company equivalent to 100% of 
base salary. For L TIPs granted in March 2017 and subsequent 
awards, the Directors will not be permitted to sell shares unless 
the specified shareholding has been achieved, other than sale of 
shares to satisfy tax obligations. For L TIPs granted in 2014 and 
2015, until the minimum holding is achieved the Directors are 
permitted to sell up to 50% of shares vesting, after sufficient 
have been sold to settle tax liabilities.
The Gooch & Housego 2013 Long Term Incentive Plan
The Gooch & Housego 2013 L TIP was adopted on 9 April 2013.  
Under the plan, awards will be made annually to key employees 
based on a percentage of salary or management grade. Subject 
to the satisfaction of the required TSR performance criteria and 
EPS financial performance, these grants will vest upon 
publication of the results of the Company three years after  
the grant date. The exercise price of all awards is nil.

that the Company will operate within the standard dilution limit 
of 10% of the Company’s issued share capital over a 10 year 
period, but excluding the dilution arising from the 2010 Value 
Creation Plan.
During the year to 30 September 2017, £587,000 (2016: 
£638,000) was charged to the income statement in respect of 
the IFRS 2 share based payments charge on all share option 
schemes (valued using the Monte Carlo option pricing model)

REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Report on the audit of the financial statements
Our Opinion
In our opinion, Gooch & Housego PLC’s Group financial 
statements and parent company financial statements (the 
“financial statements”):
•  give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the 
parent company’s affairs as at 30 September 2017 and of the 
Group’s profit and the Group’s and the parent company’s cash 
flows for the year then ended;
•  have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as 
adopted by the European Union and, as regards the parent 
company’s financial statements, as applied in accordance 
with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and
•  have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of 
the Companies Act 2006.
We have audited the financial statements, included within the 
Annual Report and Financial Statements (the “Annual Report”), 
which comprise: the Group and company balance sheets as at 
30 September 2017; the Group income statement and Group 
statement of comprehensive income, the Group and company 
cash flow statements, the notes to the Group and company cash 
flow statements, and the Group and company statements of 
changes in equity for the year then ended; and the notes to the 
Group and company financial statements, which include a 
description of the significant accounting policies.
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International 
Standards on Auditing (UK) (“ISAs (UK)”) and applicable law. 
Our responsibilities under ISAs (UK) are further described in 
the Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial 
statements section of our report. We believe that the audit 
evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to 
provide a basis for our opinion.
Independence
We remained independent of the Group in accordance with the 
ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial 
statements in the UK, which includes the FRC’s Ethical Standard, 
as applicable to listed entities, and we have fulfilled our other 
ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.
Our Audit Approach
Context
Gooch & Housego PLC is listed on the Alternative Investment 
Market (AIM) of the London Stock Exchange and its principal 
activities comprise the research, design, engineering and 
manufacture of advanced photonic systems, components and 
instruments in the Aerospace & Defence, Industrial, Life Sciences 
and Scientific Research sectors. It has operations across the 
USA and Europe. 
In February 2017, the Group completed the acquisition of 
StingRay Optics LLC in Keene, USA. The acquisition allows the 
business to further its strategic objective of broadening its 
product offering and diversifying its markets and follows two 
previous acquisitions in FY16. 
The Group’s strategic objectives remain the diversification of 
its product offering and moving up the value chain.  GOOCH & HOUSEGO PLC

Overview
Materiality
Audit scope
Key audit
matters
•  Overall Group materiality: £620,000 (2016: £635,000), based on 5% of profit 
before tax.
•  Overall parent company materiality: £122,000 (2016: £92,000), based on 5% of 
profit before tax.
•  The UK audit team performed an audit of the complete financial information 
of one operating unit in the USA (Gooch & Housego (Palo Alto) LLC and 
two operating units in the UK (Gooch & Housego (UK) Limited and Gooch & 
Housego (Torquay) Limited) as well as the Parent company based in the UK 
(Gooch & Housego PLC).
•  Additional procedures were also performed at a Group level over centralised 
processes and functions, including the audit of consolidation journals.
•  Taken together, these four reporting units (post consolidation entries) account 
for 87% of Group profit before tax. 
•  Specific audit procedures were also performed by the UK audit team on certain 
other balances and transactions and the remaining sixteen reporting units. 
In particular, additional detailed testing was performed on revenue at three 
reporting units in the USA (Gooch & Housego (Ohio) LLC, StingRay Optics LLC 
and EM4 Inc.). 
•  Valuation of goodwill and intangibles (Group) and investments (parent 
company) (Group and parent).
•  Acquisition accounting (Group). 
The scope of our audit
As part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and 
assessed the risks of material misstatement in the financial 
statements. In particular, we looked at where the directors made 
subjective judgements, for example in respect of significant 
accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and 
considering future events that are inherently uncertain. As in 
all of our audits we also addressed the risk of management 
override of internal controls, including evaluating whether there 
was evidence of bias by the directors that represented a risk of 
material misstatement due to fraud. 
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in the auditors’ 
professional judgement, were of most significance in the audit 
of the financial statements of the current year and include the 
most significant assessed risks of material misstatement 
(whether or not due to fraud) identified by the auditors, including 
those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; 
the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts 
of the engagement team. These matters, and any comments we 
make on the results of our procedures thereon, were addressed 
in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, 
and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a 
separate opinion on these matters. This is not a complete list 
of all risks identified by our audit.  GOOCH & HOUSEGO PLC

KEY AUDIT MATTER HOW OUR AUDIT ADDRESSED THE KEY AUDIT MATTER
Valuation of goodwill and intangibles 
(Group) and investments (parent company)
The assessment of the carrying value of 
goodwill and intangibles involves judgment 
and any impairment of the carrying value of 
such assets could have a material impact on 
the Group’s financial statements.
Similarly, the assessment of the carrying 
value of investments held involves judgment 
and any impairment of the carrying value of 
such assets could have a material impact on 
the parent company’s financial statements.
These are areas of continued focus for the 
audit to ensure that assets are valued 
correctly and not overstated in the context 
of the trading performance of the relevant 
cash generating units.
Group and parent
We examined management’s impairment assessment, auditing in detail the key underlying 
assumptions in the discounted cash flow models. 
We noted that a £0.6m impairment had been taken in relation to the Kent Periscopes business, 
the result of a poorer than expected first full year post acquisition. 
We met with management and key operational personnel to update our understanding of the various 
sites and considered the discounted cash flow models with reference to current performance. 
We assessed each of the key assumptions in turn and sensitised management’s model, which itself 
built in an element of sensitivity against budget, to reflect uncertainty in the future cash flows. 
We also compared key assumptions such as discount rate and long-term growth with market data 
in the UK and the US for reasonableness. 
Based on our work, we determined that the judgment of management that a £0.6m impairment was 
required at Kent Periscope was reasonable. We also concluded that the judgment that no further 
impairment was required at either this site or any other was also reasonable. We note however 
that goodwill and intangibles held remain sensitive to changes in key assumptions. In particular, a 
failure to achieve growth objectives for certain sites could give rise to an impairment in the 
future. Given this management has disclosed relevant sensitivities (see note 17). 
We assessed the appropriateness of the accounting and related disclosures included in the 
financial statements. These are deemed reasonable. 
Acquisition accounting
Acquisition accounting involves a number of 
judgements from management and is 
therefore a subjective area.
The risk is that the purchase price allocation 
(PPA) model may not reflect the true value of 
the acquisitions made, leading to 
misstatement in the financial statements.
Group
StingRay
We reviewed the underlying transactions, tested the fair value of the assets and liabilities 
acquired together with the intangible assets identified as part of the purchase price allocation 
and reviewed the disclosures in the financial statements.
There were no significant issues noted from our work. 
Included within the StingRay total consideration was $10m of deferred consideration payable 
based on performance over two earn out periods subsequent to the acquisition. 
Management have reassessed this deferred consideration at the balance sheet date. Based on 
the current activity within the business, historical growth rates and the latest forecasts for the 
business, management consider that both payments ($6.0m and $4.0m) will be made. 
We have reviewed the available information and based on our work consider that management’s 
judgment is reasonable.
Kent Periscopes
We note that a reassessment was also made of the deferred consideration associated with the 
acquisition of Kent Periscopes (acquired in 2016). Based on the current activity levels, historical 
performance and forecasts for the coming period, management concluded that the first earn out 
target would be missed, but the second would be achieved. 
A £0.6m adjustment was made to the deferred consideration, reflecting the amount no longer payable.
We have reviewed the available information and based on our work consider that the adjustment 
made is reasonable. Further, the decision to hold the remaining deferred consideration as due 
against the second earn out is deemed reasonable.

FINANCIAL ST A TEMENTS
How we tailored the audit scope
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed 
enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial 
statements as a whole, taking into account the structure of the 
Group and the parent company, the accounting processes and 
controls, and the industry in which they operate.
The Group comprises four divisions, being Industrial, Aerospace 
& Defence, Life Sciences and Scientific Research and we focused 
our audit work on the Group’s largest operating units, within 
these divisions, in the USA and UK. The UK audit team conducted 
an audit of the complete financial information of four operating 
units (the largest in the USA, the two largest in the UK and the 
Parent company based in the UK) due to their size and risk 
characteristics. In addition, procedures were performed at a 
Group level over centralised processes and functions, including 
the audit of consolidation journals.
Specific audit procedures were also performed by the UK team 
on certain balances and transactions material to the Group 
financial statements at the remaining reporting units. Taken 
altogether, these procedures gave us the evidence we needed 
for our opinion on the Group financial statements as a whole.
Materiality
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of 
materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality. 
These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to 
determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and 
extent of our audit procedures on the individual financial 
statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating the effect 
of misstatements, both individually and in aggregate on the 
financial statements as a whole. 
Based on our professional judgement, we determined 
materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:
Group financial statements Parent company financial statements
Overall materiality £620,000 (2016: £635,000). £122,000 (2016: £92,000).
How we determined it 5% of profit before tax. 5% of profit before tax.
Rationale for benchmark applied Based on the benchmarks used in the annual report 
and our understanding of the business, profit before 
tax is the primary measure used by the shareholders 
in assessing the performance of the Group, and is a 
generally acceptable auditing benchmark.
We believe that profit before tax is the primary 
measure used by the shareholders in assessing 
the performance of the entity, and is a generally 
accepted auditing benchmark.
For each component in the scope of our Group audit, we allocated 
a materiality that is less than our overall Group materiality. The 
range of materiality allocated across components was between 
£122,000 and £589,000. Certain components were audited to 
a local statutory audit materiality that was also less than our 
overall Group materiality.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to 
them misstatements identified during our audit above £31,000 
(Group audit) (2016: £31,750) and £6,100 (Parent company audit) 
(2016: £4,600) as well as misstatements below those amounts 
that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.
Conclusions Relating to Going Concern
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters 
in relation to which ISAs (UK) require us to report to you when: 
•  the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in 
the preparation of the financial statements is not 
appropriate; or 
•  the directors have not disclosed in the financial statements any 
identified material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt 
about the Group’s and parent company’s ability to continue to 
adopt the going concern basis of accounting for a period of at 
least twelve months from the date when the financial 
statements are authorised for issue.
However, because not all future events or conditions can be 
predicted, this statement is not a guarantee as to the Group’s 
and parent company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
Reporting on Other Information 
The other information comprises all of the information in the 
Annual Report other than the financial statements and our 
auditors’ report thereon. The directors are responsible for the 
other information. Our opinion on the financial statements does 
not cover the other information and, accordingly, we do not 
express an audit opinion or, except to the extent otherwise 
explicitly stated in this report, any form of assurance thereon. 
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our 
responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, 
consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent 
with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the 
audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we 
identify an apparent material inconsistency or material 
misstatement, we are required to perform procedures to conclude 
whether there is a material misstatement of the financial 
statements or a material misstatement of the other information. 
If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there 
is a material misstatement of this other information, we are 
required to report that fact. We have nothing to report based 
on these responsibilities.
REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOOCH & HOUSEGO PLC
46  |  ANNUAL REPORT 2017
FINANCIAL ST A TEMENTS
With respect to the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report, we 
also considered whether the disclosures required by the UK 
Companies Act 2006 have been included.  
Based on the responsibilities described above and our work 
undertaken in the course of the audit, ISAs (UK) require us also 
to report certain opinions and matters as described below.
Strategic Report and Directors’ Report
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the 
audit, the information given in the Strategic Report and Directors’ 
Report for the year ended 30 September 2017 is consistent with 
the financial statements and has been prepared in accordance 
with applicable legal requirements. 
In light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and 
parent company and their environment obtained in the course 
of the audit, we did not identify any material misstatements in 
the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report. 
Responsibilities for the Financial Statements and
the Audit
Responsibilities of the directors for the financial 
statements
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ 
Responsibilities set out on pages 31 and 32, the directors are 
responsible for the preparation of the financial statements in 
accordance with the applicable framework and for being satisfied 
that they give a true and fair view . The directors are also responsible 
for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable 
the preparation of financial statements that are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the directors are 
responsible for assessing the Group’s and the parent company’s 
ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing as applicable, 
matters related to going concern and using the going concern 
basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate 
the Group or the parent company or to cease operations, or have 
no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial 
statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether 
the financial statements as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an 
auditors’ report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance 
is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit 
conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a 
material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise 
from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or 
in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence 
the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these 
financial statements. 
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the 
financial statements is located on the FRC’s website at:  
www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description 
forms part of our auditors’ report.
Use of this report
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and 
only for the parent company’s members as a body in accordance 
with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no 
other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or 
assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other 
person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may 
come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
Other Required Reporting
Companies Act 2006 exception reporting
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to 
you if, in our opinion:
•  we have not received all the information and explanations 
we require for our audit; or
•  adequate accounting records have not been kept by the 
parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not 
been received from branches not visited by us; or
•  certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by 
law are not made; or
•  the parent company financial statements are not in 
agreement with the accounting records and returns. 
We have no exceptions to report arising from this 
responsibility. 
Other Voluntary Reporting
Directors’ remuneration
The parent company voluntarily prepares a Directors’ 
Remuneration Report in accordance with the provisions of the 
Companies Act 2006. The directors requested that we audit 
the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report specified by 
the Companies Act 2006 to be audited as if the parent 
company were a quoted company.
In our opinion, the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report 
to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with 
the CA06.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
For the year ended 30 September 2017
1. General information
Gooch & Housego PLC (the “Company”) is incorporated and 
domiciled in the United Kingdom. The Company is listed on the 
Alternative Investment Market (“AIM Market”) of the London 
Stock Exchange. The address of the registered office of the 
Company is given on page 89.
The consolidated financial statements of the Group for the year 
ended 30 September 2017 comprise the Company, Gooch & 
Housego PLC, and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the 
“Group”). A listing of the Company’s subsidiaries is set out on 
page 84.
The Group is a manufacturer of specialist optoelectronic 
components, materials and systems and specialist 
instrumentation and life sciences devices. The Group has 
facilities in the United Kingdom, Germany and the United States.
2. Basis of Preparation
These financial statements have been prepared under the 
historical cost convention as modified by financial assets and 
financial liabilities (including derivative instruments) at fair 
value and in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards as adopted by the European Union (“IFRS”) and IFRIC 
Interpretations in issue at 30 September 2017, and with those 
parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies 
preparing financial statements in accordance with IFRS. The 
financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.
3. Application of IFRS
Adoption of New Standards
There has been no material impact from the adoption of new 
standards or revised standards or interpretations which are 
relevant to the Group:
• Annual Improvements 2012-2014
•  Amendment to IAS16 “Property, plant and equipment” and 
IAS 38 “Intangible Assets” on depreciation and amortisation
•  Amendments to IAS27 “Separate financial statements” on 
equity accounting
•  Amendments to IFRS10 “Consolidated financial statements” 
and IAS28 “Investments in associates and joint ventures” on 
applying the consolidation exemption
•  Amendments to IAS1 “Presentation of financial statements” 
disclosure initiative
ISA (UK) 700 
ISA (UK) 700 “Forming an opinion and reporting on financial 
statements” applies to AIM listed entities for periods commencing 
on or after 17 June 2016. The form and content of the audit report 
contained within the financial statements has been extended.
The following standards will apply to the Group in future 
accounting periods:
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments 
This standard will apply for the first time in the year ending 30 
September 2019. Management do not currently envisage this 
standard having a material effect on the financial statements, 
because the Group does not currently utilise derivatives, although 
there may be some changes to the disclosure related to 
financial instruments.
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers 
IFRS15 will apply to the Group for the first time in the year ending 
30 September 2019. Management have been monitoring the 
potential effect of the Standard on the Group’s financial 
statements. The majority of the Group’s revenue is derived from 
sale of products, none of which have warranty terms extended 
beyond the standard for the industry. Because of this, 
management do not currently expect IFRS15 to have a material 
impact on the financial statements, but will continue to monitor 
this as the adoption date gets closer.
IFRS 16 Leases 
This new standard will apply to the Group for the first time in the 
year ending 30 September 2020. Following adoption of the 
standard, management expect all of the Group’s operating leases 
to be reclassified onto the balance sheet. This will entail the 
recognition of right of use assets and lease liabilities relating to 
existing operating leases, although we do not currently envisage 
a material effect on the Group’s net assets or profit before tax.
4. Accounting Policies
The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of 
the financial statements are set out below. The policies have 
been consistently applied to all of the years presented, unless 
otherwise stated.
Consolidation
Subsidiaries are entities that are directly or indirectly controlled by 
the Group. Control exists where the Group has the power to govern 
the financial and operating policies of the entity so as to obtain 
benefits from its activities. In assessing control, potential voting 
rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are taken 
into account.
The purchase method of accounting is used to account for the 
acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group. The cost of a business 
combination is measured as the fair value of the assets given, 
equity instruments issued, the fair value of contingent or deferred 
consideration and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of 
exchange. Costs directly attributable to the business combination 
are charged to the income statement. The excess of the costs of 
a business combination over the fair value of the identifiable net 
assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. If the cost of a business 
combination is less than the fair value of the net assets of the  GOOCH & HOUSEGO PLC
ANNUAL REPORT 2017  |  53
FINANCIAL ST A TEMENTS
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
For the year ended 30 September 2017
subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognised directly in the 
income statement. Should the fair value of contingent or deferred 
consideration vary from the actual value on settlement date, the 
difference is recognised directly in the income statement.
Where deferred consideration is payable in cash, the amount is 
discounted to present value at the date of acquisition, using the 
Group’s weighted average cost of capital. The financing charge 
which arises on the discounted consideration between the 
acquisition date and the date of payment is included within 
finance costs.
Transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions 
between Group companies are eliminated. Unrealised losses 
are also eliminated but considered an impairment indicator of 
the asset transferred. Accounting policies of subsidiaries have 
been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with 
the policies adopted by the Group.
Subsidiary audit Exemptions
Gooch & Housego (UK) Limited, Gooch & Housego (Torquay) 
Limited, Spanoptic Limited, Kent Periscopes Limited, G&H US 
Holdings Limited and G&H Property Holdings Limited are exempt 
from the requirement to file audited accounts by virtue of Section 
479A of the Companies Act 2006. 
Segment Reporting
A business segment is a grouping of operations engaged in 
providing products or services that are subject to risks and 
returns that are different from those of other business segments. 
A market segment is engaged in providing products or services 
within a particular economic environment that are subject to 
risks and returns which are different from those of segments 
operating in other economic environments.
The chief operating decision maker in determining a business 
or operating segment is the Board of Directors.
Foreign Currency Translation
a. Functional and presentation currency 
The consolidated financial statements are presented in 
Pounds Sterling, which is the Group’s presentation currency. 
Items included in the financial statements of each of the 
Group’s subsidiaries are measured using the currency of the 
primary economic environment in which the entity operates 
(the “functional currency”). 
b. Transactions and Balances 
Foreign currency transactions are translated into an entity’s 
functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the 
dates of the transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses 
resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from 
the translation at balance sheet exchange rates of monetary 
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are 
recognised in the income statement, except when deferred in 
equity as qualifying cash flow hedges and qualifying net 
investment hedges.
c. Subsidiaries 
The results and financial position of subsidiaries that have a 
functional currency different from the presentation currency 
are translated into the presentation currency as follows:
•  assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are 
translated at the closing rate at the date of that balance sheet;
•  income and expenses for each income statement are translated 
at average exchange rates (unless this average is not a 
reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates 
prevailing on the transaction dates, in which case income and 
expenses are translated at the rate on the dates of the 
transactions); and
•  all resulting exchange differences are recognised in other 
comprehensive income and as a separate component of equity.
On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the 
translation of the net investment in foreign operations, and  
of borrowings and other currency instruments designated as 
hedges of such investments, are taken to shareholders’ equity.  
When a foreign operation is partially disposed of or sold, 
exchange differences that were recorded in equity are 
recognised in the income statement as part of the gain or loss 
on sale.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition 
of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the 
foreign entity and translated at the closing rate.
Property, Plant and Equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost less 
depreciation. Historical cost includes expenditure that is directly 
attributable to the acquisition of the items.
No depreciation is charged on freehold land or capital work in 
progress. Certain plant used in the manufacturing process which 
is constructed from precious metals is not depreciated.
Depreciation on other assets is calculated to allocate their cost 
over their estimated useful lives, as follows:
• Freehold buildings                 2-3% Straight line
• Leasehold property over term of lease Straight line
• Plant and machinery  10-20% Straight line
• Fixtures, fittings and computers 10-33% Straight line
• Motor vehicles 25% Reducing balance GOOCH & HOUSEGO PLC
54  |  ANNUAL REPORT 2017
FINANCIAL ST A TEMENTS
The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and 
adjusted if appropriate, at each balance sheet date. Where an 
asset’s carrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable 
amount, the asset’s carrying amount is written down immediately 
to its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher 
of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell or an asset’s value in use.
Intangible Assets
a. Goodwill 
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of a business 
combination over the fair value of the net identifiable assets of 
the acquired business. Goodwill arising from business 
combinations is included in ‘intangible assets’. 
Goodwill is tested annually for impairment and carried at cost 
less accumulated impairment losses. The impairment testing 
requires an estimation of the ‘value in use’ of the Cash-generating 
unit (the “CGU”) to which goodwill is allocated using appropriately 
discounted cash flow projections. Any impairment is recognised 
immediately as an expense to the income statement and is not 
subsequently reversed.
For the purpose of impairment testing a CGU is defined as either 
a business segment or an operating entity, as appropriate. 
Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the 
carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold.
b. Patents, Trademarks and Licenses 
Internally incurred costs associated with the filing and perfection 
of patents and trademarks are capitalised and carried at cost less 
accumulated amortisation. Amortisation is calculated using the 
straight line method to allocate the cost over their useful 
economic lives and are charged to Research and Development 
in the income statement.
Acquired patents, trademarks and licences are shown at historical 
cost. Patents, trademarks and licences have a finite useful life and 
are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation. Amortisation 
is calculated using the straight line method to allocate the cost 
over their useful economic lives.
c. Computer Software 
Costs associated with developing or maintaining computer 
software programmes are recognised as an expense as incurred. 
Costs that are directly associated with the development of 
identifiable and unique software products controlled by the 
Group, and that will probably generate economic benefits 
exceeding costs beyond one year, are capitalised and recognised 
as intangible assets. Costs include the software development 
employee costs and an appropriate portion of relevant overheads. 
Acquired computer software and licences are capitalised on 
the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring to use the 
specific software.
Capitalised software costs are amortised using the straight 
line method over their estimated useful lives of up to 5 years 
and charged to Administration in the income statement.
d. Research and Development 
Expenditure on research activities, undertaken with the 
prospect of gaining new scientific or technical knowledge  
and understanding, is recognised as an expense as incurred.
Development costs incurred after the point at which the 
commercial and technical feasibility of the product have been 
proven, and the decision to complete the development has 
been taken and resources made available, are capitalised. The 
expenditure capitalised includes the cost of materials, direct 
labour and an appropriate proportion of overheads.  
Capitalised development expenditure is stated at cost less 
accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. Development 
costs are amortised using the straight line method over their 
estimated useful life lives, which is typically 5 years, and are 
charged to Research and Development in the income statement.
e. Acquired Intangibles 
Other acquired intangible assets are stated at fair value less 
accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. 
The useful life of each of these assets is assessed based on 
the differing natures of each of the intangible assets acquired.  
Amortisation is charged on a straight-line basis over the 
estimated useful life of the assets acquired and charged to 
administration in the Income Statement.
• Customer relationships up to 10 years
• Brand names up to 10 years
• Acquired patents, trademarks and licences up to 3 years
Government Grants 
Government grants are accounted for on an accruals basis.  Grants 
are credited to the income statement over the life of the project. 
Where grants are used to fund the acquisition of property, plant 
and equipment, the grant is initially credited to deferred income 
then credited to the income statement over the estimated 
economic life of the asset.
Impairment of Non-financial Assets 
The Group assesses at each balance sheet date whether an 
asset may be impaired. If any such indicator exists, the Group 
tests for impairment by estimating the recoverable amount 
which is the higher of the value in use and the fair value less 
costs to sell. If the recoverable amount is less than the carrying 
value of the asset, the asset is impaired and the carrying value 
is reduced to its recoverable amount. In addition to this, assets 
with indefinite lives are tested for impairment annually. 
Non-financial assets other than goodwill which have suffered 
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
For the year ended 30 September 2017 GOOCH & HOUSEGO PLC
ANNUAL REPORT 2017  |  55
FINANCIAL ST A TEMENTS
an impairment are reviewed for possible reversal of the 
impairment at each balance sheet date. 
Loans and Receivables 
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with 
fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active 
market. They are included in current assets, except those with 
maturities greater than 12 months from the balance sheet date. 
These are classified as non-current assets. Loans and receivables 
are classified as trade and other receivables in the balance sheet.
Inventories 
Inventories are stated at the lower of weighted average cost 
and net realisable value. The cost of finished goods and work in 
progress comprises design costs, raw materials, direct labour, 
other direct costs and related production overheads (based on 
normal operating capacity). It excludes borrowing costs. Net 
realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary 
course of business, less applicable variable selling expenses.
Long term contract balances included in work in progress comprise 
costs incurred on long term contracts, net of any amounts 
transferred to trading expenditure, after deducting foreseeable 
losses and related payments on account. Costs include all direct 
material and labour costs incurred in bringing a contract to its state 
of completion at the year end. Provisions for estimated losses 
on contracts are made in the period in which such losses are 
foreseen. Long term contract balances do not include attributable 
profit. The amount by which customer billings exceed the revenue 
recognised on a contract is shown as a payment on account.
Trade Receivables 
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and 
subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective 
interest method, less provision for impairment. 
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established 
when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able 
to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the 
receivables. Significant financial difficulties of the debtor, 
probability that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or financial 
reorganisation, and default or delinquency in payments (more 
than 30 days overdue) are considered indicators that the trade 
receivable may be impaired. 
The amount of the provision is the difference between the asset’s 
carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash 
flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate. The 
carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of an 
allowance account, and the amount of the loss is recognised in 
the income statement within ‘Administration costs’. When a 
trade receivable is uncollectible, it is written off against the 
allowance account for trade receivables. Subsequent recoveries 
of amounts previously written off are credited against 
‘Administration costs’ in the income statement.
Cash and Cash Equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the cash flow 
statement includes cash in hand and deposits held on call with 
banks with original maturities of three months or less.
Trade Payables 
Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and 
subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective 
interest method.
Borrowings 
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction 
costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised 
cost; any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction 
costs) and the redemption value is recognised in the income 
statement over the period of the borrowings using the 
effective interest method.
Borrowing costs which are directly attributable to the acquisition, 
construction or production of a qualifying asset are capitalised 
as part of the cost of that asset.
Borrowing costs are classified as current liabilities unless the 
Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the 
liability for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date.
Financial Instruments 
Financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on 
the date that a contract is entered into and are subsequently 
remeasured at their fair value. The Group documents the 
relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged 
item and, on a periodic basis, assesses whether the hedge  
is effective.
Current and Deferred Income Tax 
Income tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current 
and deferred tax.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income 
for the year using rates enacted at the balance sheet date, and 
any adjustments to tax payable in respect of prior years.
Amounts claimed under the RDEC scheme have been 
recognised within operating profit. 
Deferred income tax is provided in full, using the liability method, 
on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets 
and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated 
financial statements. However, the deferred income tax is not 
accounted for, if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or 
liability in a transaction other than a business combination 
that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting 
nor taxable profit or loss. 
Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) 
that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance 
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

56  |  ANNUAL REPORT 2017
FINANCIAL ST A TEMENTS
sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred 
income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability 
is settled.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised to the extent that it 
is probable that future taxable profit will be available against 
which the temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising 
on investments in subsidiaries, except where the timing of the 
reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group 
and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse 
in the foreseeable future.
Deferred income tax is recognised in the income statement 
except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly 
in other comprehensive income and equity, in which case it is 
recognised in other comprehensive income and equity.
In the UK and US, the Company is entitled to a tax deduction for 
amounts treated as compensation on exercise of certain 
employee share options under each jurisdiction’s tax rules. As 
explained under “Share options” below, a compensation expense 
is recorded in the Company’s income statement over the period 
from the grant date to the vesting date of the relevant options. 
As there is a temporary difference between the accounting and 
tax bases, a deferred income tax asset is recorded. The deferred 
income tax asset arising is calculated by comparing the estimated 
amount of tax deduction to be obtained in the future (based on 
the Company’s share price at the balance sheet date) with the 
cumulative amount of the compensation recorded in the income 
statement. If the amount of estimated future tax deduction 
exceeds the cumulative amount of the remuneration expense 
at the statutory rate, the excess is recorded directly in equity.
Employee benefits
a. Pension Obligations 
The Group operates money purchase pension schemes for UK 
employees and Section 401(k) plans for US employees. The 
Group pays contributions to publicly or privately administered 
pension insurance plans on a mandatory , contractual or voluntary 
basis. The Group has no further payment obligations once the 
contributions have been paid. The contributions are recognised 
as an employee benefit expense in the income statement when 
they are due. Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset 
to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in the future 
payments is available. 
b. Profit Share and Bonus Plans 
The Group recognises a liability and an expense for bonuses 
and profit-sharing, based on a formula that takes into 
consideration the profit attributable to the Group’s shareholders 
after certain adjustments. The Group recognises a provision 
where contractually obliged or where there is a past practice 
that has created a constructive obligation.
c. Share Options 
The Group operates a number of share option schemes. In 
accordance with IFRS 2 the fair value of the employee services 
received in exchange for the grant of the options is recognised as 
an expense in the income statement. The total amount to be 
expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to 
the fair value of the options granted, excluding the impact of any 
non-market vesting conditions (for example, profitability targets). 
Non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions 
about the number of options that are expected to vest. 
Employer’s National Insurance in the United Kingdom and 
equivalent taxes in other jurisdictions are payable on the exercise 
of certain share options. In accordance with IFRS 2, this is treated 
as a cash-settled transaction. A provision is made, calculated 
using the fair value of the Company’s shares at the balance sheet 
date, pro-rated over the vesting period of the options.  
At each balance sheet date, for awards with non market vesting 
conditions, the entity revises its estimates of the number of 
options that are expected to vest. It recognises the impact of the 
revision to original estimates, if any, in the income statement, 
with a corresponding adjustment to equity. The fair value of 
the options under the Gooch & Housego 2013 Long Term 
Incentive Plan are determined by using the Monte Carlo option 
pricing model.
The proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction 
costs are credited to share capital (nominal value) and share 
premium when the options are exercised.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or 
constructive obligation as a result of past events; it is probable 
that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the 
obligation; and the amount has been reliably estimated.
The Group monitors and assesses its warranty provision 
requirement on a continuing basis. The provision for other 
liabilities and charges provides for the anticipated cost of repair 
and rectification of products under warranty, based on historical 
repair and replacement costs. In addition the Directors will also 
assess expected changes in future costs based on current 
information.
Exceptional Items
T ransactions are classified as exceptional where they relate to an 
event that falls outside the ordinary activities of the business 
and where individually or in aggregate they have a material 
impact on the financial statements. 
Leases
Leases which transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of 
ownership of an asset are treated as a finance lease. Assets 
held under a finance lease are capitalised at their fair value at 
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
For the year ended 30 September 2017 GOOCH & HOUSEGO PLC
ANNUAL REPORT 2017  |  57
FINANCIAL ST A TEMENTS
the inception of the lease and depreciated over the estimated 
useful economic life of the asset or lease term if shorter.
Finance charges are associated with the finance lease are 
expensed in proportion to the capital amount outstanding.
All other leases are classified as operating leases. Operating 
lease rentals are expensed in equal annual amounts over the 
lease term.
Share Capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. 
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares 
or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from 
the proceeds.
Revenue Recognition
Revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received 
or receivable for the sale of goods and services in the ordinary 
course of the Group’s activities. Revenue is shown net of 
value-added tax, returns, rebates and discounts and after 
eliminating sales within the Group.
The Group recognises revenue when the amount of revenue can 
be reliably measured, it is probable that future economic benefits 
will flow to the entity and when specific criteria have been met 
for each of the Group’s activities as described below. The amount 
of revenue is not considered to be reliably measurable until all 
contingencies relating to the sale have been resolved.
a. Sale of Goods 
Revenue is recognised when the risks and rewards of the 
underlying sale have been transferred to the customer, and when 
collectability of the related receivable is reasonably assured.  
Depending on the terms of business, this occurs either on the 
dispatch/delivery of the goods supplied or on acceptance by 
the customer.
b. Long Term Contracts 
Revenue is recognised on long term contracts by reference to 
the stage of completion of the contract activity at the balance 
sheet date. Revenue and profits are determined by estimating 
the outcome of the contract and determining the costs and 
profit attributable to the stage of completion.
Where the outcome of the contract cannot be reliably estimated, 
contract costs are recognised as an expense when incurred and 
revenue is recognised to the extent of the costs incurred that 
are expected to be recoverable.  In both cases, any expected 
contract loss is recognised immediately.
c. Interest Income 
Interest income is recognised on a time-proportion basis using 
the effective interest method.
Dividend distribution
Dividend distributions to the Company’s shareholders are 
recognised as a liability in the Group’s financial statements  
in the period in which the dividends are approved by the 
Company’s shareholders.
5. Financial Risk Management
Capital Risk Management
Management considers capital as equity, as shown in the 
Group balance sheet, excluding net cash.
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard 
the Group’s ability 
• to continue as a going concern, 
•  to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other 
stakeholders and 
•  to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost  
of capital.
The Board is satisfied that these objectives have been met 
during the year. Actions taken during the year to achieve these 
objectives are outlined in the Chief Executive Officer’s Review. 
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may
• adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders,
• return capital to shareholders,
• issue new shares,
• sell assets to reduce debt and
• vary the level of debt financing.
While the Group’s debt to equity ratio is consistently monitored, 
changes in the Group’s need for capital and the selection of the 
source and funding of capital are assessed against a number 
of criteria which may have a direct effect on the Group debt to 
equity ratio. 
The Group’s capital needs include, but are not solely limited to, its
• investment in non-current assets;
• investment in working capital; and
•  acquisition of businesses, technologies and other intangible 
assets.
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
For the year ended 30 September 2017 GOOCH & HOUSEGO PLC
58  |  ANNUAL REPORT 2017
FINANCIAL ST A TEMENTS
The criteria against which the Group’s capital needs are 
assessed include, but are not limited to, 
• availability of and cost of debt financing;
• ability to raise equity financing at an acceptable share price; and
• ratio of debt to equity. 
Financial Risks
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: 
market risk (including foreign exchange risk and cash flow interest 
rate risk), credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Group’s overall risk management programme focuses on 
the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise 
potential adverse effects on the Group’s financial performance.  
Where considered appropriate, the Company will use derivative 
financial instruments to hedge risk exposures, although no 
such arrangements were in place during the year ended 30 
September 2017 or 2016.
i. Market risk 
a. Foreign exchange risk 
The Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign 
exchange risk arising from various currency exposures, 
primarily with respect to the US Dollar. 
Foreign exchange risk arises from 
• future commercial transactions;
• recognised assets and liabilities; and
• net investments in foreign operations.
The Group has certain investments in foreign operations, whose 
net assets are exposed to foreign currency translation risk. 
Currency exposure arising from the net assets of the Group’s 
foreign operations is managed primarily through borrowings 
denominated in the relevant foreign currencies. 
No financial derivatives have been entered into to manage 
foreign exchange exposure.
As a significant amount of the Group’s profit is earned by its US 
subsidiaries, the Group’s profit is sensitive to movements in the 
US Dollar exchange rate. If the average US Dollar exchange rate 
for the year had been consistent with the closing exchange rate 
at 30 September 2016, with all other variables constant, post tax 
profits for the year would have been £123,000 lower (2016: 
£447,000 lower) as a result of the translation in US Dollars.  
Equity is more sensitive to movement in the US Dollar exchange 
rate as a significant amount of the Group’s net assets are held in 
the Group’s US subsidiaries. If the US Dollar weakened by 10% 
against Pound Sterling with all other variables held constant, 
the net assets of the Group would be £1,953,000 lower (2016: 
£1,821,000 lower). If the US Dollar strengthened by 10% against 
Pound Sterling with all other variables held constant, the net 
assets of the Group would be £2,388,000 higher (2016: 
£2,226,000 higher).
b. Cash flow interest rate risk 
The Group has cash balances of £26.4m which are held in interest 
bearing current accounts. The Group’s income and operating 
cash flows are substantially independent of changes in market 
interest rates.
The Group’s interest rate risk arises from its revolving credit 
facility. A 1% increase in the cost of borrowing would have 
resulted in an annualised increase in interest expense of 
£146,000 (2016: £68,000) had the Group’s borrowings been 
in place throughout the year.
Borrowings issued at variable interest rates expose the Group to 
cash flow interest rate risk. During 2016 and 2017, the Group’s 
borrowings at variable interest rates were denominated in 
Pound Sterling and US Dollars as detailed in Note 22.
ii. Credit Risk 
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer 
or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its 
contractual obligations. It arises principally from the Group’s 
trade receivables.
a. Trade and other receivables 
The management of credit risk exposure is the responsibility of 
each business unit which has credit policies in place to mitigate 
the risk. The credit policies seek to verify a customer’s credit 
worthiness prior to trading and maintain the level of trading 
within agreed credit limits.  Changes to credit limits require 
authorisation in accordance with internal control policies.
The Group is exposed to concentration of credit risk. The Group’s 
top ten customers in 2017 accounted for 25% of the Group’s 
revenue (2016: 26%). No individual customer made up more 
than 6% of revenue in either the current or prior year. 
The Group’s trade receivables are analysed in note 19.
b. Cash 
Cash is held in current and deposit accounts with financial 
institutions which have credit ratings of A- or greater.

FINANCIAL ST A TEMENTS
iii. Liquidity Risk 
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet 
its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group aims to 
achieve a balance between certainty of funding and a flexible, 
cost effective borrowing structure.
The Company’s facilities comprise a committed revolving credit 
facility of $15m of which $8m is drawn and an uncommitted 
flexible acquisition facility of $20m of which $7.5m is drawn. 
Both are available until 30 April 2019. These are analysed in 
Notes 22 and 29. 
The Group aims to ensure that there are sufficient funds or credit 
lines available to supplement cash flows generated from trading 
to meet known obligations in the next twelve months.
6. Critical accounting estimates and judgments
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) requires the 
Directors to make critical accounting estimates and judgments 
that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements 
and accompanying notes. These estimates and judgments are 
continually evaluated and are based on historical experiences 
and other factors, including expectations of future events that 
are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The 
resulting accounting estimates will on occasions fail to equal 
actual results.
The estimates and assumptions that have significant risk of 
causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets 
and liabilities within the next financial year are outlined below.
Impairment of Goodwill
The Group tests goodwill for impairment at least annually. This 
requires an estimation of the value in use of the Cash Generating 
Units (the “CGUs”) to which goodwill is allocated. The value in 
use calculations are based on forecast cash flows of the CGU 
discounted at the Group’s weighted average cost of capital. These 
calculations have a number of significant variables including 
forecast revenue and margins, working capital movements and 
maintenance capital expenditure levels. The calculations are also 
sensitive to the discount rate used. Further details are given in 
note 17.
Accounting for Acquisitions
An assessment of the fair value of the purchase consideration 
and net assets acquired has been undertaken in respect of the 
acquisition of StingRay Optics LLC. Determining the fair value 
of the consideration involves an estimate of the deferred 
consideration payable, which is dependent on post-acquisition 
performance, and therefore inherently uncertain. Intangible 
assets relating to customer relationships, the order book and 
the brand have been recognised based on an estimate of the 
future cash flows to be derived from those assets.
Inventory Provision
The Group continually monitors and assesses the provision for 
old and slow moving inventory. Factors considered by the 
Directors include the expected future usage and the potential 
obsolescence and deterioration of the Inventory.

costs, provision for export compliance risk and transaction fees in the above analysis. This has been shown because the Directors 
consider the analysis to be more meaningful excluding the impact of these non-recurring expenses.

Factors Affecting the Future Tax Charge
Overseas tax losses of £3.7m (2016: £3.8m) and UK tax losses of £0.8m (2016: £0.8m) are available against future profits of the 
Group. The utilisation of these losses is not sufficiently certain to recognise a deferred tax asset. 
Changes to the UK corporation tax rates were substantively enacted as part of the Finance Act 2016 in September 2016. These included 
the replacement of the 18% rate from 1 April 2020 with a lower rate of 17%. To date, no further changes have been announced. 
The Group operates internationally; as a result, it is subject to various overseas tax rules and regulations. A change in the assessment 
of their implementation could result in an increase in G&H’s liability, though no such change is currently considered necessary.

Goodwill is allocated to operating sites as follows: Cleveland (£2.1m), Ilminster (£1.5m), Torquay (£1.6m), Moorpark (£6.2m), 
Boston (£4.9m), Palo Alto (£0.9m), St Asaph (£4.0m) and Keene (£5.7m). 
Goodwill is tested annually for impairment and carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. The impairment testing requires 
an estimation of the ‘value in use’ of the CGU. The value in use calculations use post-tax cash flow projections based on the latest 
projections approved by the Board for year one. For the purposes of the impairment review, the following key assumptions were 
made in respect of the cash flows beyond year one:
• Projected gross profit margins of 22% to 44%
• Average growth in EBITDA to 2022 of up to 10%, and 2% thereafter
• 8.3% post tax discount rate used to discount cash flows
The projected gross profit margin and average growth is based on past performance and the Directors’ expectations for the 
foreseeable future.  
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
For the year ended 30 September 2017 GOOCH & HOUSEGO PLC
ANNUAL REPORT 2017  |  69
FINANCIAL ST A TEMENTS
The Boston cash generating unit’s performance improved significantly over FY16, reflecting the effect of the Alfalight acquisition 
in the prior year, and improved sales of the Boston site’s existing products and services. Management expect the new combined 
business to continue to grow profitably and it remains a key part of the Group’s Space Photonics activities. The impairment 
calculation for the Boston cash generating unit utilises a specific set of growth assumptions based on revenue increasing by an 
average of 6% per annum in the period to 30 September 2022, which results in an average annual forecast EBITDA of £1.5m over 
the same period. Management do not consider any impairment of goodwill to have arisen in the year because of the significantly 
improved result and the growth opportunities of the new enlarged business. If the discount rate were increased to 9.7%, or if the 
average annual EBITDA were reduced by £0.3m, the headroom on the impairment calculation would be reduced to zero. 
The impairment calculation for the Moorpark cash generating unit is based on an average annual forecast EBITDA to 2022 of £1.2m. 
The headroom on the calculation (of £2.1m) would be reduced to zero if the average annual EBITDA to 2022 were reduced by £0.3m 
or the discount rate increased to 9.4%. The Directors are satisfied that no impairment is necessary.
Kent Periscopes’ performance in the year was lower than the targets set for the deferred consideration which was potentially payable 
in the year. Accordingly, a release of the accrued contingent consideration of £0.6m has been credited to the income statement. 
Management performed an impairment review of the goodwill based on an average annual EBITDA to 2022 of £0.7m. Following this 
review, the Directors consider it appropriate to impair the goodwill by £0.6m. If the discount rate were increased to 9.3%, then a 
further impairment of £1.0m would arise. However, the Directors expect a significant improvement in the results going forward, and 
are therefore satisfied no further impairment is necessary.

Overseas tax losses of £3.7m (2016: £3.8m) and UK tax losses of £0.8m (2016: £0.8m) are available to offset against future 
profits of the Group. The Group has not recognised a deferred income tax asset of £1.4m (2016: £1.4m) in respect of these losses 
due to uncertainty as to whether they would be utilised within the foreseeable future.
No deferred tax has been provided in relation to unremitted earnings from overseas subsidiaries on the basis that no incremental 
tax charge is currently anticipated to arise upon remittance of these earnings to the UK.

27. Share Options 
The Company operates the Gooch & Housego 2013 Long Term Incentive Plan (the “2013 L TIP”).
The Gooch & Housego 2013 Long Term Incentive Plan
The Gooch & Housego 2013 Long Term Incentive Plan was adopted on 9 April 2013. Under the plan, awards are made annually 
to key employees based on a percentage of salary. Subject to the satisfaction of the required TSR performance criteria and EPS 
financial performance, these grants will vest upon publication of the results of the Company three years after the grant date. 
There have been five grants of options under the 2013 Long Term Incentive Plan. The remuneration report provides further details 
on the share options awarded and exercised during the financial year. 
The 2013 Long Term Incentive Plan Awards were valued using the Monte Carlo option pricing model. The expected volatility used 
in the model was based on the historical volatility of the Company’s share price over the three years prior to the grant date.  
The details of awards extant as at 30 September 2017 are summarised below:
Grant date
10 Mar 2017 23 Dec 2015 17 Dec 2014
No. of options granted 133,146 147,458 260,193

The weighted average fair value of options granted in the year was 589.0p per option (2016: 427.0p per option). For the options 
exercised, the average market price was 1,238.0p per share.
Share options outstanding at the end of the year have the following expiry dates and exercise prices:

32. Acquisition of StingRay Optics LLC
On 21 February 2017, the Group completed the acquisition of the entire unit capital of StingRay Optics LLC, a Keene, New Hampshire, 
based specialist designer and manufacturer of high performance optical and opto-mechanical subsystems for demanding defence 
and commercial applications. The acquisition strengthened the Group’s position in the aerospace & defence sector.
The consideration for the acquisition will be up to $20m comprising initial consideration of $7.5m paid in cash and $2.5m paid in new 
G&H ordinary shares. There is also deferred contingent consideration of up to $10m, payable in cash, based on the performance of 
the business for a period of up to three years post acquisition. 
The fair value of the assets acquired is summarised as follows:
Provisional fair value 
£’000
Property, plant and equipment 98
Intangible assets 7,986
Cash 231
Trade and other receivables 655
Inventory 1,058
Trade and other payables (1,274)
Current and deferred tax assets 156
Net assets acquired 8,910
Consideration paid:
Cash and shares paid on completion 7,996
Deferred consideration 7,013
Goodwill 6,099
The fair value of the intangible assets represents the estimated fair value of StingRay’s order book, its customer relationships and 
its brand. These have been valued using a discounted cash flow model. The deferred consideration has been discounted using the 
company’s weighted average cost of capital. 
The goodwill arising on acquisition reflects items not separately recognised, including the expertise of StingRay’s employees and 
their contacts in target markets.
Post-acquisition, the acquired business contributed £5.3 million of revenue and £1.0 million of profit after tax to the consolidated 
income statement.
33. Post Balance Sheet Events
In October 2017 the Company concluded a legal dispute with the landlord of its Fremont facility. As a result of this, a Californian 
court has awarded G&H in the region of $2 million in damages arising from the landlord’s non-performance in respect of the lease.

NOTES TO THE COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
For the year ended 30 September 2017
1. Company Accounting Policies
Basis of Preparation
These financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention as modified by financial assets and liabilities 
(including derivative financial instruments) at fair value and in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted 
by the European Union (“IFRS”) and IFRIC interpretations in issue at 30 September 2017, and with those parts of the Companies 
Act 2006 applicable to companies preparing financial statements in accordance with IFRS. The financial statements have been 
prepared on a going concern basis. 
The accounting policies have been consistently applied over the period reported.
Adoption of New Standards
There has been no material impact from the adoption of new standards or revised standards or interpretations which are relevant 
to the Group:
• Annual Improvements 2012-2014
• Amendment to IAS16 “Property, plant and equipment” and IAS 38 “Intangible Assets” on depreciation and amortization
• Amendments to IAS27 “Separate financial statements” on equity accounting
•  Amendments to IFRS10 “Consolidated financial statements” and IAS28 “Investments in associates and joint ventures” on 
applying the consolidation exemption
•  Amendments to IAS1 “Presentation of financial statements” disclosure initiative
The following standard will apply to the Company in future accounting periods:
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments
This standard will apply for the first time in the year ending 30 September 2019. Management do not currently envisage this 
standard having a material effect on the financial statements. 
Pension Schemes
The Company operates a money purchase pension scheme for Directors and staff. The assets of the scheme are held in separately 
administered funds. Contributions are recognised as an employee benefit expense in the income statement when they are due. 
Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in the future payments is available. 
Share Options
The Company operates a number of share option schemes. In accordance with IFRS 2 the fair value of the employee services received in 
exchange for the grant of the options is recognised as an expense in the income statement. The total amount to be expensed over the 
vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the options granted, excluding the impact of any non-market vesting 
conditions (for example, profitability targets). Non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of 
options that are expected to vest. 
Employer’s National Insurance in the United Kingdom and equivalent taxes in other jurisdictions are payable on the exercise of certain 
share options. In accordance with IFRS 2, this is treated as a cash-settled transaction. A provision is made, calculated using the fair 
value of the Company’s shares at the balance sheet date, pro-rated over the vesting period of the options.  
At each balance sheet date, for awards with non market vesting conditions, the entity revises its estimates of the number of options 
that are expected to vest. It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in the income statement, with a 
corresponding adjustment to equity. The fair value of the options under the Gooch & Housego 2013 Long Term Incentive Plan are 
determined by using the Monte Carlo option pricing model.
The proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs are credited to share capital (nominal value) and share 
premium when the options are exercised.
Foreign Currency Translation
a. Functional and presentation currency 
The financial statements are presented in Pounds Sterling, which is the Company’s presentation currency.   GOOCH & HOUSEGO PLC
82  |  ANNUAL REPORT 2017
FINANCIAL ST A TEMENTS
b. Transactions and balances 
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the 
transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at 
balance sheet exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income 
statement, except when deferred in equity as qualifying cash flow hedges and qualifying net investment hedges.
Property, Plant and Equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at historical purchase cost less accumulated depreciation. Cost includes expenditure that 
is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items. No depreciation is charged on freehold land or capital work in progress. 
Depreciation on other assets is calculated to allocate their cost over their estimated useful lives, as follows: 
• Freehold buildings  2-3% Straight line
• Plant and machinery  10-20% Straight line
• Fixtures, fittings and computers 10-33% Straight line
• Capitalised software and licences 25-33% Straight line
Investments 
Investments are stated at cost less provision for any impairment in value. Where overseas borrowing is required to finance the 
investment in overseas subsidiaries, the investment is retranslated at the exchange rate ruling at the balance sheet date.
Deferred Tax
Deferred income tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets 
and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements. However, the deferred income tax is not accounted 
for, if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the 
transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss. 
Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet 
date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against 
which the temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, except where the timing of the 
reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in 
the foreseeable future.
Deferred income tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in other 
comprehensive income and equity, in which case it is recognised in other comprehensive income and equity.
In the UK and US, the Company is entitled to a tax deduction for amounts treated as compensation on exercise of certain employee 
share options under each jurisdiction’s tax rules. As explained under “Share options” below, a compensation expense is recorded in the 
Company’s income statement over the period from the grant date to the vesting date of the relevant options. As there is a temporary 
difference between the accounting and tax bases, a deferred income tax asset is recorded. The deferred income tax asset arising is 
calculated by comparing the estimated amount of tax deduction to be obtained in the future (based on the Company’s share price 
at the balance sheet date) with the cumulative amount of the compensation recorded in the income statement. If the amount of 
estimated future tax deduction exceeds the cumulative amount of the remuneration expense at the statutory rate, the excess is 
recorded directly in equity.
Trade Payables
T rade payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events; it is probable 
that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation; and the amount has been reliably estimated.
Dividend Distribution
Dividend distributions to the Company’s shareholders are recognised as a liability in the Group’s financial statements in the period

Factors Affecting the Future Tax Charge
UK tax losses of £0.8m (2016: £0.8m) are available against future profits of the Group. The utilisation of these losses is not sufficiently 
certain to recognise a deferred tax asset. 
Changes to the UK corporation tax rates were substantively enacted as part of the Finance Act 2016 in September 2016. These included 
the replacement of the 18% rate from 1 April 2020 with a lower rate of 17%. To date, no further changes have been announced.

control laws, which were voluntarily disclosed to the relevant authorities after having been identified by an internal review. This

12. Share Options
The Company operates the Gooch & Housego 2013 Long Term Incentive Plan (the “2013 L TIP”).
The Gooch & Housego 2013 Long Term Incentive Plan
The Gooch & Housego 2013 Long Term Incentive Plan was adopted on 9 April 2013. Under the plan, awards are made annually to key 
employees based on a percentage of salary or management grade. Subject to the satisfaction of the required TSR performance criteria 
and EPS financial performance, these grants will vest upon publication of the results of the Company three years after the grant date.
There have been five grants of options under the 2013 Long Term Incentive Plan. The remuneration report provides further details 
on the share options awarded and exercised during the financial year.
The 2013 Long Term Incentive Plan Awards were valued using the Monte Carlo option pricing model. The expected volatility used in 
the model was based on the historical volatility of the Company’s share price over the three years prior to the grant date.  
Details of awards extant as at 30 September 2017 are summarised below:
Grant date
10 Mar 2017 23 Dec 2015 17 Dec 2014
No. of options granted 133,146 147,458 260,193

Risk free rate 0.9% 0.9% 0.8%
Fair value (£) 784,041 629,506 878,475

The weighted average fair value of options granted in the year was 589.0p per option (2016: 427.0p per option). For the options 
exercised, the average market price was 1,238.0p per share.
Share options outstanding at the end of the year have the following expiry dates and exercise prices:

share based payment transactions. 
13. Related Party Disclosures
The company recharges certain costs and provides financing to its subsidiaries in the ordinary course of business. The closing balances 
due from and to the subsidiary companies are shown in notes 8 and 10 respectively.

SHAREHOLDER INFORMA TION
1   Explanatory note on Resolution 2: Resolution 2 is an advisory vote 
only. The Remuneration Committee Report is set out on pages 37 to 
41 of the Annual Report and Financial Statements for the financial 
year ended 30 September 2017. Pages 37, 39, 40 and 41 of the 
Remuneration Committee Report set out the pay and benefits 
received by each of the directors for the year ended 30 September 
2017. The Company’s policy on remuneration and potential pay outs 
to directors in the future, which is set out on page 38 of the Annual 
Report and Financial Statements for the financial year ended 30 
September 2017, is specifically excluded from this Resolution.
2  Resolutions 1 to 12 (inclusive) are proposed as Ordinary Resolutions. 
This means that for those resolutions to be passed, more than half 
of the votes cast on such resolutions must be in favour of such 
resolutions. Resolutions 13 and 14 are proposed as Special Resolutions. 
This means that for those resolutions to be passed, at least 
three-quarters of the votes cast on such resolutions must be in 
favour of such resolutions.
3  A member entitled to attend and vote at the meeting is entitled to 
appoint one or more proxies to exercise all or any of the member’s 
rights to attend, speak and vote at the meeting (or any adjournment 
of the meeting). A proxy need not be a member of the Company. If a 
member appoints more than one proxy in relation to the meeting, 
each proxy must be appointed to exercise the rights attached to a 
different share or shares held by that member. If a member submits 
more than one valid proxy appointment in relation to the same share, 
the appointment received last before the latest time for receipt of 
proxies will take precedence. A member may only appoint a proxy in 
accordance with the procedures described in notes 4,5 and 6.
4  To appoint a proxy outside of the CREST system, a form of proxy is 
enclosed for use. To be valid, this form of proxy (and any power of 
attorney or other authority (if any) under which it is signed) must by 
duly completed and signed and sent to or deposited at the office of 
the Company’s registrars, Link Asset Services, PXS, 34 Beckenham 
Road, Beckenham, Kent BR3 4TU so as to be received not less than 
48 hours before the time for holding the meeting (or any adjournment 
of the meeting). Completion of a form of proxy does not preclude a 
member from attending and voting in person at the meeting if that 
member so wishes.
5  T o appoint as a proxy a person other than the Chairman of the meeting, 
a member must insert the proxy’s full name in the box on the proxy 
form. If a member signs and returns a proxy form with no name in the 
box, the Chairman of the meeting will be deemed to be the member’s 
proxy. Where a member appoints as a proxy someone other than the 
Chairman, the member is responsible for ensuring that the proxy 
attends the meeting and is aware of the member’s voting intentions. 
If a member wishes a proxy to make any comments on the member’s 
behalf, the member will need to appoint someone other than the 
Chairman and give them the relevant instructions directly.
6  To appoint a proxy or to give or amend an instruction to a previously 
appointed proxy via the CREST system (Link ID: RA10), the CREST 
message must be received by the issuer’s agent by 11.00 a.m. on 19 
February 2018. For this purpose, the time of receipt will be taken to 
be the time (as determined by the timestamp applied to the message 
by the CREST Applications Host) from which the issuer’s agent is able 
to retrieve the message. After this time any change of instructions 
to a proxy appointed through CREST should be communicated to the 
proxy by other means. CREST Personal Members or other CREST 
sponsored members, and those CREST Members who have appointed 
voting service provider(s) should contact their CREST sponsor or 
voting service provider(s) for assistance with appointing proxies via 
CREST . For further information on CREST procedures, limitations and 
system timings please refer to the CREST Manual. The Company or 
its Registrars may treat as invalid a proxy appointment sent by CREST 
in the circumstances set out in Regulation 35(5) (a) of the 
Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001. In any case your Form 
of Proxy must be received by the Company’s Registrars by no later 
than 11.00 a.m. on 19 February 2018.
7  A member which is a corporation is entitled to appoint one or more 
corporate representatives to exercise the same powers on behalf 
of the corporation as the corporation could exercise if it were an 
individual member. If a member which is a corporation appoints more 
than one corporate representative in relation to the meeting (or any 
adjournment of the meeting), each such corporate representative 
shall be entitled to exercise the same powers on behalf of that 
corporation as that corporation could exercise if it were an individual 
member, provided that if such persons purport to exercise those 
powers the same way, those powers shall be treated as exercised in 
that way, but if those persons purport to exercise those powers in 
different ways, those powers shall be treated as not exercised. In the 
case of a member which is a corporation, the proxy form must be 
executed under the corporation’s common seal or signed on its behalf 
by a duly authorised officer of the corporation or an attorney for 
the corporation.
8  Pursuant to Regulation 41 of the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 
2001, the Company specifies that only those members entered in the 
Company’s register of members at close of business on 19 February 
2018 shall be entitled to attend and vote at the meeting in respect 
of the number of shares registered in their names at that time. 
Changes in the Company’s register of members after that time shall 
be disregarded in determining the rights of any person to attend 
and vote at the meeting. If the meeting is adjourned, the time which 
is 48 hours (disregarding any part of a day which is not a working day) 
before the time fixed for the adjourned meeting shall apply for the 
purpose of determining the entitlement of members to attend and 
vote at the adjourned meeting.
9  Copies of Directors’ service agreements and letters of appointment 
and the rules of the Company’s share option schemes will be available 
for inspection at the registered office of the Company from the date 
of this Notice of AGM until the date of the meeting during normal 
business hours, and at the place of the meeting from 10.45 a.m. 
until its conclusion.
