Operational highlights
• Further year of profitable growth assisted 
by increased contributions from Bilco 
and Giesse acquisitions and favourable 
exchange rates.
• AmesburyTruth ahead of last year with 
strong Bilco growth partially offset by 
some short term market share loss in 
smaller residential customers and 
operational issues in Juarez, Mexico, 
which are now largely resolved.
• ERA gained share in both OEM 
and distribution in what remains 
a slow market.
• SchlegelGiesse increased margins 
by c. 190 bps as its enlarged product 
offering continues to gain traction.
• Synergy targets for both Giesse and Bilco 
acquisitions exceeded.
• Leverage back within the Group’s target 
range of 1.50 to 2.00x at year end.
• Industry-leading facilities opened in 
Sioux Falls, South Dakota; Statesville, 
North Carolina; and Wolverhampton, 
West Midlands.
• Group effective tax rate for 2018 
expected to reduce by c. 400 bps to 
26.0–27.0 per cent following changes 
to US Federal tax rate.

Delivering operational excellence
Delivering
in 2017
The Group’s footprint project 
brought a number of new and 
expanded facilities online, adding 
to the centres of excellence within 
the Group’s operations. 
Giesse merges sites 
in Bologna
Two Giesse facilities in Bologna 
were consolidated onto the larger 
manufacturing site, with an offsite 
logistics warehouse retained for the 
storage and dispatch of finished goods.
New sites in Sioux Falls 
and Statesville
Two new centres of excellence opened in 
Sioux Falls, South Dakota, and Statesville, 
North Carolina. The movement of plant 
and machinery and key personnel to the 
new centres of excellence was completed 
on time and within budget.

Howe Green acquired 
by the Group
Howe Green is one of the world’s 
leading manufacturers of floor, wall 
and ceiling access hatches. For over 
30 years Howe Green has been at the 
forefront of design and innovation in 
the highly specialised architectural 
building products sector.

Wolverhampton site 
becomes a centre of 
excellence
ERA occupied its new facility 
at Wolverhampton in the 
West Midlands during the 
second half of the year, with 
the final warehouse moves 
taking place in the first two 
months of 2018. The purpose 
built 136,000 sq. ft. facility has 
allowed the consolidation of 
three distribution warehouses 
onto a single site.
Harrogate site opened 
for business
Ventrolla moved to a new facility in 
the first quarter of the year which 
allows the business to manufacture 
larger timber windows for commercial 
projects as well as residential joinery.
  See our Operating review on Page 22
The Juarez centre of 
excellence became fully 
operational
This site is now a 157 ,000 sq. ft. plant, 
fulfilling phase I of the North American 
footprint project. The expansion has 
transformed this facility into a full-service 
manufacturing unit.

Differentiated 
strategic focus
Chairman’s statement
This is my first statement since my 
appointment as Chairman of Tyman in 
May of last year in succession to Jamie Pike. 
Tyman has again demonstrated its resilience 
in producing a solid set of results for 2017 
and a further year of profitable growth, 
assisted by increased contributions from 
the Bilco and Giesse businesses purchased 
in 2016 and by further margin expansion 
in the enlarged SchlegelGiesse business. 
These results were achieved despite the 
Group encountering some challenges during 
the year. Operational issues in Juarez, Mexico 
took longer to resolve than expected, there 
was some short term market share loss in 
AmesburyTruth and subdued market conditions 
continued in the United Kingdom. 
In 2017, alongside its regular agenda items, 
the Board has spent considerable time on 
four key topics: how the Board operates, 
succession planning, Group strategy and 
health and safety.
How the Board operates
The Board conducted an externally facilitated 
evaluation during the year, with a focus on 
how the Board and its associated Committees 
operate, the results of which are summarised 
in the Corporate governance section on 
pages 56 to 60. This exercise has proved useful 
in that it confirmed the open and collegiate 
culture of the Group Board while providing 
specific direction for improvement of the 
Board’s processes in the future.
A solid set of results with good cash generation 
demonstrating the Group’s resilience.
Please join us on 10 May 2018 in 
Wolverhampton to see first hand 
how one of Tyman’s Divisions is 
delivering our commitment to 
operational excellence.”

Board priorities
2017 has seen the Board focus on four 
key areas:
• How the Board operates 
• Succession planning
• Group strategy
• Health and safety
 Find out more about governance  
 on Pages 56 to 60
As in previous years the Board continued with 
its established practice of spending time with 
Divisional management and employees away 
from the Group head office. In 2017, Board 
meetings were held in the US and Italy with 
site visits made to the Group’s two facilities 
in Juarez, Mexico. 
The Board also attended the Group 
Management Conference held in Bologna, 
Italy, in October. 
Succession planning
Succession planning is a key Board responsibility 
and the Nominations Committee has spent 
considerable time during the year considering 
succession plans for both the Board and for 
the Divisional Management Teams. Further 
details on succession planning are contained 
in the Nominations Committee report 
on pages 67 to 68. 
A number of changes to the Board composition 
and roles took place during the year. As 
announced at the time of the interim results, 
from August 2017 James Brotherton took on 
responsibility for Group strategy, corporate 
development and M&A in addition to his 
existing duties as Chief Financial Officer. 
Helen Clatworthy joined the Board as an 
Independent Non-executive Director in 
January 2017 and took over from me as 
Chair of the Audit Committee in May. 
Since the year end Tyman has announced 
the appointment of Pamela Bingham as an 
Independent Non-executive Director and the 
retirement of Angelika Westerwelle. I would 
like to welcome Pamela to the Group Board 
and thank Angelika for her service to Tyman.
Jamie Pike stepped down as Non-executive 
Chairman in May 2017 and I succeeded him 
from that date. Jamie joined Tyman in 
November 2009 following a challenging 
period for the Group and led the Board through 
the subsequent seven and half years in which 
Tyman changed considerably. He made a 
significant contribution to the Group’s 
development in that time and, on behalf of 
all shareholders, I would like to thank Jamie 
for his leadership and to wish him well for 
the future.
Group strategy 
To allow scope for discussion and debate, 
the Board held a strategy away day in 
2017 which included presentations to 
the Board from the three Divisional CEOs 
concerning the strategy for their Divisions’ 
respective markets. 
The Group’s strategy remains to be a 
leading international supplier of engineered 
components to the door and window industry. 
This strategic focus, which was adopted 
in 2010, has allowed Tyman to differentiate 
itself in the various national markets in which 
the Group operates. As the Group has grown, 
the strategy has evolved from a pure play on 
residential markets to include commercial 
applications and now light infrastructure.
Our strategy is implemented through a 
combination of our commitment to operational 
excellence, targeted acquisitions and close 
alignment with our customers. 
Tyman remains the only supplier of scale 
that can offer its customers, wherever they 
are located, a one stop solution for all their 
engineered component requirements. Further 
details on the Group’s strategy are set out 
in the business model on pages 10 to 11.
2017 saw further significant investment 
made in the Group’s operating footprint 
with new facilities constructed in Statesville, 
North Carolina, and Wolverhampton, West 
Midlands. These investments provide the 
Divisions with the modern manufacturing, 
sourcing and distribution facilities necessary 
to achieve operational excellence and 
support our future growth. 
The Group made one small acquisition in 
the year, Howe Green, which has performed 
well since completion and has a good pipeline 
of prospects in the UK light infrastructure 
space. The integrations of Bilco and Giesse 
are now largely complete and it is pleasing 
to note the contributions that both 
businesses are making to the Group.
Health and safety
The health and safety of our employees 
remains a key priority for the Board and it 
is disappointing to have to report that the 
number of lost time incidents increased 
year on year and that severity rates 
increased across all three Divisions.
As part of the Group’s commitment to 
operational excellence, the Board remains 
determined that all employees will be provided 
with a high quality, safe and appropriate 
working environment. 2017 saw further 
investments made in new plant and 
machinery and in appropriate guarding, 
as well as additional third party audits of 
operating environments. 
All three Divisions now have their own dedicated 
Health and Safety Officer whose remit 
includes the rolling review of policies and 
procedures, as well as the investigation of 
incidents as and when they occur. 
The Board continues to place a high priority 
on Tyman achieving real and tangible 
improvement to the Group’s health and 
safety record and in 2018 the Chief Executive’s 
remuneration will in part be determined by 
the Group’s progress in this area.
Dividend 
Underlying Earnings Per Share increased to 
26.91 pence in 2017 assisted by full year 
contributions from Giesse and Bilco and 
exchange translation benefits. In light of the 
Group’s performance during the year, the Board 
is recommending a final dividend of 7 .75 pence 
per share, making a total of 11.25 pence per 
share for the year, which equates to Dividend 
Cover of 2.40x and is an increase of 7 .1 per cent 
over the previous year. 
Outlook and AGM
As an international manufacturer working 
with customers in many different countries, 
the Group has continued to deliver for its 
stakeholders in 2017. The investments Tyman 
has made in each of its Divisions this year 
positions the Group well for further profitable 
growth in the years to come.
The Group’s AGM this year will be held at the 
ERA Division’s new facility in Wolverhampton 
on Thursday 10 May 2018. I do hope that as 
many shareholders as possible are able to 
join us to see first hand how one of Tyman’s 
Divisions is delivering our commitment to 
operational excellence.

Focusing on
our strengths
Chief Executive Officer’s review
2017 saw a further year of profitable growth 
for the Group with increased contributions 
from the Bilco and Giesse acquisitions, 
and continued favourable exchange rates 
on translation.
Footprint projects in each of the Divisions 
progressed well such that the Group has the 
safe, modern and flexible facilities necessary 
to support our customers’ needs, increase 
our product quality and improve our 
service levels. 
Reported Revenue and Underlying 
Operating Profit increased by 14.2 and 
10.0 per cent respectively, principally due 
to the Bilco and Giesse acquisitions and 
favourable exchange rates on translation. 
On a constant currency like for like basis, 
Revenue increased by 1.7 per cent in the 
year and Underlying Operating Profit 
decreased by 1.5 per cent.
Cash generation was lower than in recent 
years  due to targeted investment in working 
capital and continued investment in the 
balance sheet, including gross capital 
expenditure at 1.27x Depreciation. The 
Group remains cash generative and 
Leverage at the year end of 1.83x was again 
comfortably back within the Group’s core 
year-end target range of 1.50x to 2.00x.
ROCE decreased slightly in the year to 
13.6 per cent, with the Group continuing 
to target achieving a ROCE of 15.0 per cent 
over the medium term.
The Group has again demonstrated its resilience 
in producing a solid set of results.

2018 priorities
Tyman’s key priorities for 2018 are an 
extension of the themes that the Group has 
developed over the past few years and include:
1. Health and safety
The Group’s health and safety performance 
in the past two years has been disappointing, 
despite the significant investment made in 
both time and resources dedicated to health 
and safety functions in each Division.
Securing a demonstrable improvement to 
the Group’s health and safety record in 2018 
is regarded by the Board as being of the 
highest importance. 2018 will see further 
investment made in employee training, the 
development of safer working practices, 
additional capital investment and sharing 
of best practice across Divisions. 
2. Footprint
Tyman made significant changes to its 
footprint in 2017 in each of its Divisions such 
that the Group has safe, modern and flexible 
facilities necessary to support customers’ 
needs, increase product quality and improve 
service levels. 
2018 will see the completion of moves into 
the new facilities in the UK and US and the 
exit from two significant sites in North America. 
Successful management of these moves, 
with minimal operational disruption to the 
businesses, will be a key priority for the 
Group during the year.
3. Group collaboration
The Group has successfully established 
inter-Divisional teams in the areas of health 
and safety, risk management and supply 
chain through TSA. Cross selling of other 
Divisions’ products continued to gain traction 
most notably with the Giesse products in 
North American and UK markets.
Encouraging effective communication, 
consistency of approach, sharing of best 
practice and standards of operational 
excellence across each of the Divisions 
remains a focus in 2018. 
4. Financial objectives 
A return to like for like Revenue growth 
and margin expansion in each Division, 
underpinned by working capital discipline 
and cash generation to enable the Group 
to make further progress towards its 
committed medium term ROCE target 
of 15.0 per cent.
Input cost inflation pressures in 2018 will 
be managed through a combination of 
effective purchasing, price management 
and cost reduction programmes.
5. Self‑help initiatives
Continuing with the Group’s well established 
self-help initiatives to improve the businesses, 
in particular in the areas of new product 
development, people, supply chain and 
capital projects with a focus on automation 
and lean manufacturing to ensure Tyman 
differentiates itself from the competition 
and continues to grow market share.
6. M&A
Pursuing the Group’s active acquisition 
programme, prioritising hardware and 
seals businesses in the UK and Europe 
and selecting emerging markets together 
with commercial hardware businesses 
in key end markets. 
7. Integration
The completion of the integration of Bilco 
and the start of the integration of Ashland 
Hardware into AmesburyTruth.
Tyman expects to see a further 
year of profitable growth.”
Louis Eperjesi
Chief Executive Officer
Outlook
AmesburyTruth expects US residential and 
commercial markets will show growth in 
2018, possibly assisted by increasing real 
wages as the changes to the US tax code 
become established. The Canadian market 
for the Division’s products is expected to 
show further growth, although at a slower 
rate than was seen in 2017. 
AmesburyTruth is well placed to capture the 
opportunities that exist in 2018, and expects 
to see market share recovery among smaller 
customers, like for like sales growth and a 
return to margin expansion during the year.
ERA expects that UK residential RMI 
demand will continue to be slow in 2018 
and, as a consequence, expects that the 
market will contract to a similar extent to 
2017. Given the subdued market backdrop 
ERA’s focus will be on further share gains, 
leveraging the opportunities offered by 
ERA’s new facility, new product introductions 
and management of costs and overheads. 
The outlook for ERA’s commercial and light 
infrastructure products remains promising 
in 2018.
SchlegelGiesse expects that Continental 
European markets will show broad-based 
incremental growth in 2018 and is well placed 
to take further market share. The second 
half momentum established in the Middle 
East and Latin America is expected to continue, 
with key Brazilian and Argentine markets 
recovering. China and Asia Pacific markets 
are likely to remain variable with opportunities 
for growth in certain countries. 
Volumes in 2018 to date are in line with 
expectations and there is a promising order 
book in each Division. Tyman expects to see 
a further year of profitable growth in 2018.

Tyman’s key strengths
Flexibility
Tyman chooses to manufacture certain products, such 
as complex balances, extrusions and seals, close to the 
customer base when flexibility, variety or complexity 
are key to the component manufacturing process and 
to the customer.
Engineered solutions
Substantially all of the components supplied to Tyman’s 
customers – whether manufactured by Divisions in their 
own plants or sourced externally – are engineering-led, 
value-added products made to Tyman’s designs, 
protected where possible and practical by patents 
and intellectual property, and manufactured on the 
Group’s proprietary tooling.
Quality and service
The manufacturing decision for Tyman comes back to 
the Group’s desire to differentiate its product offering 
from the Group’s competitors by providing customers 
with the highest quality product at the relevant price 
point, delivered to specification on time and in full.
Financial discipline
Tyman focuses on financial disciplines that encompass 
margin targets for each product, close scrutiny of the 
cost base, optimisation of working capital, and a rigorous 
approach to return on capital and its allocation, both 
internally in the form of capital investment and 
externally in the form of M&A.
Strong relationships
We believe in establishing an honest and fair long-term 
relationship with suppliers and customers based on 
value, quality and range of products, industry-leading 
service and value-added technical support.
Expertise and experience
Tyman invests in its people through employee training, 
career path development, and improvement of working 
practices and conditions. Training schemes around the 
Group include apprenticeship schemes, vocational 
training as well as personal development programmes.

international supplier of engineered components to the door and window industry.
Strategic objectives
Tyman aims to secure profitable market 
share increases annually through deeper 
penetration of the existing customer base, 
the development of new products and 
winning new customers. The breadth of the 
Group’s product offering and our ability to 
offer customers engineered solutions means 
that in each market there remain opportunities 
for the Group to continue to increase its 
market share.
Performance in 2017
The Group lost some residential market share 
in North America in 2017, however grew 
share in a number of international markets.
Focus for 2018
Profitable growth in market share remains 
a core objective for the Group and each 
Division is targeting further improvements in 
2018. In North America the changes made 
to the route to market for smaller customers 
are expected to lead to market share recovery 
in 2018. Given market conditions, profitable 
share gain in the UK will be a particular 
focus for ERA.

Strategic objectives
Divisions scrutinise Tyman’s manufacturing 
and sourcing processes to ensure that they 
are providing products to the customer in 
the most efficient manner. Divisions operate 
rolling programmes of process improvement 
engineering designed to eliminate unnecessary 
cost from our processes and reduce scrap levels.
Performance in 2017
The Group made significant progress on 
its various projects – including business 
improvement, footprint, integration and 
sourcing during the year, which will improve 
the flexibility of its manufacturing and 
sourcing capabilities.
Focus for 2018
Improvements to processes will be a focus 
for each Division in 2018 in order to improve 
the Group’s health and safety record, meet 
increasing quality standards and eliminate 
unnecessary cost and waste from processes.

Strategic objectives
Divisions target minimum gross margin 
thresholds for each product line, and in 
pricing consider the end to end cost of 
providing the necessary product and service 
to customers. For the ultimate customer, 
wherever they are located, Tyman’s aim 
is to provide a differentiated product 
offering at an appropriate price, delivered 
to specification, on time and in full.
Performance in 2017
Price discipline was well maintained in 2017 
across each Division with the Group securing 
price and surcharge increases of 9.0 per cent 
in aggregate to recover in part raw material 
cost increases and exchange rate movements. 
AmesburyTruth did not recover all material 
cost increases incurred by the Division in 2017 .
Focus for 2018
Inflationary cost pressures will continue in 
2018 with further increases in commodity 
prices expected. Each Division will monitor 
pricing closely to ensure it reflects the costs 
of doing business.

Strategic objectives
The Group adopts a rigorous appraisal 
process for all items of capital investment in 
order to ensure that investments are supported 
by a robust business case. Divisional investment 
plans are required to provide an attractive 
return to the Group overall, while also 
ensuring that Divisions continue to invest 
in making facilities safe, leading edge and 
attractive working environments that are 
fit for purpose for an international 
manufacturing organisation.
Performance in 2017
Returns on capital decreased slightly during 
the year reflecting the increased levels of 
capital employed in the business following 
investment and the reduced Underlying 
Operating Margin.
Focus for 2018
The Group will continue to invest in the 
Divisions in 2018 through its footprint and 
integration projects and will seek to improve 
the Underlying Net Operating Margin as it 
makes progress towards its ROCE target of 
15 per cent.

Operating Cash Conversion
Strategic objectives
Each Division is targeted on conversion of 
100.0 per cent of its Underlying Operating 
Profit into operating cash. These Divisional 
cash conversion targets intentionally exclude 
capital investment in order to encourage the 
required long term investment decisions 
necessary to improve the Group’s business. 
At a Group level, Operating Cash Conversion 
is measured after capital investment.
In any one year, a Division may need to 
invest in working capital in order to support 
customers’ needs; however, a focus on cash 
conversion ensures that working capital 
investment receives the necessary scrutiny.
Performance in 2017
The Group generated £31.7 million of Free Cash 
Flow in 2017 which more than covered the 
Group dividend, the acquisition of Howe 
Green and other investments. This was 
despite the significant capital and operational 
investment made in each Division in 
connection with the various footprint projects.
Leverage was back within the Group’s target 
range at the year end for the sixth successive year.
Focus for 2018
Further improvements to cash generation 
are targeted in the year with a more normal 
working capital cycle expected in 2018. 
2018 will be the final year of material 
capital and operational investment in the 
North American footprint project.

of the increase relating to pricing and 
surcharge actions offset in part by a 
0.5 per cent decrease in sales volumes.
Target
To grow Revenue organically year on year. 
2017 performance
Underlying Operating Margins decreased by 
60 bps, the decrease largely driven by higher

Group’s processes as well as overheads 
and administrative costs.
2017 performance
Leverage decreased by 0.06x to 1.83x,

ROCE decreased by 20 bps to 13.6 per cent (2016: 13.8 per cent) and ROCCE 
decreased by 60 bps to 49.6 per cent (2016: 50.2 per cent). The fall in both 
measures is principally due to increases in average capital and controllable 
capital employed, following the 2016 acquisitions. 
The Group continues to target a ROCE of 15.0 per cent over the medium term.
Target
To maintain and steadily improve ROCE and ROCCE with a medium term target 
for ROCE of 15.0 per cent.
2017 performance
Giesse has made a significant contribution to 
the Group since its acquisition in March 2016 
and has materially exceeded the Group’s 
minimum target return threshold on both a 
run rate and annualised basis.
The ROAI for Bilco has increased as synergy 
benefits have started to be realised in the 
year. Bilco is expected to exceed the minimum 
run rate target return threshold within 
two years of acquisition. 
Howe Green has been owned by the Group 
for ten months at the year end and has 
performed encouragingly since acquisition. 
Target
For all acquisitions to achieve a run rate 
of ROAI greater than 15.0 per cent within

2017 performance
Underlying basic EPS increased by 5.9 per cent 
to 26.91 pence. The increase reflects the 
improvement in Underlying Operating Profit, 
offset by higher finance costs in the year 
and the higher Underlying effective tax rate 
for the Group. 
Target
To improve underlying EPS performance

2017 performance
Dividends have continued to grow 
consistently and by 7.1 per cent in the year. 
This equates to dividend cover of 2.40x,

Target
To grow dividends annually at least in line 
with underlying earnings. 
2017 performance
Operating Cash Conversion fell to 85.6 per

Business performance 
and developments
AmesburyTruth had a mixed year during 
2017 despite generally favourable market 
conditions. On a reported basis, Revenue 
increased by 9.1 per cent to US$428.8 million 
(2016 restated: US$393.1 million), principally 
due to the full year contribution of Bilco, to 
the Division in the year. Like for like Revenue 
for the year was 1.9 per cent ahead of 2016 
following an improved second half performance 
from Bilco, with volumes in the core 
AmesburyTruth business marginally 
ahead of last year. 
Reported Underlying Operating Profit 
increased by 3.9 per cent to US$77.0 million 
(2016 restated: US$74.1 million). Like for like 
Underlying Operating Profit was flat year 
on year.
Input costs increased significantly, most 
notably for zinc where the spot unit cost at 
December increased by 57.0 per cent year 
on year, as well as for other raw materials 
such as paint and oil derivatives. The impact 
of these increases was not fully recovered 
through price, although AmesburyTruth 
expects to resume its usual practice of cost 
recovery through price in 2018. Overheads 
in the Division increased principally due to 
higher freight costs than usual.
AmesburyTruth’s Underlying Operating 
Margin decreased to 17.9 per cent 
(2016 restated: 18.8 per cent), due 
to the consolidation of Bilco for a full 
12 months and the increased input costs 
previously discussed. The Division remains 
confident that it will achieve a blended 
Underlying Operating Margin of 20.0 per cent 
over the medium term.
Residential and commercial
Volumes into residential were broadly flat 
during the year with modest growth in US 
tier one and two customers and from Bilco 
residential products being offset by volume 
declines in US tier three and four customers. 
The Division lost some market share in US 
residential during the year.
The Division’s commercial offering made 
good progress during the year with increased 
contributions from both the Bilco and Giesse 
product offerings. Revenue in commercial 
increased by 4.3 per cent to US$62.7 million 
(2016 full year restated: US$60.1 million). 
The run rate of major project quote activity 
in Bilco in Q4 2017 was significantly higher 
than in Q4 2016.
Canada
Performance in Canada for the Division 
improved during 2017, reflecting better 
market conditions and some recovery of 
share lost in previous years assisted by more 
favourable exchange rates. Canadian Revenue 
increased by 8.8 per cent to US$46.0 million 
(2016 full year: US$42.3 million) with new 
customer and product wins across both 
AmesburyTruth and Bilco products.
Tier three and four account coverage
In June, AmesburyTruth transferred its US tier 
three and four account coverage to a national 
sales representative network, ISC. Previously 
coverage was managed through state or 
regional representatives, which led to some 
inconsistencies in service depending on location. 
Progress with ISC has been promising with trading 
in US tiers three and four during the second 
half of the year increasing by 4.7 per cent 
compared with the equivalent period in 2016 
and c. US$1.4 million of annualised 
incremental orders secured to date, which 
should convert into Revenue in 2018.
Like for like Revenue 
increased by 
1.9 per cent 
following strong 
Bilco growth and 
core Amesbury T ruth 
business volumes 
were marginally 
ahead of 2016.”

Business performance and 
developments continued
Tier three and four account 
coverage continued
At the same time the Division started its 
first distribution pilot with ISC, taking pallet 
space in a Dallas, Texas, warehouse. The 
warehouse allows customers in the region 
access to over 200 AmesburyTruth SKUs 
with guaranteed order fulfilment within four 
hours if required. The pilot has exceeded 
expectations and in 2018 ISC plans to take 
space in a second warehouse in Nashville, 
Tennessee, and to extend the range of 
SKUs available to customers.
The Division is confident that this 
differentiated twin track approach to service 
and distribution of product will lead to a 
recovery in AmesburyTruth’s market share 
among US tier three and four customers.
Footprint project
Further progress was made with the 
footprint project in 2017. The Juarez centre 
of excellence became fully operational and 
two new centres of excellence opened in 
Sioux Falls, South Dakota, and Statesville, 
North Carolina. The manufacturing facility 
in Canton, South Dakota, and the vacated 
facilities in Sioux Falls and Statesville 
all closed. 
The movement of plant and machinery 
and key personnel to the new centres of 
excellence was completed on time and 
within budget; however, the operational 
issues encountered by the Division in 2016 
at the Juarez facility persisted into 2017. 
Recruitment and retention of qualified 
semi-skilled operatives proved more 
challenging than expected and the facility 
did not meet its initial targeted output and 
quality levels. This led to increased levels 
of scrap and product rework and the 
requirement to support US tier one and 
two customers led to increased levels 
of expedited freight.
Encouragingly, AmesburyTruth has seen 
the expected reductions in direct labour 
and direct overhead from the moves starting 
to come through during the year which gives 
the Division confidence that the targeted 
net financial benefits from the footprint 
project will be achieved now that the 
business has reached its targeted output 
and quality levels and freight costs have 
started to normalise.
In 2018 the facilities in Rochester, New York, 
and Amesbury, Massachusetts, will close 
with production moving to the Statesville 
centre of excellence. These production 
moves are relatively low risk in that they are 
contained within the United States and the 
Division has been a significant employer in 
the Statesville area for a number of years.
The facility build out phase of the project 
is now substantially complete, with the 
exception of a potential extension to the 
fourth centre of excellence in Owatonna, 
Minnesota, which remains under evaluation. 
At the end of 2019 the AmesburyTruth manufacturing footprint, excluding the Bilco and Ashland sites, is expected to be as follows:

Cash costs incurred during 2017 in connection 
with the footprint project were US$13.1 million, 
in line with expectations coming into the year. 
The overall net project cost is now estimated 
at c. US$37.0 million (2016: US$34.0 million) 
with the increase year on year principally 
due to firmer estimates of the cost to close 
the Rochester site.
Following the announcement of the decision 
to close the Amesbury and Rochester sites, 
agreements have been reached with the 
relevant trade unions covering severance 
and exit arrangements. These agreements 
include the closure of the Rochester 
post-retirement medical benefit scheme at 
the end of 2018 with no future obligations 
to AmesburyTruth in respect of the scheme 
from that date (see page 32). The closure of 
the scheme has reduced AmesburyTruth’s 
actuarial liability by US$4.2 million. As 
AmesburyTruth has now entered into a firm 
commitment in respect of these sites; the 
estimated costs to close of US$10.2 million 
have been provided for in the 2017 
financial statements. 
At the start of the year incremental P&L savings 
of US$2.0 million were expected to be realised 
in 2017; however, scrap, product rework and 
increased levels of expedited freight meant 
that there were no net benefits realised in 2017 . 
2018 should see c. US$2.0 million of incremental 
P&L savings realised as the Division starts to 
progress towards its cumulative target of 
US$10.0 million savings per annum from 2020.
Bilco
A new senior management team was 
appointed for Bilco during the year and has 
made good progress in improving the focus 
of the business. A more structured approach 
to pricing has been adopted and savings 
were secured in the areas of freight, 
procurement, personnel and warehousing. 
In 2017 Bilco, including the contribution 
from Bilco UK, increased Revenue by 
3.1 per cent to US$59.9 million (2016 
Full Year: US$58.1 million) and Underlying 
Operating Profit by 69.3 per cent to 
US$9.4 million (2016 Full Year: 
US$5.6 million). Installations of Bilco 
products in the year included the LA Metro, 
the San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit 
and the Blue Origin Exploration Park in Florida. 
Injection moulding in Juarez, Mexico.
The increase in Bilco’s Underlying Operating 
Profit was principally due to improved 
trading, particularly in the second half of the 
year, as well as delivery of US$2.8 million of 
cost and revenue synergies during the year. 
The run rate of synergies at 31 December 
2017 was US$3.0 million, some 20.0 per cent 
ahead of the target set out at the date of 
acquisition and twelve months ahead of 
schedule. Bilco is on track to meet the Group 
target run rate ROAI of 15.0 per cent within 
two years of ownership. Bilco has a 
promising order book for 2018.
NPD and investment
In 2017 customers started the transition 
to the new proprietary Elon foam seal from 
the legacy Qlon foam seal. A new constant 
force balance, Stasis, which offers superior 
features and benefits compared with the 
industry standard products, will be launched 
in the second half of 2018. The Division 
expects to bring to market its electronic 
patio door and multipoint locks during 2018. 
Additional investments in manufacturing 
capability and automation in connection 
with the footprint project are expected in 
2018 with a focus on operational and 
quality improvements.
Outlook
AmesburyTruth expects US residential and 
commercial markets will show growth in 
2018, possibly assisted by increasing real 
wages as the changes to the US tax code 
become established. The Canadian market 
for the Division’s products is expected to 
show further growth, although at a slower 
rate than was seen in 2017. 
AmesburyTruth is well placed to capture the 
opportunities that exist in 2018, and expects 
to see market share recovery among smaller 
customers, like for like sales growth and a return 
to margin expansion during the year. Tyman plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 22

Business performance and 
developments
ERA performed credibly in 2017 against 
a difficult market backdrop. ERA’s like for like 
Revenue for the year increased by 2.8 per cent 
with the increase reflecting the 2016 pricing 
and surcharge actions which more than offset 
small aggregate volume decreases. On 
a reported basis, Revenue increased by 
10.0 per cent, principally due to the incremental 
contributions from Bilco UK and Howe Green.
Underlying raw material prices continued 
to increase through 2017 and consequently 
the Division implemented a price increase in 
November 2017, the benefits of which will 
largely flow through in 2018. Overheads 
in the Division increased in part due to the 
higher property costs of the new facility. 
Underlying Operating Margins in the Division 
were impacted by increased raw material 
costs and overheads, although benefited 
from the inclusion of the higher margin business 
at Bilco UK and Howe Green. The 2016 
comparator margin benefited from currency 
hedges put in place at a time when Sterling 
was significantly stronger against international 
currencies. ERA continues to target an 
Underlying Operating Margin in the 
mid-teens in the medium term.
OEM and distribution 
Despite the challenging market conditions, 
OEM volumes decreased by only 2.9 per cent, 
reflecting the continued growth in bifold 
hardware products and door cylinders together 
with encouraging take-up from new product 
introductions.
The Division made further progress in 
distribution with incremental listings secured 
at both existing and new customers. As a 
result, distribution volumes increased by 
6.8 per cent across the year. 
Summary
• Share gains in OEM and distribution 
despite subdued markets.
• New West Midlands facility occupied in 
second half of year.
• Higher raw material input costs through 
2017 to be recovered in 2018 by 
November 2017 price increase. 
• New trade alarm and door intercom 
range launched into the market.
Market
The UK market was challenging in 2017. 
New build residential construction continued 
to grow; however, the RMI sector of the 
market, which comprises the substantial 
majority of UK residential construction 
activity, contracted as consumers elected 
to defer significant items of expenditure. 
ERA estimates that the window and door 
market volumes contracted by between 
6.0 and 8.0 per cent in 2017, although 
there were certain subsectors that 
showed encouraging growth, most 
notably bifold doors.

ERA Home
Smartware sales in the year were broadly in 
line with 2016. During 2017 a new range of 
trade alarms and door intercoms was 
launched into the market with an encouraging 
level of listings secured with retailers and 
specialist distributors.
The TouchKey night latch is in beta testing 
phase and is expected to be launched 
commercially during 2018 with the TouchKey 
multipoint lock offering to follow. 
The Division has branded its smartware 
product family “ERA Home”, which includes 
the full range of cloud-based home alarms 
and video intercoms as well as the TouchKey 
electronic access products.
UK commercial
From 1 January 201 7 , responsibility for Bilco UK 
was transferred from AmesburyTruth to 
ERA and in March the Group acquired Howe 
Green. Accordingly, ERA’s results for the year 
ended 31 December 2017 include the 
post-acquisition contribution from Howe 
Green and a full twelve month contribution 
from Bilco UK.
The combination performed well during 
the year, contributing £7.2 million to the 
Division’s Revenue in 2017 at a promising 
margin, with installations including the new 
Crossrail stations, Heathrow Terminal Five 
and Battersea Power Station. The two 
businesses provide ERA with a platform to 
develop a meaningful commercial and light 
infrastructure access business for the 
UK market.
The Division has appointed a dedicated 
product manager to support the promotion 
of Giesse products to the UK commercial 
market and expects this initiative will start 
to yield benefits in 2018.
Ventrolla
Ventrolla moved to a new facility in the first 
quarter of the year which allows the business 
to manufacture larger timber windows for 
commercial projects as well as its core 
residential joinery offering. Revenue in the 
year for Ventrolla increased by 7.0 per cent 
to £5.3 million (2016: £5.0 million); however, 
profitability was impacted by capacity 
constraints prior to the facility move, lower 
installer productivity and a small (£0.1 million) 
exposure to Carillion, which has been 
fully provided.
Ventrolla has a promising order book for 
2018, has secured a number of commercial 
contract wins and, since the half year, has 
seen installer productivity improve. 
Tyman Sourcing Asia
TSA reports through ERA and is responsible 
for the Group’s Far Eastern sourcing operations. 
TSA manages the supply chain for the majority 
of the Division’s UK sales. In 2017 purchases 
made by TSA on behalf of all Group companies 
totalled US$75.1 million across 47 active 
suppliers. The management team was 
strengthened during 2017 and investments 
were made in the areas of product quality, 
logistics and supplier assessments.
New facility
ERA occupied its new facility at Wolverhampton 
in the West Midlands during the second half 
of the year, with the final warehouse moves 
taking place in the first two months of 2018. 
The purpose built 136,000 sq. ft. facility has 
allowed the consolidation of three distribution 
warehouses onto a single site and incorporates 
the Divisional head office, test centre and 
showroom as well as light manufacturing 
and assembly operations. 
The facility has significant room for expansion 
as ERA grows. The Division is now able to 
offer customers improved service levels with 
later dispatch cut off times, same or next 
day delivery of products, and consolidated 
shipments of multiple SKUs.
The new facility 
enables the 
Division to offer 
customers 
improved service 
levels and later 
dispatch cut 
off times.”
Darren Waters
Chief Executive Officer – ERA
Showroom at Wolverhampton, West Midlands.
Outlook
ERA expects that UK residential RMI 
demand will continue to be weak in 2018 
and, as a consequence, expects that the 
market will contract to a similar extent to 
2017. Given the subdued market backdrop the 
focus of the Division will be on further share 
gains, leveraging the opportunities offered by 
the new facility, new product introductions and 
management of costs and overheads. 
The outlook for ERA’s commercial and light 
infrastructure products remains promising 
in 2018. Tyman plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 24

Business performance 
and developments
SchlegelGiesse had another strong year 
during 2017 as the enlarged hardware and 
seals product proposition continued to gain 
traction in the Division’s core markets. 
Revenue of €125.2 million for the year 
was broadly flat on a like for like basis with 
further growth in EMEAI offset by more 
challenging markets in the UK, China, 
Australia and Latin America. Encouragingly, 
the Division’s second half performance 
improved compared with the first half, 
reflecting good sales growth in Latin 
America and the Middle East and sustained 
improvements in Continental Europe. 
Price increases were achieved by the Division 
during the year, principally in Continental 
Europe, which offset small aggregate volume 
decreases elsewhere in the Group. On a 
reported basis, Revenue increased by 
16.0 per cent, assisted by the full year 
contribution from Giesse.
Reported Underlying Operating Profit 
increased by 27.0 per cent to €14.6 million 
(2016: €11.5 million) and by 19.0 per cent 
on a constant currency like for like basis. 
The largest contributor to the improved 
profitability was the delivery of increased 
synergy benefits during the year.
Underlying Operating Margins in the Division 
increased to 11.6 per cent (2016: 10.0 per cent) 
as SchlegelGiesse made further progress towards 
its medium term target of a 15.0 per cent 
Underlying Operating Margin.

Market
Markets in Europe continued to recover in 
2017 with most countries showing year on 
year market growth. Middle Eastern markets 
saw variable demand patterns through the 
year and Indian markets remained positive. 
China and Asia Pacific markets continued 
to grow, albeit at lower levels than in recent 
years. Latin American markets remained 
subdued in the first half of the year however

the year and intercompany sales to other 
Group Divisions increased to c. €4.0 million.
In 2017 the two Giesse facilities in Bologna, 
Italy, were consolidated onto the larger 
manufacturing site, with an offsite logistics 
warehouse retained for the storage and 
dispatch of finished goods. New general 
managers were appointed during the year in 
Australasia, Brazil, China and the Middle East 
and a new Divisional CFO was recruited.
As at 31 December 2017, in aggregate 
€7.6 million of synergy benefits have been 
recorded from the Giesse acquisition, 
€0.7 million of which have been recorded 
below Underlying Operating Profit and 
€2.2 million of which relate to incremental 
cross selling of products within the Division 
and the Group. The delivered synergies 
represent an increase of approximately 
90.0 per cent over the original targets put 
in place at the date of the acquisition. Total 
costs of the integration of Schlegel and 
Giesse incurred since acquisition were 
€2.7 million.
NPD and investment
The Division has continued to invest in the 
seals and hardware ranges with extensions 
to the Giesse hardware range due to be 
launched in 2018 and new sealing technology 
in advanced testing. The Henlow facility 
moved onto the Divisional SAP platform 
during the year and plans are in process to 
move further facilities onto SAP during 2018. 
Additional investments in manufacturing 
capability and automation are expected 
in 2018.
significant growth with good performance 
recorded in Benelux, Southern Europe and 
the Nordics. The UK was relatively subdued 
with sealing Revenue down 3.4 per cent, 
reflecting general market conditions.
In the Middle East the second half was 
notably stronger than the first half leading 
to Revenue for the year 3.2 per cent ahead 
of 2016. The Division entered 2018 with an 
encouraging order book in the region. The 
business in India continues to grow rapidly 
from a low base with Revenue increasing by 
28.0 per cent in the year.
China and Asia Pacific
China and Asia Pacific markets were more 
challenging for the Division in 2017. In China, 
Revenue decreased by 16.2 per cent due to 
project postponements and cancellations, 
particularly in Southern China. During 2018 
SchlegelGiesse intends to review the 
Division’s route to market in China.
Australasian Revenue was slightly lower 
in 2017 with improved performance in 
New Zealand more than offset by weaker 
trading in the Australian market which 
slowed incrementally in the second half. 
Profitability in the region was enhanced 
by the mix of product sales.
As expected, Revenue in the Pacific Rim was 
lower than last year following changes to 
the route to market made at the end of 
2016. There were some pockets of growth 
in the region, most notably in Vietnam and 
Indonesia. Further penetration of Pacific 
Rim markets remains an opportunity for 
the Division.
Latin America
Revenue in Latin America decreased by 
10.0 per cent across the year, following a very 
subdued first half. The second half of the 
year was much improved in the region, with 
market recovery evident in both Argentina 
and Brazil.
Despite lower sales, profitability in Latin America 
remained in line with the previous year due 
to the savings made from the consolidation 
of the Brazilian sites that took place towards 
the end of 2016. The Latin American region 
remains profitable and cash generative and 
makes an operating margin in line with the 
rest of the Division.
Giesse integration
The integration of Giesse completed with 
the launch of the new Divisional brand 
“SchlegelGiesse” at the start of March 2018. 
The Division now operates through a functional 
reporting structure under a unified executive 
team and with a greatly simplified legal and 
financial structure. 
The Division has a single salesforce in each 
key market selling the complete range of 
hardware, seals and extrusions, supported by 
dedicated product managers. Cross selling 
initiatives within the Division delivered 
€4.0 million of incremental revenue during 
Giesse synergy benefits 
of €7 .6 million have 
been recorded in 2017 , 
representing an increase 
of approximately 
90.0 per cent over 
original targets.”

Outlook
2018 has started promisingly for 
SchlegelGiesse in most geographies.
SchlegelGiesse expects that Continental 
European markets will show broad-based 
incremental growth in 2018 and is well 
placed to take further market share. The 
second half momentum established in the 
Middle East and Latin America is expected 
to continue, with key Brazilian and Argentine 
markets recovering. China and Asia Pacific 
markets are likely to remain variable with 
opportunities for growth in certain countries.  Tyman plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 26

Revenue and profit
Reported Group Revenue increased 
by 14.2 per cent to £522.7 million 
(2016: £457.6 million) assisted by favourable 
exchange movements and the enlarged 
size of the Group. On a constant currency, 
like for like basis, Group Revenue was 1.7 per cent 
ahead of last year, with 2.2 per cent of the 
increase relating to pricing and surcharge 
actions, offset in part by a 0.5 per cent 
decrease in sales volumes. 
Reported Gross Margin was 36.5 per cent 
(2016: 36.5 per cent). Underlying Administrative 
Expenses increased to £114.1 million (2016: 
£97.5 million), with £4.0 million of the 
increase attributable to the impact of 
foreign exchange and the balance 
principally due to the inclusion of Bilco for a 
full twelve months. Centrally incurred costs 
in the year were well controlled at £5.9 million 
(2016: £6.0 million). 
Underlying Operating Profit increased 
by 10.0 per cent to £76.8 million 
(2016: £69.8 million), and decreased by 
1.5 per cent on a constant currency like 
for like basis. The favourable impact on the 
full year Underlying Operating Profit from 
acquisitions, exchange movements and 
pricing actions was partially offset by higher 
input costs and other inflationary increases. 
The Group’s Underlying Operating Margin 
decreased by 60 bps to 14.7 per cent (2016: 
15.3 per cent).
Underlying Profit before Taxation 
increased by 10.0 per cent to £68.3 million 
(2016: £62.1 million), and decreased by 
1.4 per cent on a constant currency like 
for like basis. Reported Profit before Taxation 
increased by 1 7 .6 per cent to £34.5 million 
(2016: £29.4 million).
Materials and input costs
The price of key raw materials and input 
costs is tracked closely by the Group 
to ensure the Divisions are procuring 
product at the optimal price for the 
quantities consumed and are in a 
position to secure price increases from 
customers where required. 
Four principal categories of raw material 
are monitored by reference to the Division 
with the highest usage: steel, oil derivatives, 
zinc and aluminium. Tyman’s largest raw 
material and component purchase is 
steel across many different types and 
grades. Oil derivatives are used in the 
manufacture of seal, extrusion and 
injection-moulded products. Zinc, 
aluminium and associated alloys are 
used in the manufacture of a number 
of hardware products.
In addition, ERA monitors the cost 
of a representative basket of those 
products sourced from the Far East by 
Tyman Sourcing Asia into the UK which is 
influenced by local labour and overhead 
rates, raw material price variations and 
exchange rates.
At a Group level, the pricing of US 
stainless steel is monitored as a proxy 
for the steel category.  Find out more at: www.tymanplc.com 27
Tyman expects a reduction in the 
Underlying effective tax rate in 2018 
of approximately 400 bps to between

Footprint restructuring
As announced in March 2015 and reported 
in previous periods, footprint restructuring 
principally relates to directly attributable costs 
incurred in the ongoing North American footprint 
project. Gross costs attributable to footprint 
restructuring in the year amounted to 
£16.4 million, of which £15.2 million 
(2016: £2.6 million) relates to the 
North American project. 
Credits relating to footprint restructuring 
include £1.8 million relating to the 
respective disposal and exit from the Canton, 
South Dakota, and Sioux Falls, South Dakota, 
facilities, and a reduction of £3.3 million in 
past service costs relating to the expected 
closure of the Rochester post-retirement

M&A and integration
M&A and integration credit of £0.7 million

relate to the net legal, financial, taxation 
and consultancy costs associated with the 
Howe Green acquisition, intellectual property 
defence costs relating to pre-acquisition 
periods as well as the integration of businesses 
acquired in prior years. The credits principally 
comprise £2.3 million associated with the

Bilco (see page 32) together with £0.6 million 
of surplus provisions created an acquisition 
no longer required.

acquired in March 2017 was immaterial.
Profit on disposal of business relates to the 
net deferred consideration for EWS received 
in 2016.
Property provision releases and disposals 
relate to surplus onerous lease provisions 
released in 2016.
Finance costs
Net finance costs increased to £9.4 million 
(2016: £7.8 million). Interest payable on 
bank loans, private placement notes and 
overdrafts increased to £8.2 million 
(2016: £7.8 million) reflecting the rise in 
the Group’s average cost of funds in the 
second half of 2017.
Non-cash movements charged to 
net finance costs in the year include 
amortisation of borrowing costs of 
£0.4 million (2016: £0.4 million), pension 
interest of £0.6 million (2016: £0.5 million) 
and a loss on the revaluation of fair value 
currency hedges of £0.4 million (2016: gain 
of £0.3 million). 
Income from short term bank deposits 
decreased to £0.2 million (2016: £0.5 million).
Underlying net finance costs increased by 
£0.8 million to £8.5 million (2016: £7 .7 million).
Interest rates on borrowings
The Group’s average cost of funds and 
margin payable over the year increased by 
10 bps to 3.4 per cent (2016: 3.3 per cent) 
reflecting the increases in margins payable 
on facility borrowings in the second half of 
the year as well as increased base rates.
Interest rate swap contracts
A portion of the Group’s floating rate 
borrowings are held at fixed rates via interest 
rate swap contracts. At the year end, the 
notional value to swap of the Group’s 
outstanding borrowings under the 
revolving credit facility was 14.0 per cent 
(2016: 14.2 per cent). The weighted average 
fixed rate of the swap contracts was 
1.7 per cent (2016: 1.7 per cent). 
In addition, the Group has issued 
US$100.0 million in aggregate under its US 
Private Placement programme, all of which 
is held at fixed rates. In total, 35.9 per cent 
(2016: 37.2 per cent) of the Group’s 
Underlying Gross Indebtedness is effectively 
held at fixed rates of interest. At 31 
December 2017, the Group held interest 
swap contracts amounting to a fair value 
liability of £0.3 million (2016: £0.3 million). 
During the year, the movement in fair value 
was immaterial (2016: fair value loss of 
£0.2 million). 
Forward exchange contracts
At 31 December 2017, the Group’s portfolio 
of forward exchange contracts at fair value 
amounted to a net asset of £0.1 million 
(2016: £0.5 million). The notional value of 
the portfolio amounted to £10.9 million, 
comprising US$ and Chinese Renminbi 
forward exchange contracts with notional 
values of US$8.5 million and RMB40.0 million 
respectively. These contracts have a range 
of maturities up to 22 May 2018.
During the year, a fair value loss of 
£0.4 million (2016: fair value gain of 
£0.3 million) was recognised directly in 
the income statement. 
Taxation
The Group reported an income tax 
charge of £3.3 million (2016: £8.6 million), 
comprising a current tax charge of £15.0 million 
(2016: £11.4 million) and a deferred tax credit 
of £11.7 million (2016: £2.8 million). The 
deferred tax credit includes a £6.9 million credit 
in respect of the revaluation of the Group’s net 
deferred tax liabilities following the reduction 
in the US Federal tax rate. As this credit is 
exceptional in nature it has been excluded 
from the Group’s Underlying tax charge.
The Underlying tax charge was £20.6 million 
(2016: £18.1 million), representing an 
Underlying effective tax rate for the year 
of 30.1 per cent (2016: 29.2 per cent). 
During 2016 the Group paid corporation tax 
of £15.1 million (2016: £12.7 million) which 
equates to a cash tax rate on Underlying 
Profit before Taxation of 22.1 per cent 
(2016: 20.4 per cent).
US tax legislation and impact on the future 
Group’s Underlying effective tax rate
As the majority of the Group’s operations 
are in the US there will be a significant 
impact on the Underlying effective tax rate 
from the US tax legislation which came into 
force on 1 January 2018. The most significant 
change is to the US Federal tax rate, which has 
reduced from 35.0 per cent to 21.0 per cent. 
The reduced rate applies to a broader tax 
base under the new legislation as certain 
credits and deductions are removed, most 
notably the s199 domestic production 
activities deduction.
In 2018 Tyman will benefit from the lower 
tax rate applied to its US taxable profits; 
however will lose the benefit of the s199 
deduction. Exports from the US account for 
approximately 10.0 per cent of AmesburyTruth’s 
US sales so the Group can expect to gain a 
small benefit from changes to the taxation 
of foreign sourced income. 
In aggregate, Tyman expects a reduction in 
the Underlying effective tax rate in 2018, 
compared with 2017, of approximately 
400 bps to between 26.0 and 27.0 per cent. 
It is not yet clear what incremental tax laws 
or regulations may be introduced in the US 
and Tyman’s Underlying effective tax rate 
will be sensitive to further changes to tax 
legislation or changes to US state tax rates. 
The final Underlying effective tax rate for 
the year will also depend on the Group’s 
geographical mix of taxable profits.
Earnings per share
Basic Earnings Per Share increased 
by 47.0 per cent to 17.61 pence 
(2016: 11.98 pence). Diluted Earnings 
Per Share increased to 17.49 pence 
(2016: 11.93 pence). 
Underlying Earnings Per Share 
increased by 5.9 per cent to 26.91 pence 
(2016: 25.41 pence). Underlying Diluted 
Earnings Per Share increased to 26.73 pence 
(2016: 25.31 pence).
The increase in Earnings Per Share measures 
reflects the improvement in Underlying 
Operating Profit, offset by higher finance 
costs in the year and the higher Underlying 
effective tax rate for the Group. 
Intellectual property defence
The Group incurred higher than normal 
intellectual property defence costs in 2017 
of £1.5 million (2016: £0.9 million). 
£1.2 million of these costs related to the 
successful litigation defence of a significant 
intellectual property claim made against 
AmesburyTruth concerning the Truth casement 
operator product line. The claim looked back 
to 2005 and accordingly £0.8 million of the 
defence costs have been accounted for through 
the utilisation of specific provisions created 
on the acquisition of Truth to cover pre-existing 
intellectual property and warranty claims. 
The balance of the defence costs was 
taken to exceptionals.
Tyman has a portfolio of 1,148 patents, 
trademarks and designs. Where intellectual 
property is threatened or compromised by 
third parties the Group will seek to defend 
its position in order to protect the interests 
of both customers and shareholders. Find out more at: www.tymanplc.com 29
Taxation policy
The Group’s tax affairs are managed 
in accordance with relevant laws and 
regulations in each jurisdiction in which 
the Group operates. The policy ensures that 
the approach to taxation is aligned with 
Tyman’s commercial activities worldwide. 
Tyman follows the terms of double taxation 
treaties and relevant OECD guidelines in 
dealing with issues such as transfer pricing, 
repatriation of profits and the establishment 
of a taxable presence in countries where it 
trades. The Group seeks to engage proactively 
with tax authorities in each of its key 
jurisdictions to ensure that the Group’s 
tax affairs are clearly communicated.
Tyman aims to maintain straightforward 
legal and commercial structures to reduce 
risk and minimise compliance costs. 
Investments made in tax reporting 
systems and personnel across the Group 
have ensured tax reporting, compliance 
and disclosure that is more accurate 
and reliable.
The Group’s key transfer pricing 
arrangements comprise commercial 
agreements relating to trade between 
Group entities, intragroup financing 
and the recharging of shared-service 
administrative costs. Where Group 
entities trade with each other, transfer 
pricing arrangements are appropriate for 
the territories involved and are enacted 
on a consistent basis.
Several factors impact the Group’s 
taxation charge or credit in the income 
statement, including: 
• 
The international nature of the Group’s 
operations. In 2017, 72.0 per cent of 
Tyman’s Underlying operating profits 
before central cost allocations were 
generated in North America, 12.3 per cent 
in the UK and 15.7 per cent in 
SchlegelGiesse’s territories outside the 
UK. The Group’s effective tax rate is 
therefore a function of the interaction 
of currency movements with different 
country, state and local taxation rates 
and allowances.
• 
The proactive capital investment 
programme in each of the Group’s 
Divisions. These investments are 
amortised for tax purposes in 
accordance with the laws relating 
to capital allowances in each country, 
which may not match the Group’s 
depreciation policy.
• 
The footprint rationalisation project 
taking place in North America. The 
Group will not receive tax relief for a 
large portion of the exceptional costs 
accrued for in 2017 until a later period. 
As the costs are largely incurred in the 
US the delay in relief represents a tax cost 
to the Group as tax will be relieved at the 
reduced Federal rate of 21.0 per cent.
• 
Taxable losses generated by Group 
companies. Where these losses can 
be relieved or carried forward to be 
relieved in future periods, Tyman does 
so in accordance with the relevant laws. 
This treatment is, however, broadly 
dependent on sufficient eligible 
taxable profits being generated in 
the relevant jurisdiction.
• 
Certain expenses which cannot be 
relieved against taxable profits. Such 
expenses most notably relate to the 
amortisation and impairment of 
intangible assets and the write-off of 
goodwill arising on acquisition. As the 
Group has developed through acquisition, 
these charges have a material impact 
on the Group’s statutory tax charge as 
a proportion of pre-tax profits. 
• 
The changing attitude of tax authorities 
under the OECD BEPS Project. Under 
Action 2 of the OECD BEPS Project the 
UK government introduced new rules, 
the consequence of which is that more 
financing income is brought into the 
Group’s UK taxable income.
• 
Pricing on intercompany sales within 
SchlegelGiesse, inherited on the acquisition 
of Giesse, require a transfer pricing 
adjustment that will increase the 
taxable profits in Italy.
• 
Group share options and LTIPs will 
generate varying levels of tax relief to 
the Group dependent on the vesting 
outcomes of awards and the share 
price as at the date of vesting.
• 
The Group does not at present make 
material use of special incentive 
arrangements that might impact 
the tax charge such as research and 
development tax credits or patent 
box structures however will keep this 
under review. Tyman plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 30

Free Cash Flow in the year decreased 
by £13.4 million to £31.7 million 
(2016: £45.1 million), due to the £8.2 million 
decrease in Operational Cash Flow, £2.5 million 
higher level of taxation payments on account 
(see Taxation on page 28) and the increase 
in exceptional cash costs (see Exceptional 
items on page 27).
The Group’s Operating Cash Conversion 
in 2017 decreased to 85.6 per cent 
(2016: 105.9 per cent). Over the past five 
years, a period which has seen significant 
capital investment made in the Group, 
Operating Cash Conversion has averaged 
92.9 per cent and each Division remains 
targeted on delivery of 100.0 per cent cash

Bank facilities and US private placement notes
Total facilities available to the Group, as at 7 March 2018, were as follows:

Other facilities Various € €2.2m —
On 19 February 2018, the Group entered 
into the 2018 Facility and incurred upfront 
financing costs of £2. 1 million. The 2018 Facility 
gives the Group access to up to £310.0 million 
of borrowings with seven relationship banks 
and comprises a £240.0 million committed 
revolving credit facility and a £70.0 million 
uncommitted accordion facility. The 2018 
Facility expires in February 2023 although has 
provision for an extension to February 2024. 
On signing the 2018 Facility, the 2014 Facility 
was repaid in full and cancelled. 
Liquidity
At 31 December 2017, the Group had gross 
outstanding borrowings of £206.2 million 
(2016: £217.7 million), cash balances of 
£42.6 million (2016: £40.9 million) and 
committed but undrawn facilities of 
£50.0 million (2016: £46.5 million). 
The 2018 Facility increases the Group’s 
committed but undrawn facilities to 
£111.4 million as at 7 March 2018 together 
with potential access to the uncommitted 
£70.0 million accordion facility. 
Underlying Net Debt at the year end 
was £163.7 million (2016: £176.7 million). 
Under IFRS, which reduces gross debt by the 
unamortised portion of finance arrangement 
fees, net debt was £162.9 million

Cash Generating Units
The Group’s CGUs are defined as three 
operating Divisions. In the opinion of the 
Directors, the Divisions represent the smallest 
groups of assets that independently generate 
cash flows for the Group, consistent with the 
approach adopted in 2016.
During the year, ERA acquired Howe Green 
and assumed responsibility for the Bilco UK 
business. These businesses have been 
substantially integrated with the existing 
ERA business and are now included in the 
ERA reporting segment. The 2016 
comparatives have been restated for the 
AmesburyTruth and ERA segments in 
respect of the Bilco UK reallocation.
Capital expenditure
Gross capital expenditure increased by 
£1.0 million to £16.4 million (2016: £1 5.4 million) 
or 1.27x Depreciation (2016: 1.32x). 
Property, plant and equipment gross 
expenditure increased by £2.8 million to 
£15.4 million (2016: £12.6 million) reflecting 
the Group’s continued programme of targeted 
capital development across the Divisions, 
most notably expenditures on the construction 
and fit out of new facilities in the ERA and 
AmesburyTruth Divisions.
Intangible assets gross expenditure decreased 
by £1.7 million to £1.1 million reflecting the 
conclusion of the AmesburyTruth ERP project 
at the end of Q4 2016.
Net capital expenditure decreased in the 
year to £12.6 million (2016: £15.3 million) 
or 0.98x Depreciation (2016: 1.31x).
Balance sheet – assets and liabilities
Goodwill and intangible assets
At 31 December 2017, the carrying value 
of Group goodwill and intangible assets 
was £427.2 million (2016 restated: 
£475.6 million). Amortisation of intangible 
assets through the income statement during 
the year was £24.2 million (2016: £22.7 million). 
Of the movement in carrying values, £6.0 million 
related to the acquisition of Howe Green and 
£31.0 million to exchange movements. The 
exchange movement reflects the average 
appreciation of Sterling against the US Dollar 
over the year impacting the translation of the 
underlying US$-denominated carrying values 
of intangible assets into the Group’s 
functional currency at the year end. Tyman plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 32

Pension and post‑ retirement medical 
benefit obligations
At 31 December 2017, the Group had four 
post-retirement pension schemes and one 
post-retirement medical benefit scheme in 
operation. Apart from the Italian pension 
scheme, all schemes originate from the US. 
Excluding the Bilco scheme, there was a 
32.9 per cent reduction in the Group’s net 
effective post-retirement benefit obligation 
in the year.
At 31 December 2017, the Group’s gross 
pension and post-retirement medical benefit 
obligations under IAS 19 were £42.8 million 
(2016: £52.7 million). Net obligations at 
31 December 2017 were £12.4 million 
(2016: £17.1 million). 
The AmesburyTruth schemes are closed to 
new entrants. Gross obligations under the 
AmesburyTruth schemes at the year end 
were US$35.4 million (2016: US$39.3 million) 
with US$4.2 million of the reduction due to 
the expected closure of the Rochester, 
New York, post-retirement medical benefit 
plan at the end of 2018.
The Italian scheme relates to TFR termination 
obligations payable to employees of the 
Group’s Italian operations. As at 31 December 
2017 , the Group’s TFR termination obligations 
amounted to €3.4 million (2016: €3.7 million). 
TFR payments made to former Italian 
employees in the year were €0.2 million 
(2016: €0.2 million). TFR termination 
obligations are unfunded.
Cash contributions made to the schemes 
during the year were £1.2 million (2016: 
£0.9 million). Favourable exchange 
movements of £4.2 million were mostly 
offset by interest expense of £1.9 million 
and remeasurement losses of £2.1 million.

Working capital 
At the year end trade working capital, net of 
provisions, was £94.6 million (2016 restated: 
£88.6 million). Of the increase, £0.7 million 
relates to working capital assumed on the 
acquisition of Howe Green and £10.4 million 
relates to the net cash outflow of trade 
working capital across the year, offset by 
£5.1 million exchange movements.
Inventories increased by £4.2 million to 
£75.3 million (2016 restated: £71.1 million). 
The majority of the movement relates to 
temporary investment in inventory at 
AmesburyTruth to support service levels, 
offset by exchange rate movements of 
£4.0 million.
Trade receivables increased by £1.8 million 
to £57.1 million (2016: £55.3 million). There 
was a cash benefit of £0.6 million following 
the full settlement with interest of a long 
outstanding Italian trade receivable, which 
had previously been fully provided for. As 
with the 2016 year, bad debts written off 
in the year as a percentage of Revenue 
were negligible.
Trade payables remained flat at £37.8 million 
with all movements in the year being offset 
by the impact of foreign exchange.
Properties marketed for sale 
At the year end, the following freehold 
properties were being marketed for sale by 
the Group. The Statesville freehold property 
was sold in February 2018 for a consideration 
of US$1.4 million and so has been classified 
in the 2017 financial statements as an asset 
held for sale at the year end.

Property related
Property provisions include provisions 
for onerous leases of £2.1 million 
(2016: £2.8 million) and leasehold dilapidations 
of £1.4 million (2016: £1.0 million). The 
utilisation in the year principally relates 
to costs associated with the Silver End, 
Essex, property. 
Restructuring
Restructuring provisions include provisions 
for ongoing employee redundancy costs at 
certain restructured European business units 
as well as restructuring provisions raised in 
the year relating to the closures of the 
Rochester, New York, and Amesbury, 
Massachusetts, properties. The utilisation in 
the year principally relates to the ongoing 
costs associated with business unit closures. 
Warranty
Warranty provisions include provisions 
for the ultimate cost of settling product 
warranty claims which arose from the 
Group’s M&A activities. The utilisation in the 
year primarily relates to the costs associated 
with US product litigation applied against 
provisions recognised on the acquisition of 
Truth Hardware (see Intellectual property 
defence on page 28).
Balance sheet – equity
Shares in issue
At 31 December 2017 , the total number 
of shares in issue was 178.6 million 
(2016: 178.6 million). In addition, the 
Group held 0.5 million shares in Treasury 
(2016: 0.5 million).
The basic weighted average number of 
shares at the year end was 177.2 million 
(2016: 173.0 million). The diluted weighted 
average number of shares was 178.4 million 
(2016: 173.8 million).
Employee Benefit Trust purchases
At the year end, the Tyman Employees 
Benefit Trust held 0.8 million shares 
(2016: 1.0 million). On 9 March 2017, the 
Trust purchased 267,752 shares in Tyman plc 
at a total cost of £0.8 million to satisfy 
certain share awards vested in March 2017 
as well as future obligations under the 
Group’s various share plans.

Dividend policy
Tyman plc, the Parent Company of the 
Group, is a non-trading investment 
holding company that derives its 
distributable reserves principally 
from dividends received from 
subsidiary companies. 
The Group’s dividend policy targets a 
dividend cover of between 2.00x to 
2.50x underlying earnings per share 
while being mindful of the Group’s near 
term capital requirements. 
The objective of this policy is to:
• align shareholder returns with growth 
in the Group’s profitability;
• reinforce capital discipline; and 
• help ensure that the Group’s shares 
appeal to a wide range of investors.
While the Board’s aim is to deliver 
progressive growth in dividends year on 
year, application of the Group dividend 
policy may lead to dividends paid to 
shareholders reducing in years where 
business performance has been weaker 
than expected or where other near 
term capital priorities are considered 
to be of greater importance.
The application of this policy has 
meant that the Group has delivered 
consistent dividend growth over the last 
five years (see Dividend growth KPI on 
page 16) as the Group’s Underlying 
Earnings Per Share has increased.
The Board considers a number of 
factors that influence the level of dividend 
in any given year. These include:
• the cyclical nature of the industry 
in which the Group operates; 
• the near term capital requirements 
of the business; 
• the level of distributable reserves 
in the Parent Company; and 
• the availability of liquid cash 
resources across the Group.
See pages 38 and 41 for the Group’s 
principal risks and uncertainties which 
may have a negative impact on the 
performance of the Group and may 
influence how the dividend policy 
is implemented. 
Dividends are paid bi-annually. The 
interim dividend, which is typically set 
at around one-third of that year’s total 
dividend, is paid to shareholders in 
September. The final dividend is paid 
to shareholders in May following the 
conclusion of the Annual General Meeting.
A final dividend of 7.75 pence per share 
(2016: 7.50 pence), equivalent to £13.7 million 
based on the shares in issue as at 
31 December 2017, will be proposed at the 
Annual General Meeting (2016: £13.3 million). 
The total dividend declared for the 2017 
financial year is therefore 1 1.25 pence per share 
(2016: 10.50 pence), an increase of 7 .1 per cent. 
This equates to a Dividend Cover of 2.40x, 
towards the upper end of the Group’s target 
range of 2.00x to 2.50x.
The ex-dividend date will be 19 April 2018 
and the final dividend will be paid on 
18 May 2018 to shareholders on the 
register at 20 April 2018.
Dividend payments continue to be well 
funded and covered by cash generated 
across the Group. See commentary on the 
Group’s cash generation, funding and 
liquidity on page 30, as well as details on its 
continuing viability and going concern on 
pages 42 and 43.
Only dividends paid in the year have been 
charged against equity in the 2017 financial 
statements. In aggregate £19.5 million 
(2016: £15.6 million) of dividend payments, 
representing 61.4 per cent of 2017 Free Cash 
Flow, were made to shareholders during 2017. 
At 31 December 2016, the Company’s reserves 
available for distribution to shareholders were 
£199.9 million. Total dividends paid during 
2017 utilised approximately 9.8 per cent of the 
estimated reserves available for distribution at 
the beginning of the year.  Tyman plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 34

Returns on Capital
ROCE decreased by 20 bps to 13.6 per cent (2016: 13.8 per cent) and ROCCE decreased by 60 bps to 49.6 per cent (2016: 50.2 per cent). 
The fall in both measures is principally due to increases in the average capital and controllable capital employed following the 2016 acquisitions. 
The Group continues to target a ROCE of 15.0 per cent over the medium term.
At 31 December 2017, average capital employed was £563.6 million (2016: £505.8 million) and average controllable capital employed was 
£154.8 million (2016: £139.0 million). The Group continues to target a ROCE of 15.0 per cent over the medium term.

The Group targets a run rate ROAI in 
excess of 15.0 per cent two years 
post-completion of an acquisition. The 
ROAI takes account of all the costs of 
an acquisition, together with the costs 
of integration and any material capital 
investment required. The target ROAI is 
designed to ensure that each acquisition 
delivers a return significantly in excess 
of the Group’s Acquisition Enterprise 
Value (see Alternative Performance

3 Underlying Operating Profit impact.
4  Defined as the approximate favourable translation impact on the Group’s Underlying Operating Profit of a 1c decrease in the Sterling exchange rate of the respective currency.
The net effect of currency translation 
caused Revenue and Underlying Operating 
Profit from ongoing operations to increase 
by £21.5 million and £3.7 million respectively 
compared with 2016. This result is driven by a 
combination of the increase in the proportion 
of the Group reporting in currencies other 
than Sterling as well as average Sterling 
exchange rates compared with major 
currencies being lower than in 2016. 
Transactional exposure
Divisions that purchase or sell products 
in currencies other than their functional 
currency will potentially incur transactional 
exposures. For purchases by ERA from the 
Far East, these exposures are principally 
Sterling/US Dollar or Chinese Renminbi. 
For purchases by SchlegelGiesse’s 
Australian business from the US and 
the Far East, these exposures are 
principally Australian Dollar/US Dollar 
or Chinese Renminbi.
The Group’s policy is to recover adverse 
transactional currency movements 
through price increases or surcharges. 
Divisions typically buy currency forward 
to cover expected future purchases for 
up to around six months. The objective 
is to achieve an element of certainty in 
the cost of landed goods and to allow 
sufficient time for any necessary price 
changes to be implemented.
The 2017 transactional impact of 
weakness in Sterling against the US Dollar 
and Chinese Renminbi on the Operating 
Profit of ERA was approximately a cost of 
£3.2 million (2016: £1.5 million). In the year 
ERA benefited from surcharge recoveries of 
£3.7 million (2016: £0.7 million) and gains on 
hedges of £0.2 million (2016: £0.8 million).
The Group’s other transactional exposures 
generally benefit from the existence of 
natural hedges or are immaterial. 
Currency in the consolidated balance sheet
The Group aims to mitigate the translational 
impact of exchange rate movements by 
denominating a proportion of total borrowings 
in those currencies where there is a material 
contribution to Underlying Operating Profit. 
Tyman’s banking facility allows for funds to 
be drawn in many different currencies. 
Giesse has made a significant contribution 
to the Group since its acquisition in 
March 2016 and has materially exceeded the 
Group’s minimum target return threshold on 
both a run rate and annualised basis. 
The ROAI for Bilco has increased as synergy 
benefits have started to be realised in the 
year. Bilco is expected to exceed the minimum 
run rate target return threshold within two 
years of acquisition. 
Howe Green has been owned by the Group 
for ten months at the year-end and has 
performed encouragingly since acquisition. 
Currency
Currency in the consolidated 
income statement
The principal foreign currencies that impact 
the Group’s results are the US Dollar, the Euro, 
the Australian Dollar and the Canadian Dollar. 
On average in 2017 , each of these currencies 
were materially stronger than Sterling.

New IFRS (unaudited)
The following IFRS, which have not been adopted in the 2017 financial statements, were in issue but not yet effective:
Standard Name Effective date
Likely
impact
IFRS 9 financial instruments 1 Jan 2018 Immaterial
IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers 1 Jan 2018 Immaterial
IFRS 16 Leases 1 Jan 2019 Relatively significant
IFRS 9 Financial instruments
IFRS 9 provides revised guidance on the 
classification, impairment and measurement 
of financial assets and hedge accounting.
Tyman is in the process of assessing the 
impact of adopting IFRS 9 with the main 
areas of consideration being hedge accounting, 
impairment of accounts receivable and 
refinancing transactions. Based on the 
work undertaken to date, the adoption of 
IFRS 9 is not expected to have a material 
impact on the Group financial statements. 
IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts 
with customers
IFRS 15 provides revised guidance on revenue 
recognition and establishes principles for the 
reporting of information about the nature, 
timing, amount and uncertainty of revenue 
and cash flows from contracts with customers. 
Tyman is in the process of assessing the 
impact of adopting IFRS 15 and notes that 
Revenue of the Group is transactional in nature 
with limited judgement applied in recognising 
the amounts recorded. In addition, contracts 
with customers are predominantly based on 
standard terms and conditions. Based on the 
work undertaken to date, the adoption of IFRS 
15 is not expected to have a material impact 
on the Group financial statements.
IFRS 16 Leases
IFRS 16 requires lessees to recognise almost 
all lease contracts on the balance sheet, 
with optional exemptions for certain leases 
of a short term or low-value nature. Instead 
of operating lease costs being recognised in 
the income statement, a “right of use asset” 
depreciation charge will be recognised within 
operating profit and a lease interest expense 
will be recognised within finance costs. 
The adoption of IFRS 16 is expected to be 
relatively significant to the Group’s financial 
statements and the Group’s assessment of 
the likely impact is ongoing.
2018 summary guidance
Exceptional costs are expected to be 
c. £4.0–£5.0 million reflecting M&A and 
integration costs associated with Ashland 
Hardware and footprint projects. The IFRS 3 
change in respect of the proposed Ashland 
acquisition has yet to be estimated. 
Exceptional costs cash paid in 2018 are 
expected to be c. £9.0–£10.0 million.
Interest payable on borrowings for the full 
year is expected to be c. £10.0–£11.0 million. 
The actual amount payable will be dependent 
on Leverage and the currency of borrowing. 
The non-cash amortisation and accelerated 
amortisation of capitalised borrowing costs 
is expected to be c. £1.1 million.
The Underlying effective tax rate for Tyman in 
2018 is expected to be c. 26.0 to 27.0 per cent 
reflecting the reduced US Federal tax rate 
that will apply to the Group’s US profits. 
2018 cash taxation rates are expected to 
be broadly in line with the Group’s 2018 
Underlying effective tax rate. 
Trade working capital trough to peak for 
the year is expected to be c. £15.0–£20.0 
million with the working capital peak 
occurring around the half year. 
Maintenance and investment capital 
expenditure for the year for the Group is 
expected to be c. £18.0–£20.0 million. 
Share purchases by the Employee Benefit 
Trust to satisfy LTIP and other share plan 
awards are expected to be c. £2.0–£3.0 million. 
The share-based payments charge will be 
c. £1.1 million. Tyman plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 36

Identifying and managing risk
The Group has policies and procedures in

identified, evaluated and managed at the 
appropriate level within the business. The 
identification of risks and opportunities, the 
development of action plans to manage the 
risks and maximise the opportunities, and 
the continual monitoring of progress against 
agreed plans are integral parts of the 
business process and core activities 
throughout the Group.

Responsibilities for and structure of risk management
Responsible body Areas of responsibility
Board
Overall responsibility for risk management. Defines the Group’s risk appetite and 
culture. Reviews principal risks and uncertainties every six months and provides 
direction and tone of risk management.
Audit Committee
Assurance of the internal control and risk management systems.
Risk Management Committee
Regular review of risk registers and implementation of mitigation plans. 
Executive and divisional management
Day-to-day operational management and management of risk. Design and 
implementation of the necessary systems of risk assessment and internal control.
Each Division maintains a comprehensive risk 
register which assesses all pertinent risks relevant 
to that Division, including operational, financial, 
compliance and strategic risks. These risk 
registers are reviewed on a regular basis by the 
functional heads within each Division. As a 
result of these reviews, the assessment of each 
risk is monitored and where necessary updated 
using a scoring system which seeks to assess 
the likelihood and the financial effect of the 
relevant risks. Against this an assessment is 
made of the controls that are in place to 
mitigate the relevant risk. The Risk Management 
Committee formally reviews each Division’s 
risk register four times a year.
A shorter register of principal risks is specifically 
reserved for review by the Board. This is mainly, 
but not exclusively, comprised of risks after 
mitigation and above a certain threshold. 
These principal risks and uncertainties are 
reported in the Annual Report.
The Board has overall responsibility for 
reviewing the effectiveness of the risk 
management and internal control systems 
in the Group. The Audit Committee, on 
behalf of the Board, reviews the overall 
system of risk management, details of 
which are described below. 
Risk management and internal control
The Board has overall responsibility for the 
Group’s system of internal control and for 
reviewing its effectiveness. 
The internal control systems are designed to 
meet the particular needs of the Group and to 
manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure 
to achieve business objectives. Such systems 
can only provide reasonable and not absolute 
assurance against material misstatement or loss.
Through the work of the internal and 
external auditors and the reports to the 
Audit Committee, the Committee is satisfied 
that any audit issues raised by either the 
internal or external auditors are managed 
and resolved effectively by management.
Key elements of internal control and risk management systems: Tyman response:
There is a clearly defined management structure. A framework of policies and procedures covering authority levels, responsibilities and 
accountabilities is in use throughout the Group.
A three‑ year strategic plan is prepared for the 
Board’s consideration each year.
The strategic plan is appraised in light of the strategic and other relevant risks and 
uncertainties faced by the Group, the resources available and its objectives.
Managers are responsible for the identification 
and evaluation of significant risks in their area 
of business, together with the design and 
operation of suitable internal controls.
The Group has a detailed risk management process, which identifies the key risks faced 
by each Division and the Group as a whole and the actions and controls required to 
manage and mitigate these risks. Divisional risk registers are reviewed each quarter by 
the Risk Management Committee, which reports back to the Audit Committee.
The Board approves the annual financial budget. Performance against these targets is monitored monthly and reported on at Board 
meetings and reasons for divergences are discussed.
There are established procedures for planning, 
approving and monitoring capital expenditure 
and major projects.
Board approval is required for all major investment, divestment and strategic plans 
and projects.
The Group operates an effective Group 
reporting and consolidation system. 
Written monthly reports, management accounts and key performance indicators 
analysing performance by operating unit are reviewed with each Division every month 
by senior management. 
An annual review is performed on the 
effectiveness of the system of internal control. 
The Committee receives regular reports throughout the year to assure itself that the 
Group’s internal control systems comply with the requirements of the Code. 
Divisional management is required to implement base financial and other controls in 
line with a clear set of detailed Group policies relating to financial reporting and other 
accounting matters and to act in accordance with the Group Code of Conduct. Each 
Division completes a bi-annual self-certification of compliance and implementation of 
internal controls by its businesses which is submitted to the Committee for review.
The internal and external audits test various aspects of internal controls, including  their 
adequacy and effectiveness. The findings of internal and external audits, together with 
improvement recommendations and management responses, are  shared with the Committee. 
Operating units produce plans to improve 
controls relating to key risks and any 
significant weaknesses identified by 
internal and external audits.
The Audit Committee monitors the progress against these plans to ensure that any 
corrective actions to the internal control procedures are made in a timely manner.
The internal control regime is supported by the 
operation of independent whistleblower 
reporting functions. 
A whistleblowing system is operated by specialist external third party service providers and 
allows employees to report concerns anonymously and in confidence. All reports are received 
by the Group Company Secretary. A full investigation is carried out following the receipt of 
each report, with the results of the investigation being reported directly to the Board.  Tyman plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 38

Principal risks and uncertainties
Principal risks
The Directors confirm they have carried out 
a robust assessment of the principal risks 
facing the Company, including those that 
would threaten its business model, future 
performance, solvency or liquidity. The table 
on pages 39 and 41 sets out the principal 
risks and uncertainties facing the Group at 
the date of this report and how they are 
being managed or mitigated. The principal 
risks do not comprise all the risks that the 
Group may face. 
In accordance with the provisions of the Code, 
the Board has taken into consideration the 
principal risks in the context of determining 
whether to adopt the going concern basis of 
accounting and when assessing the prospects 
of the Company for the purpose of preparing 
the Viability statement. The going concern 
statement can be found on page 43 and 
the Viability statement can be found on 
page 42 of the Strategic report.
Main developments in risk
The Group has recognised information 
security as a new principal risk, reflecting the 
increased level, frequency and sophistication 
of IT threats that the Group currently faces. 
Business integration is no longer considered to 
be a principal risk as at 31 December 2017 . The 
integrations of the three businesses acquired in 
2016, Bilco, Giesse and Response, have 
substantially been completed. Howe Green, 
acquired in March 2017, continues to be 
integrated according to plan and is 
immaterial in the context of the Group. 
Should the Group acquire further material 
business during the course of 2018 then 
business integration will be reinstated as 
a principal risk.
While the UK’s vote to leave the 
European Union continues to create 
uncertainty in the UK economy, this is 
not expected to have a material impact 
on the Group.
Heat map
The heat map below shows the relative 
positioning of the Group’s principal risks 
by the severity of their impact and the 
probability of occurrence. The heat map 
shows the Board’s assessment of the principal 
risks before any mitigating controls and actions. 
The Group has adopted strategies to reduce 
these inherent risks to an acceptable level 
and more details of this are set out in the 
table on pages 39 to 41.

Description
Demand in the building products sector 
is dependent on levels of activity in new 
construction and residential and commercial 
RMI markets. This demand is cyclical 
and can be unpredictable and the Group 
has a low visibility of future orders from 
its customers.
Description
The Group may face significant competition 
in its markets, including competition from 
global competitors with large capital resources. 
Competition in the industry is based on: 
range and quality of products offered; 
geographical reach; product development; 
reputation; and customer relationships. 
Demand may also be impacted by 
competitor disruptive behaviour.
Description
The success of the Group is dependent on 
the continuation of satisfactory commercial 
relationships with its major customers. 
In 2017 the top five customers accounted 
for 22.1 per cent of total Group Revenue. 
Mitigation
In previous cyclical downturns Tyman has 
proved effective in responding to events:
• 
maintaining appropriate headroom 
and tenor in the Group’s available 
borrowing facilities;
• 
the geographic spread of the 
Group’s business; 
• 
the ability to flex the Group’s cost base; 
• 
 pricing and gross margin management;
• 
 planning, budgeting and forecasting 
processes; and
• 
 offering industry-leading customer service.
As part of its process for assessing the 
ongoing viability of the Group, the Board 
regularly stress tests the Group’s financial 
and cash flow forecasts.
Mitigation
Some of the Group’s markets are relatively 
concentrated with two or three key players, 
while others are highly fragmented and offer 
significant opportunities for consolidation 
and penetration. 
Tyman continues to differentiate itself 
through its wide range of products, its focus 
on setting industry-leading standards for 
delivery on time and in full, its technical 
support and its geographical spread, new 
product development, strategic focus 
and reputation. 
The Group aims to minimise the impact of 
aggressive pricing by competitors through 
a low-cost manufacturing strategy 
supported by its programmes of new 
product development, continual process 
improvements and building long term 
relationships with its customers based on 
value, quality, service and added value 
technical support.
Mitigation
Each Division develops strategic customer 
plans which include high level engagement 
through business review meetings to identify 
service issues and product development 
opportunities on a timely basis.
Management continues to invest in training 
for its sales teams. The Divisions aim to 
provide a speedy response to sub-standard 
OTIF performance or product quality. Where 
a Division identifies a broader category of 
customer that may be at risk, specific 
mitigation plans are put in place such 
as the changes made in 2017 to the 
AmesburyTruth route to market for 
smaller customers. Tyman plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 40

Our strategy
Description
The raw materials used in the Group’s 
businesses include commodities that 
experience price volatility (such as oil 
derivatives, steel, aluminium and zinc). The 
Group’s ability to meet customer demands 
depends on obtaining timely supplies of 
high quality components and raw materials 
on competitive terms. Product or raw 
material may become unavailable from a 
supplier due to events beyond our control. 
Description
Rationalisation of the Group footprint is 
expected to produce more efficient 
manufacturing processes, shorter 
development times for bringing new 
products to market, a reduction in internal 
freight costs, a more efficient deployment 
of personnel and a reduction in divisional 
overheads. There is a risk that changes will 
be disruptive and that these projects may 
cost more than originally planned and may 
not deliver the expected benefits. 
Description
The Group operates internationally and 
is therefore exposed to transactional and 
translational foreign exchange movements 
in currencies other than Sterling. In particular 
the Group’s translated Underlying Operating 
Profit is impacted by the Sterling exchange 
rate with the US Dollar and the Euro. 
The Group is also exposed to interest rate 
risks on its external translated borrowings. 
In 2017 , 77 .7 per cent of the Group’s 
Underlying Operating Profit was derived 
from North American operations.
Mitigation
The Group continues to invest in and improve 
its sourcing and procurement capability with 
dedicated supply chain resources. The Group 
manages supply chain risk through strong 
long term relationships with suppliers, risk 
assessment and audit of key suppliers, review 
of make or buy policies, economies of 
purchasing, dual sourcing, adequate safety 
stock and inventory management. The 
Group maintains product quality by ongoing 
testing up to and beyond the industry 
standards. Commodity price inflation 
continues to be a risk for the Group. In 
response, the Group will increase selling 
prices or apply surcharges to recover 
unavoidable input cost increases.
Mitigation
The Group mitigates this risk by extensive 
upfront analysis, planning and risk assessment, 
with multi-disciplined project teams, supported 
by dedicated professional project 
management resources.
During 2017 ERA has completed the 
substantial part of its move to i54, 
a consolidated distribution site in the 
West Midlands. AmesburyTruth completed 
moves to new greenfield sites in Sioux Falls and 
Statesville and has completed a substantial 
expansion of its Juarez plant. Schlegel has 
completed the footprint consolidation 
resulting from the Giesse acquisition.
Mitigation
The Group denominates a proportion 
of its debt in foreign currency to align its 
exposure to the translational balance sheet 
risks associated with overseas subsidiaries. 
Ancillary bank facilities are utilised to manage 
the foreign exchange transactional risks 
and interest rate exposure through the use 
of derivative financial instruments. Where 
possible the Group will recover the impact 
of adverse exchange movements on the 
cost of imported products and materials 
from customers.

Liquidity and credit risks
Description
Information and data systems are 
fundamental to the successful operation 
of Tyman’s businesses. The Group’s digital 
assets are under increasing risk from 
hacking, viruses and “phishing” threats. 
Sensitive employee, customer, banking 
and other data may be stolen and distributed 
or used illegally. The new GDPR could 
increase the cost of failures to protect 
the Group’s digital assets.
Description
The Group’s future success is substantially 
dependent on the continued services and 
performance of its Executive Directors and 
senior management and its ability to continue 
to attract and retain highly skilled and 
qualified personnel throughout the Divisions.
Description
The Group must maintain sufficient 
capital and financial resources to finance 
its current financial obligations and fund 
the future needs of its growth strategy.
Mitigation
The Group continues to develop and test 
regularly disaster recovery plans for all sites. 
The Group undertakes regular penetration 
testing of data systems and maintains up 
to date versions of software and firewalls. 
The Group periodically reviews IT system 
controls, with the help of tailored internal 
audit programmes developed by BDO. The 
Group engages specialist resources to review 
its plans for GDPR.
Mitigation
The Remuneration Committee and the 
Nominations Committee mitigate the risk 
of losing key personnel through robust 
succession planning, strong recruitment 
processes, long term management incentives 
and retention initiatives. Each Division 
maintains talent development and succession 
plans, supported by adequately funded training.
Mitigation
The Group maintains adequate cash 
balances and credit facilities with sufficient 
headroom and tenor to mitigate credit 
availability risk. The Group monitors 
forecast and actual cash flows to match 
the maturity profiles of financial assets 
and liabilities. The Group aims to operate 
within its target leverage range of 1.50x to 
2.00x EBITDA at the year end throughout 
the cycle. 
Since the year end the Group has 
increased and extended its banking 
facilities to at least February 2023.

Viability statement
Strategy and appetite for risk
The Group’s strategy, details of which are 
set out on pages 12 to 13, aims to create 
shareholder value through offering residential 
and commercial customers the complete 
range of door and window components 
across hardware, seals and extrusions. 
Tyman’s business model, details of which are 
set out on pages 10 and 11, is flexible and 
adaptable and aims to ensure that the Group 
is able to service its customers effectively and 
provide them with a differentiated product 
offering at an appropriate price supported 
by high standards of quality and service. 
Both the business model and the strategy are 
central to understanding the future prospects 
for the Group. This strategy has been in place 
for several years and is subject to regular 
monitoring and development by the Board. 
Decisions relating to major investment projects, 
including all M&A transactions, are approved 
by the Board. The Board is prepared to adopt 
an appropriate amount of risk and would 
characterise the Group’s risk appetite as 
moderate. The Board continues to take a 
conservative approach to the assessment of less 
certain future benefits such as those derived 
from integration and rationalisation projects. 
Assessment of prospects
Tyman’s longer term prospects are assessed 
through the Group’s strategic planning process. 
This process includes a review of Divisional 
three-year rolling strategic plans by the 
Executive Directors in conjunction with the 
Tyman Management Committee and 
functional leaders within each Division. The 
Board participates in the process through 
regular meetings with the Divisional senior 
management, visits to Divisional facilities 
and strategic updates, including strategy 
away days. 
The output of this assessment is a consolidated 
set of financial projections for the Group that 
takes account of Tyman’s principal risks (see 
pages 39 and 41), and explicitly covers the 
period of the next three years. A central review 
of forecast debt covenant compliance and 
debt headroom is also completed. 
The annual Group budget is compiled in the 
autumn of each year and generates a detailed 
forecast for the year ahead. As part of this 
process the strategic plan financial projections 
are refreshed. The strategic plan reviewed as 
part of the assessment of prospects in this 
report therefore covers the three-year period 
ending 31 December 2020. 
Since the year end the Group has renewed, 
extended and increased its committed banking 
facilities to at least February 2023 which 
provides Tyman with significant financial 
headroom to achieve its objectives and extends 
beyond the life of the strategic plan. 
Key assumptions 
The key assumptions underpinning the 2017 
to 2020 strategic plan include:
• 
average market growth forecasts in line 
with local consensus; 
• 
no loss of significant customers;
• 
conservative forecasts of market share 
growth, selling price increases and the 
impact of new product development;
• 
conservative forecasts of the benefits 
from existing major rationalisation 
projects; and
• 
no impact from future acquisitions 
or disposals. 
Assessment of viability
In accordance with provision C.2.2 of the Code, 
the Directors have assessed the viability of 
the Group over a three-year period. This 
assessment takes account of the Group’s 
current trading position and the potential 
impact of the principal risks and the mitigating 
actions documented on pages 39 to 41 of 
the Annual Report. 
Consistent with 2016, the Directors have 
determined that three years is an appropriate 
timeframe over which to provide a viability 
statement, as this is the timeframe currently 
adopted by the Board as its strategic 
planning period. 
A three-year period aligns with the Group’s 
typical investment time horizon and with the 
performance measurement period for the 
Tyman Long Term Incentive Plan under the 
Remuneration Policy. In addition, the Directors 
consider that demand in the Group’s business 
is ultimately driven by consumer confidence 
and discretionary spending patterns which 
are difficult to project accurately beyond 
a three-year time horizon. 
The strategic plan therefore reflects the 
Directors’ best estimate of the future prospects 
of the business over the three-year period. 
In order to assess the Group’s viability over 
this period, the strategic plan has been flexed 
by overlaying the cumulative financial impact 
of a number of downside scenarios to represent 
“severe but plausible” circumstances that the 
Group might experience. These scenarios are 
based on the potential financial outcomes 
of certain of the Group’s principal risks 
crystallising such as a severe deterioration 
in market conditions, loss of business to 
competitors and loss of major customers. 
Assessment of
prospects Find out more at: www.tymanplc.com 43
The downside scenarios applied to the strategic plan are summarised below:
Severe but plausible scenarios:
Strategic plan flexed for combinations 
of the following scenarios: Link to principal risks and uncertainties: Level of severity tested: Conclusion:
Severe downturn in 
market conditions 
Aggressive competitor 
actions resulting in a severe 
loss of market share
The loss of major customers
Market conditions
Competitors
Loss of major customers
• 
22.0 per cent fall in Revenue 
in year one followed by flat 
revenues in the following 
two years
• 
£15.0 million one-off 
exceptional cash cost 
in year one
This cumulative scenario is 
significantly worse than the 
reductions experienced by the 
Group during the last downturn 
in 2007 to 2009. Tyman, after 
undertaking mitigating actions, 
should be able to withstand the 
impact of these severe but 
plausible scenarios.
Reverse stress test scenarios:
Strategic plan flexed for combinations 
of the following scenarios: Link to principal risks and uncertainties: Level of severity tested: Conclusion:
Extreme downturn in 
market conditions
Aggressive competitor 
actions resulting in extreme 
loss of market share
The loss of major customers
Market conditions
Competitors
Loss of major customers
• 
27.0 per cent fall in Revenue in 
year one followed by 8.0 per 
cent fall in revenues in each of 
the following two years
• 
£15.0 million one-off 
exceptional cash cost 
in year one
This level of performance 
deterioration is considered 
extreme and highly implausible 
and would make the future viability 
of the Group less certain.
The flexed models take account of the 
availability and likely effectiveness of 
mitigating actions available to the Group, 
including the flexing of working capital, 
capital expenditure and discretionary spend, 
as well as Tyman’s ability to change its 
capital structure if necessary through 
refinancing existing debt facilities and/or 
raising equity finance.
Viability statement
Based on their assessment of the prospects 
for the Group and principal risks and the 
viability assessment above, the Directors 
confirm that they have a reasonable 
expectation that the Group will be able to 
continue in operation and meet its liabilities 
as they fall due over the period to 
31 December 2020.
Going concern 
As a consequence of the work undertaken 
to support the Viability statement above, the 
Directors have continued to adopt the going 
concern basis in preparing the financial 
statements (see note 2.2 Going concern 
in the notes to the financial statements). Tyman plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 44

Sustainability
Focusing on our
responsibilities
People
The Group employs nearly 4,000 people, 
and through their expertise, experience 
and contribution Tyman is able to deliver 
operational excellence. 
The sustainability of the Group’s business is 
dependent upon attracting people of the 
right quality, skills and behaviours that match 
with the Tyman Code of Conduct and in 
developing each individual by recognising 
the contribution they make through ongoing 
development and appropriate reward.
The Code of Conduct was developed to provide 
common principles and best practice 
standards to an increasingly large and 
geographically diverse organisation. The 
Code of Conduct covers the overarching 
principles by which every employee working 
in the Group is expected to behave and how 
Tyman expects its customers, suppliers and 
other stakeholders to operate to an equivalent 
standard. The Code of Conduct is now included 
in each Division’s handbook which ensures 
every new recruit is fully aware of the 
standards expected of them. 
Each of the Group’s Divisions operates in 
accordance with its own policies and 
procedures, which are consistent with the 
principles and values set out in this Code.
Employees
The Board recognises delivery of the Group 
strategy is dependent on providing operational 
efficiencies, through process scrutiny, delivered 
by talented and skilled employees. Please 
see page 12 for more information on this 
aspect of Group strategy. 
The loss of key personnel is a recognised 
risk (see page 41) and therefore, to mitigate 
this, each Division has policies on recruitment 
processes, talent development and succession 
plans, supported by adequately funded 
training and long term management 
incentives and retention initiatives.

Each Division 
seeks to develop 
every member 
of its workforce 
by providing 
them with the 
right level of 
ongoing training.”
Each Division seeks to develop every member 
of its workforce by providing them with the 
right level of ongoing training, whether this 
is product knowledge, manufacturing 
process development or policy and 
management training.
During the year the Group invested in a wide 
variety of training programmes to support 
both stated strategy and risk mitigation.
AmesburyTruth engaged external providers 
to provide focused OGSM 4.3 management 
level training and development programmes 
for selected employees together with an 
online training platform for all areas of the 
business, providing wide coverage on a 
variety of training areas via a training 
portal. As part of succession planning and 
talent management a number of high 
potential individuals have been selected to 
participate in team building exercises and 
tailored development training programmes. 
An internship programme selected seven 
interns who participated in job training 
during 2017. Participants were recruited 
from universities across the Midwest of 
America and gained experience in 
engineering, sales, supply chain and 
operations. AmesburyTruth continued its 
tuition reimbursement programme where 
employees can pursue a degree course 
which is directly related to their employment. 
SchlegelGiesse focused on NVQ training 
in a number of product and production 
related areas, including direct product training, 
creativity in innovation and marketing and 
communications. As part of its apprenticeship 
schemes, SchlegelGiesse renewed its 
collaboration with the University of Bologna 
Engineering Department and hosted students 
for research programmes within the business. 
ERA supported skills training through the 
UK Apprenticeship Schemes for customer 
services and business administration. 
Management development programmes 
were completed for senior managers in 
project management. Apprentices were 
also recruited for the Howe Green business.
More informal training is carried out via 
individual product training, tool box talks and 
notice boards, populated when necessary to 
provide news and information.
Employees are reviewed annually to assess 
performance against established goals and 
as part of this process development 
opportunities are considered. 
The importance of frequent and consistent 
communications to everyone within the Group 
is recognised and therefore each Division 
participates in frequent staff engagement on 
a number of levels, in different mediums and 
on a variety of topics.  Tyman plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 46
Strategic report Governance and Directors’ report Financial statements
People continued
Employees continued
The aim of these communications is to ensure 
everyone is kept informed of progress being 
made by their own unit and the Division as a 
whole. The frequency of communications 
ranges from monthly newsletters and site 
meetings with all employees to quarterly 
team meetings and staff group representations. 
Topics include information of recent personnel 
changes, health and safety updates, and 
community activities. During the year 
AmesburyTruth conducted an employee 
engagement survey throughout the US 
facilities, the results of which will be shared 
with all employees, including the actions 
and responses to the results.
Diversity
Tyman’s employment policies and practices 
require that an individual’s skills, experience 
and talent are the sole determinants in 
recruitment and career development rather 
than age, beliefs, disability, ethnic origin, 
gender, marital status, religion and sexual 
orientation. The Group is committed to 
supporting employment policies and practices 
that make provision for equal opportunities 
and non-discrimination, and that comply 
with relevant local legislation and accepted 
employment practice codes. 
Within the Group local diversity and unconscious 
bias training has been conducted during the 
year. All salaries are linked to job evaluations 
to promote equality of opportunity. As at 
31 December 2017 the Board had female 
representation of 33.0 per cent. Female 
representation at senior management level 
was 21.0 per cent (2016: 29.0 per cent). 
Across the global workforce there was 
41.0 per cent female representation 
(2016: 40.0 per cent). The change in female 
representation at senior management level 
reflects a slightly enlarged management 
structure, with those moving into these 
positions being primarily male. These figures 
reflect the challenges faced by the Group 
operating in a manufacturing environment. 
As part of the work of the Nominations 
Committee on succession planning, together 
with the Remuneration Committee’s 
continued review of the gender pay gap 
analysis, this topic will receive further scrutiny 
during 2018. 
Gender pay gap reporting
Under UK legislation, all organisations with 
250 employees or more are required to publish 
data which demonstrates the pay differential 
between male and female employees. 
In the UK, Tyman has two operational 
divisions, ERA and SchlegelGiesse, and a 
small Group head office. None of these 
entities have a payroll that exceeds 
250 employees. At present, there is no legal 
requirement for any one of these employing 
companies to publish their pay differential 
data. However, it is recognised there are 
benefits to Tyman in compiling and publishing 
this information. In addition, Tyman expects 
that in future years it may have a legal 
requirement to report this data; this will in 
part be determined by the size of the 
payrolls within any one Division.
The results show the mean difference 
between male and female pay is 21.0 per 
cent and the median difference is 11.0 per 
cent. This data demonstrates that despite 
the high number of males in each pay 
quartile in comparison to the number 
of female employees, both results compare 
favourably to the national gender pay gap 
median of gross hourly earnings which is 
21.9 per cent for all employees in 
manufacturing industry. 
The data highlights the challenges Tyman 
faces when looking to attract females 
into a traditionally male manufacturing 
organisation. The proportion of female 
employees in the Tyman workforce in the UK 
is 26.0 per cent, with the majority of females 
employed by the Group working in support, 
light assembly or warehousing activities. 
The full statement on gender pay reporting 
can be found on the Group’s website.

Health and safety
The Board recognises its responsibility for 
the health and wellbeing of everyone 
employed by the Group, part of which is 
providing a safe environment in which to 
work, free from accident or incident.
As can be seen by the performance of the 
Group’s overall health and safety statistics for 
2017, there has been a deterioration in the 
injury and lost time rates, including in the 
severity rates of accidents that have occurred. 
This is highly disappointing to everyone 
concerned in all aspects of health and 
safety, throughout the Group, as there has 
been considerable time, effort and focus on 
this topic during the year. This result is 
primarily caused by a deteriorating rate in 
Mexico, in part caused by the rapid expansion 
of the Juarez workforce. A number of initiatives 
are underway, including engagement with 
all employees to develop an improved health 
and safety culture in this facility. 
As part of the continued focus on health and 
safety during the year, each Division has engaged 
with every member of staff to further embed 
the Tyman health and safety culture.
ERA supported regular health and safety 
training for all staff, including managers, 
in areas such as manual handling, DSE 
assessments and driver awareness training 
for all mobile workers. ERA also conducted 
a Division wide staff health and safety 
culture questionnaire with the results 
being communicated with the staff at 
specific team briefings. The move to the 
new i54 site in Wolverhampton has provided 
management the opportunity of combining 
three locations into one site and bringing 
health and safety focus into one dedicated 
role for all UK staff. All ERA sites are 
ISO 9001 accredited.
SchlegelGiesse has embarked on a 
three-year programme, “Creating a Safer 
Working Environment” of safety initiatives, 
which aims to establish and embed a new 
organisational structure, with roles and 
responsibilities aligned with health and

safety, with a newly appointed Divisional 
Health and Safety Manager.
AmesburyTruth is well advanced with safety 
programmes and used the US National 
Safety Week to reinforce the safety message, 
with a video communication to all employees. 
Follow-up facility audits have been carried 
out by an external third party at five sites, 
with recommended actions being taken. 
Ad-hoc site audits are also carried out by 
the Divisional Health and Safety Manager 
to ensure ongoing compliance with safety 
systems. Further initiatives carried out 
during the year included the identification 
of health and safety champions for each site 
to keep health and safety at the forefront of 
all operations. Should an incident occur, a 
four-person panel, independent of the 
operations, carries out an internal review of 
the causes of the accident, actions required 
to prevent a repeat occurrence and lessons 
learnt to assist with an improved safety 
culture. The Health and Safety Manual 
was also updated, distributed and signed by 
all employees, including new employees as 
part of the onboarding process. A number of 
other initiatives are also underway, including 
occupational athletics, a programme 
designed to help staff get fit for their roles 
and reduce repetitive strain injuries.
One of the Group’s key performance indicators 
is the health and safety performance statistics, 
the results of which may be seen on page 17. 
This measurement is used to provide focus 
on one of the Group’s key performance 
measures, process scrutiny. The target is to 
reduce the overall lost time injuries year on 
year. As a result of the disappointing health 
and safety performance during 2017 all 
Divisions will be looking at alternative ways 
in which to further engage with employees to 
continue the development of the health and 
safety culture at all levels. 
Stakeholders
Engagement with all our stakeholders is 
important and ensures there is a sound basis 
upon which our business is conducted. Each 
Division has a relationship management 
programme with their customers and 
suppliers which provides the appropriate 
forum for open and transparent discussions.
CEO reports to the Board on the Group’s 
health and safety performance

Tyman Sourcing Asia
In October 2017 the Risk Management 
Committee visited the Tyman Sourcing 
Asia office in Ningbo, China. As part 
of this visit the Committee received a 
briefing on the work of TSA and visited 
the TSA offices, which included logistics, 
projects, engineering and quality 
management, which includes a testing 
laboratory, CMM and training rooms.
The Committee also visited a number of 
suppliers in the region, which provided the 
opportunity to meet local management 
teams and see production facilities and 
processes first hand. The Committee was 
particularly interested in seeing the facilities 
afforded the production staff including 
health and safety measures provided. 
This visit coincided with the first 
supplier conference, which was attended 
by TSA’s leading suppliers and provided 
the opportunity for the Risk Management 
Committee to meet with local manufacturers 
and to provide them with some further 
background to the work of each of the 
Tyman Divisions.
Ethics and compliance
The Group is committed to conducting 
its business with integrity. High standards 
of professional and ethical conduct are 
expected throughout its operations acting 
in compliance with the laws and regulations 
in jurisdictions in which the Group operates.
Employees and persons acting on behalf of 
the Group are expected to implement the 
Group’s policies and procedures such that 
the legitimate interests of the Group are 
advanced, having regard to the Group’s 
values and standards. All employees are 
expected to engage in ethical conduct.
As part of the work of the Risk Management 
Committee, a number of other Group 
policies have been developed during the 
year and these are now in full operation 
throughout the Divisions. These policies 
include anti-bribery and anti-corruption, 
Supplier Code of Conduct and the 
prevention of the facilitation of tax evasion.
The Group is 
committed to 
conducting 
its business 
with integrity.”
These policies are clearly communicated 
to all staff. Training programmes in these 
areas, in some cases provided by external 
providers, continued during the year with 
key members of staff from each Division 
completing relevant modules. 
Internal review of systems and internal 
audits provide assurance there is no 
significant risk in these areas. The Risk 
Management Committee manages the 
programme of work which supports the 
implementation and compliance with these 
policies, reporting regularly to the Audit 
Committee on these issues. 
Product integrity
The Group seeks to be honest and fair in its 
relationships with customers and suppliers 
and to source and supply goods and services 
in an efficient manner, in accordance with 
specifications, without compromising quality 
and performance. Each Division is responsible 
for negotiating the terms and conditions of 
trade with suppliers. In doing so each Division 
is expected to maintain high standards of 
integrity in all business dealings with suppliers 
and is encouraged to use the services of those 
suppliers whose values and standards are 
equivalent to Tyman’s quality management 
standards. Operating units are encouraged 
to gain and maintain accreditation to 
specific standards required by the markets 
they serve, with quality and production 
accreditations gained throughout 
the operations.
ISO 9001 certification ensures operations 
adopt and maintain efficient quality 
management systems that save time 
and cost, whilst improving efficiency and 
delivering high quality products to 
their customers.
Modern slavery
The Group is committed to respecting 
human rights across all its operations and 
aims to work at the highest international 
standards as well as complying with local 
legislation. The Group fully supports the 
Modern Slavery Act 2015 and seeks to 
ensure the Group’s activities and activities 
within its supply chain do not infringe or 
encourage abuses of any human rights.
The UK Modern Slavery Act 2015 requires 
Tyman plc and its subsidiaries to make an 
annual statement on the steps taken to 
identify and prevent modern slavery 
throughout its supply chain. 
Each of the Divisions manufactures 
products, primarily in North America and 
Western Europe, distributing and selling 
products to markets globally. A proportion of 
the Group’s products are sourced from third 
party suppliers, primarily in China. Responsibility 
for the management of the supply chain in 
Asia rests with the TSA. 
Through the Divisions’ sourcing arrangements, 
it is recognised there is a risk of the occurrence 
of modern slavery practices. Each Division 
is therefore committed to ensuring any 
indication of such practices is investigated 
immediately with the appropriate actions 
being taken, if necessary. 
During the year a number of actions have 
been carried out to minimise the possibility 
of modern slavery within the Group’s supply 
chain. Each of the Divisions has carried out 
training for all relevant staff, in the appropriate 
language, to educate them to be vigilant for 
any signs of malpractice. Audit and site visits 
of suppliers, particularly in low cost regions, 
have been completed and revised supplier 
agreements have been implemented. Find out more at: www.tymanplc.com 49
A revised Modern Slavery Statement for the 
financial year ended 31 December 2017 can 
be found on the Group’s website. 
Each Division is responsible for the ethical 
sourcing of all products used in the production 
of finished goods. As part of the work of the 
sourcing teams, there is a strong emphasis 
on ensuring the integrity of the supply chain, 
including verification of their suppliers. 
Supply chain teams seek to re-engineer 
products, reworking them to reduce the 
materials used, or to take advantage of 
improved production methods, using more 
environmentally sound materials. 
The Group operates a confidential 
whistleblowing telephone help line, which is 
available for all employees and any external 
person associated with providing goods or 
services to any of the Divisions. During the 
year eight calls were received by the Group 
Company Secretary. Each call was fully 
investigated, by an appropriate person, 
independent of the claim being made. Each 
of these claims was fully resolved, with the 
necessary actions being taken. These claims 
were reported to the Board, which was kept 
apprised of all actions being taken and the 
final outcomes. There is nothing material to 
report in respect of any of these claims.
Community
The Divisions do not have policies on the 
social and community activities in which 
their employees participate, on behalf of the 
Division. In keeping with the decentralised 
nature of the Tyman Group, each operating 
unit participated in a number of local initiatives 
and charitable causes either associated with 
the unit or to which an employee has a 
personal connection.
AmesburyTruth
As in previous years AmesburyTruth has 
taken pride in being actively involved in local 
and national charitable initiatives through 
monetary donations as well as providing 
hours of community service. Big Brothers 
& Big Sisters, Make A Wish, United Way 
and Junior Achievement are all national 
programmes with which the Company has 
partnered financially and through volunteer 
hours. Several of the sites support employee 
fundraising campaigns with United Way 
which helps raises additional funds outside 
of the Company.
AmesburyTruth participates financially 
and with physical involvement at the local 
Chambers of Commerce in Cannon Falls, 
Owatonna, Sioux Falls and Statesville. During 
the holiday season and winter months, 
AmesburyTruth runs collection campaigns 
at the sites collecting winter wear, clothing 
and supplies for the needy. Many employees 
are active with the local school districts and 
support sport teams. Each site has a WAVE 
Committee (Wellness, Activity, Volunteerism, 
Events) which plans, co-ordinates and 
interacts with the community on

the 2017 year totalled US$77,908.
ERA
In 2017 ERA supported a charity voted 
for by their employees and were delighted 
to raise over £14,000 for Birmingham 
Children’s Hospital. Birmingham Children’s 
Hospital is a leading UK specialist paediatric 
centre, offering expert care to over 90,000 
children and young people from across the 
country every year. Delivering some of the 
most advanced treatments, complex surgical 
procedures and cutting-edge research and 
development, the hospital treats one in five 
children from Birmingham and one in eight 
from the wider West Midlands. 
SchlegelGiesse
Reflecting the international nature 
of this Division, the community activities 
in which each unit is involved ranges 
from hosting Macmillan coffee mornings 
and participation in the Muddy Race for 
breast cancer to sponsorship of the local 
Budrio theatre. 
As in prior years, as part of the Group 
Management Conference, funds were raised 
for a local charity. This year, the conference 
was held in Budrio, home of the SchlegelGiesse 
Group head office, and the nominated 
charity was in support of the first Wheelchair 
Tennis Tournament at the Budrio Tennis 
Club. The SchlegelGiesse contribution 
was aimed at the removal of architectural 
barriers in the club, to help people of all 
abilities participate in this sport. With 
matching contributions from Tyman plc, 
the charitable giving raised €5,200.
Each operating unit 
participated in a number 
of local initiatives and 
charitable causes.” Tyman plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 50

Environment
Each Division has policies in place for managing 
the environment, including compliance with 
local regulations. The policies cover areas such 
as the use of materials, including the principles 
of use, re-use and recycle. These policies support 
the ongoing energy efficiency programmes 
carried out during the year, as part of the 
continued drive for increasing efficient 
methods of production including the 
minimisation of waste materials. 
All Divisions have programmes for the ongoing 
maintenance of plants and investment in 
new processes, including the improvement 
of recycling facilities in all locations. 
The Divisions actively promote the reduction 
of materials used in all aspects of production. 
The actions taken in compliance with these 
policies support the efficient use of natural 
resources for both operational efficiencies 
and the sound use of natural resources.
As part of the footprint rationalisation the 
move to energy efficient buildings is part of 
the Group’s drive for operational excellence 
in all areas of its operations, for the benefit 
of everyone working in these premises and 
for production and energy efficiencies. 
Some of the actions taken during the year, 
which support the Divisions’ environmental 
policies, were: 
AmesburyTruth completed a number of 
environmental audits with follow up actions, 
which have improved energy usage, including:
• 
the reduction of compressed air leakages 
and the replacement of old equipment 
with energy efficient units, for the 
reduction of energy and air consumption; 
• 
the replacement of lighting systems, 
including fluorescent lighting, with LED for 
reduced energy usage;
• 
installation of water conditioning equipment 
to the process water systems, reducing the 
frequency of filter replacement and the 
reduction of landfill products by 90 per cent;
• 
installation of movement sensors, for 
lighting systems, to reduce energy use;
• 
installation of new energy efficient electric 
injection moulding machines, reducing 
energy consumption by 20 per cent;
• 
installation of new energy efficient 
heating, ventilation and air conditioning 
systems in new buildings; and
• 
construction of a storm water prevention 
system and settling pond to contain and 
filter water before discharge into the local 
ecosystem.
The focus on the new AmesburyTruth 
centres of excellence is on creating 
state-of-the-art facilities for employees 
which support efficient and environmentally 
aware production methods. 
Following the amalgamation of the Italian 
sites, SchlegelGiesse completed an energy 
audit at the start of 2017 which mapped all 
energy consumption, to provide the basis on 
which energy reduction programmes can 
target key areas. Other actions taken during 
the year were:
• 
as part of an ongoing sustainable 
buildings initiative, 1,100m
2
 of asbestos 
roof was replaced with energy efficient 
thermal insulation, which was restructured 
to provide additional light to this area of 
the building;
• 
improved waste separation, with follow up 
audits to ensure compliance;
• 
installation of energy efficient lighting in 
some older premises;
• 
turbocharged direct injection monitoring 
system was changed, replacing nylon 
mixing heads with steel units resulting 
in reduced water use and 
environmental disposal;
• 
initiated reel recycle system as part of the 
supply of polycarbonate inserts; and
• 
various production processes have moved 
to paperless systems, reducing paper use.
ERA’s consolidation of three plants into a 
new purpose built facility has provided the 
Division the opportunity to operate in an 
energy efficient building, with features 
that include:
• 
a targeted air permeability of 3m
3
/(h.m
2
);
• 
improved U values (insulation levels);
• 
low G values on the windows and curtain 
walling scheme. This is a measure relating 
to the reduction in solar gain;
• 
louvres outside office windows to reduce 
solar gains;
• 
heat recovery ventilation units;
• 
air source heat pumps for heating and 
cooling of office space;
• 
low energy LED lighting;
• 
daylight dimming controls for lights close 
to the windows;
• 
present detection lighting; and
• 
storm water run-off swales have been 
installed for sound water treatment.

Greenhouse gas emissions
The Group applies the GHG Protocol as the 
basis for reporting its emissions. Emissions 
reporting includes the facilities over which 
the Group has operational control. This is 
the internationally recognised standard for 
corporate carbon reporting. Scope 1 and 
Scope 2 emissions data has been collected 
from all material locations operated or 
controlled by the Group. Emission sources 
falling outside the Group’s operational 
control and other Scope 3 emissions have 
not been collated or reported. Emissions 
data for businesses acquired during the year 
has only been included from the date of 
acquisition. The Group has used Revenue as 
the denominator for its intensity ratio as this 
is the most appropriate and relevant factor 
associated with the Group’s activities and 
should provide an appropriate basis on which 
to compare trends over time. Greenhouse 
gas emissions generated by the Group’s 
operations present considerable risks to both 
the Group and the environment, including: 
• 
the agricultural impact of the Group’s 
dependence on extraction and use of 
raw materials;
• 
the potential disruption of the Group’s 
operations and those of its customers 
and suppliers; and
• 
changes in the nature or distribution of 
consumer demand.
These risks can be mitigated through the 
Group’s conscious efforts to minimise its 
release of GHG through environmental 
initiatives. Our GHG emissions, measured 
as the quantity of CO
2
e generated by the 
Group’s activities, for the year ended 
31 December 2017 are presented in the 
table below.
The performance at the end of 2017 shows a 
positive trend over the past three years, helped 
by the Group’s footprint rationalisation and 
in particular the continued investment in 
new, built for purpose manufacturing and 
warehouse facilities.
Water usage
The Group started monitoring water usage 
in 2015, as an acknowledgement of the 
expansion of the Group and its use of 
natural resources and the wish to ensure 
the efficient use of this resource. 
The increased production in both the 
AmesburyTruth and SchlegelGiesse Divisions 
during the year has caused the resultant 
increase in the use of water throughout 
their operations.

GHG emissions
The Divisions 
actively promote 
the reduction of 
materials used 
in all aspects 
of production.”
The majority of greenhouse gas emissions 
used arise from the manufacturing processes 
throughout the Group, together with the 
running of the Group and divisional offices 
and an element of air travel. Where possible 
alternative technologies are used to minimise 
the use of travel between sites, with video 
conference calls used extensively by 
colleagues to communicate outside of 
scheduled meeting times.
Each Division seeks to reduce emissions 
wherever possible and to review and improve 
the recycling facilities in all locations. As part 
of the footprint rationalisation the move to 
purpose built facilities has provided a number 
of opportunities to operate more in energy 
efficient premises and to upgrade and 
improve production processes.
All facilities undertake energy efficiency 
programmes during the year, as part of a 
continual drive for increasing efficient 
methods of production including the 
minimisation of waste materials.  Tyman plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 52

 g o v e rna n c e
Chairman’s introduction to governance
Dear Shareholder
On behalf of the Board I am pleased to 
report to you on the progress made on the 
governance arrangements during the year.
The governance of an organisation starts 
with the tone at the top and so I took the 
opportunity of the Board’s planned externally 
facilitated evaluation to extend this review 
process to take into account the views of 
senior management. Pleasingly the results 
of the evaluation were very positive and 
demonstrated the unity of the Board. However, 
there is always room for improvement and 
the results, which are noted in more detail in 
the following Statement of governance, 
showed as the Group continues to grow the 
Board’s focus should move to more 
Group-based discussions including the wider 
influences upon Group performance such 
as competitor and customer developments. 
To address this the Board’s agenda has been 
restructured to strengthen this aspect of the 
Board’s work. 
As the Group continues to grow it is essential 
that sound practices and behaviours are 
further embedded into the culture of the 
Group as a whole. The Board and Committees 
receive updates on all areas of governance, 
which provide the necessary assurance that 
the appropriate platforms are provided, 
from which everyone can operate. 
One key area of focus which did not provide 
the outcome on which the Board has worked 
hard to deliver is health and safety performance 
across the Group. This result shows the 
continued investment in this area must be 
supported by alternative ways of embedding 
world class practices in every area of the 
business. This will be a continuing theme 
during the year ahead.
I am pleased with the smooth transition in 
the Audit Committee as Helen Clatworthy 
took over as Chair of this Committee. The 
results of the performance evaluation show 
this Committee is well run and provided with 
the necessary information. The Committee’s 
work has developed with the focus on a 
number of key areas, including improvements 
in risk management systems and changes in 
forthcoming changes in accounting 
standards, and in light of the FRC’s Lab 
project report on risk and viability reporting 
reviewed and approved the Group’s Viability 
statement.
The Remuneration Committee is committed 
to aligning remuneration with the delivery of 
long term shareholder value and therefore 
spent time reviewing the roles of the Executive 
Directors and associated remuneration, both 
of which have been realigned to take into 
account the Executives’ contribution to the 
Group and in the case of James Brotherton, the 
extension of his responsibilities. 
The work of the Nominations Committee 
developed during the year as it commenced 
a full succession planning programme, which 
considered the skills and capabilities of all 
senior management and other high potential 
individuals. This process gave the 
Committee an in-depth view of the human 
talent within the Group and where there are 
development opportunities. This programme 
will continue into 2018, combined with a 
review of the diversity within the Group.
The Board also appointed a new Non-executive 
Director, Pamela Bingham, who has extensive 
experience in international manufacturing 
businesses, which includes business 
development and the implementation of 
strategies for business growth, through 
product development and M&A. Her current 
operational experience will provide an 
additional dimension to the work of the 
Board. Angelika Westerwelle will be stepping 
down from the Board at the conclusion of 
the 2018 AGM. I am pleased to report that 
following these changes in Board membership, 
the Board continues to have 33 per cent 
female representation, as recommended by 
the Hampton Alexander review for FTSE 350 
companies by 2020. 
The Board remains committed to developing 
operational excellence throughout the Group, 
which includes the governance arrangements 
for the Board and the Group as a whole, which 
will continue to be a focus for the Board for 
the year ahead. 
More details on the membership of the Board 
and the Board Committees and the work 
carried out during the year can be found in 
the following pages. This Governance and 
Directors’ report, together with the following 
Audit Committee report, Nominations 
Committee report and Remuneration report, 
sets out how the governance arrangements 
for the Group have been implemented during 
the year and I am pleased to confirm that 
Tyman has complied with the provisions of 
the Code. 
As noted in my Chairman’s statement, 
the Company’s AGM will be held at the ERA 
Division’s new facility in Wolverhampton 
on Thursday 10 May 2018, providing our 
shareholders with the opportunity to see 
one of Tyman’s centres of excellence first 
hand. I do hope as many shareholders as 
possible will be able to attend.

control of the Group in order to achieve its 
strategic objectives of continued earnings 
growth and to enhance shareholder value. 
The Board also ensures that there is an 
effective system of controls to safeguard 
the Company’s assets and to enable risks 
to be properly assessed and managed.
The Board is the body responsible for making 
decisions on all significant matters, as detailed 
in the schedule of matters reserved for the 
Board, and is accountable to shareholders 
for creating the sustainable long term 
success of the business. 
The areas for specific consideration by the 
Board include: setting the Group’s values and 
standards; approval of the Group’s strategic 
aims and objectives; ensuring maintenance 
of a sound system of internal control and risk 
management, including approval of the 
Group’s risk appetite statements; responsibility 
for the review of the Group’s corporate 
governance arrangements; and ensuring the 
Group has the necessary financial and human 
resources, processes and controls to deliver 
the long term strategy of the Group.
Matters not specifically reserved for the Board, 
including the day-to-day management of the 
Group, are delegated to the Executive Directors.
Governance framework
A schedule of Board meeting dates is set a 
year in advance, to ensure the Board meets 
at regular intervals throughout the year, at 
times that align with the operations of the 
different business divisions and the financial 
and reporting requirements of the Group as 
a whole. 
To ensure relevant topics are given appropriate 
consideration the Board has delegated certain 
roles to three principal Committees: Audit, 
Remuneration and Nominations. Membership 
of these Committees is made up of the 
Non-executive Directors. The Chairman is 
also a member of the Nominations and 
Remuneration committees. 
The work of these Committees in 2017 is 
explained in more detail on pages 61 to 82. 
Each of the Committees’ terms of reference 
can be found on the Group’s website.
All Directors have access to the services 
of the Group Company Secretary who 
is responsible for ensuring the Group’s 
governance framework is observed and 
the Board and Committees receive 
the necessary support in fulfilling 
their responsibilities. 
If thought appropriate, Directors may obtain 
independent professional advice in respect 
of their responsibilities, at the Company’s 
expense. No such advice was sought in 
the year. 
Board composition
The names and biographical details of all 
the current Directors, as at the date of this 
report, are set out on pages 52 and 53 and 
on the Group website. 
The following Directors served during the 
year ended 31 December 2017:
Board member Appointed

Helen Clatworthy January 2017
Louis Eperjesi February 2010
Jamie Pike

Angelika Westerwelle November 2012
1 Stepped down as Chairman May 2017.
2 Appointed Chairman May 2017.
At 31 December 2017, the Board 
comprised one Non-executive Chairman, 
two Executive Directors and three independent 
Non-executive Directors. Pamela Bingham was 
appointed to the Board on 18 January 2018. 
At the date of this report, the Board now 
comprises a Non-executive Chairman, 
two Executive Directors and four 
Non-executive Directors. As previously 
announced, Angelika Westerwelle will 
be stepping down from the Board at the 
conclusion of the Annual General Meeting 
to be held in May 2018. 
The Group is committed to supporting 
employment policies and practices that make 
provision for equal opportunities and 
non-discrimination, and that comply with 
relevant local legislation and accepted 
employment codes of practice. Group 
employment policies and practices 
must ensure that an individual’s skills, 
experience and talent are the sole 
determinants in recruitment. Further 
information of the Group’s diversity 
policies can be found on page 46 of 
the Strategic report. Adherence to Group 
employment policies, including diversity is 
seen as an effective way in which the 
composition of the Board can continue to 
be well balanced and appropriate for the 
needs of the Group as a whole.
Through the work of the Nominations 
Committee’s succession planning 
programme the composition of the Board 
and its Committees is regularly reviewed to 
ensure there is an appropriate mix of skills, 
experience, industry background and 
diversity to enable the Board and 
Committees to fulfil their responsibilities.
As a result of this review the Nominations 
Committee carried out an external 
search to recruit a Non-executive Director, 
which resulted in the appointment of 
Pamela Bingham to the Board in January 2018. 
Further details of the work of the Nominations 
Committee can be found on pages 67 to 68.
At 31 December 2017, the percentage of 
female representation on the Board was 33 
per cent, which will remain the case following 
the Annual General Meeting in May 2018.

Chairman
The roles of the Chairman and the 
Chief Executive Officer are clearly 
defined and approved by the Board.
The Chairman is responsible for the 
leadership and effective running of the 
Board and its decision-making processes, 
for setting the highest standards of corporate 
governance, for setting the Board agenda 
and for the style and tone of Board 
discussions. The Chairman’s role includes 
leading the Board in determining the 
strategy and the overall objectives of 
the Group, while ensuring that the Board 
determines the nature and extent of 
the principal risks associated with 
implementing this strategy.
Chief Executive Officer 
The CEO is responsible for the day-to-day 
management of the Group, providing 
leadership for the executive team and 
developing and implementing the Group’s 
strategic objectives. He is assisted by the 
Tyman Management Committee.
Chief Financial Officer
The CFO is responsible for the financial 
reporting and management of the Group, 
in addition to the finance, audit, tax and 
treasury functions. As announced in 
July 2017 the CFO’s role has been extended 
to take Board responsibility for Group 
strategy, corporate development and M&A, 
supported by the CEO. The CFO role remains 
responsible for investor relations. 
The Senior Independent Director
The Senior Independent Director is available 
for shareholders to voice any concerns which 
may not be appropriate for discussion 
through the normal channels of Chairman, 
CEO or CFO. The Senior Independent 
Director also leads the Chairman’s appraisal, 
serves as an intermediary for the other 
Directors with the Chairman as necessary 
and acts as a sounding board for the 
Chairman as required.
Independence of  
Non-executive Directors
Through the work of the Nominations 
Committee, the Board has ensured that its 
members have an appropriate mix of skills 
and relevant industry experience and that 
each Non-executive has sufficient 
knowledge of the Company which has 
enabled them to discharge their duties 
and responsibilities during the year. 
As part of the performance evaluation, 
the Board reviewed the independence of 
the Directors. Having reviewed the other 
positions held by the Non-executive Directors 
and the possibility of any potential conflicts 
of interest, the Board continues to consider 
that each of the Non-executive Directors 
is independent, as defined against the 
independence criteria as set out in the 
Code, believing each to be independent 
of character and judgement. 
Director induction 
Upon appointment, all new Directors receive 
a comprehensive and tailored induction 
programme, providing them the opportunity 
to learn about the operations, making 
specific site visits and meeting Divisional 
and local management.

Board visits to the operations 
As part of the Board’s work, the Directors 
visit operating units to meet with divisional 
management and to see these businesses 
first hand.
A Board and a Nominations Committee 
meeting were held in Bologna, Italy, in early 
October, where the Board in conjunction 
with the Nominations Committee received 
presentations from Divisional CEOs in respect 
of succession planning. At this time, the Board 
also participated in the Group Conference, 
where the Chairman, Martin Towers, addressed 
a delegation of the Group’s 60 most senior 
managers and gave an update on the work 
of the Board.
During late October, the Board also visited 
two plants in Juarez, Mexico, where they met 
local management teams and were able to 
make first hand assessments of progress 
being made following recent expansion.
AmesburyTruth, Juarez, Mexico
The Board visited the AmesburyTruth plant 
in Juarez. This site opened in 2008 as a 
40,000 sq. ft. facility specialising in intercompany 
supplies and balance sub-assembly (operating 
as a Maquiladora). In 2016 this site was 
expanded to the current 157,000 sq. ft. plant, 
fulfilling phase I of the footprint project. 
There are now 750 people employed at this 
site, compared with c. 200 at the start of 2015. 
The expansion allowed space for the 
additional functions of die cast, injection 
moulding, small parts assembly and spring 
manufacturing, and is now operating as 
a full-service manufacturing unit. 
The Board was keen to meet with local 
management and to see this extended 
facility and to understand what progress 
was being made in all aspects of production 
and supply chain management. 
Bilco, Juarez, Mexico
The Board also took the opportunity 
to visit the Bilco manufacturing site in 
Juarez. Bilco opened a small plant in 1994, 
which contained two welding stations, one 
assembly station and one paint booth. 
The current facility was opened in 2007, 
and is a purpose built 41,000 sq. ft. plant. 
This expansion provided additional space 
for stamping capabilities, which now 
produce the majority of the roof access 
hatches for the Bilco Division. There are 
65 people employed in this plant, with the 
majority having over 20 years of experience 
with Bilco. 
The Board was pleased to meet local 
management and to see these operations 
first hand. 
Performance evaluation
During the year the Board participated in 
an externally facilitated Board evaluation, 
in conjunction with Independent Audit, a 
leading specialist governance consultancy 
specialising in Board performance 
evaluation, with which the Company has 
no other connection. The evaluation made 
use of an online questionnaire, followed 
up with interviews with all Board members. 
At the request of the Chairman these 
questionnaires and interviews were 
extended to the Group Financial Controller 
and the Divisional CEOs, to provide a broader 
perspective of the Board’s performance 
and to encourage debate on the key 
recommendations for the work of the Board 
and Committees for the following year.
The report was generally complimentary 
about the Group, the Board and the way 
the Board is run. It was agreed there were 
certain areas upon which the Board should 
focus, which would provide an appropriate 
forum for further discussion on relevant topics.
Statement of governance continued Find out more at: www.tymanplc.com 59
The results of the review and actions taken are shown below:
Board evaluation commentary Response Actions 
Tyman has a clear strategy and 
objectives of which all Board members 
are aware. However, it was felt that 
further discussion and understanding of 
how the respective Divisions implement 
the Group strategy in their differing 
markets would be beneficial
It was considered that the Group strategy, 
although well understood, was not 
sufficiently profiled when discussing 
Divisional performance at Board meetings.
Board papers have been restructured to 
provide the CEO additional opportunity to 
provide the Board with a greater overview of 
matters such as current trading, industry 
developments around customers, markets 
and competitors, and other topical matters 
of significance that could affect the 
implementation of Group strategy, including 
the impact upon M&A. 
External understanding of customers, 
markets and competitors
It was agreed that the majority of 
information provided to the Board was 
internally sourced and that it would be 
useful to receive an external perspective 
of the Group.
The Board received a presentation from 
Rothschild, the Group’s financial advisors, 
at the January 2018 meeting. Further 
presentations from external advisers are 
planned for later in the year. 
Divisional CEOs to be available to 
answer questions at Board meetings
It was agreed further input from the 
Divisional CEOs would provide a greater 
understanding of the operational aspects of 
these Divisions. 
Presentations were received from Jeff Graby 
and his senior management team during 
the Board visit to Juarez, Mexico. Further 
presentations have been received from the 
Divisional CEOs on a number of topics, 
including health and safety, succession 
planning, strategy and M&A. 2018 will see 
further presentations made by the Divisional 
CEOs to the Board. 
As part of the Board evaluation process, 
the Chairman reviewed the performance 
of each Director; these reviews were 
followed up with one-to-one meetings. 
Following these reviews the Chairman has 
confirmed that each of the Directors has 
demonstrated their continued commitment 
to their roles by the time spent on Company 
business and through their full participation 
in Board and Committee meetings.
Led by the Senior Independent Director, 
Mark Rollins, the other Directors carried out 
a review of the Chairman’s performance. 
Feedback from these personal reviews was 
discussed on a one-to-one basis with the 
Chairman. Taking these reviews into 
consideration the evaluation confirmed 
the Chairman continues to fully discharge 
his duties and demonstrates full 
commitment to the role as evidenced by 
the time spent on Company business.
Directors’ insurance cover
The Company maintains, at its expense, 
a directors’ and officers’ liability insurance 
policy to afford an indemnity in certain 
circumstances for the benefit of Group 
personnel including, as recommended by 
the Code, the Directors. This insurance policy 
does not provide cover where the Director or 
officer has acted fraudulently or dishonestly.
Shareholder engagement
The Company’s Annual General Meeting 
is a key date for the Board, as it provides 
the Directors the opportunity to meet 
with all shareholders and private and 
institutional investors and the Board 
welcomes their participation.
At the 2017 Annual General Meeting, 
which was held in the London offices of 
Pinsent Masons, a number of members, 
representing smaller shareholdings, attended 
and used the occasion to discuss a variety 
of aspects of the business with both 
Executive and Non-executive Directors, 
in a very informal setting. 
The 2018 Annual General Meeting will 
be held at the Group’s new ERA premises in 
Wolverhampton. As noted in the Chairman’s 
statement on page 7 , shareholders are invited 
to attend and to see first hand one of the 
Group’s centres of excellence. 
Details of resolutions to be proposed at the 
Annual General Meeting can be found in the 
Directors’ report. For those shareholders unable 
to attend the Company’s Annual General 
Meetings, electronic proxy voting is available 
through the Company’s registrar’s, Link Asset 
Services, portal www.linkassetservices.com. 
The Executive Directors engage with 
institutional shareholders and sell-side 
financial analysts as well as potential 
shareholders and other interested parties 
covering the Group’s strategy and trading 
results. The Executive Directors also 
presented at the full and half-year results 
presentations, as well as investor conferences 
in the UK and US. The Executive Directors also 
hosted a capital markets event which this year 
included presentations from the divisional 
executive management of AmesburyTruth. 
Feedback from these events, meetings with 
shareholders and analysts’ reports are 
provided to the Board at each meeting.
The Chairman and Non-executive Directors 
make themselves available to attend meetings 
with major shareholders at their request. 
Further to the changes to the CFO’s role 
and responsibilities the Chairman of the 
Remuneration Committee, Mark Rollins, 
wrote to principal shareholders to keep them 
informed of the Board’s decision. Responses 
received showed shareholders were fully 
supportive of the changes in responsibilities 
and salary.
The Senior Independent Director is also 
available to attend meetings, if requested, 
by shareholders concerning matters they 
consider they are unable to discuss with the 
Chairman. No such meetings have been 
requested during the year. Tyman plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 60

presentations, press releases and stock

A table setting out the Company’s major 
shareholders may be found on page 69

Internal control and risk management 
The Directors acknowledge that they are 
responsible for the Group’s internal control 
and risk management systems and for 
reviewing their effectiveness. Details 
of this review process are set out in the 
Audit Committee report on page 63.
Directors’ responsibilities statement 
The Directors are responsible for preparing 
the Annual Report and the financial 
statements in accordance with applicable 
law and regulation.
Company law requires the Directors 
to prepare financial statements for each 
financial year. Under that law the Directors 
have prepared the Group financial statements 
in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the 
European Union and Company financial 
statements in accordance with UK GAAP. 
Under company law the Directors must not 
approve the financial statements unless 
they are satisfied that they give a true and 
fair view of the state of affairs of the Group 
and Company and of the profit or loss of 
the Group and Company for that period. 
In preparing the financial statements, 
the Directors are required to:
• 
select suitable accounting policies and 
then apply them consistently;
• 
state whether applicable IFRSs as 
adopted by the European Union have 
been followed for the Group financial 
statements and United Kingdom 
Accounting Standards, comprising FRS 
101, have been followed for the Company 
financial statements, subject to any 
material departures disclosed and 
explained in the financial statements;
• 
make judgements and accounting 
estimates that are reasonable and 
prudent; and
• 
prepare the financial statements on the 
going concern basis unless it is 
inappropriate to presume that the Group 
and Company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping 
adequate accounting records that are sufficient 
to show and explain the Group and Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable 
accuracy at any time the financial position of 
the Group and Company and enable them to 
ensure that the financial statements and the 
Directors’ remuneration report comply with 
the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards 
the Group financial statements, Article 4 
of the IAS Regulation.
The Directors are also responsible for 
safeguarding the assets of the Group and 
Company and hence for taking reasonable 
steps for the prevention and detection of 
fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the 
maintenance and integrity of the Company’s 
website. Legislation in the United Kingdom 
governing the preparation and dissemination 
of financial statements may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions.
The Directors consider that the 
Annual Report and Accounts, taken as a 
whole, is fair, balanced and understandable 
and provides the information necessary 
for shareholders to assess the Group and 
Company’s performance, business model 
and strategy.
Each of the Directors, whose names and 
functions are listed in the Annual Report and 
Accounts, confirm that, to the best of 
their knowledge:
• 
the Company financial statements, which 
have been prepared in accordance with 
UK GAAP, give a true and fair view of the 
assets, liabilities, financial position and 
profit of the Company;
• 
the Group financial statements, which 
have been prepared in accordance with 
IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, 
and applicable law, give a true and fair 
view of the assets, liabilities, financial 
position and profit of the Group; and
• 
the Directors’ report includes a fair review 
of the development and performance of 
the business and the position of the 
Group and Company, together with a 
description of the principal risks and 
uncertainties that the Group faces.

Audit Committee report
Monitoring the control 
environment
Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to present to you the 
Committee’s report for the financial year 
ended 31 December 2017, which is my 
first as Committee Chair.
This report covers the activities of the 
Committee during the year and how it 
has applied its oversight of the Group’s 
control environment. 
Key highlights
I would like to thank Martin Towers for his 
assistance in ensuring a smooth transition as 
I assumed responsibility for this Committee.
The work of the Risk Management 
Committee is gaining momentum and the 
reports received by the Audit Committee 
demonstrate improvements are being made 
across all aspects of risk management 
throughout the Divisions.
The Committee spent some time 
understanding the implications of the 
forthcoming changes to accounting standards, 
including the new revenue and financial 
instrument standards, to be implemented 
in 2018, and the new leasing standards to 
be implemented no later than 2019.
In light of the FRC’s Lab project report on 
risk and viability reporting the Committee 
approved the three-year period for the 
Group’s Viability statement.
The Committee ensured the mandatory 
rotation of the external audit partners 
in the UK and US did not compromise the 
effectiveness of the external audit function, 
and welcomed Richard Porter and Jonathan 
Friese to the Tyman audit.
The level of materiality for the full-year 
audit, agreed at five per cent of Underlying 
Operating Profit before Taxation, was 
reviewed and agreed with the external 
auditors.
Committee membership
The members of the Committee during the 
year ended 31 December 201 7 were as follows:
Audit Committee member Appointed
Helen Clatworthy
1
 January 2017
Mark Rollins April 2015
Martin Towers

December 2009
Angelika Westerwelle November 2012
1 Helen Clatworthy was appointed Chair in May 2017.
2  Martin Towers stepped down from the Committee 
in May 2017.
All members are independent 
Non-executive Directors. During the 
year, Martin Towers served as Chairman 
of the Audit Committee until May 2017. 
At the 2017 Annual General Meeting, he 
was appointed Chairman of the Board 
and consequently stepped down from the 
Audit Committee. I joined the Committee 
in January 2017 and was appointed Chair 
in May 2017, taking over this role from 
Martin Towers. Pamela Bingham joined the 
Committee upon appointment to the 
Board on 18 January 2018. 
Under provisions of the Code the Committee 
should have at least one member of the 
Committee with recent and relevant 
financial experience and competence in 
accounting and/or auditing, and that the 
Audit Committee as a whole should have 
competence relevant to the sector in which 
the Company operates. The Board considers 
that Mark Rollins and I have recent and 
relevant financial experience and that each 
member of the Committee is independent in 
accordance with the Code. Members of the 
Committee between them possess 
significant international, commercial, 
operational and financial skills which are 
relevant to an international manufacturer 
and distributor of building products. 
How the Committee operates
During the year the Committee met four 
times, with meetings timed to coincide with 
key dates in the financial reporting and 
audit cycles of the Company. Meetings 
typically take place on the same day as a 
Board meeting to promote the efficient 
working of the Committee. An annual 
schedule of Committee activity is set out a 
year in advance, to provide the appropriate 
focus on key priorities.

How the Committee operates continued
In addition to the Committee members, the 
Chairman, the Chief Executive Officer and

Committee Chair. Other attendees include 
the Group Financial Controller and members 
of the finance team, senior representatives 
from the external auditors, PwC, as well as

function is co-sourced. 
In advance of meetings, the Committee 
is provided with reports from the 
Chief Financial Officer, the Group finance 
function, PwC and BDO, as well as minutes 
of the Risk Management Committee. 
These minutes provide the Committee 
with detailed information on the progress 
the Divisions are making in respect of risk 
management activities. 
The Committee’s terms of reference were 
reviewed during the year, and updated to 
take into account revisions to the Code and 
the updated FRC Guidance on Audit 
Committees both published in April 2016 
and follow the revised guidance from the 
ICSA. The Committee’s terms of reference 
can be found on the Group website.
The Committee meets separately with the 
external auditors and the internal auditors 
during the course of the year, without 
Executive management being present. 
I have also met with PwC outside of 
Committee meetings to keep appraised of 
the year-end audit process and audit 
matters in general.
The Committee is authorised to seek 
independent advice should it wish to do so; 
however, this was not required during the year.

Committee effectiveness
During the year the Committee 
participated in an externally facilitated 
effectiveness evaluation, in conjunction 
with Independent Audit. 
The results of the evaluation showed the 
Committee was well run and management 
was very responsive with regard to providing 
the Committee with information. One 
recommendation was that it was thought 
appropriate to carry out a full review of the 
co-sourced internal audit function which 
has been in place with BDO since 2013, 
to provide the Committee with a deeper 
understanding of how this function operates 
and assurance of the function’s effectiveness. 
It was also recommended that representatives 
from BDO should attend the Committee 
meetings on a more frequent basis. Both of 
these recommendations have been agreed 
by the Committee and will be implemented 
during 2018. 
External audit
The Committee is responsible for managing 
the relationship with and the performance 
of external auditors, which includes making 
recommendations in respect of the 
appointment, reappointment and, if 
necessary, removal of the external auditors.
Following a competitive tender process, 
PwC were appointed the Group’s auditors in 
December 2011 and have therefore served 
as the Group’s auditors since the conclusion 
of the 2012 AGM. Accordingly, the 2017 
audit is PwC’s sixth consecutive audit. 
Although Tyman is not a FTSE 350 company 
and is therefore not required to comply with 
the provisions of the CMA Order, the 
Audit Committee considered that it was 
appropriate for the Company to follow these 
recommendations. As previously reported, 
the Committee confirms that it would 
expect to implement a formal competitive 
audit tender process during the financial 
year ending December 2021, or sooner if 
felt necessary.
The Audit Committee confirms Tyman has 
complied with the provisions of the CMA 
Order for the financial year under review. 
The Committee confirms there are no 
contractual restrictions on the Group with 
regard to PwC’s appointment.
Accordingly the Committee has recommended 
to the Board that PwC should be reappointed 
as the Group’s auditors at the 2018 Annual 
General Meeting.

Audit Committee priorities in 2017
The priorities for the Audit Committee in 2017 are summarised below together with the work carried out during the year in respect of these priorities:
2017 Work carried out Outcome
Review the potential impact on the 
Group of the new accounting standards 
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, IFRS 15 
Revenue from contracts with customers 
and IFRS 16 Leases
The Group carried out a provisional 
assessment of the impact of these standards 
on the consolidated financial statements.
The adoption of IFRS 9 and IFRS 15 is not 
expected to have a material impact on the 
financial statements of the Group in 
future periods.
The adoption of IFRS 16 is expected to have 
a relatively significant impact on the Group’s 
reported results and balance sheet and 
the Group’s assessment of the likely 
impact is ongoing.
Keep under review the risks associated 
with the footprint rationalisation as it 
expands across more locations
The Committee was kept informed of the 
changes to the risk environment associated 
with the footprint rationalisation through 
regular updates to the Divisions’ risk registers. 
Further detailed updates were discussed at 
Board meetings, in conjunction with Board 
visits to plants in Bologna and Juarez during 
the year. 
A number of operational issues were 
highlighted regarding the ongoing work of 
the footprint rationalisation, with remedial 
actions implemented. 
Keep under review the internal control 
function and subsidiary’s plans to 
implement recommended improvements
The Committee received full reports from each 
internal audit conducted and reviewed the 
Divisional response to action recommendations.
The Committee was pleased with 
the progress made during the year by 
all Divisions, particularly the improved 
efficiency with which outstanding actions 
are being completed. 
A full effectiveness review of the internal audit 
function will be carried out during the year.
Assess the effectiveness of the risk 
management and internal controls 
during 2017
During the year the Committee reviewed 
improvements to the quality of the Group’s 
internal control system made in response to 
internal audit recommendations and 
Divisional management self-assessment. The 
Committee reviewed the risk management 
structure, risk appetite and principal risks and 
uncertainties facing the Group including how 
those risks had evolved during the year.
The Committee confirms that they have 
carried out their annual review of the 
effectiveness of the system of internal control 
as operated throughout the year ended 
31 December 2017 and up to the date of 
approval of the Annual Report and Accounts.
The Committee also confirms that no 
significant failings or weaknesses have been 
identified from that review.
Review the impact on the Group of the 
changes in tax regulations in the US
In 2017 , 72.0 per cent of the Group’s operating 
profits before central cost allocations were 
generated in North America. Accordingly, the 
US tax rates have a material impact on the 
Group’s effective tax rate. 
At the end of 2017 , the US Federal tax rate 
was reduced from 35.0 per cent to 21.0 per 
cent as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.
A detailed presentation was made by the 
Group tax function in January 2018 to 
members of the Committee and the rest of 
the Board concerning the likely impact of the 
reductions in the US Federal tax rate and 
associated changes to the US tax code on  
the Group. 
Following discussion, the Committee is 
satisfied that the Group’s effective tax rate 
has been appropriately calculated and that 
the disclosure of the impact of the reductions 
in the US Federal tax rate and associated 
changes to the US tax code on the Group in 
the 2017 Annual Report is appropriate. Tyman plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 64
Strategic report Governance and Directors’ report Financial statements
External audit effectiveness
A key responsibility of the Committee is 
ensuring the continued effectiveness of 
the external audit. 
Following the completion of the Group 
audit, all Group finance teams are asked to 
participate in a questionnaire, which rates 
PwC’s performance, with questions relating 
to audit approach and quality, including 
areas such as planning, resources, technical 
knowledge, scope of audit and understanding 
of the business. The results of this survey 
for the 2016 Annual Report were presented 
to the Committee, following which the 
Committee confirms it remains satisfied that 
PwC continues to provide an effective audit. 
It has been decided to conduct an externally 
facilitated questionnaire in respect of the 
2017 audit to gain a different perspective of 
the work of the external audit. The results of 
this review will be presented to the Committee 
during 2018 and will be used to assist the 
Committee in informing its view of the 
effectiveness of the external audit. 
Auditor independence and objectivity
The Committee recognises the importance 
of auditor independence and receives reports 
from PwC during the year in respect of their 
compliance with the fundamental principles 
of objectivity, integrity and professional 
behaviour, including independence. PwC 
has provided their annual assurance 
independence letter to the Audit Committee 
in March 2018. 
The Committee reviews the policy on auditor 
independence and non-audit services annually 
and takes into consideration the nature, scope 
and appropriateness of non-audit services 
annually supplied by the external auditors, 
whilst taking into account that the provision 
of certain non-audit services can be most 
efficiently provided by the Group’s external 
auditors. The Committee has requested 
that, where practicable, non-audit services 
should generally be contracted from firms 
other than PwC, including firms that are not 
members of the “Big Four”.
The Committee continues to be satisfied 
with the external auditors’ independence 
and objectivity.
Audit and non-audit fees
The Committee regularly reviews the 
audit fees to ensure these are appropriate 
to enable an effective and high-quality 
audit to be conducted. The fee for the 2017 
Group audit is £772,000 (2016: £775,000). 
Although there has been a slight increase in 
the base audit fee, this is mitigated by the 
reduction of the overall fee, reflecting the 
absence of acquisition and merger audit 
work, as required in previous years. 
Further information in respect of the 
audit fee can be found in note 4 to the 
Group financial statements. 
In line with policy, the Committee also 
reviews any non-audit services provided 
by the external auditors and such fees 
and services are regularly reported to the 
Committee to ensure this work does not 
exceed 50 per cent of the audit fee for any 
one year. 
Pre-approved audit and audit related 
services to a maximum of £100,000 
are permitted without reference to the 
Audit Committee.
Any non-audit work performed by the 
external auditors with fees expected to be in 
excess of £100,000 in aggregate in any one 
year are subject to Audit Committee approval. 
A schedule of prohibited work includes 
bookkeeping and accounting, internal audit 
services, design and implementation of 
financial information systems and payroll, 
and actuarial and recruitment services.
During 2017 non-audit fees paid to PwC 
were 3.9 per cent (2016: 11.4 per cent) of the 
annual Group audit fee. This work related 
mainly to the provision of assurance related 
audit services for the interim results.
The Committee is satisfied that the 
provision of such services does not in any 
way prejudice the objectivity and 
independence of the external auditors.
The Group’s policy on non-audit fees was 
reviewed during the year and can be found 
on the Group website.
Internal audit
Internal audit has been co-sourced with 
BDO since 2013, providing independent 
assurance and a level of resource that is not 
available in house. 
An annual internal audit plan is reviewed 
by the Committee following discussions 
with management in consideration of the 
areas requiring review. During 2017 BDO 
completed all planned internal audits and 
reported to the Committee on the results 
of these audits and management response 
to the reported actions.
In light of the Group’s growth and increasing 
footprint, a five-year internal audit strategic 
plan has been developed, covering all 
subsidiaries. The internal audit strategic plan 
for 2018–2022 and the 2018 annual plan 
have taken into consideration: the turnover 
of each subsidiary, risks reported in the 
Divisional risk registers, internal audit 
findings from previous reviews and any 
changes to the current risk environment. 
Planning meetings have taken place with 
Divisional CFOs and the Group Financial 
Controller. The plan for 2018 covers 
risk-based audits for larger entities whilst 
continuing to use the standard internal 
control programme where appropriate.
The Committee expects that each Group 
subsidiary will be visited at least once by 
internal audit over a five-year cycle with 
higher risk and more material subsidiaries 
potentially visited more than once.
The Committee is responsible for ensuring 
the continued effectiveness of the internal 
audit function. In 2017 and prior years, this 
overview has been completed through the 
receipt of internal audit plans, audit reports 
and discussions with management. In 
response to the recommendations made 
following the Committee’s external 
effectiveness evaluation, a full effectiveness 
review will be carried out during the year 
as one of the Committee’s key priorities. 
This review will be carried out through an 
externally facilitated questionnaire and will 
be used to gain a deeper insight of the work 
of the internal audit function from a number 
of key stakeholders throughout the Group, 
including comments made by respondents, 
covering: the function’s quality of planning, 
communication, understanding of the 
business, engagement and resourcing. 
The results of this work will be reported 
to the Committee during 2018 and will 
be used as part of the internal audit 
effectiveness review.
Having reviewed the work of the internal 
audit function and results achieved during 
the year, the Committee considers that 
overall the internal audit programme has 
improved the way the Group operates, with 
the programme evolving positively over 
time. The Committee is satisfied the internal 
audit programme continues to be effective 
and this work is complementary to the work 
carried out by PwC.

Financial reporting and significant judgements
The Committee is responsible for monitoring the integrity of the financial statements including significant judgements. In undertaking this 
review, the following critical accounting policies and judgements were discussed with management and the external auditors.
Audit Committee review Conclusions
Carrying value 
of goodwill and 
intangibles
The Committee reviewed the work carried out in respect of 
the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets, including 
the assumptions used over which there is a high degree of 
judgement, and which significantly impact the calculated 
value in use.
Further information can be found in note 10 to the Group 
financial statements.
The Committee was satisfied that the assumptions 
used by management’s impairment testing were 
appropriate, and that there was sufficient impairment 
headroom on all CGUs and that no impairment charge 
was required.
Carrying value 
of provisions
The Group holds a number of provisions related to 
restructuring, properties, warranty claims and 
tax exposures. There is a high degree of judgement 
involved in assessing the level of provision required.
Further information can be found in note 19 to the Group 
financial statements.
The Committee discussed with management and with 
PwC the key elements of judgement to assure 
themselves as to the adequacy and appropriateness of 
the provisions. The Committee was satisfied that the 
judgements exercised were appropriate and that the 
provisions were fairly stated in the annual accounts.
Exceptional items During the year the Group incurred exceptional items which 
primarily related to the North American footprint project, 
costs associated with M&A activity and integration costs 
associated with acquisitions. Separate presentation of 
these items as exceptional provides an improved 
understanding of the underlying trends in financial 
performance and a better comparison with prior periods.
Further information can be found in note 6 to the Group 
financial statements.
The Committee reviewed management’s plans for the 
related programmes and following discussions with 
PwC concluded that the items were material by their 
size and non-recurring in nature and consequently, in 
accordance with the Group’s accounting policy, met 
the criteria for disclosure as exceptional. The 
Committee considered that the accounting treatment 
and disclosures in the financial statements were 
appropriate and consistent. 
The Committee noted that £8.6 million of exceptional 
credits had been booked during the year and was satisfied 
that there were no other credits that should be classified 
as exceptional.
Acquisition 
accounting
Depending on the level of M&A activity during the year, 
acquisition accounting can be considered a significant risk. 
Acquisitions during 2017 have been smaller and less 
complex than previous years so this is not considered to 
be significant.
Further information can be found in note 24 to the Group 
financial statements.
The Committee reviewed the fair value exercise for 
the Howe Green acquisition and following discussion 
with PwC it concluded that the assumptions used 
were appropriate and the resultant fair values and the 
estimates of the economic useful lives of the 
intangible assets identified were reasonable.
Carrying value of 
accounts receivable
Provision against trade receivables is made when there is 
objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect 
all amounts due to it in accordance with the original terms 
of those receivables. Group management exercises 
judgement in assessing the amount of any write downs 
required which is based on current assessments of the 
creditworthiness of current customers. 
Further information can be found in note 13 to the Group 
financial statements.
The Committee reviewed the ageing of accounts 
receivable and the basis of the provisions made by 
management. Following discussion with PwC on their 
review of trade receivables, the Committee was 
satisfied that the book value of trade receivables was 
consistent with the Group’s accounting policy and 
previous practice and that the resultant valuation 
was reasonable.
Carrying value 
of inventory
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net 
realisable value, with due allowance for excess, obsolete or 
slow-moving items. Group management exercises 
judgement in assessing net realisable value and provisions 
for slow-moving and obsolete inventory which is based on 
current assessments of future demand, market conditions 
and new product development initiatives.
Further information can be found in note 12 to the Group 
financial statements.
The Committee considered the basis for the 
provisions made for obsolete and slow-moving 
inventory by management. The Committee also 
discussed with PwC the results of their review of 
inventories and was satisfied that the inventory 
valuation was consistent with the Group’s accounting 
policy and previous practice and that the resultant 
valuation was reasonable. Tyman plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 66
Strategic report Governance and Directors’ report Financial statements
2017 Annual Report and Accounts
Following discussions with the auditors, 
and the deliberations set out above, the 
Committee was satisfied that the financial 
statements dealt appropriately with each of 
the areas of significant judgement. PwC also 
reported to the Committee on any 
misstatements that they had found in the 
course of their work and confirmed that no 
material amounts remained unadjusted.
Throughout 2017 and up to the date of 
approval of this Annual Report and Accounts 
there has been in place an established, 
ongoing process for identifying, evaluating 
and managing the significant risks faced 
by the Group which has been regularly 
reviewed by the Committee and the Board, 
and is in accordance with Guidance on Risk 
Management, Internal Control and Related 
Financial and Business Reporting.
The Group’s assessment of its principal risks 
and uncertainties is set out on pages 36 and 41. 
The key elements of risk management and 
internal controls are detailed on page 37 of 
the Risk management section of this 
Annual Report.
In accordance with the Code, the Committee 
reviewed the Annual Report and was able to 
confirm to the Board that the Committee 
considered the Annual Report and Accounts, 
taken as a whole, was fair, balanced and 
understandable and provided the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the 
Group’s performance, business model 
and strategy.
Audit Committee priorities for 2018
Following the results of the Committee’s 
effectiveness review, the priorities for the 
Committee for 2018 are set out below:
• 
continue to review and refine the 
assessment of the potential impact on 
the Group of the new accounting 
standard IFRS 16 Leases;
• 
continue to promote a process of 
continuous improvement in the Group’s 
systems of internal control and 
risk management;
• 
provide sufficient time for extended 
risk-based discussions in the 
Committee’s timetable;
• 
 provide greater level of contact with 
the internal audit function, including 
more regular attendance of BDO at 
Committee meetings;
• 
 establish focused training time into 
the Committee schedule; and
• 
 conduct a full internal audit 
effectiveness review.
The results of the work on these priorities 
will be reported in the 2018 Annual Report.

Nominations Committee report
Evaluating skills and
experience
Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to present to you my first 
Nominations Committee report and 
to report on the main activities of the 
Committee during the financial year 
ended 31 December 2017.
Role of the Committee
The Board has delegated responsibility to 
the Committee for reviewing and making 
recommendations to the Board on the size, 
structure and composition of the Board and 
that its succession plans are appropriate for 
both its current and future strategic needs of 
the Group. 
In addition, the Committee must evaluate 
the balance of skills, diversity, knowledge 
and experience of the Board. In doing so the 
Committee is responsible for the identification 
and nomination of candidates to fill Board 
positions, recommending the reappointment 
of Non-executive Directors and the 
re-election of Directors. 
The Committee ensures all Board 
appointments are made in line with the 
Group’s stated employment policies and 
practices. These make provision for equal 
opportunities and non-discrimination and aim 
to ensure that an individual’s skills, experience 
and talent are the sole determinants in 
recruitment and career development. 
Committee membership
The members of the Nominations Committee 
during the year ended 31 December 2017 
were as follows:
Nominations Committee

2  Martin Towers was appointed Chairman of the 
Board in May 2017.
Pamela Bingham joined the Committee 
on her appointment to the Board in 
January 2018. All members are 
independent Non-executive Directors.
Activities of the Committee during 2017
During the year the Committee held four 
scheduled meetings to consider Board and 
senior management succession planning, 
the appointment and reappointment of 
Directors and the results and recommendations 
of the Committee performance evaluation. 
The Committee also reviewed the induction 
programme of Helen Clatworthy, ensured 
the Directors received both formal and 
informal training updates and reviewed the 
Committee’s terms of reference to ensure 
these remained relevant for the future needs 
of the Board. These may be found on the 
Group’s website.
In 2017 the key focus of the Committee’s 
work was to carry out a full succession 
planning review, looking at the Board, the 
Tyman Management Committee and senior 
management throughout the Group, with 
particular emphasis on the current skills and 
experience within the management teams 
and the potential each individual has to 
develop within the Group. 
Succession planning
Non-executive Directors
Following my appointment as Chairman of 
the Board in May 2017, the Board had a 
total of four Non-executive Directors. As 
part of the Committee’s annual review of 
the Board’s composition, the Committee 
concluded that The Zygos Partnership, an 
external executive search agency, with 
which the Board has no other connection, 
should be appointed to recruit another 
Non-executive Director. As part of this 
recruitment process a longlist of candidates 
was prepared, which was reviewed by the 
Chairman and Senior Independent Director. 
Following this review, a shortlist of 
candidates was interviewed by the 
Committee and the Executive Directors.

Succession planning continued
Non-executive Directors continued
The Committee was keen to ensure the Board 
was representative of as broad a base as 
possible and therefore paid particular attention 
to the level and type of experience of the 
candidates. All role specifications are drafted 
to ensure the best candidate for the role, whilst 
ensuring as diverse a Board as possible, including 
diversity of gender. The Committee was 
keen to ensure the candidate would fit with 
the cultural style of the Board. Having taken 
all these matters into consideration the 
Committee was able to formulate its 
recommendation to the Board, confirming 
the appointment of Pamela Bingham with 
effect from 18 January 2018. In line with policy, 
Pamela will offer herself for election at the 
forthcoming Annual General Meeting. 
As announced in January 2018, 
Angelika Westerwelle, who joined the Board 
in 2012 will step down from the Board at the 
conclusion of the Company’s AGM. 
Executive Directors
As disclosed in the Group’s half year results 
announcement in July 2017, as part of 
normal Board succession planning, the 
Committee decided that James Brotherton’s 
role should be enhanced with exposure 
to additional areas of experience, 
particularly strategy.
Accordingly, it was agreed that 
James Brotherton would take Board 
responsibility for Group strategy, corporate 
development and M&A, in addition to his 
existing duties as Chief Financial Officer. 
This change was made with effect from 
1 August 2017.
Senior management team
The Committee, in conjunction with the Board 
reviewed the senior management team, 
assisted by presentations and discussions 
with the Divisional CEOs, as part of senior 
talent management. The review covered 
the skills, experience and potential of each 
member of the team, to provide a sound 
evaluation of the current skills mix to ensure 
it remained appropriate for the future 
strategic needs of the Group.
This work is ongoing and a further review will 
be conducted during 2018 to assure the 
Committee these plans are being effectively 
managed and the appropriate development 
plans are in place. 
Evaluation
Committee evaluation
During the year the Committee participated 
in an externally led performance evaluation, 
in conjunction with Independent Audit. 
The results of the report were very positive 
and found the Committee had made 
significant progress and gained considerable 
momentum in the past twelve months as its 
work had focused on its key priorities in taking 
forward succession planning for the Board 
and the review of the senior management 
team and talent management of the Group 
as a whole. 
Director evaluation 
As part of the evaluation process, each 
Director had one-to-one performance 
reviews with the Chairman, which included 
any development or training needs which 
may be required to support them in making 
further contributions to the work of the Board. 
The Committee considers the results of these 
performance reviews prior the proposal 
for re-election to ensure the Director has 
demonstrated the required contribution 
and commitment to the role.
Diversity of the Board
The aim of the Committee is to ensure that 
the Board is well balanced and appropriate 
for the needs of the business and the 
achievement of its strategy, comprising 
Directors who are appropriately experienced 
and are independent in character and 
judgement. Before recommending new 
candidates to the Board, the Nominations 
Committee takes account of the balance of 
skills, knowledge, experience, diversity of 
background and cultural fit. 
The Committee is mindful of the 
Hampton-Alexander Review targets 
in respect of gender diversity and keeps this 
under review when considering appointments 
to the Board and is pleased to confirm 
continued adherence to these 
recommendations. Although T yman is not a 
member of the FTSE 350. The Committee 
is also aware of the Parker Review 
recommendation that each Board should 
have at least one Director of colour on the 
Board by 2024. The Committee will ensure all 
aspects of diversity are considered in 
the years ahead. 
Following the AGM held in May 2016, the 
Board had two female Non-executive Directors 
representing 33.0 per cent of the Board. 
On the appointment of Pamela Bingham, 
the female representation has increased 
to 42.0 per cent, but will reduce back to 
33.0 per cent, after the 2018 AGM, when 
Angelika Westerwelle steps down from 
the Board.
Committee priorities for 2018
The priorities for the Committee for 2018 
are set out below:
• 
continue with the review of succession 
planning and talent management for senior 
management throughout the divisions;
• 
consider the overall diversity of the 
Board, the Board Committees and senior 
management when reviewing succession 
planning within the business; and
• 
facilitate a full induction programme for 
the newly appointed Non-executive Director, 
including a training update for all Directors.

details can be found in note 17 and 29 
to the financial statements.
Share capital
As announced on 7 March 2018 Tyman 
entered into a conditional agreement to 
acquire Ashland Hardware, a North 
American manufacturer of hardware for 
residential windows and doors, for an 
Enterprise Value of US$101.0 million. 
The Acquisition and associated expenses 
are to be funded through a drawdown of 
the Group’s committed banking facilities, 
together with the net proceeds of a Placing 
of up to 10.0 per cent of the existing issued 
share capital of the Company utilising 
consents granted at the 2017 AGM to raise 
c. £50.0 million net of expenses. Details of 
the number of shares issued in respect of 
this Placing were not available at the time of 
this report, but can be found on the 
Company’s website.
Directors
The names of the Directors who served 
during the year are on pages 52 to 53 along 
with the biographical details of the Directors 
serving at the date of signing of this report. 
Further information regarding the Directors 
who served during the year can be found on 
pages 71 to 82 in the Remuneration report. 
Re-election of Directors
With the exception of Angelika Westerwelle, 
who will be stepping down from the 
Board, each Director will stand for election 
or re-election at the AGM. Accordingly, 
James Brotherton, Helen Clatworthy, 
Louis Eperjesi, Mark Rollins and Martin Towers 
will offer themselves for re-election at the 
2017 AGM. As this is Pamela Bingham’s 
first year of appointment, she will offer 
herself for election to the Board. 
Annual General Meeting
At the Company’s 2017 AGM the Directors 
were authorised to allot shares equal to 
approximately one-third of the issued share 
capital of the Company as at 12 May 2017 
or a further one-third of the issued share 
capital in connection with a pre-emptive 
offer by way of a rights issue. 
The Directors were also given the authority 
to allot shares for cash representing up to 
5.0 per cent of the Company’s issued share 
capital as at 12 May 2017, without first 
offering these shares to existing shareholders 
in the proportion to their existing holding. The 
Directors confirmed there was no intention to 
issue more than 7 .5 per cent of the issued share 
capital of the Company on a non-pre-emptive 
basis in any rolling three-year period (other 
than in connection with an acquisition as 
contemplated by the Pre-Emption Group’s 
Statement of Principles) without prior 
consultation with the relevant investor groups.
Shareholders also approved an additional 
authority for the Directors to issue ordinary 
shares, or sell treasury shares, for cash in 
connection with an acquisition or capital 
investment of the kind contemplated by the 
Pre-Emption Group’s Statement of Principles 
up to an additional aggregate amount being 
approximately 5.0 per cent of the issued 
ordinary share capital as at 12 May 2017. 
At the 2017 AGM the Company was also 
authorised to make market purchases of its own 
shares of up to approximately 14.99 per cent 
of the shares in issue as at 12 May 2017. The 
Board had no immediate intention of exercising 
this authority but wished to retain the flexibility 
to do so should it be needed in the future. This 
authority was not used during the year and 
therefore remained in full at the year end. 
The Directors believe that it is in the best 
interests of the Company that these powers 
are renewed and, as in previous years, 
resolutions to renew these authorities will be 
put to shareholders at the Company’s AGM 
to be held on 10 May 2018. 
The Notice of the Company’s AGM and 
related explanatory notes accompany this 
Annual Report and Accounts. Other than 
elections to the Board, the principal business 
to be considered at the AGM is to renew the 
Directors’ authority to allot shares, to 
disapply pre-emption rights in certain 
limited circumstances and to purchase its 
own shares, revisions to the LTIP Rules and 
other routine matters.
Further information on these resolutions is 
given in the explanatory notes to the Notice 
of AGM, which may also be found on the 
Group website.

Remuneration report
Annual statement
Rewarding
performance
Dear Shareholder
On behalf of the Board I am pleased to 
present our Remuneration report for the 
year ended 31 December 2017.
The Remuneration report, is split into 
three sections:
1. My annual statement, summarising the 
activities of, and decisions made by, the 
Remuneration Committee during the past 
twelve months (pages 71 to 73).
2. The Annual Report on Remuneration, 
which sets out the remuneration paid to 
Directors in 2017 and provides details on 
how the Committee intends to implement 
the Remuneration Policy in 2018. The 
Annual Report on Remuneration will be 
put to shareholders, for an advisory vote, 
at the 2018 AGM (pages 74 to 82).
3. A summary of the Remuneration Policy. 
The Remuneration Policy was approved 
by nearly 97.0 per cent of shareholders 
voting at the 2017 Annual General 
Meeting and sets out the Company’s 
policy on Directors’ remuneration for the 
three years from May 2017 to May 2020 
(pages 83 to 86).
Group performance in 2017
Tyman delivered a sound financial 
performance for 2017, with reported 
Revenue and Underlying Operating Profit 
increasing by 14.2 and 10.0 per cent 
respectively. Growth was aided by the 
successful 2016 acquisitions of Bilco and 
Giesse and favourable exchange rates on 
the translation of overseas results. On a 
constant currency like for like basis, Revenue 
increased by 1.7 per cent whereas 
Underlying Operating Profit decreased by 
1.5 per cent. Underlying earnings per share 
increased by 5.9 per cent in the year to 
26.91 pence for 2017. Cash generation was 
healthy, but lower than operating profit due 
to targeted investment in working capital 
and continued investment in the balance 
sheet, including gross capital expenditure at 
1.27x Depreciation. Leverage at the year end 
of 1.83x was again comfortably back within 
the Group’s core year-end target range of 
1.50x to 2.00x. ROCE decreased slightly in 
the year to 13.6 per cent, principally as a 
result of the 2016 acquisition activity. The 
Group continues to target achieving a ROCE 
of 15.0 per cent over the medium term.

Remuneration report.
Performance and reward in 2017
Full details of the Directors’ remuneration 
for 2017 are set out in the Annual Report 
on Remuneration on pages 74 to 82.
Annual bonus
The annual bonus scheme for the 
Executive Directors was based on 
stretching targets: 70.0 per cent on 
underlying profit targets and 30.0 per cent 
on free cash flow targets. The awards were 
weighted across four categories: profit 
growth over prior year; profit performance 
versus target; the ratio of operating cash 
generated to operating profit; and absolute 
cash generation versus target. The targets 
were increased during the year to ensure 
they remained appropriately stretching 
following the acquisition of Howe Green.
The specific targets and outcomes of each 
element of the bonus scheme for 2017 are 
set out in a table on page 75 of the 
Remuneration report. This shows the 
Executive Directors earned a total bonus of 
51.3 per cent of salary (2016: 91.25 per cent) 
in respect of 2017 , with strong year on year 
growth in profits and healthy cash conversion 
but lesser success in achieving the stretching 
profit and cash generation targets.
Long Term Incentive Plan
The LTIP awarded in 2015 was subject to 
a performance condition of cumulative 
three-year underlying earnings per share of 
between 69.60 pence (25.0 per cent vesting) 
and 78.45 pence (100.0 per cent vesting). In 
addition, the award was made subject to a 
discretionary TSR underpin. The actual 
cumulative underlying earnings per share 
outcome for the three years, 2015 to 2017, 
was 71.57 pence (a healthy compound 
annual growth of 13.1 per cent per annum 
over the three-year performance period). 
With the Remuneration Committee being 
satisfied that the discretionary TSR underpin 
had been met, it consequently approved a 
2015 LTIP vesting of 41.69 per cent. 
Changes in CFO responsibilities 
and salary
As set out in the Nominations Committee 
report, during the year the Board made the 
decision to assign executive responsibility for 
strategy, corporate development and M&A 
to James Brotherton with effect from 
1 August 2017.
In light of these additional responsibilities 
his salary was increased from £251,200 to 
£297,500 from the same date. His salary will 
remain unchanged for at least 17 months, 
with his salary not being reviewed again 
until 1 January 2019. The Committee 
decided that to allow time for the impact of 
his additional responsibilities to feed 
through to performance and to mitigate any 
“ratchet effect” of the base salary increase 
on variable pay, his pre-1 August 2017 salary 
of £251,200 would be used in calculating 
his 2017 annual bonus and an intermediate 
amount of £275,000 would be used for 
2018 LTIP and annual bonus purposes. 
His 2019 salary will then be used in 2019 
for LTIP and annual bonus awards. At the 
increased level, his salary is around the 
median level for chief financial officers for 
companies of similar size and complexity to 
Tyman. The principal shareholders were kept 
informed of the Committee’s decisions at 
the time and were fully supportive of the 
changes in responsibility and salary.
Remuneration in 2018
Salaries
The Committee completed a review in late 
2017 in respect of the CEO’s remuneration 
package, together with undertaking an 
assessment of Louis Eperjesi’s performance 
during 2017 and his record of leading the 
Group over a number of years. The Group’s 
performance during this time has been 
highly impressive, as can be seen in the 
chart of Tyman total shareholder return 
relative to that of the FTSE All Share Index 
set out on page 78. Whilst this assessment 
indicated that a more significant increase in 
Louis’ salary might be justified, the 
Committee decided to award him an 
increase of 3.2 per cent, taking his salary 
from £407,000 to £420,000, having taken 
into account the more modest increases 
being awarded throughout the Group and 
the increase in variable pay opportunity he 
now had for 2018. As discussed above, 
James Brotherton’s salary is to remain at 
£297,500 for 2018.
The salaries of the Group’s senior 
management team were also reviewed 
in December 2017 and in general were 
awarded an increase to their base salaries 
of 2.0 per cent, these being in line with 
the average increases for all UK-based 
employees, excluding exceptional increases 
reflecting local operating or market 
conditions in the various geographies 
where Tyman operates. 
Annual bonus
The overall structure of the annual bonus 
scheme for Executive Directors and other 
senior managers in 2018 remains 
unchanged from that operated in 2017. In 
line with the revised Remuneration Policy 
approved by shareholders, the maximum 
rewards available for the Executive Directors 
in 2018 increase to 125 per cent of salary.
As noted in the 2016 Annual Report, it was 
the Committee’s intention to introduce at 
least one other performance measure, in 
addition to the challenging profit and cash 
flow measures already in place, at the time 
the maximum award was increased. 
Accordingly, 20.0 per cent of Louis Eperjesi’s 
2018 annual bonus (25.0 per cent of salary) 
is to be linked to the achievement of certain 
personal objectives related to progress 
made in the delivery of the Group’s strategy.
More specifically, these personal objectives 
are to be set with regard to the Group’s 
progress during 2018 in delivering and 
embedding the Group’s plans in relation to 
strategy deployment (10.0 per cent of base 
salary), health and safety (7.5 per cent of 
base salary) and succession planning 
(7.5 per cent of base salary). The remaining  Find out more at: www.tymanplc.com 73
80.0 per cent (100.0 per cent of base salary) 
of Louis Eperjesi’s annual bonus will continue 
to be determined by the performance 
against financial targets linked to 
profitability (70.0 per cent of base salary) 
and cash generation (30.0 per cent of base 
salary). James Brotherton’s 2018 annual 
bonus, where the opportunity is also a 
maximum of 125.0 per cent of salary, will 
continue to be based entirely on financial 
measures, being the same measures as for 
Louis Eperjesi.
Consistent with prior years, the precise 
financial bonus targets (which the 
Committee considers to be commercially 
sensitive) will be disclosed in detail in the 
2018 Annual Report, along with details on 
the personal objectives of the CEO.
Long Term Incentive Plan
In line with the revised Remuneration Policy 
approved by shareholders, the maximum 
rewards available for the Executive Directors in 
2018 under the LTIP increases to 125.0 per cent 
of salary.
The Committee intends that LTIP awards 
made in 2018 will be subject to the same 
performance measures, underpins and 
holding periods as those awarded in 2017, 
namely: the financial performance measure 
will be cumulative underlying earnings per 
share over the three-year performance 
period subject to discretionary TSR and 
ROCE underpins. The Committee plans 
to determine the minimum EPS threshold 
performance (for 25.0 per cent vesting) for 
the period 2018 to 2020 and the maximum 
EPS threshold (full vesting) shortly after the 
announcement of the 2017 results. 
It is intended these performance measures 
will be disclosed in advance of the 2018 
AGM as these had not been determined at 
the time of completing this report.
Other matters
UK Corporate Governance Code
The Committee is cognisant of the proposed 
changes to the Code relating to Directors’ 
remuneration, which are currently going 
through the final consultation stages with a 
view to coming into force for accounting 
periods beginning on or after 1 January 
2019. Any new requirements necessary to 
comply with the provisions of the revised 
Code will be considered and actioned in the 
appropriate time-scale by the Committee.
Annual General Meeting
The Committee remains committed to 
ensuring executive remuneration is fully 
aligned with driving the right behaviours to 
deliver long term shareholder value through 
the setting of appropriate targets and 
individuals receiving rewards commensurate 
with performance. The Committee looks 
forward to your continued support at the 
2018 AGM, where I, and the other members 
of the Committee, will be happy to answer 
questions or receive feedback on any aspect 
of the Group’s remuneration.

Annual Report on Directors’ Remuneration
The Annual Report on Remuneration set out below (together with the Remuneration Committee Chairman’s Annual Statement) will be put 
to a single advisory shareholder vote at the 2018 AGM. The information below reports on the pay outcomes in respect of the 2017 financial 
year and explains how the Committee intends to operate the approved Remuneration Policy in 2018. The information from the single total 
remuneration figures for Directors on page 74 to the end of the section on loss of office payments on page 77 has been audited. The 
remainder of the Annual Report on Remuneration is unaudited.
Role of the Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee is responsible for setting and implementing the remuneration policy for the Executive Directors and the 
Company’s Chairman.
In addition, the Committee considers the remuneration arrangements for the Tyman Management Committee and for other senior managers. 
This ensures a consistent application of remuneration policy across the Group and aligns all senior managers’ remuneration to the Group’s 
strategic objectives. Remuneration received reflects the contribution made by senior executives to the business, the performance of the Group, 
the size and complexity of the Group’s operations and the need to attract, retain and incentivise executives of the highest quality. 
Committee membership
The members of the Committee during the year ended 31 December 2017 were as follows:

Secretary is Secretary to the Committee. Other individuals such as external advisers may be invited to attend all or part of any meeting, as and when 
appropriate and necessary. None of these individuals were present or participated in any discussion in respect of their own remuneration.
The Committee held four scheduled meetings during the year, at which there was full attendance, timed to coincide with the reporting cycle of the 
Company, including the approval of the Annual Report, and the management of the Executive Directors’ remuneration and incentive plans. A 
further meeting was held to consider the remuneration implications following the changes to Executive roles and responsibilities. The Committee’s 
terms of reference were reviewed during the year to ensure these remained relevant for the aims of the Committee and continued to meet the 
requirements of the business, the Group’s shareholders and other stakeholders. The terms of reference are available on the Group’s website.

1  With effect from 1 January 2017, Louis Eperjesi and James Brotherton each received a base salary increase of 2.5 per cent; these increases were broadly in line with 
those received by the wider workforce. Following a review of Executive Director roles, as announced in July 2017, James Brotherton’s salary was increased from £251,200 
to £297,500 with effect from 1 August 2017. 
2  Louis Eperjesi and James Brotherton received cash in lieu of pension amounting to 20.0 per cent and 15.0 per cent of base salary respectively. The Executive Directors 
are not members of any of the Group pension schemes.
3  The benefits provided to the Executive Directors included private medical insurance, permanent health insurance, life assurance and car allowance. There were no 
changes to the benefits policies during the year. 
4  The estimated value of the LTIP awards vesting by reference to performance in 2017 (granted in 2015), which vests on 9 March 2018, is based on the average share price 
over the three months ended 31 December 2017 of £3.3428, including the dividend equivalent shares. The comparative value of LTIP awards for 2016 has been restated 
using the actual share price at vesting on 9 March 2017 and so it is different to the value shown in the 2016 Remuneration report.
5  Helen Clatworthy was appointed to the Board in January 2017.
6 Jamie Pike stepped down from the Board and as Chairman in May 2017.
7  Martin Towers became Chairman of the Group in May 2017.
Determination of the 2017 Group Bonus Plan
The maximum bonus opportunity for both Executive Directors for the 2017 financial year was 100.0 per cent of annual salary, of which 
50.0 per cent is to be paid in cash and 50.0 per cent in ordinary shares in Tyman plc whose vesting is deferred for three years. Relevant 
Divisional and Group bonus targets for both profit and cash were increased during the year to take into account the acquisition of Howe Green 
and to ensure an equivalent level of difficulty. The outcome of the 2017 bonus, alongside the performance targets set, is shown below:

2 Profit performance versus target is measured on a constant currency basis.
3 Cash conversion targets were increased by 500 bps at each level compared with 2016.
4  Cash generation targets for the Group exclude the investment impact of major projects. The Group recorded an Operational Cash Flow in the year of £65.7 million and the 
investment impact of major projects in the year was £4.3 million (£0.1 million rounding difference).
Straight-line vesting occurs between target and stretch performance.
In total, 51.30 per cent of salary was earned as a bonus by the Executive Directors (2016: 91.25 per cent). The monetary amounts are payable 
in cash and deferred shares as set out below:

misstatement of the accounts, a material miscalculation of the performance of the Company or gross misconduct before the vesting date.

LTIP awards vesting in respect of 2017
LTIP awards were made to Executive Directors on 14 June 2015, subject to performance measured over three years ending 31 December 2017. 
Awards were measured against targets outlined below dependent upon underlying EPS from continuing operations:
EPS targets (100% weighting)
Cumulative EPS target over
the three years ending
December 2017

Threshold – 25% award 69.60p

19.25p
2016 25.41p
2017 26.91p
Underlying cumulative EPS 71.57p
1  The 2015 Underlying Earnings Per Share was restated in the 2016 accounts to 19.33 pence. However, for the purposes of the performance measurement the Committee 
has elected to use the lower number of 19.25 pence reported in 2015.
In addition to the targets above, vesting is subject to financial underpins which consider relative TSR, actual EPS achieved in 2017 and whether 
the three-year cumulative EPS target has been achieved through increased and inappropriate gearing of the balance sheet.
The Remuneration Committee was satisfied that the Underlying Earnings Per Share performance in 2017 of 26.91 pence was a fair reflection 
of the performance of the Group and undue risk was not taken in its achievement. Further, with the Group’s TSR being broadly in line with the 
TSR of a comparator group of UK listed companies, the Committee determined that the financial underpin was satisfied. Accordingly, with the 
level of award being calculated on a straight-line basis between the threshold and maximum targets, 41.69 per cent of the 2015 awards will 
vest on their three-year anniversary date in March 2018. Vested shares, after the sale of the necessary number of shares to cover tax and NI 
payments, are retained by the Executive Directors for a minimum of two years following the date of vesting.

In 2017 the Remuneration Committee introduced a discretionary ROCE underpin as an additional measure to ensure the performance 
conditions remain suitably challenging and fully aligned with shareholder interests. The ROCE underpin operates in addition to the existing 
financial underpin, with the Committee having the discretion to reduce LTIP awards in the event that ROCE does not meet certain pre-determined 
targets over the performance period. In 2017, the first year of operation of the ROCE underpin, it is intended that the discretion to reduce the 
LTIP award would apply if ROCE had not increased by at least 100 bps over the three-year performance period. ROCE for 2016, the base year 
for the performance period, was 13.6 per cent as set out on page 15. Find out more at: www.tymanplc.com 77

Statement of implementation for the 2018 financial year
Statement of implementation of remuneration for the 2018 financial year
In line with the Remuneration Policy report, approved by shareholders at the 2017 AGM, a number of amendments to the Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy were approved, to be implemented from 2018 onwards. Details of the Directors’ remuneration for the 2018 financial year 
are set out in the table below:
Salary CEO – £420,000 (2017: £407,000 – 3.2 per cent increase)
CFO – £297,500 (2017: received £270,400 – 7.64 per cent increase, 18.43 per cent change over 1 January 2017 salary 
of £251,200)
Pension allowance CEO – 20 per cent of base salary
CFO – 15 per cent of base salary
Benefits Life assurance cover, critical illness cover, private medical and dental cover, car allowance and professional tax and 
financial advice. The Directors to receive a car allowance of £16,500 per annum with effect from 1 January 2018.
Annual bonus 125 per cent of base salary, with half in cash and half in shares deferred for three years. The CEO bonus will be 
calculated 80 per cent (100 per cent of base salary) on financial measures and 20 per cent (25 per cent of base salary) 
on personal objectives linked to delivery of the Group’s strategy. The personal objectives are to be set in relation to 
the Group’s progress during 2018 in delivering and embedding the Group’s plans in relation to strategy deployment 
(10 per cent of base salary), health and safety (7.5 per cent of base salary) and succession planning (7.5 per cent of 
base salary).
The CFO bonus will be based entirely on financial measures, being the same measures as for the CEO. 
The financial measures for both Executive Directors will remain, 70 per cent linked to profitability (“PBTA”) and 30 per cent 
linked to cash generation. Consistent with prior years, the precise bonus targets will be disclosed in detail in the 
2018 Annual Report and Accounts, together with further details concerning the personal objectives of the CEO. 
LTIP Nil-cost options of 125 per cent of base salary. Performance metrics based on cumulative underlying EPS measured 
over a three-year period, and subject to discretionary relative total shareholder return and absolute ROCE underpins. 
25 per cent vests for threshold performance, with 0 per cent below threshold, increasing pro rata to full vesting for 
stretch performance. LTIP awards to be retained for two years after vesting. 
The performance targets will be based on cumulative EPS over the three-year period, with the threshold and 
maximum targets for the period 2018–2020 to be set shortly after the results for the 2017 year are announced, and 
when the effect of the recent changes in US tax legislation are fully understood. 
The salaries of the Group’s senior management team were reviewed in December 2017 and in general were awarded an increase to their base 
salaries of 2.0 per cent, these being in line with the average increases for all UK-based employees, excluding exceptional increases reflecting 
local operating or market conditions in the various geographies where Tyman operates. The average increase for the general worldwide 
workforce was 2.5 per cent.
Salary
CEO remuneration
In light of the Group’s progress, including its increase in size and complexity, the Committee undertook a review of the CEO’s remuneration 
package in December 2017. As part of the review, the Committee considered Louis Eperjesi’s level of experience, individual performance and 
impact on the continuing success of the Group. Subsequently, it was determined that an increase of 3.2 per cent to Louis Eperjesi’s base salary 
effective from 1 January 2018 was warranted.
CFO remuneration
As reported in the Group’s half-year results announcement in July 2017 the Board reviewed the Executive Directors’ roles and with effect from 
1 August 2017 James Brotherton took up responsibility for Group strategy, corporate development and M&A, in addition to his existing duties 
as CFO. In light of these additional responsibilities it was agreed to increase his salary to £297,500 from 1 August 2017, with no further review 
to his salary until 1 January 2019. In addition, and being fully cognisant of shareholder opinions, the Remuneration Committee mitigated the 
effect of the ratchet of the salary increase on variable pay by setting the base salary for the purposes of bonus and LTIP awards at £251,200 
for 2017 and £275,000 for 2018. Find out more at: www.tymanplc.com 81
LTIP awards
In line with the approved Remuneration Policy it is expected that an award of shares will be made under Tyman’s Long Term Incentive Plan in 
mid-March 2018, shortly after the release of the Group’s financial results for 2017 (the “2018 Awards”), with the two Executive Directors being 
awarded shares to the value of 125 per cent of their respective base salaries in line with the Policy approved at the 2017 AGM. The measurement 
period for the 2018 Awards will be from 1 January 2018 to 31 December 2020. These awards will be subject to two years’ post vesting holding 
period and three years’, post vesting, recovery provisions.
The 2018 Awards will be made under the rules of the 2010 Long Term Incentive Plan (the “2010 LTIP”) under which awards with a face value 
of up to 100 per cent of salary may be granted in normal circumstances. To enable the awards to be granted in advance of the 2018 AGM, 
where shareholders will be asked to confirm a change to the existing normal limit to bring it into line with the approved Policy, the exceptional 
circumstances provision of the current Rules, which permit awards with a fair value of up to 150 per cent of salary to be granted in circumstances 
which the Committee deems to be sufficiently exceptional, will be used. Revised LTIP Plan Rules, including the already approved increased 
maximum award level, will be put to shareholders for approval at the 2018 AGM.

Non-executive Director fees
The Chairman is paid a fee of £132,600 per annum, with no additional fee for chairing the Nominations Committee.
Non-executive Directors are paid an annual basic fee, plus an additional fee for chairing a Board Committee.

Annual fee for the Chair of the Audit or Remuneration Committees 7,000 5,200
Annual fee for the Senior Independent Director 6,000 5,200
Non-executive Director basic fees together with the fee for the Chairman were reviewed in December 2017 and increased by 2.0 per cent from 
January 2018, in line with the general UK pay award for 2018.
The Board reviewed the fees paid to the Chairs of the Audit and Remuneration Committees in December 2017 and considered these were not 
commensurate with the amount of time required and responsibility taken for these roles and awarded an increase to £7,000 per annum with 
effect from 1 January 2018.
An incremental fee was paid to the Senior Independent Director for the first time in 2017, to reflect the increasing size of the Group and 
the contribution this role makes to the Board. It was initially felt appropriate that this fee should be set at broadly the same level as that of 
a Committee Chair or at 50 per cent of the fee for a Committee Chair where the Senior Independent Director is also Chair of a Committee 
and in receipt of a Committee Chair fee. This fee was reviewed in December 2017 and it was agreed the full fee for this role should be £6,000 
for the 2018 financial year. Mark Rollins, who is Chair of the Remuneration Committee, will therefore receive an additional fee of £3,000 as 
Senior Independent Director.
During 2018, the Committee intends to carry out a full review of the Chairman’s and Divisional Directors’ remuneration packages. In conjunction 
with this work, the Board will also review the Non-executive and Committee Chairmanship fees. Tyman plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 82

Details of share plans
During the year awards were made under the following plans:
• 
Tyman Sharesave Plans in the form of options totalling 115,450 shares at a price of £3.2685 to £3.0794, vesting over a one or three-year 
period, depending on jurisdiction. The total number of awards outstanding as at 31 December 2017 is 288,524.
• 
Deferred Share Bonus Plan in the form of deferred share awards totalling 194,214 shares. Awarded as a nil-cost option in respect of deferred 
bonus. Vesting over a three-year period. The total number of share awards outstanding as at 31 December 2017 is 384,901.
• 
Tyman Long Term Incentive Plan awards totalling 792,477 shares. Awarded with performance conditions, vesting over a three-year period, 
with a further two-year holding period. The total number of share awards outstanding as at 31 December 2017 is 2,107,191.
• 
The total number of shares outstanding under all share plans as at 31 December 2017 is 2,780,616 shares.
Dilution
The Group operates the general principle that the vesting of share awards under Executive and Employee Share Plans should be satisfied 
either by the issue of shares out of treasury or, subject to Trustee consent, through shares acquired on the market by the Tyman Employee 
Benefit Trust.
Certain jurisdictions require that new shares are issued to employees to settle vesting under share arrangements. Where new shares are issued 
in these circumstances it is the Group’s intention to match the new shares issued with an equal purchase of shares on the market either into 
treasury or into the Tyman Employee Benefit Trust.
As at 31 December 2017, shares equivalent to 1.6 per cent of the Group’s issued share capital (excluding Treasury shares) would be required 
to settle all outstanding awards under employee and Executive share plans, assuming maximum vesting.

During the year the Committee wrote to major shareholders, representing over 50 per cent of the Group’s shareholder base, following the changes 
to James Brotherton’s responsibilities and resultant increase in base salary, as announced in July 2017. These changes were received positively, 
acknowledging James Brotherton’s contribution to the continued success of the Group and his further development within the Company. 
The Committee is grateful to the Group’s shareholders for their support as shown in the voting levels at the 2017 AGM and looks forward to 
receiving their continued support in 2018.

Remuneration Policy table
This section of the Directors’ remuneration report has been prepared in accordance with The Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups 
(Accounts and Reports) (Amendment) Regulations 2013 and sets out the Remuneration Policy which was approved by shareholders at the 
AGM on 12 May 2017. The policy took formal effect from the date of approval and is intended to apply until the 2020 AGM. Please note that 
some of the information shown has been updated to take account of the fact that the policy is now approved and enacted rather than proposed. 
A full version of the original shareholder approved policy can be found in the Annual Report for the year ended 31 December 2016 available 
on the Group website.

Base salary
To pay Executive Directors at a level 
commensurate with their contribution to 
the Company and appropriately 
based on skill, experience and 
performance achieved.
The level of salary paid is considered 
appropriate for motivation and 
retention of the calibre of executive 
required to ensure the successful 
formation and delivery of the Group’s 
strategy and the management of its 
business in the international 
environment in which it operates.
Base salary is paid monthly in cash.
The Executive Directors’ salaries are 
set having regard to typical pay levels 
at companies of a similar size, 
internationality and complexity. 
Salaries are normally reviewed 
annually and are typically effective 
from 1 January each year. When 
reviewing salaries, the Committee 
considers all relevant factors including:
• 
prevailing market and 
economic conditions;
• 
scope and responsibilities of 
the role;
• 
the level of increase for other roles 
within the business; and
• 
Company and 
individual performance.
There is no prescribed maximum 
salary. 
Salary increases will normally be 
broadly in line with the general annual 
salary increase received by Group 
employees in the relevant Director’s 
country of residence.
The Committee retains the discretion 
to award larger increases, for example, 
to reflect a change in role, 
development and performance of a 
Director or to reflect an increase in 
complexity of the Group. 
While there are no performance 
targets attached to the payment 
of salary, Company and individual 
performance is a factor considered 
in the salary review process.
Benefits
To provide a range of 
market-competitive benefits to 
facilitate the recruitment of high 
calibre individuals and encourage 
their retention.
Executive Directors are eligible for a 
range of benefits that may include:
• 
life assurance cover;
• 
critical illness cover;
• 
private medical and dental cover;
• 
car allowance; and 
• 
professional tax and 
financial advice.
Additional benefits may also be 
provided in certain circumstances 
which may include relocation and 
associated expenses.
Other benefits may be offered if 
considered appropriate, reasonable 
and necessary by the Committee and 
any reasonable business related 
expenses can be reimbursed 
(including tax thereon if determined 
to be a taxable benefit).
Executive Directors are eligible 
for other benefits introduced for 
the wider workforce on broadly 
similar terms.
No overall maximum level has been 
set since some costs may change in 
accordance with market conditions. 
Benefits are reviewed by the 
Committee on an annual basis and 
set at an appropriate market rate. 
No performance metrics apply.

Pension
To provide a market-competitive 
benefit for retirement, to facilitate the 
recruitment of high calibre individuals 
and encourage their retention. 
Executive Directors are eligible to 
participate in the relevant pension 
arrangements offered by the Group or 
to receive a cash salary supplement in 
lieu of pension entitlement.
The Committee may amend the form 
of any Executive Director’s pension 
arrangements in response to changes 
in legislation or similar developments, 
provided that the amendment does 
not materially increase the cost to the 
Company of the pension provision.
The maximum opportunity, either by 
way of a contribution to a Group 
pension arrangement or payment of a 
cash salary supplement, is 20 per cent 
of base salary.
The maximum cash salary supplement 
for any new Executive Director would 
be limited to 15 per cent of base salary.
No performance metrics apply.
Annual bonus
To incentivise and reward 
achievement of annual goals 
consistent with the strategic direction 
of the business.
To create further alignment with 
shareholders’ interests via the delivery 
and retention of deferred equity.
Rewards annual performance 
against targets set and assessed 
by the Committee.
Any bonus payable under the annual 
bonus scheme is paid 50 per cent in 
cash and 50 per cent in shares 
deferred for three years under the 
DSBP and is not pensionable.
A dividend equivalent provision allows 
the payment of dividends, at the 
Committee’s discretion on vested 
shares at the time of vesting.
Three-year recovery and withholding 
provisions apply.
The normal maximum annual bonus 
opportunity for the Executive Directors 
is 125 per cent of salary.
Performance metrics are selected 
annually based on the objectives 
of the business at the time, with 
the majority of the bonus linked 
to financial metrics. Annual 
financial performance targets 
have historically been focused on 
profit and cash generation metrics.
Performance below threshold 
results in zero payment. 
Payments normally rise from 
0 per cent to 100 per cent of 
the maximum opportunity for 
performance between the 
threshold and maximum targets.
Long Term Incentive Plan 
To align the interests of senior 
executives to those of shareholders in 
developing the long term growth of 
the business and execution and 
delivery of the Group’s strategy.
To facilitate share ownership.
Consists of awards of shares that vest 
subject to the achievement of 
performance conditions.
Participation and individual award 
levels will be determined at the discretion 
of the Committee and within the 
approved limits of the policy.
The Committee reviews the LTIP 
performance measures in advance 
of each grant to ensure their ongoing 
appropriateness and, where material 
changes to performance measures are 
proposed, it consults with shareholders.
Awards made under the LTIP are 
non-pensionable and will normally 
require Executive Directors to retain 
any awards that vest, net of tax, 
(whether held as shares or options) 
for a minimum of two further years 
from the date of vesting.
Three-year recovery and withholding 
provisions apply.
Dividend equivalents may be paid.
125 per cent of salary or 200 per cent 
in exceptional circumstances, such as 
the recruitment or retention of critical 
talent on a targeted basis.
Awards are subject to the 
achievement of defined targets 
measured over three financial 
years, starting at the beginning 
of the financial year in which the 
award is made. 
In respect of each performance 
measure, performance below 
threshold results in zero vesting. 
The starting point for the vesting 
of each performance element will 
be no higher than 25 per cent of 
the maximum opportunity and 
will rise a straight-line basis to 
100 per cent of maximum 
opportunity for attainment of 
levels of performance between 
threshold and maximum.
Awards will be granted subject 
to performance conditions that 
measure the long term success 
of the Company. The Committee 
may introduce or reweight 
performance measures so that 
they are directly aligned with the 
Company’s strategic objectives 
for each performance period.

Shareholding requirement
To motivate and reward the 
creation of long term shareholder 
value. To ensure alignment with 
shareholders’ interests.
Executive Directors are expected 
to retain a minimum shareholding 
equivalent to 200 per cent of 
basic salary.
Executive Directors are required to 
retain 50 per cent of shares vesting 
(after any disposals necessary to pay 
associated tax charges) under both 
the Deferred Share Bonus Plan and 
the LTIP until the minimum 
shareholding is reached.

Chairman and Non-executive Director fees
To attract and retain high calibre 
Non-executive Directors.
Non-executive Director fees are set by 
the Board.
Fees are normally reviewed 
annually, but not necessarily 
increased. Reviews take into account 
the time commitment, responsibilities 
and fees paid by companies of 
a similar size and complexity.
Fee increases, if applicable, for 
Non-executive Directors, take effect 
from 1 January.
Additional fees may be paid to 
Chairmen of Board Committees and 
to the Senior Independent Director.
If there is a temporary yet material 
increase in the time commitments for 
Non-executive Directors, the Board 
may pay extra fees on a pro-rata basis 
to recognise the additional workload.
No eligibility to receive bonuses or 
retirement benefits or to participate in 
the Group’s long term incentive plans 
or employee share plans.
Any reasonable business related 
expenses can be reimbursed 
(including tax thereon if determined 
to be a taxable benefit).
Aggregate annual fees to Directors 
are limited to £500,000 under the 
Company’s Articles of Association.

Policy report continued
Remuneration policy table continued
Notes to the Remuneration policy table:
1  Recovery and withholding provisions may be applied to LTIP and DSBP awards in the exceptional circumstances of a material misstatement, 
gross misconduct, or a material misjudgement of the performance of the Company.
2  For the avoidance of doubt, by approval of the policy, authority has been given to the Company to honour any commitments entered into 
with current or former Directors that have been disclosed to shareholders in previous Directors’ remuneration reports. Details of any payments 
to former Directors, where required by relevant regulations, will be set out in the Annual Report on Remuneration as they arise. 
3  The Remuneration Committee retains discretion over the operation of certain elements of pay, particularly variable pay. This includes the 
discretion to adjust either the annual bonus or LTIP if the outcome is not considered to be reflective of Company performance. In addition, 
the Committee may adjust elements of the plan including, but not limited to:
• participation;
• the timing of the grant and/or payment;
• the size of an award (up to plan limits) and/or payment;
• discretion relating to the measurement of performance in the event of a change of control;
• determination of a good leaver for incentive plan purposes;
• adjustments required in certain circumstances (e.g. rights issues, corporate restructuring and special dividends);
• in certain circumstances to grant and/or settle bonus or LTIP awards in cash. In practice, this will only be used in exceptional circumstances 
for Executive Directors;
• revise any formulaic bonus award downwards or upwards in the event that an exceptional negative or positive event occurs during 
the bonus year in question; however, in practice the Committee would not normally expect to revise any formulaic bonus upwards; and
• the ability to recognise exceptional events within the existing performance conditions.
4  Annual bonus performance metrics are determined at the start of each year based on the key business priorities for the year. The majority 
will be based on clear financial targets that include a significant weighting towards profit and cash generation as, when combined, these are 
often strong indicators of sustainable growth. 
5  LTIP performance metrics are determined at the time of grant. Performance measures may include measures of profitability (such as EPS), 
measures of capital allocation discipline (such as ROCE) and other measures of long term success (such as relative TSR). These measures 
align with the Company’s goal of value creation for shareholder through financial growth and above market returns. Performance against 
targets may also be subject to appropriate discretionary underpins.
Executive Directors’ service agreements and exit payment policy
The service agreements of the Executive Directors provide for a notice period of 12 months from either party. On termination of their contract 
by Tyman, and during the period of notice, Executive Directors would be eligible to be paid their salary, pension contributions and other employment 
benefits (but not annual bonus or grants under long term incentive plans) until the earlier of 12 months from notice of termination or the 
Director obtaining full time employment, with an obligation on the part of the Director to mitigate.
Payments will normally be made monthly, although the Committee retains discretion to agree settlement terms. These may include a pro-rata 
bonus in respect of the period worked by the Executive Director up until the date of termination. Bonuses in the final year of employment may 
also be settled in cash. The Committee may pay reasonable outplacement and legal fees where considered appropriate. The Committee may 
pay any statutory entitlements or settle or compromise claims in connection with a termination of employment, where considered in the best 
interests of the Company.
Executive Directors who are categorised as “Good Leavers” by the Committee will generally be eligible to receive outstanding awards under the 
Executive Share Plans as they vest in future years. Awards that vest under the LTIP post-employment will normally be pro-rated to reflect the 
fact that the Executive Director was not employed for the entire period under measurement. For LTIP awards made after the 2014 AGM, the 
Committee retains discretion to waive the post-vesting holding period requirement for Good Leavers depending on circumstances. Similar 
provisions apply in the event of a change of control.
In the event that an Executive Director is dismissed for reasons constituting gross misconduct, all unvested awards under Executive Share Plans 
lapse and the Committee retains no discretion in this regard. Find out more at: www.tymanplc.com 87
Non-executive Directors’ letters of appointment and shareholding guidelines
The Chairman and Non-executive Directors do not have service agreements but the terms of their appointment, including the time commitment 
expected, are recorded in letters of appointment. Non-executive Directors are employed for terms of three years’ duration, terminable on a 
month’s notice by the Company or the Director. All Non-executive Directors are required to undertake that they will submit themselves for 
re-election at each Annual General Meeting occurring during their term of office and no Non-executive Director will serve more than three 
terms of three years without prior shareholder approval.
Non-executive Directors do not have a minimum shareholding requirement; however, they are expected to acquire and retain a shareholding 
in the Group for the duration of their appointment.
Other policies
Recruitment of Executive Directors
The Committee’s general policy on recruitment remuneration is that new Executive Directors should be offered a contract on similar terms 
to the existing Executive Directors, except for pension contributions which would be capped at 15 per cent of salary. The Committee may 
agree that the Company will meet certain relocation and associated expenses of a new Executive Director, subject to circumstances.
For a new Executive Director their annual bonus framework and LTIP awards will be in line with the limits set out in the Remuneration Policy 
table. Depending on the timing of the appointment, the Committee may deem it appropriate to set different annual bonus performance 
conditions to the current Executive Directors for the first year of appointment. An LTIP award can be made shortly following an appointment 
(assuming the Company is not in a Closed period).
Where individuals are promoted to the Board from within the Group, their existing share grants or awards will be allowed to pay out on their 
original terms.
In certain circumstances, and in order to secure the services of an outstanding candidate, it may be necessary to make an award to a new 
Executive Director to “buy out” unvested performance plan share or cash awards forfeited on leaving their previous employment. Any such 
reimbursement would be subject to independent confirmation of the existence, forfeiture on departure and probability of these historical 
awards vesting had the new Executive Director remained in post. In doing so, the Committee will seek to do no more than match the fair value 
of the awards forfeited, taking account of performance conditions attached to these awards, the likelihood of those conditions being met and 
the proportion of the vesting period remaining. Such awards may be made using existing arrangements or using the flexibility provided by the 
Listing Rules to make awards without prior shareholder approval.
Any such reimbursement would be made in cash or in shares in Tyman plc, and may be subject to performance conditions attached to Tyman. 
No such incentives were paid in connection with the recruitment of Louis Eperjesi or for the promotion of James Brotherton to their respective 
roles, both of which occurred in 2010.
Recruitment of Non-executive Directors
New Non-executive Directors recruited to the Board will be paid the same rates and be subject to the same provisions concerning annual 
re-election and shareholdings as the then current Non-executive Directors.
Policy on external appointments
Executive Directors are allowed to accept external appointments as Non-executive Directors. In respect of quoted companies, this is limited 
to one other quoted company, subject to Board approval, provided that these are not with competing companies and are not likely to lead to 
conflicts of interest. Executive Directors would normally be allowed to retain the fees paid from these appointments. Executive Directors may 
not serve as the Non-executive Chairman of another quoted company.
Other share plans
The Executive Directors may participate in any all-employee share plans on the same basis as other employees in their country of residence. 
The maximum level of participation is subject to the limits imposed by HMRC (or a lower cap set by the Company).
Employment conditions elsewhere in the Group
The Remuneration Policy for Executive Directors is consistent with that for other employees save lower levels of incentive opportunity based 
on seniority and market norms. All senior management employees of the Group participate in bonus arrangements, with all permanent UK, 
US and other international employees eligible to participate in one or more share schemes. Employees in certain other jurisdictions are also 
eligible to participate in all-employee share plans. Although the Committee does not consult directly with employees on the Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy, the Committee does consider the general basic salary increase, remuneration arrangements and employment conditions 
for the broader employee population when determining remuneration policy for the Executive Directors.
Consultation with shareholders and shareholder bodies
The Committee is committed to regular engagement with shareholders and governance bodies. During the year, the Committee wrote to 
shareholders representing over 50 per cent of the Group’s issued shares and a number of governance bodies advising them of the changes to 
the CFO role and resultant increase in base salary, at the time of the announcement. Overall, the responses received were positive and acknowledged 
the Committee’s restraint in the phasing impact on variable pay of the base salary increase together with the fact that the base salary would 
not be reviewed again until 1 January 2019. 
In advance of implementing any material future changes to the Executive Directors’ remuneration the Committee would normally engage 
in consultation with shareholders.
All Committee members attend the Annual General Meeting and may also be contacted through the Group’s registered office to answer 
any questions shareholders or shareholder bodies may have in relation to the Group’s Remuneration Policy. Tyman plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 88

Report on the audit of the group financial statements
Our opinion
In our opinion, Tyman plc’s group financial statements (the “financial statements”):
• 
give a true and fair view of the state of the group’s affairs as at 31 December 2017 and of its profit and cash flows for the year then ended;
• 
have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union; and
• 
have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the group financial statements, Article 
4 of the IAS Regulation.
We have audited the financial statements, included within the Annual Report and Accounts (the “Annual Report”), which comprise: the 
consolidated balance sheet as at 31 December 2017; the consolidated income statement and statement of comprehensive income, the 
consolidated cash flow statement, and the consolidated statement of changes in equity for the year then ended; and the notes to the 
financial statements, which include a description of the significant accounting policies.
Our opinion is consistent with our reporting to the Audit Committee.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (“ISAs (UK)”) and applicable law. Our responsibilities under 
ISAs (UK) are further described in the Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. We believe that 
the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Independence
We remained independent of the group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements 
in the UK, which includes the FRC’s Ethical Standard, as applicable to listed public interest entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical 
responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.
To the best of our knowledge and belief, we declare that non-audit services prohibited by the FRC’s Ethical Standard were not provided to 
the group.
Other than those disclosed in the Directors’ report, we have provided no non-audit services to the group in the period from 1 January 2017 
to 31 December 2017.

Our audit approach
Overview
Materiality
Audit scope
Key audit 
matters
The scope of our audit
As part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements. In 
particular, we looked at where the directors made subjective judgements, for example in respect of significant accounting estimates that 
involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain. 
We gained an understanding of the legal and regulatory framework applicable to the group and the industry in which it operates, and 
considered the risk of acts by the group which were contrary to applicable laws and regulations, including fraud. We designed audit procedures 
at group and significant component level to respond to the risk, recognising that the risk of not detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is 
higher than the risk of not detecting one resulting from error, as fraud may involve deliberate concealment by, for example, forgery or 
intentional misrepresentations, or through collusion. We focused on laws and regulations that could give rise to a material misstatement in the 
group and parent company financial statements, including, but not limited to, the Companies Act 2006, the Listing Rules, UK tax legislation 
and equivalent local laws and regulations applicable to significant component teams. Our tests included, but were not limited to, review of the 
financial statement disclosures to underlying supporting documentation, review of correspondence with legal advisors, enquiries of management, 
review of significant component auditors’ work and review of internal audit reports in so far as they related to the financial statements.

Our audit approach continued
The scope of our audit continued
There are inherent limitations in the audit procedures described above and the further removed non-compliance with laws and regulations is 
from the events and transactions reflected in the financial statements, the less likely we would become aware of it.
We did not identify any key audit matters relating to irregularities, including fraud. As in all of our audits we also addressed the risk of 
management override of internal controls, including testing journals and evaluating whether there was evidence of bias by the directors that 
represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud.
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in the auditors’ professional judgement, were of most significance in the audit of the financial 
statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) 
identified by the auditors, including those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the allocation of resources in the audit; 
and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters, and any comments we make on the results of our procedures thereon, were 
addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a 
separate opinion on these matters. This is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit. 
Key audit matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter
Goodwill and intangible assets impairment assessment
Refer to page 65 (Audit Committee Report), page 111 (notes).
There is £324 million of goodwill and £103 million of intangible assets 
recognised on the balance sheet, predominantly arising from past 
acquisitions. The Group operates in the building products market and 
therefore future results are impacted by fluctuations in the housing 
market and wider economy.
We focused on these balances because the determination of whether 
or not an impairment charge was necessary involved significant 
judgements about the future results of the business and the allocation 
of assets to cash generating units (CGUs).
We also focused on the estimated value in use calculations of the 
Schlegel International and AmesburyTruth CGUs as these units have 
the most significant carrying values. The Group’s other CGU ERA 
operates in the United Kingdom and has significant headroom relative 
to the CGU carrying value.
The value in use calculation to support the carrying value of goodwill 
and intangibles includes the impact of some anticipated improvement 
in housing markets and realisation of the benefits of synergies arising 
from acquisitions, the footprint rationalisation project, investment 
made by the Group, and closure of loss-making business units.
We evaluated the appropriateness of the allocation of acquired 
assets to CGUs. We considered the level of integration of acquisitions 
made during the year to assess the level at which cash flows were 
independently generated. We were satisfied that the level of integration 
was such that the cash flows of acquired entities are not independently 
generated and therefore the allocation to CGUs was appropriate.
For all CGUs, namely AmesburyTruth, ERA and Schlegel International, 
we evaluated the reasonableness of management’s future cash flow 
forecasts and tested the underlying value in use calculations. We 
agreed management’s forecast to the latest Board approved 
strategic plan. We also compared historic actual results to those 
budgeted to assess the quality of management’s forecasting. Where 
performance was below budget, we assessed why this was the case. 
Based on this evaluation, we considered management’s ability to 
forecast was fair.
The key assumptions in the calculations were growth in revenue and 
EBITDA margins. In assessing these assumptions we considered 
external construction industry outlook reports and economic growth 
forecasts from a variety of sources, as these were good indicators of 
building product sales. Where management’s growth assumptions 
were in excess of these external forecasts, we evaluated 
management’s rationale, being the benefit of acquisition synergies 
and restructuring activities undertaken and as a result, we considered 
the forecasts to have been prepared on a supportable basis.
We also tested:
• 
management’s assumption in respect of the long term growth 
rates in the forecasts by comparing them to long term average 
growth rates of the economies in the relevant territories; and
• 
the discount rate by assessing the cost of capital for the company 
and comparable organisations.
We were satisfied these assumptions were appropriate.
Management also performed sensitivity analysis in respect of the 
key assumptions, which were flexed to determine at what level this 
would eliminate the headroom in the model. There were no changes 
in the key assumptions that were considered reasonably possible 
which would eliminate headroom, as outlined in the disclosure 
in note 10. Find out more at: www.tymanplc.com 91

Key audit matters continued
Key audit matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter
Carrying value of provisions
Refer to page 65 (Audit Committee Report), page 125 (notes).
The Group holds a number of provisions which are inherently 
judgemental, including:
Property related provisions (£2.9 million)
The Group has been built up through acquisition and is in the process of 
going through a footprint rationalisation programme which has resulted 
in the exit and consolidation of manufacturing and warehouse facilities. 
Consequently there are a number of manufacturing and warehouse 
sites which are no longer used. Provisions have therefore been made in 
relation to onerous leases. In addition, a number of leasehold properties 
require the Group to reinstate them to their original state of repair, for 
which dilapidation provisions have been made. We focused on these 
because there is inherent judgement in assessing the minimum 
expected costs of onerous leases as well as the cost of repairs at the 
end of a lease term.
Restructuring provisions (£8.0 million)
Restructuring provisions are comprised mainly of provisions for 
the closure of the Rochester and Amesbury plants, (£7.6 million).
Warranty provisions (£0.9 million)
The provision is based on the estimated costs of warranty claims on 
products sold. We focused on this provision as the estimation and timing 
of costs in respect of future warranty claims requires judgement, and, 
as such, there is a risk that the provision may be understated.
Other provisions (£6.0 million)
Other provisions are comprised mainly of provisions for potential 
tax exposures (£3.3 million) and onerous contracts (£0.8 million). 
We focused on these provisions as there is inherent judgement in 
assessing the amount and timing of settlement of these liabilities.
Property related provisions
Onerous lease provisions are based on the residual lease period and 
contractual lease payments, discounted for the time value of money. 
Our approach included agreeing remaining rental costs to lease 
agreements and assessing the reasonableness of discount rates 
applied against the risk free interest rate in each applicable country. 
We were satisfied the onerous lease provisions were made on a 
reasonable basis.
The Group has implemented a rolling programme of obtaining 
updated external valuations for costs of reinstating leasehold 
properties to their original state of repair. Where applicable we 
read available external valuation reports, assessed the competence 
and objectivity of the valuation expert by reviewing qualifications, 
and agreed their estimate to management’s calculation. Where no 
external valuations were available, we considered the reasonableness 
of the items included in the calculation, being the estimated removal 
costs of equipment, and repair costs considering the relative size and 
complexity of work across sites. We also compared the provisions 
made by management in prior years to the external valuations 
to assess the accuracy of management’s estimations, noting 
that there was no significant difference between management’s 
previous estimate and the external valuation.
Restructuring provisions
The provision for the closure of the Rochester and Amesbury plants 
is predominantly for severance costs to employees and clean-up costs 
of the plants to get them into a saleable condition. We examined 
the communication to employees of the plant closure and tested 
a sample of severance payments, and assessed the reasonableness 
of the valuation of the clean-up costs performed by an independent 
external valuation expert.
Warranty provisions
We tested the accuracy of management’s calculation of forecast 
claims, which contain an element based on historic claims 
experience, and specific elements for known warranty issues, and 
compared the level of historic warranty claims to that forecast. Based 
on the work performed, we were satisfied that the provision was 
made on a reasonable basis.
Other provisions
The provisions for potential tax exposures identified are based on 
either calculations performed by management considering the 
potential risks identified and historic settlement values, or specific 
advice received from external tax advisers. We assessed the 
reasonableness of the estimates made and were satisfied that whilst 
judgemental, the provisions have been made on a reasonable basis.
Provisions for onerous contracts are based on the minimum 
contractual cost of terminating loss-making contracts. We examined 
the terms of the contract and considered the appropriateness of 
treating it as onerous. We verified that the cost of termination is 
calculated in line with the terms of the contract and were therefore 
satisfied that the provision was made on a reasonable basis. Tyman plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 92

Exceptional items
Refer to page 65 (Audit Committee Report), page 105 (notes).
The Group has recognised £10.0 million net exceptional costs 
in the year, the classification of which is subject to judgement. 
The exceptional items relate to:
Footprint restructuring (£16.4 million charge and £5.7 million credit)
These costs relate to the footprint rationalisation programme 
across the Group, predominantly in North America. £15.2 million 
of the £16.4 million costs relate to the North American project where 
the costs relate to plant closures (severance and clean-up costs), other 
employee expenses and other cash expenses. The remaining £0.8 million 
relates to footprint projects in ERA and SchlegelGiesse.
The credit predominantly relates to:
• 
£1.8 million relating to the disposal and exit from the Canton, South 
Dakota and Sioux Falls facilities, and 
• 
£3.3 million past service costs relating to the closure of the Rochester 
post-retirement benefit medical plans. 
The North American footprint project is expected to conclude by 2020.
M&A and integration (£2.2 million charge and £2.9 million credit)
There are integration costs of £2.2 million that relate to:
• 
Legal, financial, taxation and consultancy costs associated with the 
acquisition of Howe Green in the year; 
• 
IP defence costs relating to pre-acquisition periods; and
• 
Integration of businesses acquired in prior years.
This is offset by a credit of £2.9 million, of which £2.3 million relates to 
the pension liability recoverable from and indemnified by the previous 
owners of Bilco. The remaining £0.6 million relates to the release of 
surplus non-trading provisions no longer required.
There is also a small amount recognised in relation to the write off 
of inventory fair value adjustments.
We have evaluated the appropriateness of recognising the income 
and charges as exceptional items and considered the impact of 
them on the underlying results. 
Specifically, we have understood the criteria for and governance 
over the footprint restructuring and M&A and integration projects 
and the costs associated with them that management deem to 
be exceptional items. 
Accordingly, we have tested the costs associated with such projects 
to underlying evidence to support the amounts recognised and 
challenged management on the rationale of classifying these 
amounts as exceptional.
We have also assessed the adequacy of the disclosure of 
the exceptional items within the financial statements and 
we are satisfied that the accounting treatment and disclosure 
is appropriate.
How we tailored the audit scope
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements 
as a whole, taking into account the structure of the group, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which it operates.
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements as a whole, 
taking into account the geographic structure of the Group, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which the Group operates.
The Group is structured along three business lines being AmesburyTruth, ERA, and Schlegel International along with centralised functions covering 
Group treasury and central costs. The Group financial statements are a consolidation of 65 reporting units for the Group’s operating businesses, 
which map into the three business lines and centralised functions.
Of the Group’s 65 reporting units, we identified 9 which, in our view, required an audit of their complete financial information, due to their size. 
The units were based in the United Kingdom (UK), the United States (US), and Italy.
Specific audit procedures on certain balances and classes of transactions were performed at a further 1 reporting unit, as while overall 
the units were not financially significant, certain classes of transactions and balances were material or considered to be higher risk, including 
cash, borrowings and interest expense. The UK engagement team also undertook specific procedures on 1 small reporting unit in Dubai, in 
line with our plan of rotating visits to different financially insignificant units to incorporate unpredictability and provide evidence over the units 
not subject to audit of their complete financial information.

Report on the audit of the group financial statements continued
Our audit approach continued
How we tailored the audit scope continued
In establishing the overall approach to the Group audit, we determined the type of work that needed to be performed at each of the reporting 
units either by us, as the Group engagement team, or the component auditors in the US or Italy operating under our instruction.
Where work was performed by the US and Italian component auditors, the UK engagement leader and senior manager visited the US 
(engagement leader only) and Italian component teams, reviewed audit work papers related to areas of focus, and participated in the US and 
Italian component clearance meetings. In addition to the site visits we held regular phone calls with the US and Italian teams and obtained 
formal reporting. The US engagement leader also attended the Group Audit Committee meeting in the UK.
73% of the Group’s revenue is accounted for by reporting units where we performed full scope audit work or performed specific audit procedures 
over revenue. 84% of the Group’s underlying operating profit before taxation is accounted for by the 9 reporting units where we performed full 
scope audit work on the complete financial information. Audit procedures were performed at a further 1 reporting units as explained above. We 
considered the quantitative and qualitative characteristics of the remaining reporting units which comprise a large number of small units in which 
we considered the risk of material misstatement to the Group to be low. The Group team performed appropriate analytical procedures over these 
remaining units. Together with additional procedures performed at the Group level on balances such as goodwill, intangible assets, and taxation, 
this gave us the evidence we needed for our opinion on the Group financial statements as a whole.
Materiality
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality. These, together 
with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures on the 
individual financial statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating the effect of misstatements, both individually and in aggregate on 
the financial statements as a whole. 
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:
Overall Group materiality £3.8 million (2016: £3.3 million).
How we determined it 5% of underlying operating profit before tax.
Rationale for benchmark applied Underlying operating profit before tax is the key measure used internally by 
management in assessing the performance of the Group, externally by analysts, 
and is the measure disclosed as a key performance indicator in the annual report. 
This measure provides us with a consistent year on year basis for determining 
materiality based on trading performance and eliminates the impact of 
non-recurring items. Underlying operating profit excludes net finance costs, 
exceptional items, amortisation of acquired intangible assets, and impairment 
of acquired intangible assets and goodwill.
For each component in the scope of our group audit, we allocated a materiality that is less than our overall group materiality. The range of 
materiality allocated across components was between £11,000 and £3.7 million. Certain components were audited to a local statutory audit 
materiality that was also less than our overall group materiality.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above £200,000 (2016: £165,000) 
as well as misstatements below that amount that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.
Going concern
In accordance with ISAs (UK) we report as follows:
Reporting obligation Outcome
We are required to report if we have anything material 
to add or draw attention to in respect of the directors’ 
statement in the financial statements about whether 
the directors considered it appropriate to adopt the 
going concern basis of accounting in preparing the 
financial statements and the directors’ identification 
of any material uncertainties to the group’s ability to 
continue as a going concern over a period of at least 
twelve months from the date of approval of the 
financial statements.
We have nothing material to add or to draw attention to. However, because not all 
future events or conditions can be predicted, this statement is not a guarantee as to 
the group’s ability to continue as a going concern.
We are required to report if the directors’ statement 
relating to Going Concern in accordance with Listing 
Rule 9.8.6R(3) is materially inconsistent with our 
knowledge obtained in the audit.
We have nothing to report. Tyman plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 94

Reporting on other information 
The other information comprises all of the information in the Annual Report other than the financial statements and our auditors’ report thereon. 
The directors are responsible for the other information. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, 
accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion or, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in this report, any form of assurance thereon. 
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether 
the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to 
be materially misstated. If we identify an apparent material inconsistency or material misstatement, we are required to perform procedures to 
conclude whether there is a material misstatement of the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other information. If, based 
on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that 
fact. We have nothing to report based on these responsibilities.
With respect to the Strategic Report and Directors’ report, we also considered whether the disclosures required by the UK Companies Act 2006 
have been included. 
Based on the responsibilities described above and our work undertaken in the course of the audit, the Companies Act 2006, (CA06), ISAs (UK) 
and the Listing Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) require us also to report certain opinions and matters as described below 
(required by ISAs (UK) unless otherwise stated).
Strategic Report and Directors’ report
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit, the information given in the Strategic Report and Directors’ report 
for the year ended 31 December 2017 is consistent with the financial statements and has been prepared in accordance with applicable legal 
requirements. (CA06)
In light of the knowledge and understanding of the group and its environment obtained in the course of the audit, we did not identify any 
material misstatements in the Strategic Report and Directors’ report. (CA06)
The directors’ assessment of the prospects of the group and of the principal risks that would threaten the solvency or liquidity of the group
We have nothing material to add or draw attention to regarding:
• 
The directors’ confirmation on page 38 of the Annual Report that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing 
the group, including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity.
• 
The disclosures in the Annual Report that describe those risks and explain how they are being managed or mitigated.
• 
The directors’ explanation on page 42 of the Annual Report as to how they have assessed the prospects of the group, over what period they 
have done so and why they consider that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have a reasonable expectation 
that the group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their assessment, including any 
related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.
We have nothing to report having performed a review of the directors’ statement that they have carried out a robust assessment of the 
principal risks facing the group and statement in relation to the longer-term viability of the group. Our review was substantially less in scope 
than an audit and only consisted of making inquiries and considering the directors’ process supporting their statements; checking that the 
statements are in alignment with the relevant provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code (the “Code”); and considering whether the 
statements are consistent with the knowledge and understanding of the group its environment obtained in the course of the audit. (Listing Rules)
Other Code Provisions
We have nothing to report in respect of our responsibility to report when: 
• 
The statement given by the directors, on page 66, that they consider the Annual Report taken as a whole to be fair, balanced and 
understandable, and provides the information necessary for the members to assess the group’s position and performance, business model 
and strategy is materially inconsistent with our knowledge of the group obtained in the course of performing our audit.
• 
The section of the Annual Report on page 61 describing the work of the Audit Committee does not appropriately address matters 
communicated by us to the Audit Committee.
• 
The directors’ statement relating to the parent company’s compliance with the Code does not properly disclose a departure from a relevant 
provision of the Code specified, under the Listing Rules, for review by the auditors. Find out more at: www.tymanplc.com 95
Report on the audit of the group financial statements continued
Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit
Responsibilities of the directors for the financial statements
As explained more fully in the Directors’ responsibilities statement set out on page 60, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the 
financial statements in accordance with the applicable framework and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. The directors are 
also responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing 
as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate 
the group or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but 
is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. 
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected 
to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. 
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the FRC’s website at: 
www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditors’ report.
Use of this report
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the parent company’s members as a body in accordance with Chapter 3 
of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any 
other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior 
consent in writing.
Other required reporting

Notes to the financial statements
For the year ended 31 December 2017
1. General information
Tyman plc and its subsidiaries is a leading international manufacturer and supplier of engineered components to the door and window 
industry. At 31 December 2017 the Group had 23 manufacturing sites in nine countries along with a further 14 sourcing and distribution sites 
across North America, Europe, South America, Asia and Australasia with its products being found in homes and buildings worldwide.
Tyman plc is a public limited company listed on the London Stock Exchange, incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales. The address of 
the Company’s registered office is 29 Queen Anne’s Gate, London SW1H 9BU.
2. Accounting policies and basis of preparation
The accounting policies in this section relate to the financial statements in their entirety. Accounting policies, including critical accounting 
judgements and estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements, that relate to a particular note are described in the specific 
note to which they relate. The accounting policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
Certain comparatives have been restated for fair value adjustments made in respect of business combinations completed in the 2016 financial 
year. See note 24.
2.1 Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements of Tyman plc have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union and the 
Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRSs. 
The consolidated financial statements are principally prepared on the basis of historic cost. Where other bases are applied, these are identified 
in the relevant accounting policy. 
2.2 Going concern
The Directors are confident, on the basis of current financial projections and the banking facilities available, and after considering sensitivities, 
that the Company and the Group have sufficient resources for its operational needs that will enable the Group to remain in compliance with its 
financial covenants in its bank facilities for at least the next 12 months. Accordingly, the Directors continue to adopt the going concern basis. 
Further details on the Group’s Viability statement is set out on page 42 of the Report and Accounts.
2.3 Accounting judgements and estimates
The preparation of financial statements requires management to exercise judgement in applying the Group’s accounting policies. It also 
requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and 
expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates. 
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the 
period in which the estimate is revised and in any affected future periods. 
The areas representing the critical judgements made by management in the preparation of the Group’s financial statements are listed 
below and in more detail in the related notes: 
• 
exceptional items (note 6);
• 
the carrying amount of goodwill and intangible assets (note 10);
• 
the carrying amount of inventories (note 12);
• 
the carrying amount of trade receivables (note 13); 
• 
provisions (note 19); and
• 
business combinations (note 24).
The areas involving key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty that are significant to the 
financial statements are listed below and in more detail in the related notes: 
• 
deferred tax assets (note 8); and
• 
defined benefit pension and post-retirement benefit schemes (note 20). Find out more at: www.tymanplc.com 101

2.4 Changes in accounting policy and disclosures
2.4.1 New, revised and amended EU-endorsed accounting standards
There were no new or amended accounting standards relevant to the Group’s results that are effective for the first time in 2017 that have 
a material impact on the Group’s consolidated financial statements.
2.4.2 New, revised and amended accounting standards currently EU-endorsed but not yet effective
A number of new, revised and amended accounting standards and interpretations are currently endorsed but are effective for annual periods 
beginning after 1 January 2018, and have not been applied in preparing these consolidated financial statements. None of these are expected 
to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Group, except the following:
Accounting standard Requirement
IFRS 9 Financial instruments IFRS 9 addresses the classification, measurement and recognition of financial assets and financial 
liabilities. It replaces the guidance in IAS 39 that relates to the classification and measurement of 
financial instruments. IFRS 9 establishes three primary measurement categories for financial assets: 
amortised cost, fair value through other comprehensive income and fair value through profit or loss. 
The basis of classification depends on the entity’s business model and the contractual cash flow 
characteristics of the financial asset. Investments in equity instruments are required to be measured at 
fair value through profit or loss with the irrevocable option at inception to present changes in fair value in 
other comprehensive income (non-recycling). The standard is effective for accounting periods beginning 
on or after 1 January 2018. Tyman is in the process of assessing the impact of adopting IFRS 9 with the 
main areas of consideration being hedge accounting, impairment of accounts receivable and refinancing 
transactions. Based on the work undertaken to date, the adoption of IFRS 9 is not expected to have 
a material impact on the Group financial statements.
IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts 
with customers
IFRS 15 deals with revenue recognition and establishes principles for reporting useful information to users 
of financial statements about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising 
from an entity’s contracts with customers. Revenue is recognised when a customer obtains control of a good 
or service and thus has the ability to direct the use and obtain the benefits from the good or service. 
The standard replaces IAS 18 Revenue and IAS 11 Construction contracts and related interpretations. IFRS 15 
will be effective for the first time for the year beginning on or after 1 January 2018. Tyman is in the process of 
assessing the impact of adopting IFRS 15 and notes that Revenue of the Group is transactional in nature with 
limited judgement applied in recognising the amounts recorded. In addition, contracts with customers are 
predominantly based on standard terms and conditions. Based on the work undertaken to date, the 
adoption of IFRS 15 is not expected to have a material impact on the Group financial statements.
IFRS 16 Leases Under the previous guidance in IAS 17, a lessee had to make a distinction between a finance lease 
(on balance sheet) and an operating lease (off balance sheet). The new standard requires lessees to 
recognise almost all lease contracts on the balance sheet; the only optional exemptions are for certain short 
term leases and leases of low-value assets. An interest expense on the lease liability and depreciation 
on the “right-of-use” asset will also have to be recognised. IFRS 16 will be effective for the first time for 
the year beginning on or after 1 January 2019. The adoption of IFRS 16 is expected to be relatively 
significant to the Group’s financial statements and the Group’s assessment of the likely impact is ongoing.
There are no other IFRSs that are not yet effective that would be expected to have a material impact on the Group.
2.5 Consolidation
Subsidiaries are entities that are directly or indirectly controlled by the Group. Control exists when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, 
variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. Subsidiaries 
are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are deconsolidated from the date that control ceases.
Intercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companies are eliminated. Unrealised losses are 
also eliminated. Where necessary, amounts reported by subsidiaries have been adjusted to conform to the Group’s accounting policies.
2.6 Foreign exchange
2.6.1 Functional and presentation currency
Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment 
in which the entity operates (the functional currency). The consolidated financial statements are presented in Sterling, which is the functional 
currency of the Company and the presentation currency of the Group.
2.6.2 Transactions and balances
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. 
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year-end exchange rates 
of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement, except when deferred in other 
comprehensive income as qualifying cash flow hedges and qualifying net investment hedges. Other than the ineffective element, these are 
recognised directly in equity until the disposal of the net investment, at which time they are recognised in the income statement.
2.6.3 Group companies
On consolidation, assets and liabilities of Group companies denominated in foreign currencies are translated into Sterling at the exchange rate 
prevailing at the balance sheet date. Income and expense items are translated into Sterling at the average rates throughout the year.
Exchange differences arising on the translation of opening net assets of Group companies, together with differences arising from the translation 
of the net results at average or actual rates to the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date, are taken to other comprehensive income. 
On disposal of a foreign entity, the cumulative translation differences recognised in other comprehensive income relating to that particular 
foreign operation are recognised in the income statement as part of the gain or loss on disposal. Tyman plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 102

3. Segment reporting
3.1 Accounting policy
3.1.1 Revenue recognition 
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable. Revenue represents the amounts receivable for goods 
supplied, stated net of discounts, returns, rebates and value-added taxes.
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to the Group and when the amount of 
revenue can be reliably measured. Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when the risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have 
been substantially transferred to the buyer. This is usually on dispatch of goods or on receipt of goods by the customer.
3.1.2 Segment reporting
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the Chief Operating Decision Maker. The 
Chief Operating Decision Maker, defined as the Board of Directors of the Group, is responsible for allocating resources and assessing 
performance of the operating segments.
3.2 Segment information
The reporting segments reflect the manner in which performance is evaluated and resources are allocated. The Group operates through three 
clearly defined divisions: AmesburyTruth, ERA and SchlegelGiesse. 
AmesburyTruth comprises all the Group’s operations within the US, Canada and Mexico. ERA comprises the Group’s UK and Ireland hardware 
business, together with Ventrolla and Tyman Sourcing Asia. During the year, ERA acquired Howe Green and assumed responsibility for the 
Bilco UK business. These businesses are now included in the ERA reporting segment with the 2016 comparatives restated for the AmesburyTruth 
and ERA segments in respect of the reallocation of Bilco UK. SchlegelGiesse comprises all the Group’s other businesses outside of the US, 
Canada and Mexico as well as the two UK seal manufacturing plants. 
Centrally incurred functional costs that are directly attributable to a Division are allocated or recharged to the Division. All other centrally 
incurred costs and eliminations are disclosed as a separate line item in the segment analysis. 
Each reporting segment broadly represents the Group’s geographical focus, being the North American, UK and international operations 
respectively. In the opinion of the Board, there is no material difference between the Group’s operating segments and segments based on 
geographical splits. Accordingly, the Board does not consider geographically defined segments to be reportable. For completeness, the Group 
discloses certain financial data for business carried on in the UK that is not accounted for in ERA in notes 3.2.1 and 3.2.4.
The following tables present Group revenue and profit information for the Group’s reporting segments, which have been generated using the 
Group accounting policies, with no differences of measurement applied, other than those noted above.

5. Employees and employee costs
5.1 Accounting policy
5.1.1 Wages and salaries
Wages and salaries are recognised in the income statement as the employees’ services are rendered.
5.1.2 Termination benefits
Termination benefits are payable when employment is terminated by the Group before the normal retirement date, or whenever an 
employee accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for these benefits. The Group recognises termination benefits at the earlier of the 
following dates:
• 
when the Group can no longer withdraw the offer of those benefits; and
• 
when the entity recognises costs for a restructuring that is within the scope of IAS 37 and involves the payment of termination benefits.
In the case of an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy, the termination benefits are measured based on the number of employees 
expected to accept the offer. Benefits falling due more than 12 months after the end of the reporting period are discounted to their present value.
5.1.3 Profit sharing and bonus plans
The Group recognises a liability and an expense for bonuses and profit sharing based on the expected level of payment to employees in 
respect of the relevant financial year. The Group recognises a provision where contractually obliged or where there is a past practice that has 
created a constructive obligation.
5.2 Number of employees
The average monthly number of employees during the financial year and total number of employees as at 31 December 2017 was:

6. Exceptional items
6.1 Accounting policy
Where certain income or expense items recorded in the period are material by their size or incidence the Group presents such items as 
exceptional within a separate line on the income statement except for those exceptional items that relate to net finance costs and tax. 
Separate presentation provides an improved understanding of the elements of financial performance during the year to facilitate 
comparison with prior periods and to assess the underlying trends in financial performance.
Exceptional items include one-off redundancy and restructuring costs, transaction costs and integration associated with merger and 
acquisition activity, as well as credits relating to profit on disposal of business, pension remeasurements and property provision releases.
6.1.1 Key sources of estimation uncertainty: Exceptional items
The Group aims to be both consistent and clear in its recognition and disclosure of exceptional gains and losses. Management judgement is 
required in assessing the nature and amounts of transactions that satisfy the conditions for classification as an exceptional item.

Footprint restructuring 
As announced in March 2015 and reported in previous periods, footprint restructuring principally relates to directly attributable costs incurred in the ongoing 
North American footprint project. Gross costs attributable to footprint restructuring in the year amounted to £16.4 million, of which £15.2 
million (2016: £2.6 million) relates to the North American project. Credits relating to footprint restructuring include £1.8 million relating to the respective 
disposal and exit from the Canton, South Dakota, and Sioux Falls, South Dakota, facilities, and a reduction of £3.3 million in past service costs relating to 
the expected closure of the Rochester post-retirement benefit medical plans on 31 December 2018 (see note 20.3). The North American footprint 
project is expected to conclude by 2020. 
The remaining £0.6 million of exceptional costs relates footprint projects in ERA and SchlegelGiesse.
M&A and integration
The M&A and integration credit of £0.7 million comprises gross costs of £2.2 million offset by credits of £2.9 million. The gross costs relate to the net 
legal, financial, taxation and consultancy costs associated with the Howe Green acquisition, intellectual property defence costs relating to pre-acquisition 
periods as well as the integration of businesses acquired in prior years. The credits principally comprise £2.3 million associated with the pension liability 
recoverable from and indemnified by the previous owners of Bilco together with £0.6 million surplus provisions created on acquisition no longer required.
Write-off of inventory fair value adjustments
Write-off of inventory fair value adjustments relate to the IFRS 3 requirement that finished goods held in inventory must be revalued to their 
market value on acquisition. The equivalent revaluation for Howe Green inventory acquired in March 2017 was immaterial. 
Profit on disposal of business
Profit on disposal of business relates to the net deferred consideration for EWS received in 2016.
Property provision releases and disposals
Property provision releases and disposals comprises surplus onerous lease provisions released during the 2016 year.

8. Taxation
8.1 Accounting policy
Income tax charge comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the income statement, except to the extent that it relates to 
items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in the relevant statement.
The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date 
in the countries where the Company and its subsidiaries operate and generate taxable income.
Deferred income tax is recognised on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying 
amounts in the consolidated financial statements. No deferred tax liabilities are recognised if it arises from the initial recognition of:
• 
goodwill; or
• 
an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor 
taxable profit or loss.
Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and are 
expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or when the deferred income tax liability is settled.
Deferred income tax liabilities are provided on taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries except for deferred 
income tax liabilities where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the 
temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the 
temporary differences can be utilised. 
Deferred income tax assets are recognised on deductible temporary differences arising from investments in subsidiaries only to the extent 
that it is probable the temporary difference will reverse in the future and there is sufficient taxable profit against which the temporary 
difference can be utilised.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax 
liabilities and where the deferred income tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority. Offset may 
be applied either within same tax entity or different taxable entities where there is an intention to settle tax balances on a net basis.
8.1.1 Key source of estimation uncertainty: deferred tax assets
Estimation is required of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities and their tax base. Deferred tax 
liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences but, where deductible temporary differences exist, management’s judgement 
is required as to whether a deferred tax asset should be recognised based on the availability of future taxable profits. The deferred tax 
assets recoverable may differ from the amounts recognised if actual taxable profits differ from management’s estimates.

8.2.1 Tax on profit on ordinary activities continued
The standard rate of corporation tax in the UK changed from 20.0 per cent to 19.0 per cent with effect from 1 April 2017. Accordingly, the 
Group’s UK profits for this accounting period are taxed at an effective rate of 19.25 per cent (2016: 20.0 per cent).
A further reduction to the UK corporation tax rate to 17.0 per cent was introduced in the Finance Act 2016 with effect from 1 April 2020. The 
deferred tax balances have been remeasured to reflect the future change of rate. 
Under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act 2017 the US Federal tax rate reduced from 35.0 per cent to 21.0 per cent with effect from 1 January 2018. 
The Act was substantively enacted on 22 December 2017 and so the deferred tax balances that will be settled with the United States tax 
authorities have been remeasured to reflect the reduced rate. The impact of the deferred tax change has been disclosed separately as a 
component of the income tax charge for the year. 
Taxation for other jurisdictions is calculated at rates prevailing in those respective jurisdictions. 
8.2.2 Reconciliation of the total tax charge

The deferred tax asset arises from temporary differences in the US, the UK, Greece, Spain, Argentina, China and Australia. Given both recent 
and forecast trading, the Directors are of the opinion that the level of profits in the foreseeable future is more likely than not to be sufficient to 
recover these assets. 
Deferred tax liabilities of £19.0 million (2016: £33.1 million) are expected to fall due after more than one year and deferred tax assets of 
£6.8 million (2016: £11.7 million) are expected to be recovered after more than one year.

No deferred tax liability is recognised on temporary differences of £98.1 million (2016: £68.0 million) relating to the unremitted earnings of overseas 
subsidiaries. As a result of UK legislation, which largely exempts from UK tax the overseas dividends received, the temporary differences arising 
on unremitted profits are unlikely to lead to additional UK corporate taxes. Furthermore, although the remittance to the UK of those earnings 
could still result in a tax liability, arising as a result of withholding taxes levied by some overseas tax jurisdictions in which those subsidiaries 
operate, such jurisdictions provide currently for zero dividend withholding tax in their tax agreements with the UK.
9. Earnings per share
9.1 Non-GAAP Alternative Performance Measures accounting policy
The Directors believe that the underlying profit and earnings per share measures provide additional useful information to shareholders on 
the underlying performance of the business. These measures are consistent with how business performance is measured internally. The 
underlying profit before tax measure is not recognised under IFRS and may not be comparable with underlying profit measures used by 
other companies (see Alternative Performance Measures on page 146).

Basic earnings amounts are calculated by dividing net profit for the year attributable to ordinary equity holders by the weighted average 
number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year. 
Diluted earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing the net profit attributable to ordinary equity holders by the weighted average 
number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year plus the weighted average number of ordinary shares that would be issued on the

10. Goodwill and intangible assets
10.1 Accounting policy
10.1.1 Goodwill
Goodwill arises on the acquisition of subsidiaries and represents the excess of the consideration transferred over the Group’s interest in 
the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquiree.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to each of the CGUs that are expected 
to benefit from the synergies of the combination. Each unit or group of units to which the goodwill is allocated represents the lowest 
level within the entity at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes. Goodwill is monitored at the operating 
segment level. 
Goodwill impairment reviews are undertaken annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential 
impairment. The carrying amount of goodwill is compared to the recoverable amount, which is the higher of value in use and the fair 
value less costs of disposal. Any impairment is recognised immediately as an expense and is not subsequently reversed. Find out more at: www.tymanplc.com 111
10. Goodwill and intangible assets continued
10.1 Accounting policy continued
10.1.2 Intangible assets
Intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment. On acquisition of businesses by the Group, the Group 
recognises any separately identifiable intangible assets separately from goodwill, initially measuring the intangible assets at fair value.
Purchased intangible assets acquired through a business combination, including purchased brands, customer relationships, trademarks and 
licences, are initially measured at fair value and amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful economic lives as follows:
• 
Acquired brands – 5 to 20 years
• 
Customer relationships – 9 to 15 years
• 
Internally developed computer software – 5 to 10 years
• 
Purchased computer software – 3 to 4 years
Development costs that are directly attributable to the design and testing of identifiable and unique software products controlled by the 
Group are recognised as intangible assets when the following criteria are met:
• 
it is technically feasible to complete the software product so that it will be available for use;
• 
management intends to complete the software product and use it or sell it;
• 
there is an ability to use or sell the software product;
• 
it can be demonstrated how the software product will generate probable future economic benefits;
• 
adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the software product are available; and
• 
the expenditure attributable to the software product during its development can be reliably measured.
Directly attributable costs capitalised as part of the software product include the software development employee costs and an 
appropriate portion of relevant overheads. Other development expenditures that do not meet these criteria are recognised as an expense 
as incurred. Development costs previously recognised as an expense are not recognised as an asset in a subsequent period. Computer 
software development costs recognised as assets are amortised when the intangible assets are in the location and condition necessary for 
it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management. 
The estimated useful lives of acquired intangible assets are reviewed whenever events or circumstances indicate that there has been a 
change in the expected pattern of consumption of the future economic benefits embodied in the asset. Any amendments to the estimated 
useful lives of intangible assets are recorded as a change in estimate in the period the change occurred.
10.1.3 Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets
Intangible assets, including goodwill, that have an indefinite useful life or intangible assets not ready to use are not subject to amortisation 
and are tested annually for impairment. Assets that are subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or 
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the 
asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of the asset’s fair value less costs of disposal 
and value in use. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are largely independent 
cash inflows. Prior impairments of non-financial assets (other than goodwill) are reviewed for possible reversal at each reporting date. 
Goodwill previously impaired cannot be reversed at a later date.
10.1.4 Critical accounting estimates and judgements: carrying amount of goodwill and intangibles
As at 31 December 2017, the Group had goodwill of £323.8 million with intangible assets amounting in total to £103.4 million. An 
impairment review using a value in use calculation has been performed for each CGU. There is significant judgement involved in 
determining the appropriate assumptions to use in the calculations, including the forecasted cash flows of each CGU and appropriate 
discount rates relative to the Company’s cost of capital. These assumptions have been subjected to sensitivity analyses. Details of 
estimates used and sensitivities in the impairment reviews are set out in this note. Tyman plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 112

10.2.1 Impairment tests for goodwill
Assumptions
The Group’s CGUs have been defined as each of the Group’s three operating Divisions. In the opinion of the Directors, the Divisions represent 
the smallest groups of assets that independently generate cash flows for the Group consistent with the approach adopted in 2016.
The recoverable amounts of CGUs are determined from VIU calculations. VIU is determined by discounting the future pre-tax cash flows 
generated from the continuing use of the CGU, using a pre-tax discount rate. 
Cash flow projections, which have been reviewed and approved by the Board, are derived from five-year forecasts produced by each Division 
comprised of a detailed bottom up budget for 2018 and a forecast, based on the Division’s strategic plan for 2019 to 2022. The five-year 
period cash flows were extrapolated using a long term growth rate of 1.5 per cent in order to calculate the terminal recoverable amount.
Discount rates are estimated using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risk profiles of the CGUs. 
The key assumptions used in the VIU calculations in each of the Group’s CGUs at 31 December are as follows: 
Average pre-tax discount rate Average EBITDA: years one to five
  2017 2016 2017 2016
AmesburyTruth 11.8% 12.2% 23.4% 22.0%
ERA 8.6% 8.9% 18.1% 13.2%
SchlegelGiesse 11.6% 12.5% 17.1% 13.4%
Impairment review results: 2017
A review of the carrying amount of goodwill and intangible assets across the Group has been carried out at year end in light of current trading 
conditions and future prospects. The annual impairment review did not result in any impairment losses being recognised in 2017. 
The ERA CGU has significant headroom such that a permanent diminution of the VIU to below the carrying value of goodwill is considered by 
the Board to be highly unlikely. 
AmesburyTruth is the CGU with the lowest relative VIU headroom. If the average EBITDA margin for AmesburyTruth for the five years from 
2018 to 2022 was to decrease by 830 basis points from 23.4 per cent to 15.1 per cent and continue at that reduced level in perpetuity, the VIU 
headroom for AmesburyTruth would be zero. Given that the EBITDA margin achieved in 2017 was 20.7 per cent and considering the margin 
uplift potential of the footprint rationalisation project once completed, this scenario is unlikely to occur. 
SchlegelGiesse is the CGU with the smallest absolute VIU headroom. If the average EBITDA margin for SchlegelGiesse for the five years from 
2018 to 2022 was to decrease by 240 basis points from 17.1 per cent to 8.9 per cent and continue at that reduced level in perpetuity, the VIU 
headroom of SchlegelGiesse would be zero. Given that the EBITDA margin in 2017 was 14.0 per cent and the margin uplift potential for the 
enlarged Division once realised, this scenario is unlikely to occur.

(2016: £21.7 million) relating to amortisation of acquired intangible assets and £1.3 million (2016: £1.0 million) relating to amortisation of 
other intangible assets. 
No impairments of intangible assets were recognised in 2017 and 2016. 
11. Property, plant and equipment
11.1 Accounting policy
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment. Cost includes expenditure that is directly 
attributable to the acquisition of the assets. Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, 
as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the specific asset will flow to the Group and the cost 
of the subsequent item can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognised from the date of replacement. 
All other repairs and maintenance are charged to the income statement during the financial period in which they are incurred.
Freehold land is not depreciated. Depreciation is provided on all other property, plant and equipment at rates calculated to write off the 
cost less estimated residual value of each asset on a straight-line basis over its expected useful life, at the following annual rates:
Freehold buildings – 2.0 to 5.0 per cent
Plant and machinery – 7.5 to 33.0 per cent
The carrying amounts of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment periodically if events or changes in circumstances 
indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The assets’ residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation are 
reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at the end of each reporting period.
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount and are recognised in the income statement. Tyman plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 114

related to the write-off of items of property, plant and equipment associated with the SchlegelGiesse footprint restructuring project and was 
included in exceptional items in the income statement (see note 6). 
12. Inventories
12.1 Accounting policy
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is determined in accordance with the first-in, first-out method. 
Cost includes the cost of materials determined on a purchase cost basis, direct labour and an appropriate proportion of manufacturing 
overheads based on normal levels of activity. It excludes borrowing costs. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary 
course of business less the estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale.
Where necessary, a provision is made to reduce cost to no more than net realisable value having regard to the nature and condition of 
inventory, as well as its anticipated saleability.
12.1.1 Critical accounting estimates and judgements: carrying amount of inventories
The carrying amounts of inventories are stated with due allowance for excess, obsolete or slow-moving items. Group management 
exercises judgement in assessing net realisable value. Provisions for slow-moving and obsolete inventory are based on management’s 
assessment of the nature and condition of the inventory, including assumptions around future demand, market conditions and new 
product development initiatives. Find out more at: www.tymanplc.com 115

Inventories are stated net of an allowance for excess, obsolete or slow-moving items of £12.9 million (2016 restated: £13.5 million).
An impairment charge of £1.7 million (2016: £2.4 million) was recognised in respect of inventories during the year. 
There were no borrowings secured on the inventories of the Group (2016: £Nil).
13. Trade and other receivables
13.1 Accounting policy
Trade receivables are amounts due from customers for goods sold in the ordinary course of business. If collection is expected in one year or 
less they are classified as current assets; otherwise they are presented as non-current assets. 
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value plus transaction costs and subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the 
effective interest rate method, less appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts (provision for impairment).
13.1.1 Critical accounting estimates and judgements: carrying amount of trade receivables
Provision against trade receivables is made when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due to it 
in accordance with the original terms of those receivables. The amount of the write down is determined as the difference between the 
carrying amount and present value of estimated future cash flows. Group management exercises judgement in assessing the amount of 
any write downs required which is based on current assessments of the creditworthiness of current customers, the ageing profile of 
receivables and historical experience.

16. Derivative financial instruments
16.1 Accounting policy
Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are 
subsequently remeasured at fair value. Derivatives are carried as assets when fair value is positive and as liabilities when fair value is negative.
The Group designates certain derivatives as either:
• 
hedges of the fair value of recognised assets or liabilities or a firm commitment (fair value hedge);
• 
hedges of a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction (cash flow hedge); or
• 
hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation (net investment hedge).
For those instruments designated as hedges, the Group documents at the inception of the transaction the relationship between hedging 
instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objectives and strategy for undertaking various hedging transactions. 
The Group also documents its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are used 
in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items.
The full fair value of a hedging derivative is classified as a non-current asset or liability when the remaining hedged item is more than twelve 
months and as a current asset or liability when the remaining maturity of the hedged item is less than twelve months.
For derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting, any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value are recognised immediately 
in the income statement.
16.1.1 Fair value hedges
Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated and qualifying as fair value hedges are recorded in the income statement, together with 
any changes in fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk.
16.1.2 Cash flow hedges
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognised in 
other comprehensive income. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Amounts accumulated in equity are reclassified to the income statement in the period in which the hedged item affects profit or loss. 
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or 
loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the income 
statement. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is 
immediately transferred to the income statement.
16.1.3 Net investment hedge
Hedges of net investments in foreign operations are accounted for similarly to cash flow hedges. Any gain or loss on the hedging instrument 
relating to the effective portion of the hedge is recognised in other comprehensive income. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective 
portion is recognised in the income statement. Gains and losses accumulated in equity are included in the income statement when the 
foreign operation is partially disposed of or sold.

16.2.1 Fair value hedges
The notional principal amounts of the outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts at 31 December 2017 were £10.9 million (2016: £12.5 million). 
During the year a loss of £0.4 million (2016: gain of £0.3 million) was recognised in the income statement for the changes in value of the fair 
value hedges.
The hedged highly probable forecast transactions denominated in foreign currency are expected to occur at various dates during the next 12 months. 
16.2.2 Cash flow hedges
The notional principal amounts of the outstanding interest rate swap at 31 December 2017 were £18.2 million (2016: £19.4 million). 
During the year a loss of £Nil (2016: loss of £0.2 million) was recognised in the statement of comprehensive income and £Nil (2016: £Nil) in the 
income statement for the ineffective portion of changes in the value of cash flow hedges.

The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the fair value of the derivative assets on the balance sheet. 
Refer to note 18.4 for the fair value measurement methodology. 
16.2.3 Net investment hedges
The Group uses foreign currency-denominated debt to hedge the value of its US Dollar and Euro-denominated net assets which may change 
due to respective movements in US Dollar and Euro exchange rates. At 31 December 2017, the value of the net investment hedge was 
£168.2 million (2016: £207.9 million). This hedge is considered highly effective and no ineffective portion has been recognised in the 
income statement. 
17. Interest-bearing loans and borrowings

total value of €2.2 million, a carrying value of €2.2 million and an undrawn value of €Nil. These facilities have a maturity ranging between 
31 December 2018 and 10 September 2020 and are unsecured.
17.2.2 Private placement notes
On 19 November 2014, the Group issued private debt placement notes with US financial institutions totalling US$100.0 million.
The debt placement is unsecured and comprises US$55.0 million debt with a seven-year maturity at a coupon of 4.97 per cent and US$45.0 million 
with a 10-year maturity at a coupon of 5.37 per cent.
18. Financial risk management and financial instruments
18.1 Accounting policy
Financial assets and liabilities are recognised in the Group’s balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of 
the instrument and are generally derecognised when the contract that gives rise to it is settled, sold, cancelled or expires.
18.1.1 Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. 
They are included in current assets, except for maturities greater than twelve months after the end of the reporting period. These are 
classified as non-current assets. The Group’s loans and receivables comprise “trade and other receivables” (note 13) and “cash and cash

18. Financial risk management and financial instruments continued
18.3 Financial instruments: risk profile
18.3.1 Capital risk management
The Group manages its capital structure to ensure that it will be able to continue as a going concern. The capital structure of the Group consists 
of cash and cash equivalents (note 14), interest-bearing loans and borrowings (see note 17) and equity attributable to the shareholders of the 
Parent as disclosed in the consolidated statement of changes in equity.
18.3.2 Financial management
The Group’s principal financial instruments comprise bank loans, private debt and cash and short term deposits. The Group has various other financial 
instruments such as trade receivables and trade payables that arise directly from its operations. No trading in financial instruments is undertaken.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each financial instrument risk and they are summarised below.
18.3.3 Liquidity and credit risk
The Group maintains sufficient cash and marketable securities and the availability of funding through an adequate amount of credit facilities. 
Management monitors rolling forecasts of the Group’s liquidity on the basis of expected cash flow. 
The Group manages liquidity risk by the pooling of cash resources and depositing funds available for investment in approved financial instruments 
with financial institutions. Counterparty risk with respect to cash and cash equivalents is managed by only investing in banks and financial 
instruments with independently assessed credit ratings of at least A2 as published by Standard and Poor’s. Individual risk limits are assessed 
by management based on the external ratings. Management does not expect any losses from the non-performance of these counterparties. 
Credit risk is also attributable to the Group’s exposure to trade receivables due from customers. Management assesses the credit quality of 
customers taking into account their financial position, past experience and other factors. In order to mitigate credit risk the Group utilises 
credit insurance in those areas of its operations where such insurance is available. In areas where such insurance is not available or it is 
uneconomical to purchase, management monitors the utilisation of credit limits by customers, identified either individually or by group, and 
incorporates this information in credit risk controls. The diverse nature of the Group’s customer base means that the Group has no significant 
concentrations of credit risk.
Trade receivables are presented in the balance sheet net of allowances for doubtful receivables, estimated by the Group’s management based 
on prior experience and their assessment of the current economic environment. 
The Group’s exposure to credit risk is limited to the carrying amount of financial assets recognised at the balance sheet date. Management 
considers all financial assets that are not impaired for each of the reporting dates under review are of good credit quality, including those that 
are past due. 
During the year ended 31 December 2017 the Group operated within its borrowing facilities.
The table below analyses the present value of the Group’s financial liabilities into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period 
at the balance sheet date to the contractual maturity date.

2 Excludes capitalised borrowing costs of £0.3 million (2016: £0.3 million).
The interest rate on the floating bank loans is linked to LIBOR. The Board periodically reviews any exposure the Group may have to interest rate 
fluctuations. The Group has used interest rate swaps to fix the cost of a proportion of these floating rate borrowings.

Interest rate sensitivity
The impact of a 50 basis point movement in floating interest rates on borrowings would have a c. £0.7 million (2016: £0.6 million) impact on 
profits. This impact would be reduced by the tax effect on such a change.
Interest rate risk of financial assets
The weighted average interest rate received on deposited funds was 0.6 per cent during the year (2016: 1.2 per cent).
18.3.5 Foreign currency risk
The Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currency exposures, primarily with respect to 
the US Dollar and the Euro. Foreign exchange risk arises from future commercial and financing transactions, recognised assets and liabilities 
denominated in a currency that is not the Group’s functional currency and net investments in overseas entities.
The Group has many overseas subsidiaries, whose net assets are subject to currency translation risk. The Group borrows in local currencies as 
appropriate to minimise the impact of this risk on the balance sheet. Find out more at: www.tymanplc.com 123

18.3.6 Capital management
The Group’s capital management objectives are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern so as to provide returns to 
shareholders and benefits to stakeholders. The Group defines its capital as total equity plus net debt. 
In maintaining the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount paid as dividends to shareholders, issue new shares or dispose of assets 
to reduce debt.
The Group monitors its financial capacity by reference to its financial covenant ratios, including Leverage and interest cover. If the Group fails 
to meet its key financial ratios required by its lenders, this could impact the Group’s average interest rate of borrowings and the future 
availability of credit to the Group.
The Group is in compliance with the financial covenants contained within its credit facilities, and has been in compliance throughout the 
financial year.

18.4 Fair value estimation
The Group’s derivative financial instrument used for hedging is measured at fair value. The Group uses the following hierarchy for measuring 
fair value:
• 
Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
• 
Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
• 
Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data.
Derivatives shown at fair value in the balance sheet have been valued by reference to level 2 techniques described above.
There were no transfers between levels during the year.
18.4.1 Valuation techniques used to derive level 2 fair values
Level 2 hedging derivatives comprise interest rate swaps fair valued using forward interest rates extracted from observable yield curves. The 
effects of discounting are generally insignificant for level 2 derivatives. The fair value of the derivative financial instruments at 31 December 
2017 is a net liability of £0.2 million (2016: net asset of £0.2 million).
There were no changes in valuation techniques during the year.
18.4.2 Group’s valuation process
The Group has a team that performs the valuations of financial assets required for financial reporting purposes. This team reports to the CFO 
and the Audit Committee.
18.4.3 Fair value of financial assets and liabilities measured at amortised cost
The fair values of borrowings are as follows:
 
2017
£’000
2016 
£’000
Current liabilities (1,101) —
Non-current liabilities (204,040) (216,763)
  (205,141) (216,763)
The fair values of the following financial assets and liabilities approximate their carrying amounts:
• 
trade and other receivables;
• 
cash and cash equivalents; and
• 
trade and other payables.  Find out more at: www.tymanplc.com 125
19. Provisions
19.1 Accounting policy
Provisions are recognised when:
• 
the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event;
• 
it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation; and
• 
a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at the balance 
sheet date, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation. Where a provision is measured using the cash flows 
estimated to settle the present obligation, its carrying amount is the present value of those cash flows using a pre-tax rate that reflects 
current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the obligation. 
The increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised in the income statement within net finance costs. Provisions are not 
recognised for future operating losses.
19.1.1 Critical accounting estimates and judgements: carrying amount of provisions
Provisions, by their nature, are uncertain and highly judgemental. Provisions are measured at the Directors’ best estimate of the expenditure 
required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date based on the nature of the provisions, the potential outcomes, any developments 
relating to specific claims and previous experience.

Property provisions include provisions for onerous leases of £2. 1 million (2016: £2.8 million) and leasehold dilapidations of £1.4 million (2016: £1.0 million). 
Property provisions are expected to be utilised by 2042.
For onerous leases, the Group has provided for the rental payments due over the remaining term of existing operating lease contracts where a 
period of vacancy is ongoing. The provision has been calculated after taking into account both the periods over which properties are likely to 
remain vacant and any likely sub-lease income on a property-by-property basis. The provision covers potential transfer of economic benefit 
over the full range of current lease commitments disclosed in note 27.
The provision for leasehold dilapidations relates to contractual obligations to reinstate leasehold properties to their original state of repair.  Tyman plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 126

(2016 restated: £4.6 million) relates to potential exposures arising from pre-acquisition tax audits by fiscal authorities at certain Giesse locations. 
Other provisions are expected to be utilised by 2021.
20. Retirement benefit obligations
20.1 Accounting policy
The Group operates both defined contribution and defined benefit pension plans and post-employment medical plans.
20.1.1 Pension obligations
Defined contribution plans
A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Group pays fixed contributions into publicly or privately administered pension 
insurance plans on a mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis. The Group recognises contributions as an employee benefit expense when 
they are due and has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid. The Group has no legal or constructive obligation 
to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employees the benefits relating to employee service in the 
current or prior periods. Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund in the future is available.
Defined benefit plans
A defined benefit plan is a pension plan that is not a defined contribution plan. Typically defined benefit plans define an amount of 
pension benefit an employee will receive on retirement. This amount is usually dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of 
service and compensation.
The liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the present value of the defined benefit 
obligation at the end of the reporting period less the fair value of plan assets. The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by 
independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of 
high quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity 
approximating to the terms of the related pension obligation. In countries where there is no deep market in such bonds, the market rates on 
government bonds are used.
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to equity in 
other comprehensive income in the period in which they arise.
Past service costs are recognised immediately in income.
20.1.2 Other post-employment obligations
Some Group companies provide post-retirement healthcare benefits to their retirees. The entitlement to these benefits is usually conditional 
on the employee remaining in service up to retirement age and the completion of a minimum service period. The expected costs of these 
benefits are accrued over the period of employment using the same accounting methodology as used for defined benefit pension plans.
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to equity in 
other comprehensive income in the period in which they arise. These obligations are valued annually by independent qualified actuaries. Find out more at: www.tymanplc.com 127
20. Retirement benefit obligations continued
20.1 Accounting policy continued
20.1.3 Key source of estimation uncertainty: defined benefit pension and post-retirement benefit schemes
Defined benefit obligations are calculated using a number of assumptions including future salary increases, increases to pension benefits, 
mortality rates and, in the case of post-employment medical benefits, the expected rate of increase in medical costs. The plan assets 
consist largely of listed securities and their fair values are subject to fluctuation in response to changes in market conditions. Effects of 
changes in the actuarial assumptions underlying the benefit obligation, effects of changes in the discount rate applicable to the benefit 
obligation and effects of differences between the expected and actual return on the plan assets are classified as actuarial gains and losses 
and are recognised directly in equity. Further actuarial gains and losses will be recognised during the next financial year. An analysis of the 
assumptions that will be used by management to determine the cost of defined benefit plans that will be recognised in the income 
statement in the next financial year is presented in this note.
20.2 Defined contribution pension schemes
The Group operates a number of defined contribution pension schemes, the assets of which are held externally to the Group in separate 
trustee-administered funds. The costs of the Group’s defined contribution pension schemes are charged to the income statement in the period 
in which they fall due. The Group had unpaid pension contributions of £0.2 million (2016: £Nil) included within employee benefit liabilities. 
20.3 Defined benefit pension schemes and post-employment medical benefit schemes

The Group’s principal defined benefit pension schemes are operated in the US and Italy and the principal post-employment medical benefit 
scheme is operated in the US. The defined benefit schemes provide benefits to members in the form of a guaranteed level of pension payable 
for life. The level of benefits provided depends on members’ length of service and their salary in the final years leading up to retirement. 
The Italian schemes relate to TFR termination obligations payable to employees of the Group’s Italian operations. Italian employers are required 
to make provision for a type of severance package to its employees equivalent to 6.9 per cent of each employee’s gross annual salary, revalued 
on the basis of 75.0 per cent of inflation plus a fixed rate of 1.5 per cent during the period of accrual. Upon termination of employment, the 
employer is obliged to pay a lump sum to the employee. TFR termination obligations are unfunded. 
Net amounts payable under the Bilco post-retirement benefit obligation are fully recoverable from and indemnified by the previous owners of Bilco, 
with a proportion held in escrow. The Bilco post-retirement benefit obligation is expected to terminate in 2018.
For certain US plans, pensions in payment do not receive inflationary increases. The benefit payments are from trustee-administered funds. 
Plan assets held in trusts are governed by local regulations and practice in the US, as is the nature of the relationship between the Group and 
the trustees and their composition. 
Responsibility for governance of the plans, including investment and contribution schedules, lies jointly with the Group and the board of trustees. 
The board of trustees must be composed of representatives of the Company and plan participants in accordance with the plan’s regulations.
Actuarial gains and losses from participant experience, changes in demographic assumptions, changes in financial assumptions and net return 
on plan assets are recognised, net of the related deferred tax, in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. Tyman plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 128

20. Retirement benefit obligations continued
20.3 Defined benefit pension schemes and post-employment medical benefit schemes continued
Through its defined benefit pension plans and post-employment medical plans, the Group is exposed to a number of risks, the most significant 
of which are detailed below:
Asset volatility The plan liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields; if plan 
assets underperform this yield, this will create a deficit. The US plans hold a significant proportion of fixed 
income investments, comprising a mixture of government and corporate bonds, and provide an acceptable 
level of investment risk to better match liabilities. The Group believes that given the long term nature of plan 
liabilities, and the strength of the supporting Group, a level of continuing equity investment is an 
appropriate element of the Group’s long term strategy to manage the plans efficiently. Equities are 
expected to outperform corporate bonds in the long term while providing volatility and risk in the short term. 
As the plans mature, the Group intends to reduce the level of investment risk by investing more in assets that 
better match the liabilities. The Italian plans do not have plan assets. 
Changes in bond yields A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase plan liabilities, although this will be partially offset by an 
increase in the value of the plans’ bond holdings.
Inflation risk Some of the Group’s pension obligations are linked to inflation, and higher inflation will lead to higher 
liabilities (although, in most cases, caps on the level of inflationary increases are in place to protect the plan 
against extreme inflation). The majority of the plans’ assets are either unaffected by fixed interest bonds or 
loosely correlated with equities inflation, meaning that an increase in inflation will also increase the deficit. 
In the US plans, the pensions in payment are not linked to inflation, so this is a less material risk.
Life expectancies The majority of the plans’ obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member, so increases in life 
expectancy will result in an increase in the plans’ liabilities.
The significant actuarial assumptions were as follows: 
2017 2016
  United States Italy United States Italy
Discount rate 3.30% 1.29% 4.00% 1.40%
Inflation 2.00% 1.50% 2.00% 1.50%
Salary growth rate n/a 1.50% n/a 1.50%
Pension growth rate n/a n/a n/a n/a
Healthcare cost trend
1
4.5% to 7.0% n/a 4.5% to 7.0% n/a
1 The level of healthcare contributions is capped and adopting a higher trend rate does not materially affect the liability.
Assumptions regarding future mortality are set based on actuarial advice in accordance with published statistics and experience in each 
jurisdiction. These assumptions translate into an average life expectancy in years for a pensioner retiring at age 65:
  United States Italy
Retiring at the end of the reporting year:
Male 20.1 n/a
Female 22.5 n/a
Retiring 20 years after the end of the reporting year:
Male 21.7 n/a
Female 24.1 n/a
The sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to changes in the weighted principal assumption is: 
 
Change in
discount rate 
assumption
Impact of
 increase in
 assumption
Impact of
 decrease in
 assumption
Bilco 1.00% (8.3)% 9.8%
Other US 0.25% (3.0)% 3.1%
Italy 0.50% (5.9)% 4.1%
The above sensitivity analyses are based on a change in an assumption while holding all other assumptions constant. In practice, this is unlikely 
to occur, and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated. When calculating the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to significant 
actuarial assumptions the same methodology has been applied as when calculating the pension liability recognised within the statement of 
financial position.
The methods and types of assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analyses did not change compared to the previous year.
The US pension schemes are closed to new entrants; as a result the service costs to the Group will rise in future years. The expected level of 
contributions to the defined benefit pension scheme and post-employment medical benefits in the year to December 2018 is £2.8 million.
The weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation is nine years for US plans and 10 years for Italian plans. Tyman plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 130

21. Share capital and share premium
21.1 Accounting policy
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new ordinary shares or options are shown 
in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds received by the Company.
Where any Group company purchases the Company’s equity share capital (treasury shares), the consideration paid, including any directly 
attributable incremental costs (net of income taxes), is deducted from equity attributable to the Company’s owners until the shares are 
cancelled or reissued. Where such shares are subsequently reissued, any consideration received, net of any directly attributable incremental 
transaction costs and the related income tax effects, is included in equity attributable to the Company’s owners.

On 21 June 2016 the Group issued 8,478,128 shares by way of a placing with institutional investors.
22. Share-based payments
22.1 Accounting policy
The Group operates the LTIP, which is an equity-settled share-based compensation plan for certain employees under which the entity 
receives services from employees as consideration for equity instruments (share options) of the Group. The fair value of the employee 
services received in exchange for the grant of options is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s 
estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the options granted, excluding 
the impact of any non-market vesting conditions. Non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of options 
that are expected to vest. At each balance sheet date, the entity revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to vest, 
with any changes in estimate recognised in the income statement, with a corresponding adjustment in equity. The fair value of awards 
granted under LTIP is measured using a probability model to predict target EPS levels.
The proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs are credited to share capital (nominal value) and share premium 
when the options are exercised. Find out more at: www.tymanplc.com 131
22. Share-based payments continued
22.2 LTIP
The charge to the income statement in 2017 in relation to the LTIP was £1.1 million (2016: £1.0 million). 
LTIP
Conditional, annual awards of shares are granted under the LTIP to the Executive Directors and certain senior managers at the discretion of 
the Remuneration Committee. Provided the participant remains an employee of the Group and the performance conditions are met, awards 
will vest three years after the date of the grant at no cost to the employee. Further information on the LTIP and the performance conditions 
for each grant are given in the Remuneration report.
The fair value of the awards granted under the LTIP in 2017 and the assumptions used in the calculation of the share-based payment charge 
are as follows:
Valuation model Probability model to predict EPS levels
Date of grant 14 March 2017
Number granted 792,477
Share price at date of award 319 pence
Fair value (pence) 136 pence

24. Business combinations
24.1 Accounting policy
The Group applies the acquisition method to account for business combinations. The consideration transferred for the acquisition of a 
subsidiary is the fair values of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred to the former owners of the acquiree and the equity interest 
issued by the Group. The consideration transferred includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration 
arrangement. Identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured 
initially at their fair values at the acquisition date.
Acquisition related costs are expensed as incurred.
Any contingent consideration to be transferred is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. Subsequent changes to the fair value 
of the contingent consideration that is deemed to be an asset or liability are recognised in accordance with IAS 39 either in profit or loss or 
as a change to other comprehensive income. Contingent consideration that is classified as equity is not remeasured, and its subsequent 
settlement is accounted for within equity.
The excess of the consideration transferred and the acquisition-date fair value of any previous equity interest in the acquiree over the 
fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill (see note 10.2). If the total of consideration transferred is less than 
the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired in the case of a bargain purchase, the difference is recognised directly in the 
income statement.
24.1.1 Critical accounting estimates and judgements: acquisition accounting
IFRS 3 requires assets and liabilities acquired to be recorded at fair value and to identify intangible assets separately from goodwill, initially 
measuring each group of intangible assets at fair value. Groups of intangible assets include purchased brands and customer relationships. There 
is judgement involved in estimating fair value, particularly in relation to identifiable intangible assets, which requires the Directors to estimate 
the useful economic life of each asset and the future cash flows expected to arise from each asset and to apply a suitable discount rate.
24.2 Acquisition of Howe Green
On 3 March 2017, ERA acquired Howe Green, a UK manufacturer of engineered floor and ceiling access hatches sold into the commercial and 
infrastructure markets. ERA paid a cash consideration of £5.8 million with deferred consideration of £0.4 million payable within 12 months of 
the date of acquisition. 
The following table summarises the consideration paid, fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed for all acquisitions in the year 
at the respective acquisition dates:

24. Business combinations continued
24.2 Acquisition of Howe Green continued
The fair value of trade and other receivables is £0.7 million and is principally comprised of trade receivables with a fair and collectable value 
of £0.7 million. The gross contractual amount for trade receivables due is £0.7 million, of which £Nil is expected to be uncollectable. 
Revenue included in the consolidated income statement since 7 March 2017 contributed by Howe Green was £3.3 million. Howe Green 
contributed £1.1 million to the profit before taxation over the same period. 
Had the acquisition of Howe Green been completed on the first day of the financial year, an additional £0.7 million of revenue and £0.1 million 
of profit before taxation would have been contributed to the Group. 
Goodwill arising on acquisition is attributable to the expected profitability of the acquired business arising through savings and benefits from: 
• 
the development and extension of ERA’s product portfolio into the commercial sector; and 
• 
access to the commercial and infrastructure customer base.
The estimated value of intangibles, including goodwill, deductible for tax purposes is £Nil.

25. Non-current assets held for sale
25.1 Accounting policy
Non-current assets classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell. Non-current 
assets are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use. 
This condition is met only when the sale is highly probable and the asset is available for immediate sale in its present condition. Management 
must be committed to the sale which should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date 
of classification. 
25.2 Non-current assets classified as held for sale
The Statesville, North Carolina, freehold property has been classified as an asset held for sale and was being actively marketed for sale at the 
year-end date following the Group’s exit from the property. On 7 February 2018, this property was sold for a consideration of US$1.4 million

Our audit approach
Overview
Report on the audit of the parent company financial statements
Opinion
In our opinion, Tyman plc’s parent company financial statements (the “financial statements”):
• 
give a true and fair view of the state of the parent company’s affairs as at 31 December 2017;
• 
have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting 
Standards, comprising FRS 101 “Reduced Disclosure Framework”, and applicable law); and
• 
have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
We have audited the financial statements, included within the Annual Report and Accounts (the “Annual Report”), which comprise: the company 
balance sheet as at 31 December 2017 and the company statement of changes in equity for the year then ended; and the notes to the financial 
statements, which include a description of the significant accounting policies.
Our opinion is consistent with our reporting to the Audit Committee.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (“ISAs (UK)”) and applicable law. Our responsibilities 
under ISAs (UK) are further described in the Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. We believe 
that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Independence
We remained independent of the group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements 
in the UK, which includes the FRC’s Ethical Standard, as applicable to listed public interest entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical 
responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.
To the best of our knowledge and belief, we declare that non-audit services prohibited by the FRC’s Ethical Standard were not provided 
to the group or the parent company.
Other than those disclosed in the Directors’ report, we have provided no non-audit services to the group and its subsidiaries in the period 
from 1 January 2017 to 31 December 2017.
 
• Overall materiality: £3.1 million (2016: £3.0 million), based on 1 % of total assets.
• We performed a full scope audit over the Company ledger, providing us with 100 per cent coverage 
over the Company accounts.
• We have no key audit matters to report.

Our audit approach continued
The scope of our audit
As part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements. 
In particular, we looked at where the directors made subjective judgements, for example in respect of significant accounting estimates 
that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain. 
We gained an understanding of the legal and regulatory framework applicable to the parent company and the industry in which it operates, 
and considered the risk of acts by the parent company which were contrary to applicable laws and regulations, including fraud. We designed 
audit procedures to respond to the risk, recognising that the risk of not detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk of not 
detecting one resulting from error, as fraud may involve deliberate concealment by, for example, forgery or intentional misrepresentations, or through 
collusion. We focused on laws and regulations that could give rise to a material misstatement in the parent company’s financial statements, including, 
but not limited to, the Companies Act 2006, the Listing Rules, UK tax legislation and equivalent local laws and regulations applicable to significant 
component teams. Our tests included, but were not limited to, review of the financial statement disclosures to underlying supporting documentation, 
review of correspondence with legal advisors, enquiries of management, review of significant component auditors’ work and review of internal audit 
reports in so far as they related to the financial statements. There are inherent limitations in the audit procedures described above and the further 
removed non-compliance with laws and regulations is from the events and transactions reflected in the financial statements, the less likely we 
would become aware of it.
We did not identify any key audit matters relating to irregularities, including fraud. As in all of our audits we also addressed the risk of management 
override of internal controls, including testing journals and evaluating whether there was evidence of bias by the directors that represented 
a risk of material misstatement due to fraud. 
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in the auditors’ professional judgement, were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements 
of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) identified by the auditors, 
including those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of 
the engagement team. We determined that there were no key audit matters applicable to the parent company to communicate in our report. 
How we tailored the audit scope 
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements as a 
whole, taking into account the structure of the parent company, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which it operates. 
We scoped the balances to be audited in line with the materiality determined for the year.
Materiality
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality. These, together 
with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures on the 
individual financial statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating the effect of misstatements, both individually and in aggregate on 
the financial statements as a whole. 
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:
Overall materiality £3.1 million (2016: £3.0 million).
How we determined it 1 % of total assets.
Rationale for benchmark applied As the parent entity, Tyman plc, is primarily a holding Company for the Group, the materiality benchmark 
has been determined to be based on total assets which is a generally accepted auditing benchmark.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above £200,000 (2016: £165,000) 
as well as misstatements below that amount that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.
Going concern
In accordance with ISAs (UK) we report as follows:
Reporting obligation Outcome
We are required to report if we have anything material to add or draw attention to 
in respect of the directors’ statement in the financial statements about whether the 
directors considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting 
in preparing the financial statements and the directors’ identification of any material 
uncertainties to the parent company’s ability to continue as a going concern over a 
period of at least twelve months from the date of approval of the financial statements.
We have nothing material to add or to draw attention 
to. However, because not all future events or conditions 
can be predicted, this statement is not a guarantee 
as to the parent company’s ability to continue as 
a going concern.
We are required to report if the directors’ statement relating to Going Concern in 
accordance with Listing Rule 9.8.6R(3) is materially inconsistent with our knowledge 
obtained in the audit.
We have nothing to report. Find out more at: www.tymanplc.com 139
Report on the audit of the parent company financial statements continued
Reporting on other information 
The other information comprises all of the information in the Annual Report other than the financial statements and our auditors’ report 
thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, 
accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion or, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in this report, any form of assurance thereon. 
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether 
the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to 
be materially misstated. If we identify an apparent material inconsistency or material misstatement, we are required to perform procedures to 
conclude whether there is a material misstatement of the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other information. If, based 
on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that 
fact. We have nothing to report based on these responsibilities.
With respect to the Strategic Report and Directors’ report, we also considered whether the disclosures required by the UK Companies Act 2006 
have been included. 
Based on the responsibilities described above and our work undertaken in the course of the audit, the Companies Act 2006, (CA06), ISAs (UK) and 
the Listing Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) require us also to report certain opinions and matters as described below 
(required by ISAs (UK) unless otherwise stated).
Strategic Report and Directors’ report
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit, the information given in the Strategic Report and Directors’ report 
for the year ended 31 December 2017 is consistent with the financial statements and has been prepared in accordance with applicable legal 
requirements. (CA06)
In light of the knowledge and understanding of the parent company and its environment obtained in the course of the audit, we did not 
identify any material misstatements in the Strategic Report and Directors’ report. (CA06)
The directors’ assessment of the prospects of the parent company and of the principal risks that would threaten the solvency or liquidity 
of the parent company
We have nothing material to add or draw attention to regarding:
• 
The directors’ confirmation on page 38 of the Annual Report that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing 
the parent company, including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity.
• 
The disclosures in the Annual Report that describe those risks and explain how they are being managed or mitigated.
• 
The directors’ explanation on page 42 of the Annual Report as to how they have assessed the prospects of the parent company, over what 
period they have done so and why they consider that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have a reasonable 
expectation that the parent company will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their 
assessment, including any related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.
We have nothing to report having performed a review of the directors’ statement that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal 
risks facing the parent company and statement in relation to the longer-term viability of the parent company. Our review was substantially less 
in scope than an audit and only consisted of making inquiries and considering the directors’ process supporting their statements; checking that 
the statements are in alignment with the relevant provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code (the “Code”); and considering whether the 
statements are consistent with the knowledge and understanding of the parent company and its environment obtained in the course of the 
audit. (Listing Rules)
Other Code Provisions
We have nothing to report in respect of our responsibility to report when: 
• 
The statement given by the directors, on page 66, that they consider the Annual Report taken as a whole to be fair, balanced and 
understandable, and provides the information necessary for the members to assess the parent company’s position and performance, 
business model and strategy is materially inconsistent with our knowledge of the parent company obtained in the course of performing 
our audit.
• 
The section of the Annual Report on page 61 describing the work of the Audit Committee does not appropriately address matters 
communicated by us to the Audit Committee.
• 
The directors’ statement relating to the parent company’s compliance with the Code does not properly disclose a departure from a relevant 
provision of the Code specified, under the Listing Rules, for review by the auditors.
Directors’ Remuneration
In our opinion, the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies 
Act 2006. (CA06) Tyman plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 140
Strategic report Governance and Directors’ report Financial statements
Report on the audit of the parent company financial statements continued
Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit
Responsibilities of the directors for the financial statements
As explained more fully in the Directors’ responsibilities statement set out on page 60, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the 
financial statements in accordance with the applicable framework and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. The directors are 
also responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the parent company’s ability to continue as a going concern, 
disclosing as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend 
to liquidate the parent company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is 
not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements 
can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the 
economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. 
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the FRC’s website at:  
www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditors’ report.
Use of this report
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the parent company’s members as a body in accordance with Chapter 3 
of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any 
other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior 
consent in writing.
Other required reporting
Companies Act 2006 exception reporting
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
• 
we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or
• 
adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received 
from branches not visited by us; or
• 
certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
• 
the financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement with the accounting 
records and returns. 
We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility. 
Appointment
Following the recommendation of the audit committee, we were appointed by the members in May 2012 to audit the financial statements 
for the year ended 31 December 2012 and subsequent financial periods. The period of total uninterrupted engagement is 6 years, covering 
the years ended 31 December 2012 to 31 December 2017.
Other matter
We have reported separately on the group financial statements of Tyman plc for the year ended 31 December 2017.

Notes to the Company financial statements
For the year ended 31 December 2017
1. Accounting policies
1.1 Basis of preparation
The financial statements of Tyman plc have been prepared in accordance with FRS 101, ‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’. The financial statements 
have been prepared on a going concern basis under the historical cost convention and in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 applicable 
to companies reporting under FRS 101. The accounting policies have been consistently applied.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with FRS 101 requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires 
management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Company’s accounting policies. Areas involving a higher degree of 
judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the financial statements, are disclosed in note 2.3 
of the Group financial statements.
1.1.1 FRS 101 – reduced disclosure exemptions
The following exemptions from the requirements of IFRSs have been applied in the preparation of these financial statements in accordance 
with FRS 101:
• 
paragraphs 45(b) and 46 to 52 of IFRS 2 Share-based payments;
• 
IFRS 7 Financial instruments: disclosures;
• 
paragraphs 91 to 99 of IFRS 13 Fair value measurement;
• 
the following paragraphs of IAS 1 Presentation of financial statements:
 –
comparative information requirements in respect of paragraph 79(a)(iv);
 –
paragraph 10(d), cash flow statements;
 –
paragraph 16, statement of compliance with all IFRS; 
 –
paragraph 38A, minimum of two primary statements, including cash flow statements; 
 –
paragraphs 38B to 38D, additional comparative information; 
 –
paragraphs 40A to 40D, requirements for a third statement of financial position;
 –
paragraph 111, cash flow statement information; and
 –
paragraphs 134 to 136, capital management disclosures;
• 
paragraphs 30 and 31 of IAS 8 Accounting policies, changes in accounting estimates and errors;
• 
IAS 7 Statement of cash flows;
• 
paragraph 17 of IAS 24 Related party disclosures; and
• 
the requirements of IAS 24 Related party disclosures to disclose related party transactions entered into between two or more members 
of a group.
1.2 Foreign currency translation
1.2.1 Functional currency and presentation currency
The financial statements are presented in Sterling, which is also the functional currency. 
1.2.2 Transactions and balances
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. 
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year-end exchange rates 
of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in profit or loss.
1.3 Financial instruments
Financial assets and liabilities are recognised when the Company becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument and are generally 
derecognised when the contract that gives rise to it is settled, sold, cancelled or expires. 
1.3.1 Financial assets: loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted on an active market. They are 
included in current assets, except for maturities greater than 12 months after the end of the reporting period. These are classified as non-current 
assets. The Company’s loans and receivables comprise “debtors” (see note 5) and “cash and cash equivalents” in the balance sheet. 
1.3.2 Financial liabilities held at amortised cost
Financial liabilities held at amortised cost comprise “creditors” (see note 6).
1.4 Investments in subsidiaries
Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
1.5 Borrowings
Interest-bearing loans and overdrafts are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Interest-bearing loans are subsequently 
carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. All borrowing costs are expensed as incurred, on an accruals basis, to the 
income statement using the effective interest rate method. Tyman plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 144

1.6 Share-based payments
The Company operates an equity-settled share-based compensation plan (Long Term Incentive Plan, “LTIP”) for certain employees under 
which the entity receives services from employees as consideration for equity instruments (share options) of the Company. The fair value 
of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of options is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based 
on the Company’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest. 
The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the options granted, excluding the 
impact of any non-market vesting conditions. Non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of options that 
are expected to vest. At each balance sheet date, the entity revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to vest, with any 
changes in estimate recognised in the income statement, with a corresponding adjustment in equity. The fair value of awards granted under 
LTIP is measured using a probability model to predict EPS levels.
The proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs are credited to share capital (nominal value) and share premium 
when the options are exercised.
The grant by the Company of options over its equity instruments to the employees of subsidiary undertakings in the Group is treated as a 
capital contribution. The fair value of employee services received, measured by reference to the grant date fair value, is recognised over the

APMs provide additional useful information to shareholders on the underlying performance of the business. These APMs are consistent with 
how business performance is measured internally by the Group. Underlying profit is not recognised under IFRS and may not be comparable 
with underlying profit measures used by other companies. APMs are not intended to be superior to or a substitute for GAAP measures. 
The following adjustments are made to reported profit to derive underlying profit:
Exceptional items
Exceptional items are largely one off and non-trading in nature and therefore create volatility in reported earnings. Items accounted for by the 
Group as exceptional include M&A transaction costs, IFRS 3 inventory revaluations and the costs of integrating acquired businesses, as well as 
major restructuring initiatives.
These items are excluded from the underlying results of the Group due to their material, non-trading and/or non-recurring nature. 
The Group aims to be both consistent and clear in its recognition and disclosure of exceptional gains and losses.
Amortisation of acquired intangible assets and impairment of acquired intangible assets and goodwill
The amortisation charge of intangible assets recognised on business combinations and any subsequent impairment of intangibles or goodwill 
is excluded from the underlying results of the Group as these are considered to be of a non-trading nature.
Other 
Amortisation of borrowing costs, accelerated amortisation of borrowing costs, gains and losses on the fair value of derivative financial 
instruments, and unwinding of discount on provisions are all accounted for as exceptional. These are non-trading in nature and are not 
considered reflective of the core performance of the Group.
For all adjustments, both the materiality and nature of the items are considered in determining presentation. In addition, the taxation effect 
of adjustments is excluded from Underlying Profit after taxation and earnings per share metrics. Material tax effects are disclosed separately.
