Annual Report 2017 Landsec at  
a glance
Welcome to Landsec. 
We buy, sell, develop 
and manage 
commercial property  
in the UK.   
Our aim is to create a great experience 
for everyone we rely on, from our 
customers to our communities, 
partners and employees. We believe 
that’s the best way to create long-term 
sustainable value for our shareholders 
and everyone else we affect.
 With the background of 
geopolitical and economic uncertainty 
affecting the UK, our markets lost 
momentum during the year. However, 
by having a clear strategy and acting 
early, we’ve been able to achieve a 
good relative performance this year. 
We consider both the short and  
long-term effects of our actions.  
And in this Annual Report, we’ve 
further integrated important  
content about our broader social  
and environmental impacts.

IBC Cautionary statement A breath of 
fresh air
2 Landsec Annual Report 2017
We design our buildings to be healthy, efficient 
and productive spaces. Which is why our 
ventilation system at The Zig Zag Building 
supplies air as fresh as you’d find at the coast. 
At Bluewater, our upgraded system is so 
effective we’ve turned off the air conditioning. 
That’s cut costs and energy use, and helps make 
the place even more inviting for visitors. 3 Landsec Annual Report 2017
Strategic Report
This year brought political, social and 
economic uncertainty. That affected our 
markets, weakening demand for space. 
Put simply , our markets don’t know 
what’s next.
In London, the office market reached 
a turning point. Supply-constrained 
conditions eased and the vacancy rate 
rose, with the Brexit vote a catalyst  
for change.
In the retail sector, a range of factors 
impacted retailers’ confidence, from  
the threat of cost inflation to online 
sales growth.
But we also saw opportunities. 
Successful businesses continued to look 
for innovative, technically resilient space 
in London. And in retail, there remained 
continued demand from dynamic brands 
for new and repurposed space in the  
best locations.
Our year 4 Landsec Annual Report 2017
We also saw the continuation of 
four long-term trends – each driven 
by expectation, each creating 
opportunities for us:
Smart office occupiers expect  
their work environment to deliver 
business benefits. That includes 
operational efficiency, but it’s also 
about attracting, inspiring and 
enabling talent.
People expect more from their shopping 
experience. Destination centres must  
go way beyond convenience and choice 
and provide a truly memorable day  
(and night ) out.
People also expect the best 
businesses to lead on creating better 
environmental and social outcomes. 
That means recognising the deeper, 
long-term effects of decisions 
and actions.
And talented employees expect a 
great career experience. Which is why 
a compelling employer brand is an 
increasingly valuable asset.
Designed with care
We work to create memorable 
customer experiences while 
minimising our impact. For 
example, at 1 New Street Square 
smart design choices saved 200 
tonnes of carbon and reduced 
material costs by more than 
£600,000. 5 Landsec Annual Report 2017
Strategic Report
Employer brand
We aim to provide employees with 
a great career experience, so we’re 
delighted to be one of Property 
Week’s ‘Best Places to Work in 
Property’ list – the only listed REIT 
included in their list.
Film stars
Destination centres give people 
plenty of reasons to spend time as 
well as money. Which is why you’ll 
now find 28 boutique and multiplex 
cinemas within our Retail Portfolio.
Blend of experience
It’s vital our team has the right 
blend of experience, skills and 
knowledge – including at the top. 
This year, Nicholas Cadbury joined 
the Board, further enhancing our 
financial and consumer expertise.
Community impact
We’ve launched the UK’s first 
scaffolding academy inside a 
prison, helping offenders at  
HMP Brixton get the skills and 
experience they need to find 
employment outside – reducing  
the risk of re-offending. Lighting up London
At Piccadilly Lights we’re creating 
Europe’s most technically advanced 
digital screen, giving customers 
extraordinary new ways to interact 
with two million people each week.
Healthy HQ
From collaborative working spaces 
and smart acoustics to a healthy 
food bar, our new HQ in Victoria 
has transformed the workplace 
experience for our employees.
Knowing our market
From smart technologies 
embedded in buildings to more 
flexible leases, we’re using our 
experience to prepare now for what 
our customers will need tomorrow.
6 Landsec Annual Report 2017 Girls Can Do It Too
The proportion of female workers 
in UK construction is just 11%. To 
give young women an experience 
of working in construction, our 
Girls Can Do It Too project invited 
students at two girls’ schools 
to plan, design and model a 
development, pitching their  
ideas to a panel of ‘dragons’ .
Jobs change lives
At our Lewisham shopping  
centre we’re supporting an 
innovative approach to work 
experience, helping young people 
gain skills, develop self-discipline 
and find jobs.
Multi-channel 
opportunities
Fashionista Missguided opens at 
Bluewater this summer, part of the 
trend for online retailers to provide 
a deeper brand experience through 
physical stores. 
Insights drive

By working to understand the 
business, we’ve helped TripAdvisor 
grow. Their customer experience 
has inspired them to triple space  
with us at Soho Square and 
commit through to 2023.

Strategic Report Nova shines 
bright 
We’ve created a stunning new destination in the heart 
of SW1, with landmark office space and an array of 
eateries making this a stylish and delicious place to 
work, visit and play. 17 new restaurants and three  
pop-up kiosks are set to open this summer, together 
with hundreds of alfresco dining seats. Pedestrianisation, 
public art and striking architecture complete the 
transformation of this area between Victoria Station 
and the Royal Parks. 
8 Landsec Annual Report 2017 9 Landsec Annual Report 2017
Strategic Report
So how did we address our  
opportunities this year? 
We drew our speculative London 
development programme to a close and 
sharpened our focus on letting space, 
actively managing assets and patiently 
tracking potential acquisitions. 
We worked to improve further our  
Retail Portfolio, finding new ways  
to help retailers and restaurateurs  
delight customers. 
We became the first property company 
in the world to have its science-based 
carbon targets formally approved.  
We also helped take our industry  
forward on community employment  
and wellbeing.
And we enhanced the career experience 
we offer, moving to a new headquarters 
designed for collaborative working and 
developing new ways to strengthen  
our culture. 10 Landsec Annual Report 2017
Queuing around  
the block
Our student lock-ins promise 
discounts, freebies and a top night 
out. They really draw the crowds, 
with over 27,700 students at our 
event this year at St David’s.
Our resilient results this year are down 
to the actions we have taken over the 
past few years to upgrade our assets 
and strengthen our balance sheet.
In March 2010 when we restarted 
development, our Combined Portfolio 
was valued at £9.5bn and debt was 
£4.2bn. Today, our portfolio is valued 
at £14.4bn and we’ve reduced debt  
to £3.3bn. 
Our net assets have increased by 
£4.9bn over seven years. And at the 
same time, we have increased revenue 
profit by 52%.
Our balance sheet is in robust 
health, with low levels of gearing 
and development. That gives us 
the firepower to buy when the time  
is right. 
Our high quality assets are well 
matched to the changing needs of our 
customers and communities – a vital 
advantage in uncertain times.
We’ve recommended a full year 
dividend of 38.55p per share, up 10.1%. 11 Landsec Annual Report 2017

Pride at work
Inspired by our support for Pride – 
the biggest lesbian, gay, bisexual 
and transgender parade in the UK 
– this year employees launched the 
Company’s first LGBT network. 
Oxford welcomes 
Westgate
Opening in October, Westgate will 
provide everything from global 
brands to a boutique cinema, 
from street food to rooftop dining. 
Developed with The Crown Estate 
– and the strong support of local 
people – it’s a place set to inspire 
and delight.
Re-imagining space
By taking a fresh approach to 
design at 20 Eastbourne Terrace –  
a 1960s office tower in Paddington 
– we’ve been able to raise ceiling 
heights, bring in more daylight and 
introduce a planted roof terrace. 
The asset was fully let within a year 
of completion.
Sustainability Matters
All employees are taking part in 
Sustainability Matters, a training 
experience designed to embed 
sustainable thinking in decision-
making across the Company. 12 Landsec Annual Report 2017
Understanding  
shoppers’ needs
We now measure customer 
satisfaction across every one  
of our retail destinations,  
using online surveys to track  
feedback on events and the  
overall customer experience. 
Tastes change
Food is a vital ingredient in the 
shopping centre experience; that’s 
why we’re constantly refreshing our 
restaurant mix – like bringing Indian 
street food brand Mowgli to Trinity 
Leeds this year.
Young talent
In an industry lagging on diversity, 
our Trainee Academy provides 
opportunities for school leavers 
from a broad range of backgrounds 
to develop a career here. 13 Landsec Annual Report 2017
Strategic Report
X marks the spot
We focus our activity where 
businesses and people want  
to spend their time and  
money, from regional cities to 
London’s most dynamic and  
well-connected centres. 
Validated carbon targets
We are the first property company 
in the world to have its science-
based emissions target formally 
approved – clear evidence we’re 
serious about sustainability and  
the environment.
Working together
Through our Customer 
Improvement Groups we bring 
supply partners together regularly 
– so they understand our priorities, 
we hear their views and customers 
are assured of terrific service. Zig Zag – truly 
world-class
14 Landsec Annual Report 2017
Research tell us that enriching the work environment 
makes employees happier, healthier and much more 
productive. The Zig Zag Building combines high-end 
office space with retail, restaurants and re-imagined 
public realm in SW1. The offices feature outdoor 
terraces, shower rooms, filtered air, stunning views and 
exceptional natural light – just some of the reasons it 
was named ‘Best office scheme in the world’ at the 
World Architecture Festival. 15 Landsec Annual Report 2017
Strategic Report
Uncertainty will continue to shape our 
markets, but we go forward in great  
shape – with clear priorities:
In London, we’ll focus on active asset 
management and preparations for  
future acquisitions and developments. 
In Retail, we’ll continue to enhance  
our destination assets and strengthen  
our portfolio.
We will do even more to sustain the 
success of our Company, customers 
and communities, further embedding 
sustainability in our approach. 
And we’ll keep developing our people, 
enhancing the know-how we need to 
compete, thrive and lead our industry. 
Above all else, we’ll work to understand 
and address people’s changing needs, 
using our experience to create great 
experiences for others. Because – 
ultimately – Everything is experience. Chief 
Executive’s 
statement
Robert Noel 
Chief Executive
16 Landsec Annual Report 2017
Landsec is in a great position. We have a 
portfolio of first-class assets combined with 
historically low levels of operational and  
financial gearing at a time of geopolitical  
and economic uncertainty. 
We’ve largely completed and let our 
speculative development programme. Despite 
being net sellers in the previous year, revenue 
profit is up 5.5% to £382m and adjusted diluted 
earnings per share are up 5.7% to 48.3p. Our 
adjusted diluted net asset value per share is 
down marginally to 1,417p. Our Combined 
Portfolio is valued at £14.4bn and, with adjusted 
net debt broadly unchanged over the year 
at £3.3bn, our loan-to-value is 22.2%. We’ve 
reduced our cost of debt and have access to the 
funds needed to buy when opportunities appear. 
Despite uncertainty in the outside world, we 
remain confident of our core strengths inside 
the Company and we’re recommending a final 
dividend of 11.7p – raising the dividend for the 
year by 10.1%.
Market environment
Put simply, our markets remain in good health 
but they’ve paused for breath.
In the London office market, we expected 
the occupational balance to shift from demand 
to supply during the course of 2017. The Brexit 
vote brought that inflexion point forward. In last 
year’s report, I said a vote to leave the EU would 
create business uncertainty, leading to lower 
occupational demand, falling rental values and 
a reduction in construction commitments. This 
is happening, though less than we expected. 
Overall, the UK economy continued to perform 
well during the year.
In the retail market, the effect of the 
referendum was less clear-cut although, faced 
with pressure on disposable income, shoppers 
have started to show more caution. Retailers 
were a little slower to take up new space during 
the year but we continued to see opportunities 
to meet the ever-evolving needs of the most 
successful brands.
We won’t be sure of the long-term 
effect of Brexit on our markets for some time. 
Negotiations with the EU can only begin in 
earnest after the general election. Although 
the business community remains in uncharted 
territory, that doesn’t mean we should wait 
for change to happen to us. We’re taking 
this time to prepare the business for the 
opportunities and challenges we see ahead.
We hope the new government can give 
businesses as much certainty as possible on 
areas including tax, regulation, access to skilled 
labour and public spending such as investment 
in infrastructure – including desperately needed 
homes. A clear and ambitious strategy for 
improving digital connectivity would have 
a particularly powerful impact.
Robert Noel reports on 
our performance during 
the year and shares his 
outlook for the next  
12 months. 17 Landsec Annual Report 2017
Strategic Report
First class portfolio 
The foundations of the business are rock solid, 
underpinned by our resilient portfolio and low 
leverage. 
In London, our modern, well-located assets 
are well let, with a weighted average unexpired 
lease term on offices of 10.3 years. Having 
already scaled back speculative development 
activity before the year started, the last 
12 months saw us put the finishing touches 
on over 1 million sq ft of space, including high-
profile developments at 1 New Street Square, 
EC4; 20 Eastbourne Terrace, W2; and Nova, 
Victoria, SW1, which completed shortly after 
the year end. Of the 3.1 million sq ft programme 
we started in 2010, we have let or sold all but 
283,000 sq ft.
Our Retail Portfolio is a collection of vibrant 
destinations that attract dynamic brands and 
are well-matched to consumer trends. During 
the year, we built and let a leisure extension 
at White Rose, Leeds. Our newest destination, 
Westgate Oxford, is on schedule to open in 
October and is 80% spoken for. Since the year 
end, we’ve acquired a portfolio of three outlet 
centres, establishing our position as the leading 
owner-manager of outlets in the UK.
Strong relationships
Throughout the year, we pursued our vision of 
being the best property company in the UK 
in the eyes of our customers, communities, 
partners and employees. Ultimately, their 
experience drives our performance. We’re 
responsible for ensuring that Landsec can 
thrive for many years to come. That’s why we 
set ourselves even higher expectations this year 
on issues we share with our customers and 
communities, such as local employment and 
place-making. We’ve also improved the way  
we address our climate impacts and risks.
Great people
In January, we completed the move into new 
headquarters at 100 Victoria Street, SW1. This 
is one of our buildings and it expresses the 
best of who we are and what we do. We’re on 
one floor of open-plan workspace supported 
by innovative technology. Thought has gone 
into everything from the way we collaborate 
to how we minimise energy and waste. It’s the 
UK’s highest rated office fit-out according to 
sustainability assessment scheme BREEAM.

We go forward

Evolving market conditions require role changes 
in our teams as our emphasis shifts from selling 
and development to management and buying. 
Our people relish these challenges. We are 
also enriching our culture, recruiting more 
from outside our industry so we gain fresh 
perspectives and new capabilities. During the 
year, we introduced stretching targets on gender 
and ethnic diversity and fairness.
Outlook
We’ve achieved our plan to have minimal 
development exposure and longer lease terms 
in London offices, a transformed Retail Portfolio 
and low gearing at this point. Over the next 
12 months, we’re unlikely to see rental values 
grow in London unless we have more certainty 
on movement of people and the UK’s terms 
of trade with the EU and the rest of the world. 
In the retail sector, the extent to which higher 
supply chain costs are passed on to customers 
remains to be seen. Whatever the outcome, 
higher costs tend to reduce take up of space.
In the short term, with significantly reduced 
risk and a portfolio of first-class assets, we 
go forward in excellent shape, ready to make 
acquisitions when the time is right. Longer-
term, we remain confident in our market and 
our ability to deliver sustainable growth. We’ll 
continue to address the trends that shape 
our business in coming years. For example, 
the combination of an ageing population and 
technological progress will have a huge effect 
on the way we live, work, shop, play, travel and 
are cared for. In turn, this will affect the way we 
design, construct and manage buildings, and 
how we attract the best talent.
The importance of thinking ahead and 
acting early was brought home to me by our 
completion of Nova in April. Design on this 
project started in 2003, when the iPhone was 
still an idea in Steve Jobs’ head. We must 
continue to anticipate change so that we  
can keep providing the right space for our  
customers and communities whatever their 
future demands – helping businesses and  
people to thrive.
Robert Noel
Chief Executive 18 Landsec Annual Report 2017

Product innovation
Technology and design innovation have the 
potential to change the face and functionality 
of buildings in exciting ways. They will also 
impact the construction process. While markets 
evolve at remarkable speed, the design, 
construction, leasing and operational processes 
for commercial property remain relatively slow 
and inflexible. Our industry must do more to 
reduce time-to-market, cut cost and increase 
flexibility, resilience, efficiency and sustainability. 
And we will have to continue designing buildings 
today that will appeal to and work well for a 
new generation tomorrow.
6
Sustainability as an advantage
Businesses, government and the public 
increasingly recognise the need for long-term 
thinking on social and environmental issues. The 
best companies in our industry are expected 
to take a lead on diversity, local employment, 
community, responsible supply chains, the 
wellbeing of occupiers and visitors, climate risks, 
energy and biodiversity. Smart, progressive 
thinking can help to support the people and 
resources companies rely on to prosper and 
grow – and bring all sorts of business benefits.
   
See how we’re responding to these 
opportunities and challenges on page 21
Our market
1
Evolving customer needs
For many London office occupiers, location is no 
longer the only consideration. Flexibility of layout 
and lease terms; efficient, attractive space; 
technical resilience; and physical and digital 
connectivity are now just as important. And cost 
per head is more important than £ per sq ft. In 
retail, successful operators are generally looking 
for fewer but larger spaces where they can 
showcase their entire online range and provide a 
brand experience. People are shopping less often 
but will travel further for – and stay longer in – 
the most successful destination centres.  
2
Balance of supply and demand 
We anticipated that the balance between 
occupational supply and demand in the London 
office market would shift during 2017. Since 
Brexit, we have seen lower levels of demand. 
As a result, the vacancy rate is rising, headline 
rents have stalled and net effective rents have 
weakened. If investment values fall further, this 
may present opportunities for companies with 
capital to buy assets. In retail, the market is 
over-supplied with space but assets providing  
a great experience or convenience will do  
better than those caught between the two.  
As catchments evolve, shopping destinations 
must ensure they can compete against others 
further afield.
Six big drivers  
of opportunities  
and challenges
3
Economic uncertainty
Wider uncertainty has affected the ability of 
many customers to plan and take decisions. For 
consumers, increased economic uncertainty 
may lead to lower spending. For businesses 
that have to take new space, there’s generally 
a combination of good choice and attractive 
incentives available. Others are opting to sit 
tight, extending leases and taking additional 
space if required. The impact of this has not yet 
been seen in investment values. Brexit brings 
potential for economic and financial benefits as 
well as challenges, not least for exporters and 
businesses looking to move into or expand in  
the UK. 
 
4
UK competitiveness 
In the short term, ongoing Brexit negotiations 
are likely to fuel uncertainty and commercial 
caution. Looking further out, we see the 
potential for the UK to emerge from this period 
in good shape. We fully expect London to 
continue as one of the world’s most successful 
financial and cultural centres.
6 market drivers 19 Landsec Annual Report 2017
Strategic Report
Dynamics
This year we moved from supply-constrained 
conditions into a market with more supply and 
weaker occupational demand. The UK’s vote to 
leave the EU triggered a weakening in demand 
for London office space, stalling growth in rental 
values and asset prices. The market is also driven 
by the evolving needs and expectations of 
customers and communities.
Enduring appeal 
Central London has enduring appeal for 
investors and occupiers offering:
—  Capabilities and opportunities of a global 
financial centre 
—  Deep and liquid property investment market 
—  International gateway 
—  Reasonable and relatively stable tax rates 
—  Strong business and transport infrastructure 
—  Diverse community and English-speaking 
population 
—  Access to top universities
Dynamics
We’re continuing to see the market polarised 
between destination centres and convenience. 
The growth of online shopping is driving the 
rationalisation of store estates, with only the 
strongest locations holding ground. Some 
online brands are moving into physical stores 
as convergence drives efficiency and they see 
opportunities to create great brand experiences. 
Stores are the best place to see, touch, feel 
and buy and they remain at the heart of most 
transactions.
London’s strengths attract a large and diverse 
mix of property investors, many from overseas. 
This helps us when selling assets but increases 
competition when buying. 
Challenges
Challenges for London include:
—  Uncertainty over the outcome of the Brexit 
negotiations 
—  Limitations on economic growth due to 
restrictions on immigration 
—  Lack of housing at affordable or  
attractive prices 
—  Pressure on an ageing infrastructure 
—  Continued lack of clarity around airport 
expansion 
—  High levels of stamp duty
—  Demand for better/faster digital connectivity
Outlook
We expect current uncertainty will continue 
to impact demand for space. Headline rents 
have started to fall and we expect incentives 
to increase and average lease terms to shorten 
further. London is an increasingly polycentric city 
and location is no longer the only consideration 
for occupiers. This may result in buying 
opportunities outside traditional core areas. 
Opportunities 
The best destinations continue to drive above 
average performance for retailers and attract 
the greatest demand for space from the 
broadest range of retailers. A retreat from the 
UK by some international retailers has been 
balanced by the expansion plans of others. 
Successful shopping destinations deliver higher 
dwell time and average spend per visit by 
providing consumers with a great experience 
and an appropriate mix of retail, food and 
beverage and leisure. 
Challenges 
An uncertain economic environment is putting 
pressure on discretionary spending. At the same 
time, retailer confidence is muted as they deal 
with the challenges of increased business rates, 
increases to the living wage and the requirement 
to continue investment in multi-channel offers 
and fulfilment. 
Outlook
We expect to see consumer caution led by 
concern about higher cost of living combined 
with lower wage growth. Destination and 
convenience centres will continue to outperform 
compared with those centres that fail to 
meet consumers’ needs and respond to online 
retailing: and the gap in performance is likely to 
widen further.

Our strategy
Our strategy is designed 
to ensure we are a 
sustainable business 
through the market 
cycles, creating and 
protecting value over 
the long-term. 
Our strategy helps us pursue our vision of being 
the best property company in the UK in the eyes 
of our customers, communities, partners and 
employees. 
We make understanding and meeting 
people’s needs our top priority, always looking to 
use our experience to provide them with great 
experiences. We act early in response to changes 
and trends in our markets. And we aim to lead 
our industry forward on critical long-term issues, 
from diversity to community employment, 
carbon and climate resilience.
We buy assets and start development early in 
the cycle; manage assets actively to ensure 
they generate strong income; and sell at the 
appropriate time and recycle capital. We aim 
to make sound, long-term investments so 
our assets keep their appeal, meet changing 
regulations and generate returns for years  
to come.
Nova: our strategy 
in action
Completed in 
April 2017, Nova’s 
extraordinary office, 
residential and 
restaurant spaces 
reflect the changing 
expectations of  
our customers.
—  Deliver sustainable long-term 
shareholder value
—  Maximise the returns from  
the investment portfolio
—   Manage our balance  
sheet effectively
—  Maximise development 
performance
—  Ensure high levels of  
customer satisfaction
—  Attract, develop, retain  
and motivate high 
performance individuals 
—  Continually improve 
sustainability performance

Our strategic objectives 21 Landsec Annual Report 2017
Strategic Report
Relationships
Develop close relationships with our 
customers, communities, partners and 
employees, so we understand their  
evolving needs and they trust us to  
meet their expectations.
Market
Focus on two dynamic sectors of the UK 
commercial property market – offices, retail 
and leisure in London; and retail and leisure 
outside London. Being active in these two 
sectors rather than one provides us with 
greater financial stability as they work to 
different cycles. 
Timing 
Apply our experience and insight so we buy, 
develop, manage and sell assets at the 
appropriate time in the property cycle. 
Scale 
Maintain our size and strength so when we 
judge the timing is right we can deploy our 
capital and acquire or develop a number of 
major assets at the same time. 
Locations 
Buy and develop in thriving locations or places 
with excellent potential. Good transport 
links are becoming more highly valued than 
fashionable postcodes.
Finance 
Enhance returns through appropriate levels 
of debt using our assets as security to drive 
down costs.
Risk 
Address the risk that space will be left  
unlet – or let at low rents – if supply  
outstrips demand by owning assets with 
strong appeal, developing early in the cycle 
and managing actively. Act early to  
mitigate risks related to changes in climate, 
legislation and resource availability.

Market cycle
London 
The London office market sees 
marked periods of over- and 
under-supply, and the balance 
can shift from one to the other 
quite quickly. 
Buy
We aim to buy assets when 
values are falling or low, or when 
we see a long-term opportunity 
to enhance value. We’re currently 
watching the market carefully, 
monitoring around £2 billion of 
potential acquisitions. Our strong 
balance sheet and access to 
capital mean we can buy when 
we spot the right opportunity.
Develop
We start to develop early in the 
cycle so we benefit from lower 
construction costs, aiming to 
deliver completed schemes when 
demand from customers is rising 
and levels of available space  
are low. 
We’ve drawn our large 
speculative development 
programme to a close for 
this cycle. We have plenty of 
options for development within 
our portfolio and the financial 
capacity to acquire new 
development sites.
Manage
We talk to our customers 
regularly so we understand their 
changing needs and can respond 
quickly. This helps us to retain 
customers and improve rental 
values, keeping our portfolio 
attractive and resilient. 
Sell 
We sell assets when we see 
better ways to use the capital. 
We aim to sell when there’s 
strong demand for the space 
and ahead of a turn in the cycle 
from demand to supply. We 
look to add value through asset 
management or refurbishment 
ahead of selling an asset. 
For more on our  
London Portfolio  
see pages 46-49
Retail 
The retail property market is less 
volatile than London offices and 
is fundamentally driven by long-
term structural changes such as 
consumer spending, population 
trends or the impact of online 
retailing. We are focused on 
London and the best regional 
destinations. 
Buy
We acquire when we see an 
opportunity to transform an 
under-managed property or 
land into a great destination for 
shoppers and visitors. 
Develop
We put strong emphasis 
on creating attractive, well 
considered space where people 
want to spend time and return 
frequently. We help customers 
pursue multi-channel strategies 
and we ensure our environments 
use new technology to enhance 
the shopper’s experience. 
We de-risk developments by 
seeking substantial pre-lettings 
before we start construction. 
And we ensure we contribute to 
the environmental, social and 
economic fabric of the local  
area and community, which 
helps to make our centres busy 
and well regarded. 
Manage
We are proactive managers, 
constantly looking for 
opportunities to enhance our 
space in line with the changing 
needs of our customers and 
communities. We continually 
refresh the tenant mix in our 
destinations and work hard to 
create the most compelling 
blend of retail and leisure. 
Sell
We dispose of an asset when we 
see opportunities to use capital 
elsewhere to create better,  
more valuable space with  
greater appeal. 
For more on our  
Retail Portfolio  
see pages 50-53
Develop
 
Starting schemes at 
the right point in a rising 
market helps maximise 
value and minimise risk.
Buy
Falling values 
bring opportunities 
to buy assets at 
attractive prices.
Sell
Selling some assets at the right 
point in a rising market means 
value can be crystallised and the 
portfolio can be biased towards 
high quality assets with long 
lease lengths.
Manage
Active management of assets 
through the cycle helps to reduce 
voids and ensure space meets 
occupiers’ changing needs.

Strategic Report
Investing through the life-cycle
We aim to buy, develop, 
manage and sell assets 
in a way that benefits 
those closest to us – our 
customers, communities, 
partners and employees. 
Buy
We acquire an asset if it 
has the potential to meet 
the evolving needs of our 
customers and communities, 
can be acquired at the right 
price, and is likely to create 
financial value for us over time. 
Published this year, 
our Responsible Property 
Investment Policy sets out the 
standards for acquisitions.
Develop
We develop when we see an 
opportunity to create space 
that will appeal to customers, 
enhance the area and create 
financial value for us. 
We design for the 
safety, health and wellbeing 
of occupants. We also 
design for efficiency and 
productivity. And we design 
to improve the public 
realm around our buildings, 
including connectivity and 
wider infrastructure. Our 
development activity creates 
job opportunities, both during 
construction and when the 
development opens.
To help us pursue our aim 
of being a sustainability leader 
in our industry, by the end of 
this year we had enhanced the 
Sustainable Development Brief 
we give to partners. Going 
forward, we will set tougher 
targets and higher expectation 
levels around innovation. 
The brief gives equal weight 
to social and environmental 
issues.
Manage
We work with customers, 
communities and partners to 
ensure our buildings operate 
efficiently and to help increase 
local prosperity.
We redesign and 
refurbish space if we spot an 
opportunity to make it more 
attractive, useful and valued. 
We work with occupiers to 
manage energy, waste and 
water as cost efficiency and 
environmental factors. 100% 
of the electricity we buy for 
our managed portfolio is now 
renewable and we collaborate 
with customers to reduce 
energy consumption. Thinking 
about sustainability helps us 
to protect the building from 
external risks such as price 
volatility, changing regulation, 
supply issues and premature 
obsolescence. And it enables 
us and them to meet our 
commitments.
Sell
We sell an asset when we 
see an opportunity to deploy 
our capital more effectively 
elsewhere. Through our 
investment and activity, 
the building we sell should 
perform at a higher level 
than the building we bought 
– financially, socially and 
environmentally. This should 
make it more valuable. 
We aim to build a positive 
legacy, leaving a place in a 
better state than when we 
arrived. By helping to improve 
people’s lives, we strengthen 
our reputation and add value 
to our asset.
We believe that responding to people’s needs, 
and giving careful consideration to the 
environment, economy and community, helps 
us to create enduring financial, social and 
physical value over the long term. 
Where we acquire or develop, we work closely 
with customers and communities to ensure the 
new space meets their needs and expectations. 
We manage most of the buildings we own 
(by value) which means we get to see how 
people interact with them and hear their views. 
When we have control of assets we can take 
decisive action to improve things for the better.
We aim to develop and manage buildings 
in a sustainable and innovative way; make 
efficient use of natural resources in everything 
we do; and create jobs and opportunities for 
the people who live near our assets, including 
disadvantaged groups who are furthest from 
employment.

27 Landsec Annual Report 2017
Strategic Report Creating sustainable 
long-term value
Here’s some more 
insight on the breadth 
of outputs our activities 
can generate and how 
we work to both create 
and protect value.
Profit 
We aim to grow our long-term 
underlying profit. We manage the 
business for the long term and 
growth in underlying profit ensures 
we can provide a sustainable 
dividend for shareholders. Revenue 
profit and earnings per share are 
particularly helpful indications of 
how we’re doing.
Asset value 
Our markets are cyclical. The 
London office market tends to have 
greater swings between rising and 
falling values. Our valuations reflect 
where we’re at in the cycle and how 
we’re doing in relative terms to our 
peers. Our strategy is to act early, 
reshaping our portfolios so we can 
be resilient through the downturns 
and ready for opportunities to buy 
and develop as the cycle evolves.
Balance sheet
Loan-to-value (LTV) shows the 
amount of our debt relative to the 
value of our assets. While a low 
LTV tends to represent a strong 
balance sheet, at times we will 
want to increase debt so we can 
fund buying and development 
activity. At other times, we will 
fund that activity by selling assets. 
Our adjusted diluted net assets 
per share measure is important 
because it enables shareholders to 
monitor the movement in the value 
of the net assets of the business 
and to compare this with the  
share price.
Dividend
We judge the level of dividend 
payments carefully, paying out 
most of our underlying earnings, 
but retaining some funds so that 
we have maximum flexibility 
around investments and disposals. 
Our progressive dividend policy 
means we aim to increase returns 
to shareholders at a sustainable 
level over time.

Financial Jobs and opportunities
We create income for our 
employees and those of our 
many suppliers. We aim to 
ensure that everyone who 
works on our behalf is treated 
and paid fairly and promptly. 
We believe our business should 
reflect the diversity of the 
communities we serve. And 
we help disadvantaged people 
and young people to access job 
opportunities in our industry.
Customers 
From retailers to shoppers and 
diners, from office occupiers 
and their employees who work 
in our spaces to their visitors, we 
aim to provide our customers 
with a fabulous experience. We 
design our buildings to support 
the wellbeing and productivity 
of those who visit and work  
in them.
Health, safety and 
security 
We work to maintain an 
exceptional standard of health, 
safety and security in all the 
working environments we 
control. We also partner and 
collaborate with others to help 
raise standards in our industry
Target
 — To help a total of 1,200 
disadvantaged people 
secure jobs by 2020
 — To ensure the working 
environments we control are 
fair and ensure that everyone 
who is working on our behalf 
– within an environment we 
control – is paid at least the 
Living Wage by 2020.
Sustainable design  
and innovation 
We think about the long-term 
appeal, impacts and resilience of 
our assets, designing with long-
term value in mind. We look to 
enhance biodiversity and support 
the wellbeing of those who use 
our buildings. And we work closely 
with our partners to minimise 
environmental impacts.
Natural resources
Being efficient helps us to 
mitigate our impacts and reduce 
cost. Our aim is to reduce carbon 
intensity, energy and waste while 
maximising the benefits of the 
space we create and manage.  
We always look to be thoughtful 
and smart in the way we buy, use, 
re-use and dispose of resources.
Social
New HQ
Our new headquarters 
is designed to promote 
productivity and

20 Fenchurch Street’s living 
wall enriches both the 
visitor experience and urban 
biodiversity.
Diversity 
A broad range of backgrounds  
and perspectives make us a 
stronger business.
Target
 — To reduce carbon intensity 
(kgCO

30 Landsec Annual Report 2017 Martin Greenslade reports 
on our financial performance 
in detail and explains 
the movements in our key 
financial measures.
In my financial review last year, I explained how the quality 
and resilience of our assets had been enhanced this decade 
through investment in developments and acquisitions, 
funded by the sale of weaker assets. 
Our balance sheet had also been strengthened by rising 
values leading to lower gearing, with the additional disposals 
in the second half of last year reinforcing the position. This 
year, as the property market lost direction following the EU 
referendum, our high quality assets and low gearing have 
helped limit the impact of declining values in our  
core markets. 
Over the year, our assets fell in value by 1.0% or £147m 
(including our proportionate share of subsidiaries and joint 
ventures) compared with an increase last year of £907m. 
The decline in asset values is behind both the fall in earnings 
per share (14.3p compared with 169.4p last year) and the 
reductions in basic and adjusted diluted net assets per 
share. In contrast, the Group has delivered strong underlying 
earnings growth despite the impact of disposals we made 
last year. Both revenue profit and adjusted diluted earnings 
per share increased this year; revenue profit was up 5.5% 
from £362m to £382m and adjusted diluted earnings per 
share were up 5.7% at 48.3p.
  Presentation of  
financial information
Our property portfolio is a combination of properties 
that are wholly owned by the Group, part owned through 
joint arrangements and those owned by the Group but 
where a third party holds a non-controlling interest. 
Internally, management review the results of the Group 
on a basis that adjusts for these forms of ownership to 
present a proportionate share. The Combined Portfolio, 
with assets totalling £14.4bn, is an example of this 
approach, reflecting the economic interest we have in 
our properties regardless of our ownership structure. We 
consider this presentation provides a better explanation 
to stakeholders of the activities and performance of the 
Group, as it aggregates the results of all of the Group’s 
property interests which under IFRS are required to be 
presented across a number of line items in the statutory 
financial statements.
The same principle is applied to many of the other 
measures we discuss and, accordingly, a number of 
our financial measures include the results of our joint 
ventures and subsidiaries on a proportionate basis. 
Measures that are described as being presented on a 
proportionate basis include the Group’s share of joint 
ventures on a line-by-line basis, but exclude the non-
owned elements of our subsidiaries. This is in contrast 
to the Group’s statutory financial statements, where 
the Group’s interest in joint ventures is presented as 
one line on the income statement and balance sheet, 
and all subsidiaries are consolidated at 100% with any 
non-owned element being adjusted as a non-controlling 
interest or redemption liability, as appropriate. Our joint 
operations are presented on a proportionate basis in all 
financial measures. 
Most of the measures discussed in this financial 
review are presented on a proportionate basis. Measures 
presented on a proportionate basis are alternative 
performance measures as they are not defined under 
IFRS. For further details see table 119 on page 172.
31 Landsec Annual Report 2017
Strategic Report Income statement
Our income statement has two key components: the income we generate 
from leasing our investment properties net of associated costs (including 
finance expense), which we refer to as revenue profit, and items not 
directly related to the underlying rental business, principally valuation 
changes, profits or losses on the disposal of properties and exceptional 
items, which we refer to as capital and other items. 
We present two measures of earnings per share; the IFRS measure of 
earnings per share is based on the total profit for the year attributable to 
owners of the parent, while adjusted diluted earnings per share is based 
on tax-adjusted revenue profit, referred to as adjusted earnings.

Basic earnings per share 14.3p 169.4p
Adjusted diluted earnings per share 48.3p 45.7p
Profit before tax was £112m, £1,224m lower than last year principally due 
to the valuation deficit this year compared with a valuation surplus last 
year. The same movement drives a 155.1p reduction in earnings per share 
from 169.4p last year to 14.3p this year. Adjusted diluted earnings per 
share increased by 5.7% from 45.7p last year to 48.3p this year as a result 
of an increase in revenue profit from £362m to £382m.
The reasons behind the movements in each component of our income 
statement are discussed in more detail below.
Revenue profit
Revenue profit is our measure of underlying pre-tax profit. It excludes 
all capital items, such as valuation movements and profits and losses 
on disposals, as well as items of an exceptional nature. Revenue profit 
is presented on a proportionate basis. We believe revenue profit better 
represents the results of the Group’s operational performance to 
stakeholders as it focuses on the rental income performance of the 
business and excludes capital and other items which can vary significantly 
from year to year. A full definition of revenue profit is given in the glossary. 
The main components of revenue profit, including the contributions from 
London and Retail, are presented in the table below.
Revenue profit increased by £20m from £362m last year to £382m for the 
year ended 31 March 2017. Following asset disposals we made last year,  
net rental income declined. However, this was more than offset by lower 
net interest expense as explained further below.

1.   Including our proportionate share of subsidiaries and joint ventures, as explained in the 
Presentation of financial information above.
Net rental income decreased by £4m this year as rental income growth 
from our developments and like-for-like portfolio was more than offset 
by the impact of properties sold since 1 April 2015. Significant disposals 
included The Printworks, Manchester and The Cornerhouse, Nottingham, 
both sold this year, and Thomas More Square, E1, Holborn Gate, WC1 
and Times Square, EC4 in London and three retail parks in Gateshead, 
Dundee and Derby, all sold last year. The impact of this year’s disposals 
will continue to be felt in the coming year as they contributed £9m of net 
rental income to this year’s results. Our developments generated £27m 
of additional rent following completion of 20 Eastbourne Terrace, W2 and 
1 New Street Square, EC4, alongside a full year’s income at The Zig Zag 
Building and 62 Buckingham Gate, both SW1 and 1 & 2 New Ludgate, EC4. 
Like-for-like net rental income growth was £10m due to rent reviews and 
higher turnover related rents, together with a reduction in bad debts.
Further information on the net rental income performance of the 
London and Retail portfolios is given in the respective business reviews.

32 Landsec Annual Report 2017 Net indirect expenses
The indirect costs of the London and Retail portfolios and net unallocated 
expenses should be considered together as collectively they represent 
the net indirect expenses of the Group including joint ventures. In total, 
net indirect expenses were £79m compared with £78m last year. The £1m 
increase is largely the result of higher IT and corporate communication 
and sustainability costs, largely offset by lower staff costs due to 
decreased headcount and reduced share-based payment costs.
Our net finance expense has decreased by £25m to £139m, primarily 
due to interest savings following the redemption of the £400m A8 bond 
in March 2016 and other refinancing undertaken this year, together with 
lower average drawings under our bank facilities. This has been partly 
offset by lower capitalised interest following completion of developments.

1. Rental value change excludes units materially altered during the year and Queen Anne’s Gate, SW1.
Over the year to 31 March 2017, we have seen values fall in most 
categories of our Combined Portfolio, largely due to outward yield 
movements. 
Within the like-for-like portfolio, our shopping centres fell in value 
by 1.3% as rental value growth was insufficient to offset a 9 basis points 
increase in yields. The value of our retail parks was down 4.2% as lower 
investor appetite led to yields increasing by 24 basis points. In contrast, 
leisure and hotels saw yields reduce by 6 basis points with little change 
in rental values. In London, our offices saw values decline 4.4% as yields 
increased. The 2.5% rental value increase in London offices is distorted 
by the valuer moving from net effective to headline rents on a number 
of assets. On a consistent basis, net effective rents in London offices were 
virtually unchanged over the year. The 6.9% valuation uplift in central

Capital and other items
An explanation of the main capital and other items is given below.
London shops is largely due to Piccadilly Lights where a replacement screen 
is being installed. Outside the like-for-like portfolio, the development 
programme saw values increase as construction risk reduced at Nova, 
Victoria, SW1 and Westgate Oxford. Completed developments, which 
largely comprises our recent London office schemes, proved more resilient 
than our like-for-like London office assets, falling in value by 0.4%.
Movement in impairment of trading properties
The movement in impairment of trading properties of £12m (2016: £16m) 
relates to the reversal of previous impairment charges related to residential 
land at Ebbsfleet, Kent, where the valuer’s assessment of net realisable 
value has increased over the year.

Strategic Report Net debt and gearing
Profits on disposals
Profits on disposals relate to the sale of investment properties, trading 
properties, joint ventures and other investments. We made a total profit 
on disposals of £67m, compared with £120m last year. The profit on disposal 
of investment properties of £20m includes the disposal of The Printworks, 
Manchester and Ealing Filmworks. The profit on disposal of trading properties 
of £36m includes a profit on the settlement of our remaining interest in the 
Kodak land at Harrow, together with the sale of residential units at Nova 
and Kings Gate, both SW1. Other profits on disposal amounted to £11m.
Net finance expense (included in capital and other items)
This largely comprises the amortisation of the bond exchange  
de-recognition adjustment (as explained in the notes to the financial 
statements) and the fair value movement on interest-rate swaps.
Exceptional items
This year we’ve classified two items totalling £169m as exceptional. 
They’re excluded from revenue profit by virtue of their exceptional nature, 
but form part of our pre-tax profits. 
During the year, we purchased some of our bonds with a nominal value 
of £690m, paying a premium of £137m. The redemption premium and 
£30m of the bond exchange de-recognition adjustment associated with the 
redeemed bonds, £2m of unamortised issue costs and £1m of associated 
fees (£170m in total) have been charged to the income statement as a 
finance expense. Further details are given in the financing section below.
At 31 March 2016, we provided for the onerous lease on our head 
office at 5 Strand, which arose following our commitment to move to 
100 Victoria Street, SW1. During the year, we agreed to assign the lease 
on 5 Strand to a third party at a lower net cost than originally estimated 
and we’ve therefore released the balance of the provision of £2m. Partly 
offsetting this release is £1m of relocation costs incurred during the year.
Taxation
As a consequence of the Group’s REIT status, income and capital gains from 
the qualifying property rental business are exempt from corporation tax. 
A property income distribution of at least 90% of this qualifying income must 
be made, and this distribution is taxed as property income at the shareholder 
level to give a similar tax position to direct property ownership. Profits on 
non-qualifying activities, such as residential sales, are subject to corporation 
tax and can be distributed as ordinary dividends. This year, we were able to 
offset taxable gains on non-qualifying activities with brought forward losses. 
In the year, there was a tax credit of £1m (2016: £2m) being a current tax 
credit of £nil (2016: £1m) and a deferred tax credit of £1m (2016: £1m) .
The Group fully complies with tax regulations and HMRC confirmed 
the Group’s low risk rating. In the year, total taxes borne and collected by 
the Group were £129m (2016: £109m), of which we directly incurred £41m 
(2016: £32m), including environmental taxes, business rates and stamp 
duty land tax.

Our net assets principally comprise the Combined Portfolio less net debt. 
We calculate an adjusted measure of net assets, which is lower than our 
net assets reported under IFRS due to an adjustment to increase our net 
debt to its nominal value. We believe this better reflects the underlying 
net assets attributable to shareholders as it more accurately reflects the 
future cash flows associated with our debt instruments.
At 31 March 2017, our net assets per share were 1,458p, a decrease 
of 24p or 1.6% from 31 March 2016. At 31 March 2017, adjusted diluted 
net assets per share were 1,417p, a decrease of 17p or 1.2% from 31 March 
2016, driven by the reduction in the valuation of the Combined Portfolio.

Over the year, our net debt increased by £44m to £2,905m. The main 
elements behind this increase are set out in our statement of cash flows 
and note 21 to the consolidated financial statements. 
Adjusted net debt was up £22m to £3,261m. For a reconciliation of 
net debt to adjusted net debt, see note 20 to the financial statements. 
Chart 22 sets out the main movements behind the small increase in our 
adjusted net debt. 
34 Landsec Annual Report 2017 Net operating cash inflow was £379m, largely offset by dividend 
payments of £289m. Capital expenditure was £288m (£258m on 
investment properties and £30m on trading properties), largely relating 
to our development programme. Net cash flows from the disposal of 
investment properties were £297m, from the disposal of trading properties 
£110m and the disposal of investments in joint ventures £3m. The premium 
payable for the purchase of the medium term notes was £137m.
Most of our gearing measures have increased marginally since 31 March 
2016 due to the decrease in the value of our assets and the small increase in 
our adjusted net debt. The measure most widely used in our industry is loan-
to-value (LTV). We focus most on Group LTV, presented on a proportionate 
basis, which increased marginally from 22.0% at 31 March 2016 to 22.2% 
at 31 March 2017. The increase in our Security Group LTV from 23.4% to 
28.3% relates to the medium term notes we purchased this year. These are 
held in a different entity to the issuing company and, for the purposes of 
calculating this measure, cannot be offset.
Financing
At 31 March 2017, our committed revolving facilities totalled £1,940m 
(31 March 2016: £1,865m). The £75m increase in committed facilities is the 
result of two new debt facilities totalling £560m, offset by the cancellation 
of two existing facilities. The pricing of our facilities which fall due in more 
than one year are between LIBOR +75 basis points and LIBOR +80 basis 
points. Borrowings under our commercial paper programme typically have 
a maturity of less than three months, carry a weighted average interest 
rate of approximately LIBOR +29 basis points and are unsecured. Overall, 
the amounts drawn under the syndicated bank debt and commercial 
paper programme totalled £441m (31 March 2016: £432m).
During the year, we purchased £690m (nominal value) of our medium 
term notes (MTNs). On 8 February 2017, we conducted a tender exercise 
which resulted in us buying back £635m (nominal value) of MTNs in 
three series. In addition during the year, we bought back £55m (nominal 
value) of MTNs in a number of ad hoc purchases, following enquiries by 
bondholders. Further details are set out in the table below and note 21 to 
the financial statements. In conjunction with the tender offer, we issued 
a new £400m MTN with an expected maturity of 2024 and a £300m MTN 
with an expected maturity of 2029.
A premium to par of £137m was paid across all of the MTN purchases, 
reflecting future coupon savings of £206m. Taking into account the 
interest cost of the facilities used for the purchases, we estimate the 
Group’s net interest saving next year will be a further £16m.
The Group’s debt (on a proportionate basis) has a weighted average 
maturity of 9.4 years, a weighted average cost of 4.2% and 89% is at 
fixed interest rates. At 31 March 2017, we had £1.6bn of cash and available 
facilities. This gives the business considerable flexibility to deploy capital 
quickly should acquisition opportunities arise. 
Since the end of the year, we have redeemed the Queen Anne’s Gate 
bond in its entirety. The nominal value amounted to £273m at 31 March 
2017 and the premium paid was £63m. The redemption was funded by our 
existing short term facilities and is expected to result in an interest  
saving of £8m in the year to 31 March 2018. Our pro forma cost of debt  
at 31 March 2017, taking into account this transaction, is 3.7%.

Dividend
We’re recommending a final dividend of 11.7p to be paid on 27 July 2017 
entirely as a Property Income Distribution to shareholders registered at the 
close of business on 23 June 2017. Taken together with the three quarterly 
dividends of 8.95p per share already paid, our full year dividend will be up 
10.1% at 38.55p per share (2016: 35.0p) or £305m (2016: £276m). The first 
quarterly dividend for 2017/18 will be 9.85p per share (2016: 8.95p).
Landsec has a progressive dividend policy, which aims to deliver 
sustainable growth in dividends over time, broadly in line with our underlying 
earnings growth as measured by our adjusted earnings per share. The 
reason we use underlying earnings is that it excludes capital and other items 
such as valuation movements and non-recurring income or costs.
We don’t pay out a fixed percentage of adjusted earnings each year, 
due to the earnings volatility that can come from our investment decisions. 
For example, when we empty a building in advance of development, we lose 
rent which isn’t recovered until after the new building has been built and let. 
Similarly, selling assets in the current low interest rate environment is likely to 
be earnings dilutive. Our dividend policy aims to smooth out that earnings 
volatility with a more consistent dividend progression.
The degree to which our adjusted earnings per share exceeds the 
dividend per share (known as our dividend cover) will vary for the reasons 
described above. In addition, when setting our dividend, we’re mindful 
of the earnings risks we have in the business (for example, from unlet 
speculative developments) and the degree of flexibility we believe we 
require (for example, if we intend to sell properties despite the negative 
impact on earnings).
Last year, we raised our dividend by almost 10% as earnings rose due 
to our successful development programme. This year, we’ve increased the 
dividend above our underlying earnings growth as we’ve now completed 
our disposal programme, our speculative development risk is lower than 
for many years and we’re unlikely to add to that risk in the short term. In 
addition to our focus on risk and flexibility when setting the dividend, we also 
consider underlying cash flows, recognising that these are generally lower 
than underlying earnings due to the lease incentives we give our customers 
and refurbishment capital expenditure. Taking all these factors together, 
we anticipate that dividend cover will be in the range of 1.2x to 1.3x. This 
range is indicative only although it’s unlikely that we would consistently pay 
a dividend per share in excess of our adjusted earnings per share and, as a 
minimum, we will satisfy our dividend obligation under the REIT legislation. 
At 31 March, the Company had distributable reserves of £3.5bn 
which compares to the dividend payable in respect of this year of £305m. 
We don’t anticipate that the level of distributable reserves will limit 
distributions for the foreseeable future.

Natural resources
When we buy, use, re-use and dispose of 
resources efficiently we see big benefits. We 
minimise our impact on the environment. We 
reduce costs, both for us and for our customers 
and partners. And we give our assets and our 
business greater resilience in the face of climate 
change challenges, from scarcity of resources  
to new regulation. 
Carbon
Last year we set a science-based target for 
reducing emissions. This target helps companies 
determine how much they must cut emissions 
to prevent the worst impacts of climate change 
and stay in line with the Paris Agreement. 
This year the Science-based Targets initiative 
approved our target, making us the first real 
estate company in the world to achieve this. 
During the year we reduced our carbon 
intensity by 18.5% compared to our 2013/14 
baseline, which puts us well on track to achieving 
our target for 2030 of a 40% reduction and our 
2050 ambition of an 80% reduction. 
Energy
This year’s carbon intensity performance is 
largely due to our active energy management 
programme, which is reducing the energy we 
use to power our offices and shopping centres. 
This year we set our first Group KPI for energy. 
This required us to create detailed energy 
reduction plans for each of our properties and 
approve energy reduction measures at those 
consuming the most energy. 
We’re now generating more of our own 
electricity through on-site renewable sources 
such as solar panels on our properties. We set 
ourselves a new target this year to achieve 
3 megawatts (MW) capacity of renewable 
electricity by 2030. Currently we have a 
renewable electricity capacity of 0.6 MW across 
eight assets. The solar installation schemes in 
progress at White Rose and Trinity Leeds will add 
an additional 0.8 MW this coming year, taking 
us to a total of 1.4 MW.
As of 1 April 2016, all the sites we manage 
are supplied by SmartestEnergy, the UK’s first 
officially certified 100% renewable electricity 
producer. We are also helping to pioneer the use 
of green gas, a low-carbon substitute for mined 
or fracked gas. Green gas made up 15% of our 
forward gas purchases for the coming year.

36 Landsec Annual Report 2017 Sustainable design  
and innovation
The way we design buildings has a huge impact 
on how people use them. Great design increases 
efficiency and encourages people to spend time 
in our spaces, improving wellbeing. This is good 
for our customers, communities and partners – 
and good for us. 
Climate resilience
Climate change is affecting our business today. 
Warmer temperatures, higher rainfall and more 
variable weather are putting new pressures on 
our buildings. This year we introduced a new 
resilience commitment – ‘assess and mitigate 
site-specific climate change adaptation risks 
which are material across our portfolio’ . Our  
new assets will be designed to resist the onset  
of climate change and we’ll also focus on  
how we can upgrade existing assets to meet 
climate challenges.
Scope 3 emissions and embodied carbon
Scope 3 emissions are those outside our direct 
control. They include the emissions involved 
in constructing our properties, including the 
manufacture and transportation of materials, 
and they represent 91% of our total emissions. 
Since embodied carbon makes up such a big 
part of our carbon footprint, we need to find 
ways to reduce it. 
We’re already hard at work on this. For 
example, our approach to sustainable design 
at Westgate has enabled us to avoid as many 
carbon emissions during construction as the 
centre is expected to generate in operation 
over the next 30 years, putting us well ahead 
of Oxford City Council’s environmental 
requirements. This year we worked with the 
Carbon Trust to develop a consistent and 
transparent way of reporting Scope 3 emissions 
across our business. With better data, we can 
focus on identifying and implementing the 
measures that will make the most difference. 
Biodiversity
This year we continued our work with The 
Wildlife Trusts, exploring ways to increase 
biodiversity across our Retail Portfolio. Together, 
we’ve developed a methodology that enables us 
to determine each site’s potential for biodiversity 
and to measure biodiversity at a local and 
Company-wide level.  
We’ve now identified the properties with the 
greatest potential for biodiversity gain and will 
focus our activity there, giving particularly close 
attention to how our sites connect with the 
wider landscape.
Wellbeing
Whenever we design a new development we 
think hard about the experience of the people 
who will use and visit it – everyone from office 
workers and their clients to shoppers and retail 
staff, local neighbours and tourists. This year we 
developed two stretching metrics on wellbeing 
for new developments:
—  To assess and design optimum air quality, 
daylight, lighting and noise factors
—  Where appropriate, to design and construct 
new developments to be prepared for 
certification by the WELL Building Institute, 
which recognises buildings that maximise 
positive effects on people.
We’re now pursuing these across our 
developments. This year we also continued to 
sponsor the Better Places for People Campaign, 
an initiative from the World Green Building 
Council that aims to inspire companies to think 
about the effects of property on people.
Thanks to our scale and the amount of green 
gas we buy, we can drive demand, boost the 
renewables industry and increase the proportion 
of green gas in the UK’s energy mix. This makes 
the whole industry greener – and in turn helps us 
hit our carbon targets.

Waste
Waste can have a significant effect on the 
environment. It also has financial impacts. 
For example, our proactive approach to waste 
management over the past three years has 
enabled us to avoid over £8m in landfill tax. 
This year, our London business sent over 77% of 
used materials for recycling – an improvement 
on last year’s rate of 74%; and we continued to 
divert 100% of waste from landfill. In Retail, we 
diverted 99.9% of waste from landfill, up from 
99.0% the previous year. We also sent 68.4% of 
used materials for recycling – a slight decrease 
on last year’s 69.3%. We are now investigating 
circular economy principles for further waste 
reduction across the portfolio.

Social 
review
A focus on some of the 
key activities we carry 
out to support our 
customers, communities, 
partners and employees.
Customers
We aim to use our experience to ensure we give 
our customers a great experience. We work with 
a diverse mix of businesses and organisations, 
from global corporations and international 
consumer brands to trend operators, fast-
growing tech companies and dynamic local 
businesses. Understanding and meeting 
customers’ changing needs is at the heart of 
everything we do. We work hard to understand 
future market dynamics and anticipate evolving 
expectations and requirements. Ensuring high 
levels of customer satisfaction is one of our KPIs 
and we carry out annual surveys with customers 
to assess our performance and gain insight.  
For more on our work with occupiers see our 
London Portfolio and Retail Portfolio reviews 
on pages 46-53.
Jobs and opportunities
Community employment
Our Community Employment Programme is a 
collection of employment initiatives involving 
training providers, charities and partners from 
our supply chain. It targets those furthest from 
the job market, including homeless people, the 
long-term unemployed, people with learning 
disabilities, ex-offenders and serving prisoners. 
The programme plays a real part in the planning 
process and beyond, showing local authorities 
how our work can benefit an area. In 2016/17, 
183 people found work through our Community 
Employment Programme. During the year 
we extended our prison work, launching a 
scaffolding training centre in HMP Brixton –  
a UK first.
When we started the programme in 2011, 
we focused on helping candidates in London 
find work on construction sites. In 2015, we 
launched the programme at our Westgate 
development in Oxford. This year we expanded 
the programme geographically, from Portsmouth 
to Leeds. We’re now offering more opportunities 
in customer service – a reflection of our strategic 
shift from development activity towards asset 
management. So far we have helped 962 people 
from disadvantaged backgrounds.
Education
Our education programmes help us engage the 
wider community, including students, schools 
and families. The programmes raise awareness 
of our developments, start conversations, and 
develop our local relationships. In many of the 
areas where we work there’s a degree of social 
inequality – so we particularly want to reach out 
to those pockets of disadvantage and support 
our ambitions to improve diversity in our sector. 
This year we worked with over 400 students 
between the ages of 12 and 18. Projects included 
Girls Can Do It Too, an inspiring partnership 
with two girls’ schools that challenged students 
to design, model and pitch a new property 
development. And we’re supporting The Sir 
Simon Milton Westminster University Technical 
College: a new kind of college for students 
wishing to pursue a career in construction, 
engineering and other roles that require both 
academic and technical ability.
Charity partnerships
This was the third and final year of our national 
partnership with Mencap, the UK’s leading 
learning disability charity. Across our business 
we raised over £360,000 over the three years. 
This year we asked employees to nominate 
charities that could help us achieve our goal 
of creating jobs and opportunities, and we put 
our final shortlist to a Company vote – 70% of 
respondents chose Barnardo’s. They will become 
our national partner from 2017. 
During the year our teams in London 
continued to help tackle homelessness. We also 
expanded our work in homelessness across the 
UK. We’re particularly focusing on Oxford, where 
homelessness is rising.
Fairness
We were delighted this year when we became an 
accredited Living Wage Employer by The Living 
Wage Foundation. All of our own employees are 
paid at least the Living Wage. In our London 
business, 100% of those working on our behalf 
– within an environment we control – are paid 
at least the Foundation Living Wage (£9.75 an 
hour in London; £8.45 outside London). In Retail, 
we’re confident we’ll meet our commitment 
that everyone working on our behalf is paid at 
least the Foundation Living Wage by 2020. 
In 2015 we asked construction supply chain 
partners to pay the Foundation Living Wage in 
their own supply chain. This year we started to 
check whether this is being achieved across our 
developments. Moving forward, we’ll also include 
a formal commitment in every contract.
The Modern Slavery Act came into force in 
2015. We’ve taken steps to make sure our staff 
and supply chain partners are aware of the Act 
and its requirements. In 2016 we issued our first 
statement explaining how we’re addressing 
the risk of slavery and human trafficking in our 
business. We then examined our recruitment 
processes, and trained teams to help them spot 
the risks of modern slavery.

Health, safety  
and security
Our priorities are:
—  Health: to make sure every worker has a 
transferable occupational health record, 
and to make sure all our maintenance and 
construction partners have a wellbeing policy
—  Safety: to have zero reportable health  
and safety incidents
—  Security: to raise awareness of physical and 
cyber security, in our own organisation and 
across our industry
Despite our efforts, incidents reported under the 
Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous 
Occurrences Regulations 2013 (RIDDORs) 
increased this year. This is partly because our 
system for logging and reporting of incidents is 
better, and partly because we worked on several 
complex developments – including Nova, which 
had over 2,000 people on site at one time. 
The good news is that, by bringing our many 
partners together in Customer Improvement 
Groups, we’ve created a more transparent 
culture. Partners are more likely to tell us about 
safety incidents instead of hiding them. 
Clive Johnson, our Group Head of Health, 
Safety and Security, continued to chair the 
Health in Construction Leadership Group 
(HCLG). This aims to make sure health gets 
as much attention as safety in our industry. 
In January 2017, HCLG held its second summit, 
drawing over 300 industry leaders. This saw 
the launch of Mates in Mind, a programme 
that shows people how to support colleagues 
with mental ill health. In future, we’ll require all 
contractors to sign up.
For the coming year, we have set new 
objectives to train all our people in physical 
and cyber security. The training will help with 
everything from protecting data when working 
remotely to staying safe during terrorist incidents.

Diversity
Getting greater diversity into the Company 
– including gender, ethnicity, social mobility, 
disability and sexuality – is very important for us. 
It means we better reflect the character of our 
customers and communities and are more likely 
to understand their changing needs. This year 
we’ve set out these very specific objectives for 
the business, to be achieved by 2020:
—  Ensure that Landsec continues to meet all 
the voluntary targets set by the Hampton-
Alexander Review. Currently 36% of senior 
management (including the Executive 
Committee) are female
—  Improve female representation at Leader 
level to 30%
—  Improve the Engagement scores for Black, 
Asian and Minority Ethnic colleagues – 
bringing them into parity with employee 
scores overall
—  Improve the transparency of our reporting 
of all diversity data, including the accurate 
measurement, and tracking of engagement 
of other specific groups – including LGBT 
and disabled colleagues.  41 Landsec Annual Report 2017
Strategic Report
Gender pay 
The UK Government has introduced legislation 
that will require employers with 250 or more 
UK employees to disclose information on their 
gender pay gap. The first disclosures will be 
based on amounts paid in April 2017 and must 
be published by 4 April 2018. 
Improving all aspects of the diversity of our 
workforce is a key people priority for Landsec, as 
is being a leader in promoting change across our 
sector. We have therefore chosen to publish our 
data in this year’s Annual Report. 
The table below shows the gender pay 
picture for Landsec, calculated in accordance 
with the published requirements. The definition 
of pay shown is an hourly pay rate for each 
relevant employee as at 5 April 2017, reflecting 
base salary and certain allowances. The bonus 
figures shown include total variable pay over 
the previous 12 months (bonus paid plus any 
proceeds on exercise of SAYE, ESOP or vesting  
of LTIP awards).

Investment in our people
2016 has been another year of significant 
investment in our people. We continued to 
roll out our established management and 
leadership programmes, Positive Impact and 
Positive Influence. Almost 150 managers and 
leaders have now taken part, and the feedback 
continues to be positive. We have also invested 
in our senior executives, who have been 
given access to a bespoke development offer 
including one-to-one coaching, business school 
programmes, and peer-to-peer networking 
and mentoring. In all, 67% of our people have 
undergone some form of training. 
In line with the focus from the Health, 
Safety and Security team, improving our 
wellbeing offer has been a key priority, and we 
have taken advantage of the move to Victoria 
to re-design the way all our people (including 
those based outside London) can access high 
quality medical care, including detailed health 
assessments. This has been supported by a new, 
healthier catering provision, and a range of 
wellbeing initiatives including stress awareness, 
mindfulness and yoga. 
We are proud that our investment in people 
has been recognised externally. In November 
2016, we were the only listed REIT to be named 
in the Property Week “Best Places to Work” 
survey. 93% of our people said that they were 
proud to work for Landsec.

While at a headline level, the figures would suggest a significant pay gap between males and 
females in our business, we are satisfied that the issue is one of female representation in higher-
paying roles, rather than of equal pay for equivalent roles. The analysis below, which includes 
additional data on hourly rate and mean bonus levels by pay quartile, illustrates this more fully:
Like other companies across our industry, we 
have a lower proportion of females in senior 
roles than we would like. As we have said 
elsewhere in the Annual Report, we have seen 
encouraging progress at the most senior levels, 
and we already exceed the Hampton-Alexander 
review target of 33% female representation 
at Executive Committee and the level below 
(the top 28 executives). However, the majority 
of our upper quartile roles (encompassing our 
Executive, Senior Leader and Leader levels) are 
still occupied by males. 
In the pay quartiles where there is a greater 
prevalence of females, their hourly pay matches, 
or even exceeds, that of their male counterparts. 
Given this, the differential in mean bonus 
payments at the lower levels of pay may seem 
surprising. However, this can partly be explained 
by the relatively high proportion in these groups 
of part-time females, whose bonus payments 
are pro-rated. For example, in the lower quartile, 
14.2% of our employees are part-time and they 
are all female. 
Encouraging more females into senior 
roles has become a key priority for us, which is 
why we have committed to a specific target of 
improving our female representation at Leader 
level (broadly the lower end of upper quartile) 
from 20% to 30% by 2020. This is underpinned 
by some specific initiatives such as the female 
mentoring programme and a new set of 
industry-wide recruitment guidelines which we 
have developed in collaboration with our peers. Managing 
risk 
By being both risk-agile 
and risk-resilient, we 
will be in a stronger 
position to embrace 
opportunities, deliver 
sustained success and 
enhance shareholder 
value. 
Our key focus areas in 2016/17
—  Third party review of our risk 
management processes
—  Crisis management exercises 
for the Executive Committee 
and senior management 
—  Third party review of our crisis 
management processes 
—  Cyber threats and other 
security risks, including building 
management systems 
—  Disruptors to our key target 
markets
Our key priorities for 2017/18 
—  Continue to enhance the risk 
management framework 
and further embed the risk 
management culture amongst 
all employees
—  Deep dive reviews into specific 
areas of risk
—  Enhanced reporting for 
the Board and executive 
management
—  Continue to enhance our 
approach to crisis management 
—  Construct scenarios to 
determine the impact of 
climate change on our 
existing portfolio and our 
future developments
Governance
The Board has overall responsibility for oversight 
of risk and for maintaining a robust risk 
management and internal control system. It 
recognises the importance of identifying and 
actively monitoring the full range of financial 
and non-financial risks, and other longer-
term threats or challenges potentially facing 
the business. The Audit Committee supports 
the Board in the management of risk and is 
responsible for reviewing the effectiveness of the 
risk management and internal control systems 
during the year. The Executive Committee is 
responsible for the day-to-day management of 
risk, which includes the ongoing identification, 
assessment and mitigation of risk as well as 
the design, implementation and evaluation of 
the system of internal control, and for ensuring 
its operational effectiveness. The Company’s 
Risk Management and Internal Audit function 
supports the Audit Committee and Executive 
Committee in evaluating the design and 
operating effectiveness of the risk mitigation 
strategies and internal controls implemented 
by management.
The Board undertakes an annual 
assessment of the principal risks, taking account 
of those that would threaten our business 
model, future performance, solvency or liquidity 
as well as the Group’s strategic objectives.
Risk appetite
The Board is responsible for the level and 
type of risk that the Group is willing to take 
and ensuring that it remains in line with our 
strategy. By regularly reviewing the risk appetite 
of the business and re-assessing the latest 
risk related information, the Board seeks to 
ensure risk exposure remains appropriate at 
any point in the cycle. Our risk appetite is 
cascaded throughout the organisation by being 
embedded within our policies and delegated 
authorities.
Risk management framework
We have an established risk management and 
control framework that enables us to identify, 
evaluate and manage our principal risks. This is 
supported by a strong risk management culture 
amongst our employees. Our approach is not 
intended to eliminate risk entirely but to provide 
a structure by which we’re risk aware and able 
to respond effectively and appropriately to 
create value for our shareholders.
Identification, evaluation  
and management of risk
The identification of risk is a continual process 
through discussion with management, external 
agencies and stakeholders. A full and detailed 
review of the risks, the controls and the 
mitigation strategies is undertaken with the 
executive committees of the London and Retail 
businesses four times a year. These form the 
basis for the principal risks and uncertainties, as 
well as emerging risks, which are challenged and 
validated by the Executive Committee. These 
are then presented to the Audit Committee to 
ensure representatives of the Board are aware 
of, and contribute to, the latest position. In 
addition, a wholesale and in-depth risk session 
is held with the Board every two years to ensure 
full Board participation in our risk management 
process. Such a session is next due to be 
undertaken in 2017/18.
Senior management from across the 
business will also attend the Executive 
Committee and the Audit Committee to discuss 
specific risk areas, such as a continuing focus 
on cyber risk, accompanied by external advisers 
where relevant. 
The Risk Management function, headed by 
the Director of Risk Management and Internal 
Audit, assists management by facilitating the 
risk discussions and providing challenge and 
insight where appropriate. 
We evaluate each risk on three factors: 
likelihood; financial impact, both to income and 
capital values; and reputational impact, from 
the business unit through to Group level. We also 
consider the inherent (gross) risk (the impact of 
the risk before any mitigating action is taken) 
and the residual (net) risk (the risk that remains 
after the effect of mitigating actions and 
controls are considered). From this we identify 
principal risks (current risks with relatively 
high impact and certainty) and emerging 
risks (those risks for which the extent and 
implications are not yet fully understood). This 
also informs the business as to those risks that 
have a high dependency on the internal control 
systems, which then directly helps to focus the 
work of the internal audit team. The business 
considers the full range of external and internal 
risk, including strategic, operational, people 
and technology. A risk scoring matrix is used to 
ensure a consistent approach is followed.
Ownership and management of the risks 
are assigned to members of the Executive 
Committee. They are responsible for ensuring 
the operating effectiveness of the internal 
control systems and for implementing key risk 
mitigation plans.
Internal Audit independently reviews 
the internal control systems using a risk 
based approach and, on a quarterly basis, 
management self-certify that the key controls 
within their area of responsibility have been 
operating effectively.

However, we’ve been positioning the business 
for these conditions, and so are well-placed. 
Over the past 12 months, we’ve completed our 
speculative development programme, focused 
on letting the remaining space, worked to 
maximise income and lease length through 
proactive asset management and readied  
the business to start buying when conditions  
are right. 
In addition, we’ve increased our emphasis 
on anticipating change to ensure our 
buildings and our service meet our customers’ 
needs, while at the same time enhancing 
the environment for our communities. This 
approach will deliver long-term value for us.
As a result of our actions, the portfolio is in 
great shape. It’s occupied by a broad customer 
base spanning sectors from finance to fashion 
and we now have our longest ever weighted 
average unexpired lease term of 10.3 years.
 
Buy
We made no material acquisitions this year.  
We have the firepower needed for when the 
right opportunities appear, but we will be 
patient and disciplined.
Develop
At 20 Eastbourne Terrace, W2, we completed 
a major refurbishment during the year, 
creating 93,000 sq ft of contemporary space 
in an 18-storey tower overlooking Paddington 
Crossrail station. The building offers 6,000 
sq ft floorplates and a stunning communal 
rooftop garden. All of the space is now let, on an 
average lease length of more than ten years at 
record rents. 
In the City, we completed 1 New Street 
Square, EC4. This 275,000 sq ft scheme was pre-
let in its entirety to Deloitte on a 20 year lease.
Nova, Victoria, SW1 completed just after the 
year end in April – a high point in our long-term 
regeneration of Victoria. The scheme features 
two exceptional office buildings, 170 apartments 
and a fantastic line-up of restaurants, creating 
London’s newest food destination. 49% of the 
480,000 sq ft office space and 93% of the retail 
and food-related space is now let. 148 of the 
apartments have now been sold, 10 of them 
during the year. 
The complexities of construction – together 
with competition for labour in a busy sector – 
delayed final completion and impacted costs. 
However, the scheme is proving very popular 
and we’re confident we’ll let the remaining 
space in good time. At Nova East, the second 
phase of Nova, Victoria, we’re finalising 
statutory approvals ready to start on site when 
the time is right.
We secured planning consent for 798,000 
sq ft of space in three London boroughs. In the 
City at 21 Moorfields, EC2, we’ve completed 
demolition and will shortly commence piling 
and construction of a raft that will sit above the 
eastern entrance to Liverpool Street Crossrail 
station, ready for building 522,000 sq ft in two 
buildings. Completing the raft in July 2018 will 
mean we can complete construction of the 
buildings in 24 months, providing an excellent 
prospect for the pre-letting market.
In Westminster at 1 Sherwood Street, W1 
behind Piccadilly Lights, we secured planning 
consent for a 142,000 sq ft mixed use scheme 
and in Southwark, at Sumner Street, SE1, 
resolution to grant planning consent for  
134,000 sq ft.
We have a further 360,000 sq ft in 
feasibility at Red Lion Court, SE1.
Manage
We were very active asset managers this year, 
moving early to address lease expiries and rent 
reviews, as well as securing reversions ahead  
of expectation.
At Dashwood House, EC2, we completed 
rent reviews on £6m (86%) of the income, 
increasing the rent by 26%. At One New 
Change, EC4, we reviewed £19m (65%) of the 
rent increasing the offices by 3% and the retail 
by 18%. At Cardinal Place, SW1, we reviewed 
£11m (48%) of rent increasing the offices by 14% 
and the retail by 23%, as well as letting 113,000 
sq ft of available space. At 140 Aldersgate Street, 
EC1, we reviewed £1m (44%) of the rent and 
achieved a 33% uplift, as well as letting 25,000 
sq ft of available space.
At Piccadilly Lights, W1, we obtained 
planning consent to replace the six screens 
with Europe’s most technically advanced digital 
screen, maintaining the heritage of the site while 
giving advertisers innovative ways to interact 
with more than 100 million passers-by each year. 
Coca-Cola committed to continuing its 60 year 
residence and will be joined by Samsung and 
Hyundai. We have three remaining advertising 
opportunities and are in discussion with other 
major brands to complete the line-up. We’ll be 
launching the new screen at this major tourist 
attraction in November.  49 Landsec Annual Report 2017
Strategic Report

Sell
In 2015, to reduce risk, we started a disposal 
programme of weaker assets after we had 
completed asset management plans to 
maximise value. The majority of these sales 
were executed last year and we successfully 
completed the programme this year with 
disposals totalling £46m. Trading property 
disposals of £135m include sales at Nova, 
Victoria, SW1 following completion of residential 
units, further disposals at Kings Gate, SW1 
and the disposal of our remaining interest 
in the Kodak land at Harrow. Sales of other 
investments totalled £13m. 
Net rental income
Net rental income in the London Portfolio has 
increased by £10m from £275m to £285m, with 
additional income from recently completed 
developments largely offset by lost income from 
properties sold last year.
Income from our developments contributed 
an additional £28m this year, principally at 
1 New Street Square, EC4, 20 Eastbourne 
Terrace, W2 and Nova, Victoria, SW1. We also 
benefited from a full year’s income at The 
Zig Zag Building, SW1, 1 & 2 New Ludgate, EC4 
and 62 Buckingham Gate, SW1. The increase in 
the like-for-like portfolio of £4m reflects new 
lettings and settled rent reviews, partly offset by 
reduced income at Piccadilly Lights following the 
start of refurbishment. Overall, these increases 
are largely offset by a £21m reduction in net 
rental income from disposals since 1 April 2015, 
most notably Thomas More Square, E1, Times 
Square, EC4 and Haymarket House, SW1.

Outlook
In the current uncertain environment, 
investment demand is likely to be lower for all 
but the very best assets. In the occupational 
market, we expect net effective rental values to 
weaken but demand from dynamic businesses 
to continue for high quality, resilient space. 
We’re well prepared for these conditions with a 
portfolio of assets designed to meet the needs 
of these customers.
We’re ready to add to our portfolio 
when the time is right. Our team is tracking 
around £2bn of opportunities, building up 
our intelligence network ready for a future 
investment phase. In addition, we’re preparing 
1.4 million sq ft of future development 
opportunities for when conditions are right  
to proceed. 50 Landsec Annual Report 2017

great experience held up well.
Retailers’ and consumers’ use of online 
retailing continues to influence demand for 
physical space, and inflation is now putting 
pressure on consumer spending. However, we’ve 
continued to see good demand for the best 
space in the right locations.
Buy
Our acquisitions during the year were limited to a 
small number of properties adjacent to space we 
own. Since the year end, we’ve acquired a 
portfolio of three outlet centres for £333m, which, 
alongside our existing outlet centres at Gunwharf 
Quays, Portsmouth, and The Galleria, Hatfield, 
establishes our position as the leading owner-
manager of outlets in the UK.
Develop
Our Westgate Oxford development with 
The Crown Estate is on time and on budget 
for opening in October 2017. We’ve made 
good progress on lettings with 80% of the 
scheme now pre-let or in solicitors’ hands. 
The latest brands to sign up include Uniqlo, 
Cath Kidston, Levis and Molton Brown. We’ve 
also invested to ensure the sustainability of 
the development, including extending our 
Community Employment Programme so local 
disadvantaged people will continue to benefit 
from job opportunities after the centre opens. 
At Selly Oak, Birmingham, 91% of the 
retail is either pre-let or in solicitors’ hands, 
demonstrating occupier support for this 
potential retail and student housing scheme.
Manage
This year we’ve secured £15m of investment 
lettings. Our like-for-like portfolio is virtually 
full, with voids of just 2.8% and a weighted 
average lease term of 8.2 years. We have strong 
relationships with vibrant customers, from 
groundbreaking start-ups to global brands. 
Trinity Leeds continues to be the beating 
heart of the city and we’ve brought new brands 
to the centre including Lindt, Côte Brasserie 
and Indian street food operator Mowgli. We’re 
also creating an upsized unit for New Look and 
expanding the centre’s vibrant leisure offer with 
two new operators.
At White Rose, Leeds, the demise of BHS 
enabled us to deliver a 55,000 sq ft Next store, 
doubling its previous space. We also upsized 
space for JD Sports, Pandora, Schuh and 
Holland & Barrett. Construction of our leisure 
extension is now complete and fully let, with 
the six new restaurants and IMAX cinema units 
being fitted out to open later this year.
At Gunwharf Quays, Portsmouth, we 
introduced Armani and Coach to build on 
the centre’s strong aspirational offer. We 
also opened one of the first Under Armour 
‘athleisure’ outlet stores in the UK. 
At Bluewater, Kent, we delivered a 40,000 
sq ft flagship for H&M, who had outgrown 
their existing unit. We’ve continued to broaden 
the wide range of retail brands on offer, with 
eight new openings including Mint Velvet 
and Michael Kors, and upgraded stores for LK 
Bennett and Jigsaw. Online retailer Missguided 
also committed to Bluewater. We started 
construction of the Plaza leisure reconfiguration 
this year and expect to complete by December. 
The project enables us to bring new leisure 
operators to Bluewater and the scheme is 80% 
pre-let or in solicitors’ hands, with Showcase 
taking a lease for a four screen extension.  
We’ve also continued to invest in the Learning 
Shop, which connects retailers and local 
unemployed people.  53 Landsec Annual Report 2017
Strategic Report
Throughout the year, we developed new 
relationships and ideas to keep the customer 
experience fresh and exciting. For example, we 
attracted on trend operators out of central 
London and into regional locations, including 
Dirty Bones and Sticks’n’Sushi at Westgate. 
We brought Mercedes into St David’s, Cardiff, 
and Buchanan Galleries, Glasgow. Cycle brand 
Ribble’s pop-up at St David’s was so successful 
they’re looking at more sites. In total, we 
brought 150 pop-up stores and kiosk operators 
into our assets this year.
Our retail parks are well matched to 
customers’ needs and remain 100% let. Our 
leisure parks are 99% let and are all anchored 
by the dominant cinema for their catchment, 
providing a broad, family-friendly entertainment 
and food offer. 
Sell
Disposals totalled £219m during the year. We 
sold the Ealing Filmworks development site to 
a residential developer, crystallising an element 
of the development profit up front, without risk. 
As we continue our focus on family-orientated 
leisure assets, we sold our two drinks-led 
city centre leisure schemes, The Printworks, 
Manchester, and The Cornerhouse, Nottingham. 
And since the year end, we’ve sold our 50% 
interest in Clapham Shopstop, SW11 to our 
former joint venture partner.
In February 2016, Accor exercised its right to 
break the leases on seven of their 29 hotels. All 
seven hotels have since been sold at a premium 
to their investment values and the remaining 
Accor leases, where breaks weren’t exercised, 
now extend to 2031.
Net rental income
Net rental income reduced by £14m from £329m 
to £315m. This was largely due to disposals since 
1 April 2015. These include The Cornerhouse, 
Nottingham and The Printworks, Manchester 
both sold in the current year and retail parks in 
Gateshead, Dundee and Derby, a leisure park 
in Maidstone and a supermarket in Crawley, all 
sold in the second half of last year. The increase 
in our like-for-like portfolio of £6m is due to a 
combination of new lettings, improved turnover 
performance and a reduction in bad debt 
provisions compared to last year.

Footfall in our shopping centres was 
down 1.6% (national benchmark 
down 2.5%)

Outlook
Current uncertainty and rising costs will 
continue to affect consumer confidence and 
retailers’ readiness to invest and expand. As 
a result, we expect letting activity to larger 
occupiers of retail space and leisure operators 
to slow in the year ahead. However, we believe 
that the best physical stores will play a critical 
role for retailers, not least in enabling them to 
create memorable brand experiences and to 
engage with their customers. Internet sales 
provide competition to physical space, but we’re 
also seeing opportunities to help brands develop 
their multi-channel offer. We’ll remain alert to 
buying opportunities over the next 12 months, 
but our focus will be on enhancing the space 
and offer at our most successful destinations, 
launching Westgate Oxford in October and 
successfully integrating the three new outlet 
centres into the portfolio.  54 Landsec Annual Report 2017
The Directors have assessed the viability of the 
Group over a five year period to March 2022, 
taking account of the Group’s current position 
and the potential impact of our principal risks. 
The Directors have determined five years 
to be the most appropriate period for the 
viability assessment as it fits well with the 
Group’s development and leasing cycles, and is 
broadly aligned to the maturity of the Group’s 
floating rate debt facilities. Our financial 
planning process comprises a budget for the 
next financial year, together with a forecast for 
the following four financial years. Achievement 
of the one year budget has a greater level of 
certainty and is used to set near-term targets 
across the Group. Achievement of the five year 
plan is less certain than the budget, but provides 
a longer-term outlook against which strategic 
decisions can be made. The financial planning 
process considers the Group’s profitability, 
capital values, gearing, cash flows and other 
key financial metrics over the plan period. 
These metrics are subject to sensitivity analysis, 
in which a number of the main underlying 
assumptions are flexed to consider alternative 
macro-economic environments. Additionally, 
the Group also considers the impact of potential 
structural changes to the business in light of 
varying economic conditions, such as significant 
additional sales and acquisitions or refinancing.
The Directors consider the key principal 
risks that could impact the viability of the 
Group to be ‘Customers’ , Market cyclicality’ , 
‘Development’ , ‘Liability structure’ and 
‘Financing’ . We have considered the potential 
impact of these on the Group’s ability to remain 
in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall 
due through a ‘viability scenario’ .
The viability scenario assesses the impact of 
considerably worse macro-economic conditions 
than are currently expected. In London, it is 
assumed that rental values are impacted by an 
excess of available space in the market, while, 
in Retail, inflationary pressure on consumer 
spending, together with a faster migration to 
on-line sales, maintain downward pressure 
on rental values. In London, rental values are 
assumed to fall for three financial years before 
starting to recover in the final two years of the 
plan. In Retail, rental values are assumed to fall 
for the next four financial years, and only start 
to recover slowly in the final year. Where voids 
occur, these are expected to take longer to fill 
across the portfolio. The fall in rental values, 
together with an outward movement on yields, 
results in lower rental income and a significant 
fall in capital values over the next two financial 
years. In this viability scenario, we assume 
that any uncommitted forecast acquisitions, 
disposals or developments do not take place. 
Similarly, we assume no uncommitted debt 
refinancing takes place, and no new debt or 
bank facilities are raised. 
We have assessed the impact of these 
assumptions on the Group’s key financial 
metrics over the period, including profitability, 
net debt, loan-to-value ratios and available 
financial headroom. The scenario represents a 
significant contraction in the size of the business 
over the five year period considered, with net 
asset value falling by around 35% at the lowest 
point. However, our assessment is that such a 
scenario would not threaten the viability of the 
Group. The Group would be required to renew 
a minimum of £1bn of its debt facilities at the 
end of the period considered, but the Directors 
consider this would be possible considering the 
Group’s expected loan-to-value ratio, and the 
range of alternative financing options if bank 
facilities were not available.
Based on this assessment, the Directors 
have a reasonable expectation that the Group 
will continue in operation and meet its liabilities 
as they fall due over the period to March 2022.
This Strategic Report was approved by the 
Board of Directors on 17 May 2017 and signed 
on its behalf by:
Robert Noel
Chief Executive
The Directors confirm they have a reasonable 
expectation that the Company has adequate 
resources to continue in operational existence for 
at least 12 months from the date of signing these 
financial statements. This confirmation is made 
after having reviewed assumptions about future 
trading performance, valuation projections, capital 
expenditure, asset sales and debt requirements 
contained within the Group’s current five year 
plan. The Directors also considered potential risks 
and uncertainties in the business, credit, market 
and liquidity risks, including the availability and 
repayment profile of bank facilities, as well as 
forecast covenant compliance. Based on the 
above, together with available market information 
and the Directors’ knowledge and experience of 
the Group’s property portfolio and markets, the 
Directors continue to adopt the going concern 
basis in preparing the accounts for the year ended 
31 March 2017 .

Chairman
Dear Shareholder,
Overview
During the year, Landsec continued to deliver 
against its business objectives. Our retail  
assets focus on thriving shopping destinations 
and our teams work in partnership with our 
occupiers to deliver a great experience to our 
consumers. Our London assets are prime and 
our regeneration in Victoria has been hugely 
successful. Landsec is in a strong financial 
position, with historically low levels of financial 
and operational gearing and a portfolio of  
first class, enduring assets. 
Board priorities
Given the political events we are witnessing,  
the Board has spent considerable time  
assessing the possible effects on the property 
Dame Alison Carnwath  
Chairman
Highlights
 — More time allocated to risk 
in an unpredictable year
 — Nicholas Cadbury joined

 — Strong supportive relationships

 — Sector leadership in Health, 
Safety and Security.
market of various economic outcomes flowing 
from decisions which might be taken.  
We continue to believe in the sustainability  
of our business model and the deliverability  
of superior relative returns. Our revenue  
profit is up 5.5% and we are confident in the 
underlying strength and prospects for the 
Group. Consequently, we are recommending  
a 10.1% increase in the full year dividend.
We expect a continuation of a wide 
range of technological innovations in the near 
future and we are discussing the speed at 
which they will affect the way we work and 
the requirements for our business and our 
customers’ businesses. Examples of anticipated 
change range from different construction 
techniques and materials, more sophisticated 
building management systems, greater use of 
pre-fabrication, the use of customer data and  Governance

the seamless digital environment which envelops 
us today. The diverse experience of our Directors 
has informed and expanded our debates on 
these matters. 
The Board recognises and, by its own 
example, promotes the importance of a strong 
culture within the organisation and the benefits 
which such a culture brings to the Company and 
its employees. Our recent office move puts our 
people at the centre of our business by providing 
a modern workplace with a cross-functional and 
collaborative atmosphere. I believe we will be a 
more efficient and effective business as a result 
of this move. Furthermore, during the year, Rob 
and his executive team focused on refreshing 
the Company’s brand to ensure that it reflects 
the values of our people and the aspirations  
of our customers. 
We continue to embrace the benefits of 
workforce diversity and the need to prioritise 
the growth of leadership and development skills 
within our teams. Women represent 30% of 
the Board and 36% of the Senior Management 
(including the Executive Committee) but we still 
have work to do on embracing ethnic minorities 
and disabled people. The Board allocates 
significant time on its agenda to succession 
planning and talent development. In all these 
ways, Landsec is and will be better placed to 
address the pace of change.
Shareholders and stakeholders
We are proud of the strength of our investor 
relations programme and during the year I was 
pleased to meet shareholders representing a 
significant percentage of our register in the UK 
and the Netherlands to discuss the business and 
its strategy and answer Board composition and 
succession planning questions. The meetings 
were timely with most being held the week 
following the Brexit vote. We are grateful for 
the time that shareholders set aside for these 
meetings and their feedback is always welcome. 
There were other occasions, at Investor Days 
and results presentations, at which shareholders 
could meet me and our Non-executive Directors.
We have recently completed a detailed 
third party feedback survey of our shareholders 
and were reassured by the positive results. 
In particular, our Senior Management and 
execution capabilities are highly valued. 
Shareholders contributed widely to the survey 
and provided some constructive suggestions 
which we are including in our Board agendas 
and discussions to the extent that they were  
not already part of our normal business. 
Shareholder engagement remains a high  
priority for me and the management team.
We appreciate the impact which a 
company like Landsec can have on a wider 
group of stakeholders. This is reinforced  
by our vision to be the best in the eyes of  
our customers, communities, employees  
and partners, but it goes beyond that.  
The expectations being placed on companies, 
and the ways in which they are being judged, 
are changing rapidly. The Board debates these 
issues when considering specific investments 
and more broadly when looking at future 
opportunities and the role that Landsec can 
play in a wider sense. You will see in other parts 
of this Annual Report examples of how this 
is put into practice throughout the business. 
In our separate Sustainability Report you will 
see how we are building the business for the 
future so that we leave a strong legacy for 
those following us. As part of our contribution 
to the wider issues of governance currently 
under consideration, we responded to the 
Government’s Corporate Governance Green 
Paper and await the outcome of that review 
and other governance initiatives. 
Health, safety and security
The health, safety and security of our customers, 
employees, contractors and visitors remains 
a top priority for us. We work closely with our 
partners and maintain a safety record that 
is well ahead of industry benchmarks. Our 
leadership position over the last year on mental 
health in the construction industry saw us 
recognised with the visit in December to our 
Nova site in Victoria by the Minister of State for 
Disabled People, Health and Work. Reflecting 
the ever-changing threats, we remain vigilant 
on matters of both physical and cyber security.
Board changes and effectiveness
I am delighted to welcome Nicholas Cadbury 
to our Board. Nicholas joined on 1 January and 
brings a wealth of commercial experience that 
will inform our Board discussions. As I said in  
my letter to you last year, Kevin O’Byrne will  
be retiring from the Board later this year 
and, when he does, Nicholas will take over as 
Chairman of the Audit Committee having had 
the benefit of Kevin’s oversight of this year’s 
results. I would like to convey my special thanks 
to Kevin for his nine years on the Board and  
his leadership of the Audit Committee. 
We conducted an internal evaluation  
of our Board’s effectiveness during the year.  
The process followed and outcome of this  
review and its results are set out on page 66.
Looking ahead
At Landsec, we are fortunate to have a  
Board and Senior Management who are  
very experienced and exceptionally well  
qualified. We are engaged with providing 
shareholders with attractive returns whilst  
giving customers a top-class property 
experience. All our employees work hard  
and share our enthusiasm for the business  
and I thank them for their commitment.
Dame Alison Carnwath
Chairman
I was delighted to 
be appointed to 
Landsec’s Board 
and have been 
impressed by the deep 
knowledge throughout 
the Company. My 
induction programme 
has enabled me to

quickly, to get to know 
my fellow Directors, 
Senior Management 
and key advisers 
right from the outset 
and to get a good 
understanding of the 
opportunities ahead.”

Letter 
from the 
Chairman 
of the 
Nomination 
Committee
Dear Shareholder,
I am pleased to present the Nomination 
Committee report which summarises our  
work over the past year.
Governance
I can report that we complied in full with the 
principles of the 2014 UK Corporate Governance 
Code throughout the year. You will find more 
detail regarding our compliance, governance 
and effectiveness elsewhere in this report. 
Board and Committee changes
Last year, I explained that Kevin O’Byrne, who 
joined our Board as a Non-executive Director 
in April 2008, would be standing down as 
Senior Independent Director in July 2016, and 
would retire from the Board in 2017. We started 
the external search to find Kevin’s successor 
in early 2016, appointing Spencer Stuart (an 
independent search consultancy appointed 
following a tender process) to assist with  
the recruitment. 
I am delighted to say that Edward 
Bonham Carter became the Company’s Senior 
Independent Director in July 2016, and that 
the search for a new Non-executive Director 
was successful with Nicholas Cadbury joining 
our Board on 1 January 2017. Nicholas will 
succeed Kevin O’Byrne as Chairman of the 
Audit Committee later this year. We will issue 
an announcement in due course to confirm 
the date of Kevin’s retirement.
Nicholas is CFO at Whitbread PLC 
and therefore has all the technical skills 
required to become Chairman of the Audit 
Committee. However, it was important to 
the Committee that any new Director could 
bring complementary non-financial skills and 
experience, and Nicholas’ role at a consumer-
facing business like Whitbread – and previously 
at companies such as Dixons – will be a true 
asset to our Board discussions. On behalf of 
the Committee, I extend my warm welcome 
to Nicholas as a member of the Board.
Also, Stacey Rauch joined the Nomination 
Committee on 1 April 2017 to broaden her 
perspective of and contribution to the Company.
Board composition and succession
We believe that the current composition of the 
Board and its Committees remains appropriate 
for the time being but this is kept under  
regular review. 
The Committee supports the ongoing 
development of Directors. It agreed the scope 
of a comprehensive induction programme for 
Nicholas Cadbury that started when he joined 
the Board and was pleased to support the 
ongoing professional development of Martin 
Greenslade who attended a six-week world-class 
Executive Program at Stanford University, USA, 
last summer. 
Board succession is a very live topic at 
Committee meetings. In particular, we discuss 
executive talent and leadership in the wider 
property industry. Our goal is to retain and 
recruit the best at Board and senior leadership 
levels. As a matter of prudence, we monitor 
a range of candidates who may be suitable 
replacements for existing Directors. We believe 
that Non-executive Directors should generally 
stay for nine years, with the appointment of 
new Directors providing an opportunity to 
add diverse perspectives and skills. However, 
it is important to ensure that the experience 
gained through one property cycle is available 
for the next, and that we have a mixture of real 
estate, financial, retail and general expertise to 
hand. As such, the Committee may determine 
occasionally that it is in the Company’s best 
interests for a Non-executive Director with 
particular skills to stay beyond the nine year 
term identified in the UK Corporate Governance 
Code at which point some investors or 
governance bodies may begin to question their 
independence. Should this occur, we will explain 
the decision and the rationale to shareholders.
Finally, the Committee supports the Board 
in its work to secure the long-term health of the 
Company, and its strategy for success in a fast-
changing world. This can only be achieved with 
the right people in the organisation, and the 
Committee has considered the likely business 
needs of the Company and its management 
capability – and succession plans – at executive 
and senior management level. We also 
recognise and support the extensive leadership 
development work that is being undertaken  
with all management levels within the Group.

Independence and re-election to the Board
The independence, effectiveness and 
commitment of each of the Non-executive 
Directors has been reviewed by the Committee 
which satisfied itself on the contributions and 
time commitment of all the Non-executive 
Directors during the year. On behalf of the 
Committee, I conducted a specific review in 
relation to Simon Palley as he has been in office 
for more than six years. The Committee was 
confident that Simon, and each of the other 
Non-executive Directors, remains independent 
and will be in a position to discharge their 
duties and responsibilities in the coming year. 
With the exception of Nicholas Cadbury whose 
appointment is being ratified for the first time, 
all the Directors will stand for re-election at 
the Annual General Meeting with the support 
of the Board. 
Committee effectiveness
I am pleased to report that the recent Board 
performance evaluation concluded that the 
Nomination Committee operated very well.  
The Committee has decided to increase the 
number of meetings held during the year 
from two to four. Partly this is in response to 
the ongoing internal and external succession 
planning work, but also it is a response to the 
expected increase in the number and scope  
of governance changes. 
You will find more information on these 
topics and the other work of the Committee, 
and more details of the Board evaluation 
process and its outcomes, on the

Effectiveness
Board evaluation 2016/17
Following the external evaluation of the Board 
and its Committees last year, this year’s review 
of the Board’s effectiveness was conducted 
internally and was led by the Chairman with 
the support of the Company Secretary. In 
accordance with the Board evaluation cycle, 
the evaluation this year focused on any issues 
raised in last year’s externally facilitated 
review and any new issues arising from this 
year’s process.
The first part of the evaluation required 
each Director to complete anonymously an 
online survey and questionnaire that focused 
on matters such as the Board’s performance, 
the performance of each of its Committees, 
the nature and content of Board meetings and 
the relationship between the Non-executive 
and Executive Directors. The survey included 
open questions that encouraged Directors to 
provide comments or enabled them to raise any 
concerns. The output of this survey was collated 
and provided to each Director.
The Chairman then met separately with 
each Director and used the output of the survey 
and questionnaire, together with a tailored set 
of questions, to conduct a detailed interview. 
These meetings were helpful in that they allowed 
the Chairman to explore in more detail some of 
the themes arising from the questionnaire  
and to obtain supplementary comments  
and observations. 
Mr Bonham Carter, as the Senior 
Independent Director, separately evaluated 
the performance of the Chairman having first 
collated points of view and questions from  
the other Directors and then discussing the  
outcome with her.
A final report and recommendations was 
prepared based on the collective comments 
from all the Directors and this was discussed 
by the Board. Separate reports were prepared 
for each of the Audit, Remuneration and 
Nomination Committees based on the feedback 
received, and in each case the conclusions 
were discussed by those Committees at their 
meetings in March 2017. 
Conclusions from this year’s review 
The conclusion from this year’s evaluation was 
that the Board and its Committees continue 
to operate to a high standard, and work well 
and effectively. The results overall ranged from 
positive to very positive, and there were no 
specific concerns raised by any of the Directors 
to the Chairman or anonymously through the 
online survey. Areas that were assessed as being 
particularly strong included the culture and 
relationships in the Boardroom, the Board’s 
collective judgement and overall performance, 
Board information and the involvement of 
Directors in succession planning. 
As with every high performing board, 
the Directors continue to look for areas of 
improvement. The Board will devote more time 
to engage in “blue sky” strategy discussion 
to supplement its existing programme 
(and to identify the enablers that will facilitate 
the execution of the strategy). The Board 
will ensure that its meeting agendas are 
forward looking in terms of the cycle and the 
business opportunities, and retain oversight 
over execution of the five year plan. Also, the 
Board will ensure that, at a time when the risk 
profile faced by businesses is changing rapidly, 
its assessment of risk remains dynamic (being 
revisited and adjusted as facts or scenarios 
change). Finally, regarding succession planning, 
the overall level of skills and expertise will remain 
a matter of priority, with particular importance 
attached to maintaining real estate expertise  
at Board level. 
The Chairman will continue to lead the 
process of building on current strengths of the 
Board and innovating further to build on the 
points outlined above, with support from the 
Chief Executive and Company Secretary.
Progress against targets set for 2016/17
In addition to considering the results of this 
year’s externally facilitated evaluation, the 
Directors reviewed progress against the targets 
identified last year as set out in the table below:
Areas of focus for 2017/18
 — Strategy – Board meetings to allocate 
sufficient time to both medium and longer-
term strategic discussion
 — Innovation – appreciate the impact of  
rapid technological development on us  
and our customers
 — Risk – further develop the approach to 
risk, especially in the context of the wider 
economic and political framework in which 
we will be operating
 — Culture and people – provide oversight 
and support to management as Landsec 
introduces its new brand framework.
Objective Performance
Board meetings to increase the amount of 
time allocated to risks and challenges that 
could impact the business, particularly at 
a time of increasing market uncertainty 
This is being achieved, helped by the time allocated in 
meetings to assess some of the unexpected events during 
the year, and will continue this year. Examples include 
external advisers addressing the Board in June and July 
2016 (shortly before, and immediately following, the 
EU referendum); further analysis of political and economic 
risk at the December Board meeting; and a Strategy Day 
agenda that was largely devoted to risks and challenges 
affecting (or which may affect) the business.
Time to be allocated to site visits, supported 
by ongoing professional development, 
in order to increase their level of business 
awareness and engagement
Site visits were arranged for Directors and Directors have 
attended results presentations and investor days.
Review the way the Board tracks progress 
on previously approved major projects and 
initiatives, using experience gained from 
past investment decisions
We held an in-depth review of each of the London and 
Retail operating businesses, assessing past decisions, 
current performance and future strategy.

Diversity policy 
The Board embraces diversity in its broadest 
sense, believing that a wide range of experience, 
background, perspective, skills and knowledge 
combine to contribute towards a high 
performing, effective Board, which is better  
able to support and direct the Company.
Landsec continues to make good progress 
in terms of greater diversity. The addition of 
Mr Cadbury to the Board has meant that the 
percentage of women on the Board has reduced 
to 30% (from 33% last year). However, this will 
reverse later in 2017 when Kevin O’Byrne retires 
and we will again be meeting the voluntary 
targets set by the Hampton-Alexander review 
for women on the Board of FTSE 350 companies. 
Further, we are pleased to report that 36% of 
Senior Management in Landsec (comprising the 
Executive Committee and Senior Leaders) are 
women, again in line with this voluntary target 
identified in the Hampton-Alexander review. 
Our mentoring programme, introduced last 
year specifically to assist women at all levels to 
reach their full potential within the Company, 
continues to operate well. 
Diversity is more than just gender based, 
and the Board will continue to focus in the 
coming year on this important issue in its wider 
context. Landsec has set specific objectives to 
be achieved by 2020, including improvements in 
the engagement scores of its Black, Asian and 
Minority Ethnic and LGBT employees, and these 
objectives are supported by the Board.
Conflicts of interest 
The Board operates a policy to identify and, 
where appropriate, manage any potential 
conflicts of interest that Directors may have. 
The Nomination Committee monitors the 
situation and determines the actions necessary 
to address potential conflicts of interest as 
detailed in the table below.
Board environment and access to 
appropriate information 
The Board environment and its culture of 
transparency and openness was again rated 
favourably in this year’s effectiveness review. In 
addition to the Board meetings, and the private 
sessions scheduled at each Board meeting 
held by the Chairman and the Non-executive 
Directors, there are other opportunities arranged 
during the year when Directors meet and at 
which relevant items can be discussed in detail. 
The Board and its Committees receive 
papers in a timely fashion and Directors have 
access to information, support and advice from 
the Company Secretary and members of his 
team throughout the year.
Induction 
A comprehensive induction programme exists 
for any newly appointed Directors and was 
used when Mr Cadbury joined the Board 
during the year. The priorities of the induction 
were to provide Nicholas Cadbury with an 
understanding of the Group’s history, culture, 
business, strategy and financial position. This 
included early meetings with the Chairman 
and the Executive Directors, together with 
other Non-executive Directors and Senior 
Management. There were also meetings with 
external advisers to the Audit Committee, 
of which Mr Cadbury will become Chairman 
later in 2017.
Professional development, support  
and training for Directors 
The Board held several specific knowledge 
development sessions during the year, on 
such matters as Brexit and other political and 
economic risk factors that may affect the 
business or the wider property market in the UK. 
Directors continued to receive regular 
reports facilitating greater awareness and 
understanding of the Group’s business and 
the legal, regulatory and industry-specific 
environment in which it operates. This is 
complemented by visits to properties owned, 
managed or being developed by the Group 
which enable a deeper insight into the 
operations of the business and provide Directors 
with the opportunity to meet with senior and 
local management teams. 
Board strategy 
The Board considers strategy throughout the 
year, encompassing topics such as funding and 
capital allocation, competition and emerging 
sectors. Additionally, the Board held its regular 
two-day strategy meeting in February that 
enabled it to explore and debate in detail a 
wide range of items such as: 
 — the rapidly developing technology that may 
affect the business and its customers
 — possible longer-term threats and challenges 
to the commercial property market
 — geopolitical and macro-economic trends.
Potential conflicts of interest Table 31
Director
Potential conflict  
situation
Nomination Committee decision  
and mitigating actions taken
Dame Alison 
Carnwath
A non-executive director of 
Zurich Insurance Company 
Limited with whom the 
Group places certain of 
its insurance policies and 
pension investments. 
Since the Group’s insurance programme and policy 
matters are handled by the Executive Directors 
outside of the Board (and in consultation with its 
own independent insurance brokers), the Committee 
concluded that in practice conflicts of interest involving 
Dame Alison Carnwath and Zurich Insurance were 
unlikely to occur.
Chris Bartram An adviser to Orchard Street 
Investment Management 
(OSIM) until 31 March 2017 
which is, in some areas of 
operation, a competitor  
of the Group.
The Committee did not see any potential conflict of 
interest situations arising from Mr. Bartram’s advisory 
role at OSIM.
Kevin O’Byrne Chief Executive of Poundland  
Group PLC and Chief 
Financial Officer of 
J Sainsbury PLC, both of 
which lease a number of retail 
properties from the Company 
around the country. 
As operational matters, such as retail leasing, are 
unlikely to be considered at Board level, the Committee 
concluded that in practice conflicts of interest involving 
Mr O’Byrne and his employers were unlikely to occur. 
Mr O’Byrne resigned his position at Poundland 
on 30 December 2016 and took up his position at 
J Sainsbury on 9 January 2017.
Cressida Hogg  
CBE
Managing Director, Head of 
Infrastructure, of the Canada 
Pension Plan Investment 
Board (CPPIB) which is the 
Group’s joint venture partner 
at a major development. 
In her role, Ms Hogg will not have any involvement 
with the development in question as this is managed 
by a different business unit within CPPIB. As an 
additional precaution, the Group will not share any 
sensitive information on that development with her 
and she has agreed not to participate in any Board 
discussion that relates to it. 
Edward Bonham
Carter
Vice Chairman of Jupiter 
Fund Management plc, 
a fund manager which 
evaluates investments that 
may or may not include 
those of the Group. Jupiter  
is also a customer of  
the Group.
Mr Bonham Carter’s position is such that he is 
unlikely to be involved in the selection of particular 
investments and has agreed not to participate in any 
investment decisions which may involve the Group’s 
securities. Since operational matters, such as office 
leasing, are unlikely to be considered at Board level, 
the Committee concluded that in practice conflicts of 
interest involving Mr Bonham Carter and his employer 
were unlikely to occur.
Nicholas 
Cadbury
Group Finance Director 
of Whitbread PLC which, 
through its Costa Coffee 
operations, leases a number 
of retail properties from  
the Company around  
the country. 
Since operational matters, such as retail leasing, are 
unlikely to be considered at Board level, the Committee 
concluded that in practice conflicts of interest involving 
Mr Cadbury and his employer were unlikely to occur. 
Nicholas Cadbury was appointed a Non-executive 
Director of the Board on 1 January 2017. 68 Landsec Annual Report 2017
Letter from 
the Chairman 
of the Audit 
Committee
Dear Shareholder,
I am pleased to report on the key activities and 
focus of the Audit Committee during the year. 
This will be my last report to you as Chairman 
of the Committee as I intend to step down later 
this year after nine years on the Board. Nicholas 
Cadbury, who joined the Board in January, will 
take over as the Chairman of the Committee.
The Committee monitors the integrity of 
the Group’s reporting process and financial 
management. It ensures that risks are carefully 
identified and assessed, and that sound systems 
of risk management and internal control are 
in place. It scrutinises the full and half-yearly 
financial statements before proposing them 
to the Board for approval, and reviews in detail 
the work of the external auditor and valuer 
and any significant financial judgement made 
by management. The Committee reviews the 
risk management framework and reports to 
the Board on matters of existing and emerging 
risk affecting the Group. The Committee 
receives detailed reports from management, 
supplemented by other conversations and 
meetings as appropriate during the year.
Acquisitions and disposals
The Company made a number of property 
acquisitions and disposals during the year 
as it continued to execute its strategy. The 
Committee ensured that the accounting 
treatment of all transactions was scrutinised 
and appropriate. 
Changing risk landscape
The risk landscape has evolved during the year. 
We reviewed changes at a macro-economic and 
political level and a range of other risks affecting 
the business including cyber security and rapid 
technological change. Also, we considered other 
factors such as the market cycle, the Brexit 
negotiation process, and property and consumer 
trends that are relevant to our business planning 
in the medium to long term.
The Group’s Executive Committee regularly 
reviews the risk register and this is used by the 
Committee as the basis of its risk assessment. 
During the year, we refreshed the risk reporting 
matrix within the business to provide more 
scope for emerging threats to be identified 
before they are considered as potential risks 
affecting the business. We have also revised 
the way that risks are reported to the Board 
with more regular updates through the Chief 
Financial Officer’s Board report.
Internal audit
The Company maintains its own risk 
management and internal audit function. The 
Committee again reviewed the scope, skills and 
competencies of this function, and the level of 
resource available to it. We decided that the 
knowledge, skills and resources of our internal 
audit team, and their understanding of the 
business, were appropriate. However, there are 
occasions when we require and benefit from 
the expertise that can be offered by specialist 
external advice and, accordingly, the Committee 
considered when such advice was appropriate. 
We believe that the combination of internal 
and external advisers provides us with the 
best insight into areas of risk and appropriate 
controls, and allows us to provide assurance to 
the Board that the system of internal processes 
is robust.
External valuations and valuer
CBRE was appointed in 2015 to act as the 
Group’s valuer following a tender process. We 
are pleased with the level of support provided 
by CBRE, the rigorous process that they apply 
to their work and their broad industry expertise 
and knowledge.
External auditor
Ernst & Young LLP (EY) was appointed as the 
Company’s auditor in 2013. This year’s internal 
review of their effectiveness and performance 
concluded that they continue to operate at 
a high standard. We have agreed a new fee 
basis for EY’s services for this year and through 
to 2018/19, details of which are contained on 
page 71 in the Accountability section. Based on 
the Committee’s recommendation, the Board 
is proposing that EY be reappointed to office 
at this year’s AGM.
AQRT
During the year, an Audit Quality Review Team 
(AQRT) from the FRC undertook an inspection 
of EY’s audit of the Group’s financial statements 
for the year ended 31 March 2016. As part of 
that process I spoke with the AQRT to share 
my (and the Audit Committee’s) perspectives 
on the quality of EY’s audit and its delivery on 
commitments made by the audit firm as part 
of the audit tender process. On completion 
of the review, the Audit Committee received 
and considered the AQRT’s final report on 
its inspection and discussed it with Eamonn 
McGrath, the audit partner at EY. The report 
does not give the Committee any concerns 
over the quality, objectivity or independence 
of the audit.
Fair, balanced and understandable
The Committee assessed and recommended 
to the Board that, taken as a whole, the 
Company’s 2017 Annual Report is fair, 
balanced and understandable.
Viability Statement
The Viability Statement, together with the 
rationale behind the chosen five year time 
horizon, is set out on page 54. The Committee 
considered whether there should be any 
change to the period chosen for the Statement, 
particularly in the context of any implications 
resulting from the UK’s decision to leave the  
EU, but was of the opinion that five years 
remained appropriate.
UK Corporate Governance Code/FRC 
Guidance on Audit Committees
The Committee considered its compliance with 
the 2014 UK Corporate Governance Code and 
the FRC Guidance on Audit Committees. We 
believe that we have addressed both the spirit 
and the requirements of both; this conclusion 
is supported by our external auditor.

69 Landsec Annual Report 2017
Committee effectiveness
During the year, the Board carried out an 
internally facilitated evaluation of its performance 
and that of its Committees. This evaluation 
confirmed that the Committee continued to 
operate at a high standard, with clear priorities, 
well-defined responsibilities and clarity around 
its workplan.
The year ahead
I have referred already to the rapidly changing 
environment in which the Company operates, 
with important political and economic changes 
to follow from the decision to leave the EU. 
The increasing pace of technological change is 
both a threat and opportunity that we assess 
on a regular basis. The Committee will continue 
to work with management, and provide clear 
reports to the Board, to ensure that it addresses 
these issues in a way that is consistent with the 
Company’s culture and values. 
I would like to thank the other members 
of the Committee, together with management 
and EY, for their support during the year.
Audit Committee – new Chairman
As I mentioned earlier, this is my last year  
as Chairman of the Audit Committee. I have 
thoroughly enjoyed my time at Landsec, and 
would like to thank the Chairman, my fellow 
Directors and the Company’s management, 
external advisers and shareholders for the 
support that I have received throughout  
my tenure.
A rigorous process was followed by the 
Nomination Committee in appointing my 
successor, Nicholas Cadbury. Nicholas will 
be replacing me later this year as Chairman 
of this Committee. As the CFO of Whitbread 
PLC, a highly-regarded customer-facing 
company in the FTSE 100 with an extensive 
property portfolio, Nicholas has the knowledge 
and technical skills (and recent and relevant 
financial experience) to lead this Committee. 
Nicholas will have the benefit of having been 
a member of the Audit Committee through 
the year-end process and, supported by his 
induction programme, I am confident this 
continuity will ensure a smooth transition. 
I hope that you find this review, and the 
report that follows, a helpful explanation of 
the work of the Committee during the year.

Accountability
Structure and operations 
The Audit Committee’s structure and 
operations, including its delegated 
responsibilities and authority, are governed  
by terms of reference which are reviewed 
annually and approved by the Board. 
To maintain effective communication 
between all relevant parties, and in support  
of its activities, the Chief Executive, Chief 
Financial Officer, Director of Risk Management 
and Internal Audit, the partner and 
representatives of the Company’s external 
auditor, Ernst & Young LLP (EY), and other 
members of the senior finance team  
regularly attend Committee meetings. 
The Company Chairman and all Non-
executive Directors are invited to attend 
meetings when the Group’s external valuer, 
CBRE, makes property valuation presentations. 
The Committee has private sessions 
with the internal and external audit teams. 
In addition, the Committee Chairman has 
private and informal sessions with the audit 
teams and the valuer to ensure that open lines 
of communication exist in case they wish to 
raise any concerns outside of formal meetings. 
Nicholas Cadbury has participated in these 
meeting following his appointment as a Director 
in January 2017.
The Committee members collectively have 
a broad range of financial, commercial and 
property sector expertise that enables them 
to provide oversight of both financial and risk 
matters, and to advise the Board accordingly. 
Kevin O’Byrne and Nicholas Cadbury are the 
members determined by the Board as having 
recent and relevant financial experience for 
the purposes of satisfying the UK Corporate 
Governance Code. 
The Committee works to a structured 
programme of activities and meetings to 
coincide with key events around the Company’s 
financial calendar. Following each meeting, 
the Committee Chairman reports on the main 
discussion points and findings to the Board.
External auditor 
EY, as the external auditor, is engaged to 
conduct a statutory audit and express an 
opinion on the Company’s and the Group’s 
financial statements. Their audit includes a 
review and test of the systems of internal control 
which produce the information contained in 
the financial statements, and a review by EY of 
the asset valuation process and methodology 
using its own chartered surveyors (more details 
below), in each case to the extent necessary to 
express an audit opinion.
 — quarterly reports on investigated internal 
control issues significant to the Group 
 — quarterly reports on the Group’s risk 
register, including significant and 
emerging risks 
 — compliance by management concerning 
the operation of the business for which 
they are responsible 
 — the adequacy and effectiveness of 
the Group’s internal control and risk 
management systems. 
Internal audit 
 — the scope of the internal audit plan and 
resourcing requirements
 — the independence, appropriateness and 
effectiveness of internal audit.
External property valuation 
 — the quality and appropriateness of 
the half-yearly and full year external 
valuation of the Group’s property 
portfolio, together with an assessment 
of the methodology applied
 — the independence and effectiveness of 
the external valuer. 
Other 
 — the Committee’s terms of reference  
and performance effectiveness
 — compliance with the Code and the 
Group’s regulatory and legislative 
environment. 
Significant financial matters 
During the year, the Committee considered 
the appropriateness of significant financial 
matters made in connection with the 
financial statements as set out on pages 
72 and 74.
Audit Committee activity
The key areas of Committee activity during 
the year included the planning, monitoring, 
reviewing and approving of the following:
Financial reporting 
 — the quality, appropriateness and  
integrity of the half-yearly and full  
year financial statements 
 — the information, underlying assumptions 
and stress test analysis presented in 
support of Going Concern and the 
Viability Statement 
 — the consistency and appropriateness  
of the financial control and  
reporting environment 
 — the dividend policy and the payment 
of dividends, with due regard to the 
Company’s REIT status 
 — the fair, balanced and understandable 
assessment of the Annual Report (and 
any other financial statements such  
as the half-yearly statement). 
External audit 
 — the scope of the external audit plan 
 — the independence and objectivity of EY 
 — the quality and effectiveness of EY’s 
audit services 
 — the level of fees paid to EY in accordance 
with the policy for the provision of  
non-audit services 
 — EY’s reappointment to office as  
external auditor. 
Risk management and  
internal control 
 — the scope of the internal control and risk 
management programme
 — the results of internal audit reviews 
and the progress made against agreed 
management actions  Governance
71 Landsec Annual Report 2017
Effectiveness of the external audit 
Following the issue of the Company’s Annual 
Report, the Director of Risk Management 
and Internal Audit conducts a performance 
evaluation and effectiveness review of the 
external audit. This is conducted against 
structured guidelines in consultation with 
the Executive Directors and members of the 
senior finance team and with due regard to 
the latest Audit Quality Inspection Report on 
EY issued by the Financial Reporting Council 
(FRC). This year’s review will again include an 
audit quality assessment based on the new 
Practice Aid guidelines also issued by the FRC. 
The Committee Chairman meets privately 
with the audit engagement partner before the 
Committee considers the results of the review. 
During the year, an Audit Quality Review 
Team (AQRT) from the FRC undertook an 
inspection of EY’s audit of the Group’s financial 
statements for the year ended 31 March 
2016. The report did not give the Committee 
any concerns over the quality, objectivity or 
independence of the audit. 
EY successfully completed their audit for 
the financial year. The Committee’s preliminary 
view is that, in line with the conclusions from 
last year’s performance review, EY had again 
performed their audit services effectively, 
efficiently and to a high standard. Areas 
identified for development will be shared with 
them for inclusion in their audit and service 
delivery plans going forward.
Audit plan 
In respect of the audit for the financial year 
under review, EY presented their proposed 
audit plan (prepared in consultation with 
senior management and the Director of Risk 
Management and Internal Audit) to the 
Committee for consideration and approval. 
The objective was to ensure that their work 
remained aligned to the Group’s structure and 
strategy. The audit plan was again risk and 
materiality focused, challenge based and 
designed to provide valuable insights beyond 
the audit.
Objectivity and independence 
The Committee is responsible for monitoring 
and reviewing the objectivity and independence 
of the external auditor. In undertaking its annual 
assessment, the Committee has reviewed: 
 — the confirmation from EY that they maintain 
appropriate internal safeguards in line with 
applicable professional standards 
 — the mitigation actions taken by the Company 
in seeking to safeguard EY’s independent 
status, including the operation of policies 
designed to regulate the amount of non-
audit services provided by EY and the 
employment of former EY employees 
 — the tenure of the audit engagement partner 
(not being greater than five years) 
 — the internal performance and effectiveness 
review of EY referred to above
 — the outcome of the independent AQRT  
review referred to above.
Taking the above review into account, the 
Committee concluded that EY remained 
objective and independent in their role as 
external auditor. 
Audit tendering 
EY were first appointed to the office of auditor, 
following a competitive tender process, in 
respect of the 2013/14 financial year. Having 
undertaken such a process, the Company has 
complied with The Statutory Audit Services 
for Large Companies Market Investigation 
(Mandatory Use of Competitive Processes 
and Audit Committee Responsibilities) Order 
2014 (Article 7.1), published by the CMA on 
26 September 2014. 
Under current regulations, the Company 
will be required to retender the audit by no later 
than the 2023/24 financial year. However, the 
Committee proposes to review the situation at 
the same time as the current audit engagement 
partner, Eamonn McGrath, is due to rotate. 
Mr McGrath has held the role of the Company’s 
audit engagement partner for four years and 
will relinquish this position during the 2018/19 
financial year and following completion of 
the 2017/18 financial statements. There are 
no contractual restrictions in relation to the 
Company’s choice of external auditor. 
On the recommendation of the Audit 
Committee, the Board is proposing a resolution 
at this year’s Annual General Meeting that EY 
be reappointed to office for a further year.
Audit fee
The Committee reviewed the level of fees 
payable to EY for audit services as the terms 
agreed for the original engagement had expired. 
It was agreed that the audit fees payable to EY 
for the audit and half year review for 2016/17 
would be £800,000 (up from £793,000 in 
2015/16), with an increase of £25,000 in each 
of the two following financial years subject to 
business and audit requirements remaining 
consistent year on year.
Non-audit services 
To help safeguard EY’s objectivity and 
independence, the Company operates a 
non-audit services policy which sets out the 
circumstances and financial limits within which 
they may be permitted to provide certain 
non-audit services (such as assurance work) 
on which they will not be required to provide 
an audit opinion.
The Committee monitors compliance with 
the policy including the prior approvals required 
for non-audit services which are as follows:

Details of the fees charged by EY during the 
year can be found in note 8 to the financial 
statements. Total fees for non-audit services, 
including the half year review and other 
assurance related services, amounted to 
£248,000. This sum represented 42% of the 
total Group audit fees, and 34% of the total 
audit fees payable by the Group to EY during 
the year (including the audit of its joint 
ventures). No non-audit fees were approved 
or paid on a contingent basis. 72 Landsec Annual Report 2017
External valuations and valuers 
The valuation of the Group’s property 
portfolio, including properties held within the 
development programme and in joint ventures, 
is undertaken by independent external valuers. 
The Group provides input, such as source data, 
and support to the valuation process. CBRE 
have been the Company’s principal valuer 
since September 2015. The valuation helps to 
determine a significant part of the Group’s net 
asset value, reported performance and Senior 
Management remuneration. Accordingly, the 
scrutiny of each valuation, and the valuer’s 
independence, objectivity and effectiveness, 
represents such an important part of the 
Committee’s work. 
Valuations for the full and half year were 
presented to the Committee by CBRE. These 
were reviewed and challenged by management 
and the Committee, with reference to CBRE’s 
approach, methodology, valuation basis and 
underlying property and market assumptions. 
Other Non-executive Directors attended the 
final presentation. The Committee Chairman 
and Nicholas Cadbury also met separately 
with CBRE. 
Additionally, CBRE met with EY and 
exchanged information independently of 
management. EY has experienced chartered 
surveyors on its team who consider the valuer’s 
qualifications and assess and challenge 
the valuation approach, assumptions and 
judgements made by them. Their audit 
procedures are targeted at addressing the risks 
in respect of the valuations and the potential 
for any undue management influence in arriving 
at them. This year, EY identified 36 properties 
(comprising 69% of the portfolio by valuation) 
for substantive review by its valuation experts 
primarily on the basis of their value, type, risk 
profile and location. EY performed site visits for 
a sample of assets and completed analytical 
reviews over the input data for the valuations, 
comparing this to market data. The Committee 
reviewed their findings. 
An internal evaluation of CBRE’s 
performance and effectiveness will be 
conducted after the year-end results are 
finalised (and annually thereafter) with the 
results reported on the following year. 
A fixed-fee arrangement (subject to 
adjustment for acquisitions and disposals) is in 
place with CBRE for the valuation of the Group’s 
properties and, given the importance of their 
work, we have disclosed the fees paid to them 
in note 9 to the financial statements. The total 
valuation fees paid by the Company to CBRE 
during the year represented less than 5% of 
their total fee income for the year.
Significant financial matters 
The Committee reviewed two significant 
financial matters in connection with the 
financial statements, namely the valuation 
of the Group’s property portfolio and revenue 
recognition. Further details are set out in table 
33 on page 74. 
These items were considered to be 
significant taking into account the level of 
materiality and the degree of judgement 
exercised by management and, in respect of the 
valuation, the external valuer. The Committee 
discussed these with both parties, as well as EY. 
In addition, the Committee considered, took 
action and made onward recommendations to 
the Board, as appropriate, in respect of other 
key matters including the Viability Statement, 
the Going Concern basis on which the financial 
statements are prepared, accounting for 
property acquisitions and disposals, bond buy-
back and new issue, maintenance of the Group’s 
REIT status and other specific areas of individual 
property and audit focus. 
The Committee was satisfied that all issues 
had been fully and adequately addressed, 
that the judgements made were reasonable 
and appropriate and had been reviewed 
and debated with the external auditor 
who concurred with the approach taken 
by management.
Risk management framework 
The Board is responsible for determining both 
the nature and extent of the Group’s risk 
management framework and the risk appetite 
that is acceptable in seeking to achieve its 
strategic objectives. The framework and 
the ongoing process in place for identifying, 
evaluating and managing the principal risks 
faced by the Group are described on pages  
42-45. These are regularly reviewed by 
the Board.
Primary responsibility for operation of 
the Company’s internal control and risk 
management systems, which extend to include 
financial, operational and compliance controls 
(and accord with the FRC’s 2014 ‘Guidance on 
Risk Management, Internal Control and Related 
Financial and Business Reporting’), has been 
delegated to management. These systems 
have been designed to manage, rather than 
eliminate, the risk of failure to achieve the 
Group’s business goals and can provide only 
reasonable, not absolute, assurance against 
material misstatement or loss. 
During the year, the Committee commissioned 
an external report to be carried out on the 
Company’s risk management framework and 
the approach to risk. No major weaknesses were 
identified but a number of recommendations 
were suggested and considered by the 
Committee. These will be implemented in the 
coming year.
Internal control 
The key elements of the Group’s internal control 
are as follows: 
 — an established organisation structure with 
clear lines of responsibility, approval levels 
and delegated authorities 
 — a disciplined management and committee 
structure which facilitates regular 
performance review and decision-making 
 — a comprehensive strategic review and annual 
planning process 
 — a robust budgeting, forecasting and financial 
reporting process 
 — various policies, procedures and guidelines 
underpinning the development, asset 
management, financing and main operations 
of the business, together with professional 
services support including legal, human 
resources, information services, tax, company 
secretarial and health, safety and security 
 — a compliance certification process from 
management conducted in relation to the 
half-yearly and full year results, and business 
activities generally 
 — a quarterly self-certification by management 
confirming that key internal controls within 
their area of responsibility have been 
operating effectively 
 — a risk management and internal audit 
function whose work spans the whole Group 
 — a focused post-acquisition review and 
integration programme to ensure the 
Group’s governance, procedures, standards 
and control environment are implemented 
effectively and on time
 — a financial and property information 
management system. Governance
73 Landsec Annual Report 2017
Risk management 
Under the overall supervision of the Committee, 
there are several sub-committees and work 
groups that oversee and manage day-to-
day risk within the business. The Group has 
a Director of Risk Management and Internal 
Audit (with a direct reporting line to the 
Audit Committee Chairman) who provides 
regular oversight of risk matters, evaluates 
emerging risks that may affect the business 
and monitors compliance to ensure that any 
mitigating actions are properly managed and 
completed. The Committee, in consultation 
with management, agrees the annual work 
plan (including any assistance that may be 
required from external specialists) of the risk 
management and internal audit function to 
ensure alignment with the needs of the business 
and compliance with its governance charter. 
Additionally, the Committee receives and 
discusses on a quarterly basis: 
 — the Group’s risk register, including significant 
and emerging risks, and how exposures have 
changed during the period 
 — summary reports and progress against 
agreed actions from internal audit on 
their review of the effectiveness of various 
elements of the internal control system 
maintained by the Group.
Effectiveness 
The Board has undertaken a robust assessment 
of the principal risks faced by the Group, 
including those that could threaten the business 
model, future performance, solvency or liquidity. 
Assisted by the Committee, the Board also 
reviewed the effectiveness of the systems 
of internal control and risk management 
in place throughout the year and up to the 
date of this report. This took into account the 
valuable assurance work undertaken by the 
risk management and internal audit function 
(which is supplemented by external specialist 
resource as necessary) and the relevant process, 
controls and testing work undertaken by EY 
as part of their half-yearly review and full 
year audit. No weaknesses or control failures 
significant to the Group were identified.  
Where areas for improvement were identified, 
new procedures have been introduced to 
strengthen the controls and will themselves  
be subject to regular review as part of the 
ongoing assurance process.
Fair, balanced and understandable 
The Committee applied this year the same 
due diligence approach adopted in previous 
years in order to assess one of the key Code 
requirements in respect of the Annual Report. 
This included the establishment of an editorial 
team who were responsible for preparing, 
compiling and verifying the content and, 
through regular review meetings with the 
Executive Directors, ensuring that consistent 
reporting and appropriate links existed between 
key messages and sections of the Annual 
Report. A specific paper was presented to the 
Committee (and the Board) to assist in its 
challenge and testing of a fair, balanced and 
understandable assessment.
Taking the above into account, together 
with the views expressed by EY, the Committee 
recommended, and in turn the Board confirmed, 
that the 2017 Annual Report, taken as a 
whole, is fair, balanced and understandable 
and provides the necessary information for 
shareholders to assess the Company’s position, 
performance, business model and strategy. 
Whistleblowing policy 
The Committee reviews the Group’s 
arrangements, incorporated within a specific 
policy, which allow employees to report concerns 
about suspected impropriety or wrongdoing 
(whether financial or otherwise) within the 
Group on a confidential basis, and anonymously 
if preferred. These include an independent third-
party reporting facility comprising a telephone 
hotline and an online process. Any matters 
reported are investigated by the Company 
Secretary and escalated to the Committee, 
as appropriate. During the year, there were no 
whistleblowing incidents reported. 
The Company runs a whistleblowing 
awareness campaign every year and the 
arrangements also form part of the induction 
programme for new employees. The policy 
and facilities have been extended to cover 
key suppliers and the requirements of the 
new legislation covering slavery and human 
trafficking reporting. 
Bribery and corruption policy 
The Board has a zero tolerance policy for bribery 
and corruption of any sort. The Company, in 
operating the policy, gives regular training to 
staff on the procedures, highlighting areas of 
vulnerability. New employees are required to 
complete an online training module when they 
join. Our principal suppliers are required to have 
similar policies and practices in place within 
their own businesses. 74 Landsec Annual Report 2017
Significant financial matters considered How the Committee addressed the matters Table 33
Valuation of the Group’s property portfolio 
(including properties held within the 
development programme and in joint 
arrangements)
The valuation of the Group’s property portfolio is 
a major determinant of the Group’s performance 
and drives an element of the variable remuneration 
for senior management. Although the portfolio 
valuation is conducted externally by an 
independent valuer, the nature of the valuation 
estimates is inherently subjective and requires the 
making of significant judgements and assumptions 
by management and the valuer.
Significant assumptions and judgements made by 
the valuer in determining valuations may include 
the appropriate yield (based on recent market 
evidence), changes to market rents (ERVs), what 
will occur at the end of each lease, the level 
of non-recoverable costs and alternative uses. 
Development valuations also include assumptions 
around costs to complete the development, the 
level of letting at completion, incentives, lease 
terms and the length of time space remains void.
The Audit Committee adopts a formal approach 
by which the valuation process, methodology, 
assumptions and outcomes are reviewed and 
robustly challenged. This includes separate review 
and scrutiny by management, the Committee 
Chairman and the Committee itself. The Group 
uses CBRE, a leading firm in the UK property 
market, as its principal valuer. It also includes EY 
as the external auditor which is assisted by its own 
specialist team of chartered surveyors who are 
familiar with the valuation approach and the UK 
property market. 
EY met with CBRE separately from management 
and their remit extends to investigating and 
confirming that no undue influence has been 
exerted by management in relation to the external 
valuer arriving at its valuations.
CBRE submits its valuation report to the 
Committee as part of the half-yearly and full 
year results process. They were asked to attend 
and present their report to the Board and to 
highlight any significant judgements made or 
disagreements which existed between themselves 
and management. There were none.
The valuer proposed changes to the values  
of our properties and developments during  
the year, which were discussed by the Committee 
in detail and accepted. 
Based on the degree of oversight and challenge 
applied to the valuation process, the Committee 
concluded that the valuations had each been 
conducted appropriately, independently and in 
accordance with the valuer’s professional standards.
Revenue recognition 
Certain transactions require management to make 
judgements as to whether and to what extent they 
should be recognised as revenue in the year. Market 
expectations and revenue profit based targets may 
place pressure on management to distort revenue 
recognition. This may result in overstatement or 
deferral of revenues to assist in meeting current or 
future targets or expectations.
The Committee and EY considered the main 
areas of judgement exercised by management 
in accounting for matters related to revenue 
recognition, including timing and treatment of 
rents, incentives, surrender premia and other 
property related revenue. 
EY reviewed and tested individual transactions on 
a sample basis to ensure there was a contractual 
relationship and consistency of accounting 
treatment between last year and this year. 
It performed data analytics over the whole 
population of leases in the Group’s portfolio, 
analysing data held in the Group’s document 
and property management system. 
In its assessment, the Committee, in consultation 
with EY, considered all relevant facts, challenged 
the recoverability of occupier incentives, the 
options that management had in terms of 
accounting treatment and the appropriateness 
of the judgements made by management. These 
matters had themselves been the subject of prior 
discussion between EY and management. 
The Committee, having consulted with EY, 
concurred with the judgements made by 
management and were satisfied that the 
revenue reported for the year had been 
appropriately recognised.
The above description of the significant financial 
matters should be read in conjunction with the 
Independent Auditor’s Report on pages 97-102 
and the significant accounting policies disclosed 
in the notes to the financial statements. 
Further details on significant accounting 
judgements and key estimations of uncertainty 
can be found in note 2 to the financial 
statements on page 108. Governance

Investor 
relations
Approach to investor relations
The Board is committed to maintaining 
an open dialogue with shareholders and 
recognises the importance of that relationship 
in the governance process. The Chairman, 
supported by the Executive Directors, has 
overall responsibility for ensuring effective 
communication with shareholders.
The Company has a comprehensive 
investor relations programme (designed for 
institutional investors, private shareholders 
and debt investors) which aims to help existing 
and potential investors understand the 
Group’s business, strategy and performance. 
Shareholder feedback is provided to the Board 
to ensure that they understand the objectives 
and views of major investors. 
The Company approaches its debt investor 
relations on a partnership basis, ensuring that 
any feedback is considered and the Company 
takes into account best practice guidance from 
the Investment Association.
During the year, the programme of investor 
events included:
Institutional shareholders’ programme
Meetings with principal shareholders
 — The Executive Directors had meetings with 
shareholders representing more than half 
the register by value during the year 
 — The Chairman maintained contact with 
principal shareholders and undertook her 
usual biennial investor roadshows in the UK 
and the Netherlands 
 — The geographic spread of the programme 
covered Europe, North America, South Africa 
and the Far East
 — The Senior Independent Director, and other 
Non-executive Directors, were available to 
meet with shareholders 
 — Institutional shareholders were invited to 
attend the Company’s full year and half-
yearly results presentations. 
Investor conference
 — The investor conference is held annually and 
focuses on the Retail and London portfolios 
in alternate years. This year, the conference 
was held in Victoria, SW1, and focused on the 
London Portfolio with senior management 
presenting updates on all aspects of its 
business. The day included tours of five of our 
buildings in Victoria including a visit to Nova. 
The conference also provided an opportunity 
for attendees to meet the management 
teams in the business
 — The presentations and an audio recording of 
the conference were made available on the 
corporate website to enable non-attendees  
to access the information provided.
Investor tours and presentations 
 — In addition to our annual investor conference, 
we hosted various presentations and tours 
of some of our major assets in the Retail 
and London portfolios. These tours were 
conducted at Bluewater, Kent, Trinity Leeds, 
White Rose, Leeds, Westgate Oxford, key 
properties in Victoria, SW1, and 20 Fenchurch 
Street, EC3
 — We conducted 12 sales team meetings 
during the year which provided the Executive 
Directors with the opportunity to present 
our strategy and performance directly to the 
sales teams of the major investment banks.
Industry conferences
 — Industry conferences provide Executive 
Directors with a chance to meet a large 
number of investors on a formal and 
informal basis. Conferences attended this 
year included the UBS Global Property, 
JP Morgan and Bank of America Merrill Lynch 
conferences in London, the Bank of America 
Merrill Lynch conference in New York, the 
Kempen conferences in Amsterdam and 
New York and the Citi Conference in Miami. 
Other initiatives
 — The Chairman and Chief Executive held a 
dinner for the senior heads of equities from 
UK institutions.
Private shareholders’ programme

feedback to and communicate with the 
Directors through the Company Secretary. 
During the year they were also able to meet 
Directors at the United Kingdom Shareholders’ 
Association meeting and at the Annual 
General Meeting.
Debt investors’ programme
Credit side institutional investors 
and analysts
 — Our treasury team held non-deal specific 
meetings with credit side institutional 
investors and analysts after the half year  
and full year results
 — In addition, the team met with around 40 
accounts as part of the deal roadshow for 
the bond tender and new issue exercise in 
January/February of this year.
Banks
 — Regular dialogue is maintained with our key 
relationship banks, including at least bi-
annual meetings with our treasury team and 
in-house dinners hosted by the Executive and 
Non-executive Directors
 — Our treasury team also actively engaged with 
potential lenders.
Credit rating agencies
 — During the year, business and financial 
updates were provided by our treasury team 
and senior management to Standard & 
Poor’s, Fitch Ratings and Moody’s
 — Further information on our debt investors can 
be found at: www.landsec.com/investors.
Annual General Meeting (AGM)
The 2016 AGM provided all shareholders with 
an opportunity to question the Board and 
the Chairmen of each Board Committee on 
matters put to the meeting, including the 
Annual Report. Shareholders who attended 
the AGM received a strategic progress update 
from the Chairman and a presentation from 
the Chief Executive on the business activities 
and performance of the Group over the 
preceding year. The results of voting at general 
meetings are published on the Company’s 
website: www.landsec.com/investors.
Independent feedback on investor relations
During the year, the Board commissioned Rivel, 
an independent adviser, to conduct an investor 
audit of investor perceptions of the Company, 
its management, strategy, governance and 
the investor relations programme. An investor 
relations audit usually takes place every 
two years. 
Rivel interviewed over 50 investors based 
in the UK, Europe and North America to obtain 
their views on management and business 
performance. The results were presented to 
the Board with suggestions and improvements 
being taken forward by management. 
The perception study found that investors 
have a very high degree of confidence in 
management and there was broad support 
for the Company’s strategy.
The investor relations department also 
received feedback from analysts and investors 
during the year through the Group’s corporate 
advisers. The Company Secretary also received 
feedback on governance matters directly 
from investors and shareholder bodies. The 
information was shared with the Board to 
help members develop their understanding 
of shareholders’ needs and expectations.
Other disclosures
Other disclosures required by paragraph 7.2.6 
of the Disclosure and Transparency Rules and 
the Companies Act 2006 are set out in the 
Directors’ Report on pages 92-94.
The Governance report was approved by 
the Board on 17 May 2017.

Directors’ 
Remuneration 
Report – 
Chairman’s 
Annual 
Statement
Dear Shareholder,
I am pleased to introduce the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report for the year.
The political and economic uncertainty 
to which I alluded last year has certainly 
accelerated in some unexpected ways, 
beginning with the UK’s decision to leave the 
European Union. Although the UK economy 
has continued to perform well overall, the 
property industry has been impacted by 
wavering consumer and business confidence. 
We believe our decision to complete speculative 
development earlier than others remains the 
right one. The priorities over the past year have 
been to lengthen lease terms in London offices, 
and to lease up our development programme, 
including Westgate Oxford, due to open in 
October. Behind the scenes, we have also been 
active in ensuring that the business is in the 
best possible position – financially, culturally, 
reputationally and capability-wise – to take 
advantage of new opportunities to deliver 
shareholder value.
As I have highlighted previously, the 
remuneration outcomes for the executives at 
Landsec are largely driven by outperformance 
versus our peers and do not always reflect our 
absolute performance. For Total Property  
Return, our performance is compared to 
IPD, a widely-used industry benchmark over 
both a one year and three year period, for 
the calculation of bonus and LTIP outturns 
respectively. Over one year, we estimate 
that we will have slightly underperformed 
the benchmark which now encompasses all 
March-valued properties within IPD. Over a 
three year period, where we are still measured 
against a sector weighted index of the IPD 
Quarterly Universe, I am pleased to say we have 
outperformed the benchmark. To have achieved 
this while putting the business on such a strong 
financial footing is a very good performance. 
In terms of Total Shareholder Return, we are 
measured over a three year period and were 
disappointed not to outperform our peer group.

77 Landsec Annual Report 2017
Our relative share price has been impacted by a 
number of factors including sentiment towards 
our market sectors, particularly London, and  
no exposure to continental Europe at a time  
of sterling devaluation. 
Following positive feedback from 
shareholders, we have chosen to lay out the 
report in a very similar way to last year.  
The full details of the Remuneration Policy, 
approved by shareholders in 2015, are contained 
in the back section of the Annual Report, 
on pages 175 to 179. For ease of reference, a 
summary of the proposed implementation of 
the policy for 2017/18 is included within the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report on page 90.  
We have included the key information, including 
an “at a glance” summary of the outturns for 
the year, immediately following my statement.
More detail on remuneration  
outcomes for the year
The annual bonus for the year was slightly 
above target for Executive Directors, but below 
last year’s outturn. The performance can be 
summarised as follows:
 — As I mentioned above, our measure of Total 
Property Return now uses a broader and 
unweighted IPD benchmark of all March-
valued properties. The benchmark was not 
available at the time of writing, but we 
expect to slightly underperform, resulting in 
no payment from this element of the bonus.
 — The revenue profit performance was again 
very strong, significantly above our threshold 
set in 2015. This reflects increased rents from 
our successful development programme and 
lower interest costs, more than outweighing 
rent lost through disposals last year. There 
has also been strong ongoing discipline 
around the management of costs. This 
element of the plan paid out in full.
 — Performance against the specific business 
objectives was more mixed. Retail had a 
strong performance, with high demand for 
space at Westgate Oxford, and the successful 
pre-letting of the extension to White Rose, 
Leeds as particular highlights. In London, 
where the impact of current political and 
economic uncertainty on demand has been 
more keenly felt, the ambitious development 
letting targets have been challenging to 
meet. Other corporate objectives have 
focused on evolving the culture through the 
office move and pressing ahead with our 
ambitious sustainability agenda, and these 
have largely been met. 
When this performance was combined with 
the strong performance against their individual 
objectives, the total bonus pay-out was 88.1% 
of salary for Robert Noel (58.7% of maximum) 
and 86.1% for Martin Greenslade (57.4% of 
maximum), both lower than last year.
Turning to the Long-Term Incentive Plan, 
which is for performance over the three years to 
31 March 2017, the outturn is as follows:
 — Our Total Property Return of 12.7% per 
annum over the three years outperformed 
that of our benchmark, the sector-weighted 
IPD Quarterly Universe, which was 11.5% per 
annum. As a result, this element vests in full.
 — However, our Total Shareholder Return over 
the same period was 9.2%, versus 16.2% for 
the comparator group. This element of the 
LTIP , therefore, does not vest. 
Therefore, in total, 50% of the 2014 awards  
will vest. 
Looking forward
Later this year we will be consulting 
with shareholder representatives on our 
Remuneration Policy, in preparation for the 
binding vote at next year’s AGM. Executive  
pay is an area that is attracting a great 
deal of focus from many quarters, including 
government. As ever, we are very keen to work 
within the spirit of stakeholder sentiment, while 
ensuring that any proposals continue to drive 
the right behaviours from our executives, who 
remain completely focused on the delivery of 
our stated goal – “To outperform our peer group 
in terms of total shareholder return through 
the property cycles” .
I look forward to discussions with some of 
you in the coming year.

Annual  
Report on  
Remuneration
The Annual Report on Remuneration describes 
how the Directors’ Remuneration Policy (“The 
Policy”), approved by shareholders at the Annual 
General Meeting in July 2015, has been applied 
in the financial year ended 31 March 2017, 
and how it will be applied in the financial year 
commenced 1 April 2017.
During the course of 2016/17, the 
Remuneration Committee was engaged in a 
number of key matters, including:
 — Determining salary increases for the 
Executive Directors and Executive Committee 
members, together with the overall level of 
salary increases for employees across  
the Group
 — Setting and subsequently reviewing the 
outcomes for corporate, business unit and 
personal targets under the annual bonus 
scheme for Executive Directors and Executive 
Committee members

1. Basic salary is stated as a per annum figure based on current annual salary at the end of 2016/17. Actual salaries paid in the year were £766,156 (Robert Noel) and £498,724  
(Martin Greenslade) .
2. Benefits consist of a car allowance, private medical insurance, income protection and life assurance premiums.
3. The pension allowance shown is a cash emolument of 25% of base salary. 
4. The annual bonus for 2015/16 was estimated in last year’s report and therefore the amounts for the bonus deferred into shares have been adjusted to reflect actual values. The impact of  
the adjustment was a reduction of £3,527 for Robert Noel and a reduction of £2,296 for Martin Greenslade.
5. The long-term incentives for 2016/17 have been calculated using a share price of £10.35 (which is the three-month average to 31 March 2017) . The long-term incentives vesting in 2015/16  
were estimated in last year’s report, so have been adjusted to reflect actual values. The impact of the adjustment was a reduction of £31,076 for Robert Noel and a reduction of £21,021  
for Martin Greenslade.

1.   Remuneration outcomes for Directors during the year
In this section, we explain the pay outcomes for Directors in relation to the financial year ended 31 March 2017. Table 47 shows the payments we expect 
to make and then tables 49 and 50 give more detail on how we have measured the performance outcomes with respect to the annual bonus and LTIP 
in the context of value created for shareholders.
1.1 Directors’ emoluments (Audited)
The basis of disclosure in the table below is on an ‘accruals’ basis. This means that the annual bonus column includes the amount that will be paid 
in June 2017 in connection with performance achieved in the financial year ended 31 March 2017. It should be noted that the annual bonus figure 
has been estimated for the purposes of the table, as final data on the Company’s Total Property Return versus the peer group using the benchmark 
(i.e. all March-valued properties) will not be available until after the date of this report’s publication. The estimate has been derived from the most up-
to-date performance information available, and any payment made will be based on the final performance data when received and verified. 
The values shown for the 2014 LTIP awards vesting for the three year performance period ended 31 March 2017 are based on estimated 
achievements against the performance measures and calculated using the average share price for the quarter then ended. The actual share price is  
not known at the time of writing as the awards do not formally vest until July 2017. 
 — Monitoring Directors’ compliance with the 
Company’s share ownership guidelines
 — Monitoring developments in stakeholder 
sentiment on executive pay and corporate 
governance more generally, including 
participating in consultation exercises  
where appropriate.

1.2 Annual bonus outturn
In the year under review, each Executive Director had the potential to receive a maximum annual bonus of up to 150% of base salary. Of this, 130% was 
dependent on meeting Group targets and 20% dependent on meeting personal targets. All targets were set at the beginning of the year. The following 
table confirms the targets and their respective outcomes. The on-target bonus expectation is 75% of salary.

comprising all March-valued properties (excluding 
Landsec). Total benchmark value c. £170bn.
 39.0 — The Group’s Total Property Return

 for the year was 3.9%, an under-
performance of 0.7% versus the estimated IPD benchmark 
 — Therefore, none of this element is likely to pay out.

Key business targets
Development lettings – specific targets were set for both 
the London and Retail portfolios, with a focus on the 
London developments and Westgate Oxford (opening 
in 2017) and the extension of White Rose, Leeds. Net 
effective, rather than headline, rents were used as the 
key measure of performance. 
18.2 — The outturn is calculated on the basis of a threshold of £23.4m, and a 
maximum of £34.0m 
 — Both the Retail lettings targets, at Oxford and Leeds, were exceeded, 
while London lettings achieved threshold levels. £28m was achieved  
in total.
 — This element of the bonus therefore paid out at 66.4% of the maximum.
12.1
Residential sales – specific targets were set for the 
Victoria residential developments.
4.2 — The outturn is calculated on the basis of a threshold of £65m. 
Achievement is calculated on a straight-line basis from threshold to the 
maximum of £102m
 — The Group secured relevant sales of £51m, which was below threshold
 — This element of the bonus therefore was not paid.
0.0
Project budgets – specific aggregate and individual 
budget targets were set for projects in both London and 
Retail (Nova, New Street Square, 20 Eastbourne Terrace 
and White Rose).
6.2 — Although three out of four of the named developments were completed 
to target budgets, one (Nova) was not
 — This element of the bonus therefore was not paid.
0.0
Customers – recognising the importance of creating a 
truly customer-focused culture, specific targets were 
set around the rollout of internal and external customer 
excellence programmes. An improvement to (already 
high) customer satisfaction scores was also sought.
7.8 — The proposed rollout of the internal customer excellence programme was 
delayed to coincide with the launch of the new Landsec brand in June 
 — However, a programme of external customer engagement activities has 
been delivered, and customer satisfaction scores in London and Retail 
were maintained
 — This element of the bonus therefore paid out at 66.6% of the maximum.
5.2
People – ensuring that the office move to Victoria was 
maximised as an opportunity to embed the purpose, 
vision and values and create a step change in a more 
collaborative and innovative culture, to be measured 
through movement in “before” and “after” employee 
surveys versus a recognised external benchmark.
5.2 — The relevant survey scores improved by 35%

5.2 — In order to achieve maximum payout, three levels of sustainability 
training, including a core mandatory module completed by at least 95% 
of employees, needed to be delivered. In addition, quantifiable energy 
reduction initiatives should be identified for implementation in two thirds 
of our most energy-intensive sites

1.3 Long-Term Incentive Plan and Matching Share Plan outturns
The table below summarises how we have assessed our LTIP performance achievement over the three years to 31 March 2017. Awards granted in 2014 
under the LTIP for this period are subject to performance conditions that measure and compare the Group’s relative performance against its peers in 
terms of Total Property Return (TPR) and Total Shareholder Return (TSR), with each measure representing 50% of the total award. Please see table 61 
for more detail on how vesting levels are determined. 
The performance calculation for awards granted in 2014 and vesting in 2017 are illustrated below:

For awards granted in 2015, the Group’s performance over the two years to 31 March 2017 would, if sustained over the three year period to  
31 March 2018, result in 0% of the LTIP share awards vesting. For awards granted in 2016, performance over the one year period to 31 March 2017  
would, if sustained over the second and third years of the period to 31 March 2019, result in 22.4% of the LTIP share awards vesting. Governance

3. Application of Policy for 2016/17
3.1  Executive Directors’ base salaries
Having conducted a detailed benchmarking exercise of both the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer roles in 2015, the Committee 
concluded that no formal exercise was necessary this year, in line with emerging best practice. It has therefore awarded both Executive Directors a base 
salary increase of 2%. This is in line with the average increase received by employees across the Group, excluding promotions and exceptional increases. 
Accordingly, the following salary increases will take effect from 1 June 2017:

The fees for Non-executive Directors were reviewed In December 2015 following a market benchmarking exercise, and took effect from 1 April 2016.  
They have remained unchanged for 2016/17. When Nicholas Cadbury was appointed to the Board on 1 January 2017, he received the published base  
fee of £70,000 per annum.

4. Comparison of Chief Executive pay to Total Shareholder Return
The following graph illustrates the performance of the Company measured by Total Shareholder Return (share price growth plus dividends paid) against 
a ‘broad equity market index’ over a period of eight years. As the Company is a constituent of the FTSE 350 Real Estate Index, this is considered to be 
the most appropriate benchmark for the purposes of the graph. An additional line to illustrate the Company’s performance compared with the FTSE 100 
Index over the previous eight years is also included.
Adjacent to this chart is a table showing how the ‘single figure’ of total remuneration for the Chief Executive has moved over the same period. 
It should be noted that Robert Noel became Chief Executive in March 2012.

1. Under the policy covering the years 2010–2012 shown in the table, bonus arrangements for Executive Directors comprised three elements: an annual bonus with a maximum potential of 100% of 
basic salary, a discretionary bonus with a maximum potential of 50% of basic salary and an additional bonus with a maximum potential of 200% of salary. The first two elements were subject 
to an overall aggregate cap of 130% of basic salary, with the overall amount of the three elements capped at 300% of basic salary. 2012: 73.4% of the maximum opportunity was awarded under 
annual bonus with no awards made under the discretionary bonus or additional bonus. 2011: 94.5% of the maximum opportunity was awarded under the annual bonus, discretionary bonus of 60% 
of the maximum opportunity with no awards made under the additional bonus. 2010: 77% of the maximum opportunity was awarded under the annual bonus, discretionary bonus of 50% of the

5. The context of pay in Landsec
5.1  Pay across the Group
a. Senior Management
During the year under review, bonuses (including discretionary bonuses) for our 16 most senior employees (excluding the Executive Directors) ranged 
from 37.6% to 74.5% of salary (2016: 40.1% to 114.2%). The average bonus was 55.6% of salary (2016: 67.0%). The LTIP and MSP awards made to Senior 
Management vested on the same basis as the awards made to Executive Directors.
b. All other employees
The average pay increase for all employees, including the Executive Directors, was 2.0%. Including salary adjustments and promotions for employees 
below the Board, this rose to 2.4%. The ratio of the salary of the Chief Executive to the average salary across the Group (excluding Directors) was  
13:1 (£768,668:£58,683).

2. See note 11 to the financial statements.
6. Dilution
Awards granted under the Company’s long-term incentive arrangements, which cover those made under the LTIP , MSP , Deferred Share Bonus Plan and 
the Executive Share Option Plan are satisfied through the funding of an Employee Benefit Trust (administered by an external trustee) which acquires 
existing Land Securities Group PLC shares in the market. The Employee Benefit Trust held 792,556 shares at 31 March 2017.
The exercise of share options under the Savings Related Share Option Scheme, which is open to all employees who have completed more than one 
month’s service with the Group, can be satisfied by the allotment of newly issued shares. At 31 March 2017, the total number of shares which could be 
allotted under this Scheme was 354,783 shares, which represents significantly less than 1% of the issued share capital of the Company.
7. Remuneration Committee meetings
The Committee met four times over the course of the year, and all of the members attended all meetings. Simon Palley chaired the Committee, and 
the other members during the year were Dame Alison Carnwath, Edward Bonham Carter and Cressida Hogg. The Committee meetings were also 
attended by the Chief Executive, the Group Human Resources Director, and the Group General Counsel and Company Secretary who acted as the 
Committee’s Secretary.
Over the course of the year, the Committee received advice on remuneration and ancillary legal matters from Aon Hewitt. It has also made use 
of various published surveys to help determine appropriate remuneration levels and relied on information and advice provided by the Group General 
Counsel and Company Secretary and the Group Human Resources Director. Aon Hewitt has voluntarily signed up to the Remuneration Consultants 
Group Code of Conduct. The Committee is satisfied that the advice it receives is independent and objective. Aside from some support in benchmarking 
roles below the Board for pay review purposes, Aon Hewitt has no other connection with the Group. For the financial year under review, it received fees 
of £76,290 in connection with its work for the Committee.

Summary  
of Directors’
Remuneration 
Policy
1. Approach to Policy
As stated in last year’s report, some revisions 
were made to the Company’s long-term 
incentive arrangements in 2015. The Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy (Policy) for Executive and 
Non-executive Directors was then put to a 
binding shareholder vote at the Annual General 
Meeting (AGM) on 23 July 2015, and received a 
98.8% vote in favour. It therefore took formal 
effect from that date, replacing the previous 
policy approved by shareholders at the 2014 
2. Application of the Policy in 2017/18
Policy element
Table 67
Application in 2017/18
Base salary 
Details on p175
The increase in current salaries for the Executive Directors will be 2%, in line with the increase to overall 
employee pay across the Group in 2017. Therefore, the new annual gross salaries will be £784,041 for 
Robert Noel and £510,367 for Martin Greenslade. These will be effective from 1 June 2017.
Benefits
Details on p175
No changes to the current benefit arrangements (which mainly covers annual holiday entitlement, car 
allowance, life assurance, private medical cover and income protection insurance) are proposed during 
the year.
Pension 
Details on p175
The 25% of base salary (gross) payment to each Executive Director by way of annual pension contribution 
will continue.
Annual bonus 
Details on p176
The maximum bonus potential for the Executive Directors will remain at 150% of salary. No changes are 
proposed to the weighting of the elements of the plan which remain at:
 — 26% based on the Company’s Total Property Return performance versus that of the market
 — 26% based on the Company’s Revenue Profit performance
 — 35% based on delivery of specific business objectives for the year
 — 13% based on the delivery of individual targets. 
Long-Term Incentive Plan awards (and  
Matching Share Plan awards for 2017 vesting) 
Details on p177
The value of this year’s Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) award to the Executive Directors will not exceed 
the current individual limit of 300% of salary. 
Outstanding LTIP and Matching Share Plan awards granted in 2014 will vest later in 2017 subject to the 
performance conditions set at the time and the plan rules under which they were granted. 
In September 2016, in common with many other companies and primarily to give the participants greater 
flexibility over the timing of exercise, the Committee approved the granting of LTIP awards, from 2017 
onwards, as nil-cost share options with a seven year exercise period. It also agreed that outstanding 
awards should also vest as nil-cost options, and that dividends could be accrued on vested options where 
they are subject to a two year holding period, but not thereafter.
Savings Related Share  
Option Scheme 
Details on p177
The Executive Directors, and all other eligible employees, will be entitled to participate in the Company’s 
Savings Related Share Option Scheme (which is operated in line with current UK HMRC guidelines).
Share Ownership Guidelines 
Details on p177
The existing share ownership levels (i.e. 250% of salary for the Chief Executive and 200% of salary for the 
Chief Financial Officer) will continue to apply. 
Executive Director Recruitment and  
Termination Provisions 
Details on p179
External recruitment and termination activity during the year is currently not envisaged; however should 
this occur, the Policy will apply as stated. 
Service Agreements and Letters  
of Appointment 
Details on p179
If new Service Agreements, or variations to existing ones, are required over the course of the year, the 
Policy will apply as stated.
Any new Non-executive Director joining the Board will be contracted under a Letter of Appointment as 
per the Policy. 
Non-executive Directors’ fees 
Details on p178
As the fees for Non-executive Directors were reviewed in late 2015, no further revisions will take place over 
the course of the year. The annual fee for Dame Alison Carnwath as Chairman remains at £375,000 and 
the annual base fee for all other Non-executive Directors remains at £70,000. These have been in effect 
since 1 April 2016. Additional fees also apply for Committee chairmen, and these remain unchanged. 
AGM, and intended to remain in place for 
three years. The Policy set out in the Additional 
Information section of this Report therefore 
remains in force until 2018, when any proposed 
revisions will be discussed with shareholders, 
and their views sought, well in advance of the 
AGM. A summary statement on the planned 
application of the Policy in 2017 is shown in 
table 67 below.
The Remuneration Committee’s primary 
objective when setting the Policy is to provide 
competitive pay arrangements which promote 
the long-term success of the Company. To 
achieve this, the Committee takes account of 
the responsibilities, experience, performance and 
contribution of the individual, as well as levels 
of remuneration for individuals in comparable 
roles elsewhere. The Committee also takes into 
account the views expressed by shareholders 
and institutional investors’ best practice 
expectations, and monitors developments 
in remuneration trends. The Policy places 
significant emphasis on the need to achieve 
stretching and rigorously applied performance 
targets, with a significant proportion of 
remuneration weighted towards performance-
linked variable pay. 
The Committee operates within the Policy 
at all times. It also operates the various incentive 
plans and schemes according to their respective 
rules and consistent with normal market 
practice, the UK Corporate Governance Code 
and, as applicable, the Listing Rules. Within the 
Policy, the Committee will retain the discretion 
to look at performance “in the round” , including 
withholding or deferring payments in certain 
circumstances where the outcomes for Directors 
are clearly misaligned with the outcomes for 
shareholders. Any specific circumstances which 
necessitate the use of discretion will always be 
explained clearly in the following year’s Annual 
Report on Remuneration. No such discretion 
was exercised by the Committee during the year 
under review. 
The table on pages 175-179 provides 
more detail on the discretion reserved to 
the Committee for each element of the 
remuneration package. Governance

Results and dividends 
The results for the year are set out in the 
financial statements on pages 103-154.
The Company has paid three quarterly 
interim dividends to shareholders for the year 
under review, each of 8.95p per ordinary share. 
These comprised two payments (totalling 
17.90p) as a Property Income Distribution (PID) 
and one payment (8.95p) as a normal dividend 
(i.e. non-PID). The Board has recommended 
a final dividend for the year of 11.7p per 
ordinary share, payable wholly as a PID (net of 
withholding tax, where appropriate), making a 
total dividend for the year of 38.55p per share, 
representing an increase of 10.1% compared 
with the prior year. Subject to shareholders’ 
approval, the final dividend will be paid on 
27 July 2017 to shareholders on the register 
at the close of business on 23 June 2017. 
The Board has also declared a first quarterly 
dividend in respect of the 2017/18 financial year 
of 9.85p per ordinary share, payable wholly as a 
PID (net of withholding tax, where appropriate), 
to be paid on 6 October 2017 to shareholders 
on the register at the close of business on 
8 September 2017.
A Dividend Reinvestment Plan (DRIP) 
election is currently available in respect of 
all dividends paid by the Company. 
Events since the balance sheet date 
Since 31 March 2017, the Group has redeemed 
the £273m Queen Anne’s Gate bond in its 
entirety at a premium of £63m. The redemption 
was financed through existing Group facilities.
On 13 April 2017, the Group’s joint 
arrangement, the Metro Shopping Fund Limited 
Partnership (Metro), completed the sale of 
ShopStop (Clapham Junction) LLP to DV4 
(a fund owned by Delancey Real Estate Asset 
Management Limited (Delancey)). On the same 
date, Delancey sold its stake in Metro to Invesco 
Real Estate European Fund. The partnership was 
subsequently renamed The Southside Limited 
Partnership and the £85m third-party debt in 
the fund was repaid in full. 
On 15 May 2017, the Group acquired three 
retail outlet centres from Britel Fund Trustees 
Limited (as trustee of the BT Pension Scheme). 
The three assets, Freeport, Braintree, Clarks 
Village, Street and Junction 32, were acquired 
for a total consideration of £333m.

Appointment and removal of Directors 
The appointment and replacement of Directors 
is governed by the Company’s Articles of 
Association (Articles), the UK Corporate 
Governance Code (Code), the Companies 
Act 2006 (Act) and related legislation. The 
Board may appoint a Director either to fill a 
casual vacancy or as an addition to the Board 
so long as the total number of Directors does 
not exceed the limit prescribed in the Articles.  
An appointed Director must retire and seek 
election to office at the next AGM of the 
Company. In addition to any power of removal 
conferred by the Act, the Company may by 
ordinary resolution remove any Director before 
the expiry of their period of office and may, 
subject to the Articles, by ordinary resolution 
appoint another person who is willing to act as 
a Director in their place. In line with the Code 
and the Board’s policy, all Directors are required 
to stand for re-election at each AGM. 
Directors’ powers 
The Board manages the business of the 
Company under the powers set out in the 
Articles. These powers include the Directors’ 
ability to issue or buy back shares. Shareholders’ 
authority to empower the Directors to make 
market purchases of up to 10% of its own 
ordinary shares is sought at the AGM each year 
(see below). The Articles can only be amended, 
or new Articles adopted, by a resolution passed 
by shareholders in general meeting by at least 
three quarters of the votes cast. 
Directors’ interests 
Save as disclosed in the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report, none of the Directors, nor any person 
connected with them, has any interest in the 
share or loan capital of the Company or any of 
its subsidiaries. At no time during the year ended 
31 March 2017 did any Director hold a material 
interest, directly or indirectly, in any contract of 
significance with the Company or any subsidiary 
undertaking other than the Executive Directors 
in relation to their Service Agreements.  Governance

to acts or omissions arising in the ordinary 
course of their duties. The indemnity applies 
only to the extent permitted by law. A copy of 
the deed of indemnity is available for inspection 
at the Company’s registered office and will be 
available at the 2017 AGM. The Company has in 
place appropriate Directors & Officers Liability 
insurance cover in respect of potential legal 
action against its Directors.

The Company has a single class of share capital 
which is divided into ordinary shares of nominal 
value 10p each all ranking pari passu. No other

ACS HR Solutions Share Plan Services 
(Guernsey) Limited is a shareholder who acts as 
the trustee (Trustee) of the Company’s offshore 
discretionary Employee Benefit Trust (EBT). It 
is used to purchase Land Securities Group PLC 
ordinary shares in the market from time to 
time for the benefit of employees, including 
for satisfying outstanding awards under the 
Company’s various employee share plans. The 
EBT purchased a total of 500,000 shares in 
the market during the year for an aggregate 
consideration of £4.92m (including all dealing 
costs) and released 851,336 shares to satisfy 
vested share plan awards. At 31 March 2017, the 
EBT held 792,556 Land Securities Group PLC 
shares in trust. A dividend waiver is in place from 
the Trustee in respect of all dividends payable by 
the Company on shares which it holds in trust. 
Further details regarding the EBT, and of shares 
issued pursuant to the Company’s various 
employee share plans during the year, are set 
out in note 35 to the financial statements. 
Save as disclosed above, the Company 
did not purchase any of its own shares during 
the year under review and no treasury shares 
were cancelled. Accordingly, the 10,495,131 
ordinary shares held in Treasury at 31 March 2017 
remained unchanged from those held at the 
beginning of the year. 
Substantial shareholders 
As at 31 March 2017, the Company had been 
notified under the Disclosure and Transparency 
Rules (DTR 5) of the following holdings of  
voting rights in its issued share capital: 
The Company received no further DTR 
notifications, by way of change to the above 
information or otherwise, during the period from 
1 April to 17 May 2017, being the period from 
the year end through to the date on which this 
report has been signed. Information provided to 
the Company under the DTR is publicly available 
to view via the regulatory information service on 
the Company’s website. 
Shareholder voting rights and restrictions  
on transfer of shares 
All the issued and outstanding ordinary shares 
of the Company have equal voting rights with 
one vote per share. There are no special control 
rights attaching to them save that the control 
rights of ordinary shares held in the EBT can 
be directed by the Company to satisfy the 
vesting of outstanding awards under its various 
employee share plans. In relation to the EBT, 
the Trustee has agreed not to vote any shares 
held in the EBT at any general meeting. If any 
offer is made to all shareholders to acquire their 
shares in the Company the Trustee will not be 
obliged to accept or reject the offer in respect 
of any shares which are at the time subject to 
subsisting awards, but will have regard to the 
interests of the award holders and will have 
power to consult them to obtain their views  
on the offer. Subject to the above, the Trustee  
may take such action with respect to the offer 
as it thinks fit. 
The Company is not aware of any 
agreements or control rights between existing 
shareholders that may result in restrictions on 
the transfer of securities or on voting rights.  
The rights, including full details relating to voting 
of shareholders and any restrictions on transfer 
relating to the Company’s ordinary shares, are 
set out in the Articles and in the explanatory 
notes that accompany the Notice of the 2017 
AGM. These documents are available on the 
Company’s website at: www.landsec.com.  94 Landsec Annual Report 2017
Change of control 
There are a number of agreements that take 
effect, alter or terminate upon a change of 
control of the Company following a takeover. 
None of these are considered significant. The 
Company’s share plans contain provisions that 
take effect in such an event but do not entitle 
participants to a greater interest in the shares 
of the Company than created by the initial 
grant or award under the relevant plan. There 
are no agreements between the Company 
and its Directors or employees providing for 
compensation for loss of office or employment 
or otherwise that occurs specifically because of 
a takeover.
Human rights and equal opportunities
The Company operates a Human Rights Policy 
which aims to recognise and safeguard the 
human rights of all citizens in the business 
areas in which we operate. We support the 
principles set out within both the UN Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) and the 
International Labour Organization’s Declaration 
on Fundamental Principles and Rights at 
Work. Our Policy is built on these foundations 
including, without limitation, the principles 
of equal opportunities, collective bargaining, 
freedom of association and protection from 
forced or child labour. The Policy has been 
extended to take account of the new Modern 
Slavery Act that came into force in October 
2015 and requires the Company to report 
annually on its workforce and supply chain, 
specifically to confirm that workers are not 
enslaved or trafficked. The Company’s first 
slavery and human trafficking statement, 
relating to the financial year ended 31 March 
2016, was approved by the Board on 
29 September 2016 and posted on the 
Company’s website on 30 September 2016. 
Landsec is an equal opportunities employer 
and our range of employment policies and 
guidelines reflects legal and employment 
requirements in the UK and safeguards the 
interests of employees, potential employees 
and other workers. We do not condone 
unfair treatment of any kind and offer equal 
opportunities in all aspects of employment and 
advancement regardless of race, nationality, 
gender, age, marital status, sexual orientation, 
disability, religious or political beliefs. The 
Company recognises that it has clear obligations 
towards all its employees and the community 
at large to ensure that people with disabilities 
are afforded equal opportunities to enter 
employment and progress. The Company has 
therefore established procedures designed 
to provide fair consideration and selection of 
disabled applicants and to satisfy their training 
and career development needs. If an employee 
becomes disabled, wherever possible Landsec 
takes steps to accommodate the disability 
by making adjustments to their existing 
employment arrangements, or by redeployment 
and providing appropriate retraining to enable 
continued employment in the Group. 
Further information regarding the 
Company’s practical safeguarding of human 
rights and promotion of equal opportunities 
is included as part of the Social review in the 
Strategic Report on page 38. 
Political donations 
No political donations were made in the year 
(2015/16: nil). 
Auditor and disclosure of information to  
the auditor 
So far as the Directors are aware, there is no 
relevant audit information that has not been 
brought to the attention of the Company’s 
auditor. Each Director has taken all reasonable 
steps to make himself or herself aware of any 
relevant audit information and to establish that 
such information was provided to the auditor. 
A resolution to confirm the reappointment 
of Ernst & Young LLP as auditor of the 
Company will be proposed at the 2017 AGM. 
The confirmation has been recommended to 
the Board by the Audit Committee and EY has 
indicated its willingness to remain in office. 
2017 Annual General Meeting 
This year’s AGM will be held at the earlier 
time of 10.00 am on Thursday, 13 July 2017, 
at 80 Victoria Street, London SW1E 5JL. A 
separate circular, comprising a letter from the 
Chairman, Notice of Meeting and explanatory 
notes in respect of the resolutions proposed, 
accompanies this Annual Report. 
The Directors’ Report was approved by the 
Board on 17 May 2017.

Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities
The Annual Report 2017 contains the following 
statements regarding responsibility for the 
financial statements and business reviews 
included therein.
The Directors are responsible for preparing the 
Annual Report and the financial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare 
financial statements for each financial year. 
Under that law the Directors have prepared  
the Group and parent company financial 
statements in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted 
by the European Union. Directors must not 
approve the financial statements unless they  
are satisfied that they give a true and fair view 
of the state of affairs of the Group and the 
Company and of the profit and loss of the 
Group and the Company for that period.
In preparing these financial statements the 
Directors are required to:
 — select suitable accounting policies in 
accordance with IAS 8 ‘Accounting Policies, 
Changes in Accounting Estimates and  
Errors’ and then apply them consistently;
 — make judgements and accounting  
estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
 — present information, including accounting 
policies, in a manner that provides  
relevant, reliable, comparable and 
understandable information;
 — state that the Group and Company has 
complied with IFRS as adopted by the 
European Union, subject to any material 
departures disclosed and explained in  
the financial statements;
 — provide additional disclosures when 
compliance with the specific requirements  
of IFRS is insufficient to enable users to 
understand the impact of particular 
transactions, other events and conditions on 
the Group’s and Company’s financial position 
and performance; and 
 — prepare the Group’s and Company’s financial 
statements on a going concern basis,  
unless it is inappropriate to do so.
The Directors are responsible for keeping 
adequate accounting records that are sufficient 
to show and explain the Group’s and Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable 
accuracy at any time the financial position of 
the Group and the Company, and to enable 
them to ensure that the Annual Report complies 
with the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards 
the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the 
IAS regulation. They are also responsible for 
safeguarding the assets of the Group and the 
Company and hence for taking reasonable steps 
for the prevention and detection of fraud and 
other irregularities.
Directors’ responsibility statement under the 
Disclosure and Transparency Rules
Each of the Directors, whose names and 
functions are listed below, confirm that to the 
best of their knowledge:
 — the Group financial statements, which have 
been prepared in accordance with IFRS as 
adopted by the EU, give a true and fair view 
of the assets, liabilities, financial position and 
profit of the Group; and
 — the Company financial statements, prepared 
in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU, 
give a true and fair view of the assets, 
liabilities, financial position, performance and 
cash flows of the Company; and
 — the Strategic Report contained in the Annual 
Report includes a fair review of the 
development and performance of the 
business and the position of the Group and 
the Company, together with a description of 
the principal risks and uncertainties faced by 
the Group and Company.
Directors’ statement under the UK 
Corporate Governance Code
Each of the Directors confirm that to the best  
of their knowledge the Annual Report taken  
as a whole is fair, balanced and understandable 
and provides the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the Group’s and 
Company’s position, performance, business 
model and strategy.
A copy of the financial statements of the  
Group is placed on the Company’s website.  
The Directors are responsible for the 
maintenance and integrity of statutory and 
audited information on the Company’s website 
at www.landsec.com. Information published on 
the internet is accessible in many countries with 
different legal requirements. Legislation in the 
United Kingdom governing the preparation  
and dissemination of financial statements may 
differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.

Overview of our audit approach
Risks of material misstatement — The valuation of investment property (including properties within the development programme and investment 
properties held in joint ventures)
 — Revenue recognition, including the timing of revenue recognition, the treatment of rents, incentives and 
recognition of trading property proceeds.
Audit scope — The Group solely operates in the United Kingdom and operates through two segments, London and Retail, both 
of which were subject to the same audit scope. This included the Group audit team performing direct audit 
procedures on joint venture balances included within the Group financial statements.
Materiality — Overall Group materiality of £61m which represents 0.5% of the carrying value of investment properties line item 
in the Group balance sheet at 31 March 2017
 — Specific materiality of £21m which represents 5% of adjusted profit before tax is applied to account balances not 
related to investment properties (either wholly owned or held within joint ventures) .
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) 
as adopted by the European Union and as regards the Parent company financial statements as applied in accordance with the provisions of the 
Companies Act 2006. 98 Landsec Annual Report 2017
Our assessment of risk of material misstatement 
We identified the risks of material misstatement described below as those that had the greatest effect on our overall audit strategy, the allocation of 
resources in the audit and the direction of the efforts of the audit team. In addressing these risks, we have performed the procedures below which were 
designed in the context of the financial statements as a whole and, consequently, we do not express any opinion on these individual areas.
Risk Our response to the risk
Key observations communicated to the 
Audit Committee
The valuation of the investment 
property portfolio, including 
properties within the 
development programme and 
investment properties held in 
joint ventures 
2017: £12,144m in investment 
properties and £1,763m (the 
Group’s share) in investment 
properties held in joint ventures 
(2016: £12,358m in investment 
properties and £1,630m in 
investment properties held in  
joint ventures) 
Refer to the Accountability  
section of the Annual Report 
(pages 70-74); Accounting policies 
(page 119-120); Note 14  
of the Financial Statements 
(pages 121-123) and Note 16  
of the Financial Statements 
(pages 124-129)
The valuation of investment 
property (including properties 
within the development 
programme and investment 
properties held in joint ventures) 
requires significant judgement and 
estimates by management and 
the external valuer. Any input 
inaccuracies or unreasonable 
bases used in these judgements 
(such as in respect of estimated 
rental value and yield profile 
applied) could result in a material 
misstatement of the income 
statement and balance sheet. 
There is also a risk that 
management may influence  
the significant judgements  
and estimates in respect of 
property valuations in order to 
achieve property valuation and 
other performance targets to 
meet market expectations or 
bonus targets.
Our audit procedures around the valuation of investment property included:
We evaluated the Group’s controls over data used in the valuation of the 
investment property portfolio and management’s review of the valuations.
We evaluated the competence of the external valuer which included consideration 
of their qualifications and expertise.
We met with the Group’s external valuer to discuss their valuation approach and 
the judgements they made in assessing the property valuation such as estimated 
rental value, yield profile and other assumptions that impact the value. 
For a sample of properties, we performed testing over source documentation 
provided by the Group to the external valuer. This included agreeing a sample of 
this documentation back to underlying lease data and vouching costs incurred to 
date in respect of development properties. We also assessed the reasonableness 
of the costs to complete information in respect of properties in the course of 
development by comparing the total forecast costs to contractual arrangements 
and approved budgets.
We included Chartered Surveyors on our audit team who reviewed and challenged 
the valuation approach and assumptions for a sample of properties which 
comprised 69% of the market value of investment properties (including 
investment properties held in joint ventures). Our Chartered Surveyors compared 
the equivalent yields applied to each property to an expected range of yields 
taking into account market data and asset specific considerations. They also 
considered whether the other assumptions applied by the external valuer, such  
as the estimated rental values, voids, tenant incentives and development costs  
to complete were supported by available data such as recent lettings and 
occupancy levels. 
Together with our Chartered Surveyors, we met with the external valuer to  
discuss the findings from our audit work described above and to seek further 
explanations as required. We also discussed the impact of current market 
conditions, including Brexit, on the property valuations.
We conducted analytical procedures by comparing assumptions and the value  
of each property in the portfolio on a year-on-year basis, by reference to our 
understanding of the UK real estate market, external market data and asset 
specific considerations to evaluate the appropriateness of the valuations adopted 
by the Group. We investigated further the valuations of some properties which 
included further discussions with management and, where appropriate,  
obtaining evidence to support the movement in values and involvement of  
our Chartered Surveyors.
We attended meetings between management and the external valuer to assess 
for evidence of undue management influence and we obtained a confirmation 
from the external valuer that they had not been subject to undue influence  
from management. 
We utilised our analytical procedures and work of the Chartered Surveyors 
described above in order to assess for evidence of undue management influence.
We performed site visits accompanied by our Chartered Surveyors for a sample of 
properties in the development programme, which enabled us to assess the stage 
of completion of, and gain specific insights into, these developments.
We met with development directors and project managers for major properties 
in the development programme and assessed project costs, progress of 
development and leasing status and considered the reasonableness of the 
forecast costs to complete included in the valuations as well as identified 
contingencies, exposures and remaining risks. We corroborated the information 
provided by the development directors and the project managers through 
valuation review, site visits and cost analysis. We also reviewed development 
feasibilities and monthly development reporting against budget.
Scope of our procedures 
We performed full scope audit procedures over valuation of the whole of 
investment property, including properties within the development programme 
and investment properties held in joint ventures.
We have audited the inputs, 
assumptions and methodology  
used by the external valuer. We 
conclude that the methodology 
applied is reasonable and that  
the external valuations are an 
appropriate assessment of the 
market value of investment 
properties at 31 March 2017.
Our Chartered Surveyors concluded 
that the sample of valuations  
they reviewed were within a 
reasonable range. 
We conclude that management 
provided an appropriate level  
of review and challenge over  
the valuations but did not  
identify evidence of undue 
management influence.

Key observations communicated to the

Revenue recognition, including 
the timing of revenue 
recognition, the treatment  
of rents, incentives and 
recognition of trading  
property proceeds
2017: £587m rental income and 
£62m trading property sales 
proceeds (2016: £603m rental 
income and £195m trading 
property sales proceeds)
Refer to the Accountability section 
of the Annual Report (pages 
70-74); Accounting policies  
(page 113); and Note 6  
of the Financial Statements  
(page 113)
Market expectations and revenue 
profit based targets may place 
pressure on management to 
distort revenue recognition. This 
may result in overstatement or 
deferral of revenues to assist in 
meeting current or future targets 
or expectations.
Our audit procedures over revenue recognition included:
We carried out testing relating to controls over revenue recognition and the 
treatment of rents which have been designed by the Group to prevent and  
detect fraud and errors in revenue recognition. This included testing the  
controls governing approvals and changes to lease terms and the upload of  
this information to the Group’s property information management system.  
We also performed controls testing on the billings process. 
We selected a sample of new or amended lease agreements in the year and 
agreed the data input into PIMS, the property management information  
system, including lease incentive clauses. 
We performed detailed testing for a sample of revenue transactions by agreeing 
them back to lease agreements. This included focusing upon incentives included 
within lease agreements and we critically assessed whether the appropriate 
accounting treatment had been followed. 
Detailed analytical procedures were performed on the recognition of revenue, 
including rents, incentives and other property related revenue to assess whether 
revenue had been recognised in the appropriate accounting period.
We agreed a sample of lease agreements to the schedules used to calculate 
straight-lining of revenue in accordance with SIC 15 Operating Leases – Incentives 
and corroborated the arithmetical accuracy of these schedules and the resulting 
amounts in revenue for straight-lining of tenant lease incentives.
We challenged the assessment of recoverability of ‘tenant lease incentives’ 
receivable balance by evaluating the financial viability of the major tenants with 
related lease incentive debtors.
We assessed whether the revenue recognition policies adopted complied with IFRS 
as adopted by the European Union.
We performed audit procedures specifically designed to address the risk of 
management override of controls including journal entry testing, which included 
particular focus on journal entries which impact revenue.
We tested a sample of trading property proceeds recognised during the year 
through agreement to contracts and cash to bank in order to verify that revenue 
is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been 
transferred to the buyer.
Scope of our procedures 
The whole Group was subject to full scope audit procedures over revenue. 
We audited the timing of revenue 
recognition, treatment of rents  
and incentives and recognition  
of trading property proceeds and 
assessed the risk of management 
override. Based upon the audit 
procedures performed, we 
concluded that revenue has been 
recognised on an appropriate  
basis in the year.
Compared to the prior year, there have been no changes to our assessment of the risks of material misstatement.
The scope of our audit 
Tailoring the scope
The Group solely operates in the United Kingdom and operates through two segments, London and Retail, both of which were subject to the same 
audit scope. The Group audit team performed all the work necessary to issue the Group and Parent company audit opinion, including undertaking  
all of the audit work on the risks of material misstatement identified above.
Our application of materiality 
We apply the concept of materiality in planning and performing the audit, in evaluating the effect of identified misstatements on the audit and  
in forming our audit opinion. 
Materiality
The magnitude of an omission or misstatement that, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to influence the economic  
decisions of the users of the financial statements. Materiality provides a basis for determining the nature and extent of our audit procedures. 100 Landsec Annual Report 2017
The table below sets out the materiality, performance materiality and threshold for reporting audit differences applied on our audit:
Basis Materiality Performance materiality Audit differences

investment properties

(2016: £62m)

of the net deficit on revaluation of

owned or held within joint ventures and

£21m 
(2016: £21m)
£16m 
(2016: £16m)
£1m 
(2016: £1m)
When establishing our overall audit strategy, we determined a magnitude of uncorrected misstatements that we judged would be material for the 
financial statements as a whole. We determined that the carrying value of investment property would be the most appropriate basis for determining 
overall materiality given that the Group’s investment property balance accounts for around 82% of the Group’s total assets (2016: 82%) and the fact 
that key users of the Group’s financial statements are primarily focused on the valuation of the investment property portfolio. This provided a basis for 
determining the nature, timing and extent of risk assessment procedures, identifying and assessing the risk of material misstatement and determining 
the nature, timing and extent of further audit procedures. 
We have determined that for other account balances not related to investment properties (either wholly owned or held within joint ventures) a 
misstatement of less than materiality for the financial statements as a whole could influence the economic decisions of users. We have determined  
that materiality for these areas should be based upon profit before tax of £112m, excluding the impact of the net deficit on revaluation of investment 
properties either wholly owned or held within joint ventures of £146m and the impact of the redemption of medium term notes of £170m (‘Adjusted 
PBT’) as overall materiality is applied to the net deficit on revaluation. We believe that it is appropriate to use a profit based measure as profit is also  
a focus of users of the financial statements. This year the calculation of Adjusted PBT excludes the impact of the redemption of medium term notes, 
given this is expected to be a non-recurring item.
During the course of our audit, we reassessed initial materiality and, as the actual carrying value of investment properties was in line with that which  
we had used as the initial basis for determining overall materiality, our final materiality was consistent with the materiality we calculated initially.
Performance materiality
The application of materiality at the individual account or balance level. It is set at an amount to reduce to an appropriately low level the probability 
that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceeds materiality.
On the basis of our risk assessments, together with our assessment of the Group’s overall control environment, our judgement is that overall 
performance materiality and specific performance materiality (i.e. our tolerance for misstatement in an individual account or balance) for the Group 
should be 75% (2016: 75%) of the respective materiality. We have set performance materiality at this percentage due to our past experience of the 
audit that indicates a lower risk of misstatements, both corrected and uncorrected. Our objective in adopting this approach is to confirm that total 
detected and undetected audit differences do not exceed our materiality for the financial statements as a whole.
Reporting threshold
An amount below which identified misstatements are considered as being clearly trivial.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the Committee all uncorrected audit differences in excess of £3m (2016: £3m), as well  
as audit differences in excess of £1m (2016: £1m) that relate to our specific testing of the other account balances not related to investment properties 
which are set at 5% of their respective planning materiality. We also agreed to report differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted 
reporting on qualitative grounds. 
We evaluate any uncorrected misstatements against both the quantitative measures of materiality discussed above and in light of other relevant 
qualitative considerations in forming our opinion.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the 
financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting 
policies are appropriate to the Group’s and the Parent company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the 
reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the Directors; and the overall presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read 
all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and to 
identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course  
of performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.

Notes to the financial statements
for the year ended 31 March 2017
Section 1 – General
This section contains a description of the Group’s significant accounting policies that relate to the financial statements as a whole. A description of 
accounting policies specific to individual areas (e.g. investment properties) is included within the relevant note to the financial statements.
This section also includes a summary of new European Union (EU) endorsed accounting standards, amendments and interpretations that have not yet 
been adopted, and their expected impact on the reported results of the Group.
1. Basis of preparation and consolidation
Basis of preparation
These financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis and in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as 
adopted by the EU (IFRS), IFRIC Interpretations and the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. The financial statements 
have been prepared in Pounds Sterling (rounded to the nearest one million), which is the presentation currency of the Group (Land Securities Group PLC 
and all its subsidiary undertakings), and under the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of investment property, available-for-sale 
investments, derivative financial instruments and pension assets.
During the year, the Group has reviewed the presentation of the financial statements and has made some changes with the intention of simplifying the 
way in which the Group’s results are presented. One of the main changes is from reporting to the nearest hundred thousand pounds, to reporting to the 
nearest million pounds. Additionally, certain insignificant line items that were previously presented separately in the financial statements have been 
aggregated. Where line items have been aggregated in the primary statements, explanatory notes providing a breakdown of the aggregated balances 
are included in the notes to the financial statements.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires the use of estimates and 
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues 
and expenses during the reporting period. Although these estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of the amount, event or actions, 
actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates. Further details on the Group’s significant accounting judgements and estimates are included 
in note 2.
Land Securities Group PLC (the Company) has not presented its own statement of comprehensive income (and separate income statement), as 
permitted by Section 408 of Companies Act 2006. The merger reserve arose on 6 September 2002 when the Company acquired 100% of the issued 
share capital of Land Securities PLC. The merger reserve represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the nominal value of the shares issued by 
the Company to acquire Land Securities PLC. The merger reserve does not represent a realised or distributable profit. The capital redemption reserve 
represents the nominal value of cancelled shares.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2017 incorporate the financial statements of the Company and all its subsidiary 
undertakings. Subsidiary undertakings are those entities controlled by the Company. Control exists where an entity is exposed to variable returns  
and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee.
The results of subsidiaries and joint ventures acquired or disposed of during the year are included from the effective date of acquisition or to  
the effective date of disposal. Accounting policies of subsidiaries and joint ventures which differ from Group accounting policies are adjusted  
on consolidation.
Where instruments in a subsidiary held by third parties are redeemable at the option of the holder, these interests are classified as a financial liability, 
called the redemption liability. The liability is carried at fair value; the value is reassessed at the balance sheet date and movements are recognised in 
the income statement.
Joint arrangements are those entities over whose activities the Group has joint control, established by contractual agreement. Interests in joint 
arrangements are accounted for as either a joint venture or a joint operation. A joint arrangement is accounted for as a joint venture when the Group, 
along with the other parties that have joint control of the arrangement, have rights to the net assets of the arrangement. Interests in joint ventures are 
equity accounted. The equity method requires the Group’s share of the joint venture’s post-tax profit or loss for the year to be presented separately in 
the income statement and the Group’s share of the joint venture’s net assets to be presented separately in the balance sheet. A joint arrangement is 
accounted for as a joint operation when the Group, along with the parties that have joint control of the arrangement, have rights to the assets and 
obligations for the liabilities relating to the arrangement. Joint operations are accounted for by including the Group’s share of the assets, liabilities, 
income and expenses on a line-by-line basis.
Intra-group balances and any unrealised gains and losses arising from intra-group transactions are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial 
statements. Unrealised gains arising from transactions with joint ventures are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in the joint venture 
concerned. Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment. 108 Landsec Annual Report 2017
Notes to the financial statements
for the year ended 31 March 2017 continued
2. Significant accounting judgements and estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to exercise judgement in applying the Group‘s accounting 
policies. The areas where the Group considers the judgements to be most significant involve assumptions or estimates in respect of future events,  
where actual results may differ from these estimates. These areas are as follows:
 — Valuation of investment and trading properties (page 120)
 — Accounting for property acquisitions and disposals (page 120)
 — Compliance with the Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) taxation regime and the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities (page 117) 
3. Amendments to IFRS
The accounting policies used in these financial statements are consistent with those applied in the last annual financial statements, as amended where 
relevant to reflect the adoption of new standards, amendments and interpretations which became effective in the year. These amendments have not 
had an impact on the financial statements. 
A number of new standards and amendments to standards have been issued but are not yet effective for the Group. The most significant of these, and 
their potential impact on the Group’s accounting, are set out below:
 — IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (effective from 1 April 2018) – the standard will be applicable to service charge income, other 
property related income, trading property sales proceeds and proceeds from the sale of investment properties, but not rental income arising from 
the Group’s leases with tenants. Based on the transactions impacting the current financial year and future known transactions, the Group does not 
expect the adoption of IFRS 15 to have a material impact on the Group’s reported results. However, we will continue to assess new transactions as 
they arise to the date of adoption. 
 — IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (effective from 1 April 2018) – the standard applies to classification and measurement of financial assets and financial 
liabilities, impairment provisioning and hedge accounting. The Group is in the process of assessing the impact of IFRS 9, but adoption of the new 
standard may impact the measurement and presentation of the Group’s financial liabilities.
 — IFRS 16 Leases (effective from 1 April 2019) – the adoption of this standard is not expected to significantly impact the recognition of rental income 
earned under the Group’s leases with tenants. The Group holds a small number of operating leases as a lessee which are affected by this standard, 
however, these are not material to the financial statements.  Financial Statements

Section 2 – Performance
This section focuses on the performance of the Group for the year, including segmental information, earnings per share and net assets per share, 
together with further details on specific components of the income statement and dividends paid.
Our property portfolio is a combination of properties that are wholly owned by the Group, part owned through joint arrangements and properties 
owned by the Group but where a third party holds a non-controlling interest. Internally, management review the results of the Group on a basis that 
adjusts for these different forms of ownership to present a proportionate share. The Combined Portfolio, with assets totalling £14.4bn, is an example of 
this approach, reflecting the economic interest we have in our properties regardless of our ownership structure. We consider this presentation provides  
a better explanation to stakeholders of the activities and performance of the Group, as it aggregates the results of all of the Group’s property interests 
which under IFRS are required to be presented across a number of line items in the statutory financial statements.
The same principle is applied to many of the other measures we discuss and accordingly, a number of our financial measures include the results of our 
joint ventures and subsidiaries on a proportionate basis. Measures that are described as being presented on a proportionate basis include the Group’s 
share of joint ventures on a line-by-line basis, and are adjusted to exclude the non-owned elements of our subsidiaries. This is in contrast to the Group’s 
statutory financial statements, where the Group’s interest in joint ventures is presented as one line on the income statement and balance sheet, and all 
subsidiaries are consolidated at 100% with any non-owned element being adjusted as a non-controlling interest or redemption liability, as appropriate. 
Our joint operations are presented on a proportionate basis in all financial measures.
Our income statement has two key components: the income we generate from leasing our investment properties net of associated costs (including 
interest expense), which we refer to as revenue profit, and items not directly related to the underlying rental business, principally valuation changes, 
profits or losses on the disposal of properties and exceptional items, which we refer to as capital and other items. Our income statement is presented  
in a columnar format, split into those items that relate to revenue profit and capital and other items. The Total column represents the Group’s results 
presented in accordance with IFRS; the other columns provide additional information. We believe revenue profit better represents the results of the 
Group’s operational performance to stakeholders as it focuses on the rental income performance of the business and excludes capital and other items 
which can vary significantly from year to year. A full definition of revenue profit is given in the glossary. The components of revenue profit are presented 
on a proportionate basis in note 4.
4. Segmental information
The Group’s operations are organised into two operating segments, being the London Portfolio and the Retail Portfolio. The London Portfolio includes all 
our London offices and central London shops and the Retail Portfolio includes all our shopping centres and shops (excluding central London shops), 
hotels and leisure assets and retail park properties. All of the Group’s operations are in the UK.
Management has determined the Group’s operating segments based on the information reviewed by senior management to make strategic decisions. 
During the year, the chief operating decision maker was the Executive Committee (ExecCom), which comprised the Executive Directors, the managing 
directors of the Retail and London portfolios, the Group General Counsel and Company Secretary, the Group HR Director and the Corporate Affairs and 
Sustainability Director. The information presented to ExecCom includes reports from all functions of the business as well as strategy, financial planning, 
succession planning, organisational development and Group-wide policies. 
The Group’s primary measure of underlying profit before tax is revenue profit. However, segment profit is the lowest level to which the profit arising from 
the ongoing operations of the Group is analysed between the two segments. The Group manages its financing structure, with the exception of joint 
ventures, on a pooled basis and, as such, debt facilities and finance expenses (other than those relating to joint ventures) are not specific to a particular 
segment. Unallocated income and expenses (Group services) are items incurred centrally which are neither directly attributable nor can be reasonably 
allocated to individual segments.
All items in the segmental information note are presented on a proportionate basis. A reconciliation from the Group income statement to the 
information presented in the segmental information note is included in table 78.  110 Landsec Annual Report 2017

5. Performance measures
Three of the Group’s key financial performance measures are adjusted diluted earnings per share, adjusted diluted net assets per share and total 
business return. In the tables below we present earnings per share and net assets per share calculated in accordance with IFRS, together with our own 
adjusted measures and certain measures required by EPRA. We also present the calculation of total business return.
Adjusted earnings, which is a tax adjusted measure of revenue profit, is the basis for the calculation of adjusted earnings per share. We believe adjusted 
earnings and adjusted earnings per share better represent the results of the Group’s operational performance to stakeholders as they focus on the 
rental income performance of the business and exclude capital and other items which can vary significantly from year to year. 
Adjusted net assets excludes the fair value of interest-rate swaps used for hedging purposes and the bond exchange de-recognition adjustment. We 
believe this better reflects the underlying net assets attributable to shareholders as it more accurately reflects the future cash flows associated with our 
debt instruments. 
Total business return is calculated as the cash dividends paid in the year plus the change in adjusted diluted net assets per share, divided by the opening 
adjusted diluted net assets per share. We consider this to be a useful measure for shareholders as it gives an indication of the total return on investment 
over the year.
EPRA measures for both earnings per share and net assets per share have been included to assist comparison between European property companies.

6. Revenue
 Accounting policy
The Group recognises revenue on an accruals basis, when the amount of revenue can be reliably measured and it is probable that future economic 
benefits will flow to the Group. 
Rental income, including fixed rental uplifts, is recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Lease incentives 
being offered to occupiers to enter into a lease, such as an initial rent-free period or a cash contribution to fit-out or similar costs, are an integral part of 
the net consideration for the use of the property and are therefore recognised on the same straight-line basis. Contingent rents, being lease payments 
that are not fixed at the inception of a lease, for example turnover rents, are recorded as income in the periods in which they are earned. 
Service charge income and management fees are recorded as income in the period in which they are earned.
When property is let under a finance lease, the Group recognises a receivable equal to the net investment in the lease at inception of the lease. Rentals 
received are accounted for as repayments of principal and finance income as appropriate. Finance income is allocated to each period during the lease 
term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining net investment in the finance lease and is recognised within revenue.
Proceeds received on the sale of trading properties are recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership transfer to the buyer. This 
generally occurs on unconditional exchange or on completion, particularly if completion is expected to occur significantly after exchange or if the Group 
has significant outstanding obligations between exchange and completion.
All revenue is classified within the ‘Revenue profit’ column of the income statement, with the exception of proceeds on the sale of trading properties 
which is presented in the ‘Capital and other items’ column. Also included in the ‘Capital and other items’ column is the non-owned element of the 
Group’s subsidiaries which is excluded from revenue profit.

7. Costs
 Accounting policy
The carrying amounts of the Group’s non-financial assets, other than investment properties, are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether 
there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. An impairment loss is recognised in the 
income statement whenever the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount of an asset is the greater of its 
fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. The value in use is determined as the net present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived 
from the asset, discounted using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to 
the asset. An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. An impairment loss is 
reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount after the reversal does not exceed the amount that would have been determined, net of 
applicable depreciation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.
All costs are classified within the ‘Revenue profit’ column of the income statement, with the exception of the cost of sale of trading properties, 
amortisation of intangible assets and head office relocation costs which are presented in the ‘Capital and other items’ column. Also included in the 
‘Capital and other items’ column is the non-owned element of the Group’s subsidiaries which is excluded from revenue profit.

assessment of net realisable value increased over the year.
2.  The net credit of £1m in respect of the head office relocation comprises the £2m release of an onerous lease provision following the assignment of the lease on the Group’s previous head office at 
lower net cost than originally anticipated, together with relocation costs of £1m. The cost of £6m in the prior year reflects the creation of the provision in respect of the onerous lease and relocation 
costs committed to at that time.

A third quarterly interim dividend of 8.95p per ordinary share, or £71m in total (2016: 8.15p or £64m in total), was paid on 7 April 2017 as a Property 
Income Distribution (PID). The Board has recommended a final dividend for the year ended 31 March 2017 of 11.7p per ordinary share (2016: 10.55p) to 
be paid as a PID. This final dividend will result in a further estimated distribution of £92m (2016: £83m). Subject to shareholders’ approval at the Annual 
General Meeting, the final dividend will be paid on 27 July 2017 to shareholders registered at the close of business on 23 June 2017. The total dividend paid 
and recommended in respect of the year ended 31 March 2017 is therefore 38.55p per ordinary share (2016: 35.0p).
A Dividend Reinvestment Plan (DRIP) has been available in respect of all dividends paid during the year. 
12. Income tax
 Accounting policy
Income tax on the profit for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Current tax is the tax payable on the taxable income for the year and any 
adjustment in respect of previous years. Deferred tax is provided in full using the balance sheet liability method on temporary differences between  
the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. Deferred tax is determined 
using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date and are expected to apply when the asset is realised or the 
liability is settled.
No provision is made for temporary differences (i) arising on the initial recognition of assets or liabilities, other than on a business combination,  
that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit and (ii) relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will not reverse in the  
foreseeable future.
 Significant accounting judgements and estimates 
The Group is a Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT). As a result, the Group does not pay UK corporation tax on its profits and gains from the qualifying 
rental business in the UK. Non-qualifying profits and gains of the Group continue to be subject to corporation tax as normal. In order to maintain  
group REIT status, certain ongoing criteria must be met. The main criteria are as follows:
 — at the start of each accounting period, the assets of the tax exempt business must be at least 75% of the total value of the Group’s assets;
 — at least 75% of the Group’s total profits must arise from the tax exempt business; and
 — at least 90% of the notional taxable profit of the property rental business must be distributed. 118 Landsec Annual Report 2017
12. Income tax continued
The Directors intend that the Group should continue as a REIT for the foreseeable future, with the result that deferred tax is no longer recognised on 
temporary differences relating to the property rental business.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities require management judgement in determining the amounts, if any, to be recognised. In particular, judgement is 
required when assessing the extent to which deferred tax assets should be recognised, taking into account the expected timing and level of future 
taxable income. Deferred tax assets are only recognised when management believe they will be recovered against future taxable profits.
The income tax credit in the income statement comprises the movement in deferred tax on intangible assets of £1m (2016: £1m credit) and 
adjustments in respect of prior financial years of £nil (2016: £1m credit). The tax for the year is lower than the standard rate of corporation tax in  
the UK of 20% (2016: 20%). The differences are explained in the table below.

Section 3 – Properties
This section focuses on the property assets which form the core of the Group’s business. It includes details of investment properties, investments in joint 
ventures and trading properties.
Our property portfolio is a combination of properties that are wholly owned by the Group, part owned through joint arrangements and properties 
owned by the Group but where a third party holds a non-controlling interest. In the Group’s IFRS balance sheet, wholly owned properties are presented 
as either ‘Investment properties’ or ‘Trading properties’ . The Group applies equity accounting to its investments in joint ventures, which requires the 
Group’s share of properties held by joint ventures to be presented within ‘Investments in joint ventures’ .
Internally, management review the results of the Group on a basis that adjusts for these forms of ownership to present a proportionate share. The 
Combined Portfolio, with assets totalling £14.4bn, is an example of this proportionate share, reflecting the economic interest we have in our properties 
regardless of our ownership structure. We consider this presentation to better explain to stakeholders the activities and performance of the Group, as it 
aggregates the results of all of the Group’s property interests which under IFRS are required to be presented across a number of line items in the 
statutory financial statements.
The Group’s investment properties are carried at fair value and trading properties are carried at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Both of these 
values are determined by the Group’s external valuers. The combined value of the Group’s total investment property portfolio (including the Group’s 
share of investment properties held through joint ventures) is shown as a reconciliation in note 14.
 Accounting policy 
Investment properties
Investment properties are properties, either owned or leased by the Group, that are held either to earn rental income or for capital appreciation, or 
both. Investment properties are measured initially at cost including related transaction costs, and subsequently at fair value. Fair value is based on 
market value, as determined by a professional independent valuer at each reporting date. The difference between the fair value of an investment 
property at the reporting date and its carrying amount prior to re-measurement is included in the income statement as a valuation surplus or deficit. 
Investment properties are presented on the balance sheet within non-current assets.
Some of the Group’s investment properties are owned through long-leasehold arrangements, as opposed to the Group owning the freehold. Where the 
Group is a lessee and the lease transfers substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to the Group, the lease is accounted for as a 
finance lease. Finance leases are capitalised within investment properties at the commencement of the lease at the lower of the fair value of the 
property and the present value of the minimum lease payments, and a corresponding liability is recorded within borrowings. Each lease payment is 
allocated between repayment of the liability and a finance charge to achieve a constant rate on the outstanding liability. The investment properties 
held under finance leases are subsequently carried at their fair value. 120 Landsec Annual Report 2017
Notes to the financial statements
for the year ended 31 March 2017 continued
Trading properties
Trading properties are those properties held for sale, or those being developed with a view to sell. Trading properties are recorded at the lower of cost 
and net realisable value. The net realisable value of a trading property is determined by a professional independent valuer at each reporting date. If the 
net realisable value of a trading property is lower than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recorded in the income statement. If, in subsequent 
periods, the net realisable value of a trading property that was previously impaired increases above its carrying value, the impairment is reversed to 
align the carrying value of the property with the net realisable value. Trading properties are presented on the balance sheet within current assets.
Acquisition of properties
Properties are treated as acquired when the Group assumes the significant risks and returns of ownership. 
Capital expenditure and capitalisation of borrowing costs
Capital expenditure on properties consists of costs of a capital nature, including costs associated with developments and refurbishments. Where a 
property is being developed or undergoing major refurbishment, interest costs associated with direct expenditure on the property are capitalised. The 
interest capitalised is calculated using the Group’s weighted average cost of borrowings. Interest is capitalised as from the commencement of the 
development work until the date of practical completion. Certain internal staff and associated costs directly attributable to the management of major 
schemes during the construction phase are also capitalised. 
Transfers between investment properties and trading properties
When the Group begins to redevelop an existing investment property for continued future use as an investment property, the property continues to be 
held as an investment property. When the Group begins to redevelop an existing investment property with a view to sell, the property is transferred to 
trading properties and held as a current asset. The property is re-measured to fair value as at the date of the transfer with any gain or loss being taken 
to the income statement. The re-measured amount becomes the deemed cost at which the property is then carried in trading properties.
Disposal of properties
Properties are treated as disposed when the significant risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the buyer. Typically, this will either occur on 
unconditional exchange or on completion. Where completion is expected to occur significantly after exchange, or where the Group continues to have 
significant outstanding obligations after exchange, the risks and rewards will not usually transfer to the buyer until completion. 
The profit on disposal is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset at the beginning of the 
accounting period plus capital expenditure to the date of disposal. The profit on disposal of investment properties is presented separately on the face of 
the income statement. Proceeds received on the sale of trading properties are recognised within Revenue, and the carrying value at the date of disposal 
is recognised within Costs.
 Significant accounting judgements and estimates
Valuation of the Group’s properties
The valuation of the Group’s property portfolio is inherently subjective due to, among other factors, the individual nature of each property, its location 
and the expected future rental revenues from that particular property. As a result, the valuations the Group places on its property portfolio are subject 
to a degree of uncertainty and are made on the basis of assumptions which may not prove to be accurate, particularly in periods of volatility or low 
transaction flow in the property market.
The investment property valuation contains a number of assumptions upon which the Group’s valuer has based its valuation of the Group’s properties 
as at 31 March 2017. The assumptions on which the property valuation reports have been based include, but are not limited to, matters such as the 
tenure and tenancy details for the properties, ground conditions at the properties, the structural condition of the properties, prevailing market yields 
and comparable market transactions. These assumptions are market standard and accord with the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) 
Valuation – Professional Standards UK 2014 (revised April 2015) . 
The estimation of the net realisable value of the Group’s trading properties, in particular the development land and infrastructure programmes, is 
inherently subjective due to a number of factors, including their complexity, unusually large size, the substantial expenditure required and long 
timescales to completion. In addition, as a result of these timescales to completion, the plans associated with these programmes could be subject to 
significant variation. As a result, and similar to the valuation of investment properties, the net realisable values of the Group’s trading properties are 
subject to a degree of uncertainty and are determined on the basis of assumptions which may not prove to be accurate. 
If the assumptions upon which the external valuer has based its valuations prove to be inaccurate, this may have an impact on the value of the Group’s 
investment and trading properties, which could in turn have an effect on the Group’s financial position and results.
Acquisition and disposal of properties
Property transactions can be complex in nature and material to the financial statements. To determine when an acquisition or disposal should be 
recognised, management consider whether the Group holds the risks and rewards of ownership, and the point at which this is obtained or relinquished. 
Consideration is given to the terms of the acquisition or disposal contracts and any conditions that must be satisfied before the contract is fulfilled.  
In the case of an acquisition, management must also consider whether the transaction represents an asset acquisition or business combination.  Financial Statements

The net book value of leasehold properties where head leases have been capitalised is £1,169m (2016: £968m).
Investment properties include capitalised interest of £206m (2016: £201m). The average rate of interest capitalisation for the year is 4.7% (2016: 5.0%). 
The historical cost of investment properties is £6,713m (2016: £6,720m). 
Valuation process
The fair value of investment properties at 31 March 2017 was determined by the Group’s independent valuer, CBRE. The valuations are in accordance 
with RICS standards and were arrived at by reference to market evidence of transactions for similar properties. The valuations performed by the 
independent valuer are reviewed internally by senior management and relevant people within the London and Retail business units. This process includes 
discussions of the assumptions used by the independent valuer, as well as a review of the resulting valuations. Discussions of the valuation process and 
results are held between senior management, the Audit Committee and the independent valuer on a half-yearly basis.
The valuer’s opinion of fair value was primarily derived using comparable recent market transactions on arm’s length terms and using appropriate 
valuation techniques. The fair value of investment properties is determined using the income capitalisation approach. Under this approach, forecast net 
cash flows, based upon current market derived estimated rental values (market rents) together with estimated costs, are discounted at market derived 
capitalisation rates to produce the valuer’s opinion of fair value. The average discount rate, which, if applied to all cash flows would produce the fair 
value, is described as the equivalent yield. 
Properties in the development programme are typically valued using a residual valuation method. Under this methodology, the valuer assesses the 
completed development value using income and yield assumptions. Deductions are then made for estimated costs to complete, including finance and 
developer’s profit, to arrive at the valuation. As the development approaches completion, the valuer may consider the income capitalisation approach 
to be more appropriate. 122 Landsec Annual Report 2017
14. Investment properties continued
The Group considers all of its investment properties to fall within ‘Level 3’ , as defined by IFRS 13 and as explained in note 25(iii). Accordingly, there have 
been no transfers of properties within the fair value hierarchy in the financial year. Costs include future estimated costs associated with refurbishment 
or development (excluding finance costs), together with an estimate of cash incentives to be paid to tenants.

16. Joint arrangements
 Accounting policy
Joint arrangements are those entities over whose activities the Group has joint control, established by contractual agreement. Interests in joint 
arrangements are accounted for as either a joint venture or a joint operation. The treatment as either a joint venture or a joint operation will depend on 
whether the Group has rights to the net assets, or a direct interest in the assets and liabilities of the arrangement.
A joint arrangement is accounted for as a joint venture when the Group, along with the other parties that have joint control of the arrangement, has 
rights to the net assets of the arrangement. Interests in joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. The equity method 
requires the Group’s share of the joint venture’s post-tax profit or loss for the year to be presented separately in the income statement and the Group’s 
share of the joint venture’s net assets to be presented separately in the balance sheet. 
A joint arrangement is accounted for as a joint operation when the Group, along with the parties that have joint control of the arrangement, have 
rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities relating to the arrangement. The Group’s share of jointly controlled assets, related liabilities, income 
and expenses are combined with the equivalent items in the financial statements on a line-by-line basis.

18. Net investment in finance leases
 Accounting policy
Where the Group’s leases transfer the significant risks and rewards of owning the asset to the tenant, the lease is accounted for as a finance lease. At 
the outset of the lease the fair value of the asset is de-recognised from investment property and recognised as a finance lease receivable. Lease income 
is recognised over the period of the lease, reflecting a constant rate of return. The difference between the gross receivable and the present value of the 
receivable is recognised as finance income within Revenue over the lease term.

The Group has leased out a number of investment properties under finance leases, which range from 30 to 99 years in duration from the inception 
of the lease. The fair value of the Group’s finance lease receivables, using a discount rate of 4.2% (2016: 4.9%), is £218m (2016: £226m).

19. Intangible assets
 Accounting policy
Intangible assets comprise goodwill and other intangible assets arising on business combinations and software used internally within the business. 
Intangible assets arising on business combinations are initially recognised at fair value. Goodwill is not amortised, but is tested at least annually for 
impairment. Other intangible assets arising on business combinations are amortised to the income statement over their expected useful lives. Software 
assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful economic lives, normally 
five years.

The other intangible asset relates to the Group’s acquisition of its interest in Bluewater, Kent in 2014 and represents the estimated fair value of the 
management rights for the centre. The fair value at the date of acquisition was £30m and the asset is being amortised over a period of 20 years. On 
recognition of the intangible asset, the Group recognised a deferred tax liability of £6m, and corresponding goodwill of the same amount. The deferred 
tax liability is being released to the income statement as the intangible asset is amortised, and the corresponding element of the goodwill is being 
tested for impairment. 132 Landsec Annual Report 2017
Section 4 – Capital structure and financing 
This section focuses on the Group’s financing structure, including borrowings and financial risk management.
The total capital of the Group consists of shareholders’ equity and net debt. The Group’s strategy is to maintain an appropriate net debt to total equity 
ratio (gearing) and loan-to-value ratio (LTV) to ensure that asset level performance is translated into enhanced returns for shareholders whilst 
maintaining an appropriate risk reward balance to accommodate changing financial and operating market cycles. The table in note 20 details a 
number of the Group’s key metrics in relation to managing its capital structure.
A key element of the Group’s capital structure is that the majority of our borrowings are secured against a large pool of our assets (the Security Group) . 
This enables us to raise long-term debt in the bond market, as well as shorter-term flexible bank facilities, both at competitive rates. In general, we 
follow a secured debt strategy as we believe this gives the Group better access to borrowings at a lower cost. 
In addition, the Group holds a number of assets outside the Security Group structure (in the Non-restricted Group). These assets include a number  
of joint venture interests, our interests in X-Leisure and other properties where we have asset specific finance. By having both the Security Group  
and the Non-restricted Group, and considerable flexibility to move assets between the two, we are able to raise the most appropriate finance for  
each specific asset or joint venture.
Under IFRS, a large part of our net debt is carried at below its final redemption amount and is increased over its life to its nominal value. We  
view our capital structure as if the debt were carried at its full redemption amount (see note 21 for an explanation of the bond exchange  
de-recognition adjustment).

21. Borrowings
 Accounting policy
Borrowings, other than bank overdrafts, are recognised initially at fair value less attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, 
borrowings are stated at amortised cost with any difference between the amount initially recognised and the redemption value being recognised  
in the income statement over the period of the borrowings, using the effective interest method.
Where existing borrowings are exchanged for new borrowings and the terms of the existing and new borrowings are not substantially different,  
the new borrowings are recognised initially at the carrying amount of the existing borrowings. The difference between the amount initially recognised 
and the redemption value of the new borrowings is recognised in the income statement over the period of the new borrowings, using the effective 
interest method.

Medium term notes (MTNs)
The MTNs are secured on the fixed and floating pool of assets of the Security Group. Debt investors benefit from security over a pool of investment 
properties, development properties and the Group’s investment in Westgate Oxford Alliance Limited Partnership, Nova, Victoria, the St. David’s Limited 
Partnership and 20 Fenchurch Street Limited Partnership, in total valued at £12.9bn at 31 March 2017 (31 March 2016: £12.6bn). The secured debt 
structure has a tiered operating covenant regime which gives the Group substantial flexibility when the loan-to-value and interest cover in the Security 
Group are less than 65% and more than 1.45 times respectively. If these limits are exceeded, the operating environment becomes more restrictive with 
provisions to encourage a reduction in gearing. The interest rate is fixed until the expected maturity, being two years before the legal maturity date for 
each MTN, whereupon the interest rate for the last two years may either become LIBOR plus an increased margin (relative to that at the time of issue), 
or subject to a fixed coupon uplift, depending on the terms and conditions of the specific notes. 
The effective interest rate is based on the coupon paid and includes the amortisation of issue costs. The MTNs are listed on the Irish Stock Exchange  
and their fair values are based on their respective market prices.
On 8 February 2017, the Group purchased £635m of MTNs for a premium of £124m. The Group purchased £206m of its A3 MTN due in 2022, £265m of  
its A10 MTN due in 2025 and £164m of its A4 MTN due in 2026. On the same date, the Group issued a £400m 1.974% MTN due in 2026 and a £300m 
2.399% MTN due in 2031. Costs associated with the issues of the new MTNs of £2m have been capitalised within non-current borrowings.
Earlier in the year, the Group also purchased a further £55m of MTNs for a premium of £13m. The Group purchased £3m of its A3 MTN due in 2022,  
£7m of its A10 MTN due in 2025, £20m of its A4 MTN due in 2026, £23m of its A5 MTN due in 2027 and £2m of its A7 MTN due in 2032. The table below

21. Borrowings continued
At 31 March 2017, our committed revolving facilities totalled £1,940m (31 March 2016: £1,865m). The £75m increase in committed facilities is the result 
of a £435m syndicated debt facility being arranged on 14 June 2016, and a £125m bilateral debt facility being arranged on 31 January 2017, offset by the 
cancellation of £350m of bilateral facilities on 14 June 2016 and the cancellation of a £135m bilateral facility on 24 November 2016.
All syndicated and bilateral facilities are committed and secured on the assets of the Security Group. In the year ended 31 March 2017, the amounts 
drawn under the Group’s bilateral facilities and syndicated bank debt decreased by £375m. 
The terms of the Security Group funding arrangements require undrawn facilities to be reserved where syndicated and bilateral facilities mature within 
one year, or where commercial paper has been issued. Accordingly, the Group’s available undrawn facilities at 31 March 2017 were £1,499m (31 March 
2016: £1,433m), compared with undrawn facilities of £1,885m (31 March 2016: £1,435m).
Queen Anne’s Gate Bond
On 29 July 2009, the Group issued a £360m bond secured on the rental cash flows from the commercial lease with the UK Government over Queen 
Anne’s Gate (QAG). The QAG Bond is a fully amortising bond with a final maturity in February 2027 and a fixed interest rate of 5.253% per annum.  
At 31 March 2017, the bond had an amortised book value of £273m (31 March 2016: £289m). Since 31 March 2017, the Group has redeemed the QAG 
bond in its entirety, for a premium to nominal value of £63m.
Fair values
The fair values of any floating rate financial liabilities are assumed to be equal to their nominal value, but adjusted for the effect of exit fees payable on 
redemption. The fair values of the MTNs and the QAG Bond fall within Level 1, the syndicated, bilateral facilities, commercial paper, interest-rate swaps 
and foreign exchange swaps fall within Level 2, and the amounts payable under finance leases fall within Level 3, as defined by IFRS 13. The fair value of 
the amounts payable under finance leases is determined using a discount rate of 4.2% (31 March 2016: 4.9%).
Bond exchange de-recognition
On 3 November 2004, a debt refinancing was completed resulting in the Group exchanging all of its outstanding bond and debenture debt for new 
MTNs with higher nominal values. The new MTNs did not meet the IAS 39 conditions to be considered substantially different from the debt that they 
replaced. Consequently, the book value of the new debt is reduced to the book value of the original debt by the ‘bond exchange de-recognition’ 
adjustment which is then amortised to zero over the life of the new MTNs. The amortisation is included in finance expense in the income statement.

 Accounting policy
Monies held in restricted accounts and deposits represent cash held by the Group in accounts with conditions that restrict the use of these monies by 
the Group and, as such, does not meet the definition of cash and cash equivalents. Holding cash in restricted accounts does not prevent the Group 
from optimising returns by putting these monies on short-term deposit.

24. Derivative financial instruments
 Accounting policy
The Group uses interest-rate and foreign exchange swaps to manage its market risk. In accordance with its treasury policy, the Group does not hold or 
issue derivatives for trading purposes.
All derivatives are recognised on the balance sheet at fair value. The fair value of interest-rate and foreign exchange swaps is based on counterparty or 
market quotes. Those quotes are tested for reasonableness by discounting estimated future cash flows based on the terms and maturity of each 
contract and using market rates for similar instruments at the measurement date. The gain or loss on derivatives are recognised immediately in the 
income statement, within net finance expense.
The fair values of the financial instruments have been determined by reference to relevant market prices, where available. The fair values of the Group’s 
outstanding interest-rate swaps have been estimated by calculating the present value of future cash flows, using appropriate market discount rates. 
These valuation techniques fall within Level 2, as defined by IFRS 13.

25. Financial risk management
Introduction
A review of the Group’s objectives, policies and processes for managing risk is set out in “Managing risk” and “Our principal risks and uncertainties” 
(pages 42 to 45). This note provides further detail on financial risk management and includes quantitative information on specific financial risks.
The Group is exposed to a variety of financial risks: market risks (principally interest-rate risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group’s overall risk 
management strategy seeks to minimise the potential adverse effects of these on the Group’s financial performance and includes the use of derivative 
financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures.
Financial risk management is carried out by the Group’s treasury function under policies approved by the Board of Directors.
The following table summarises the Group’s financial assets and liabilities into the categories required by IFRS 7, ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’:
Group

2016

Financial liabilities at fair value through profit and loss (43) (67)
(2,446) (2,391)
Financial risk factors
(i) Credit risk
The Group’s principal financial assets are cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables, finance lease receivables and amounts due from joint 
ventures. Further details concerning the credit risk of counterparties is provided in the note that specifically relates to each type of asset.
Bank and financial institutions
One of the principal credit risks of the Group arises from financial derivative instruments and deposits with banks and financial institutions. In line with 
the policy approved by the Board of Directors, where the Group manages the deposit only independently rated banks and financial institutions with a 
minimum rating of A- are accepted. For UK banks and financial institutions with which the Group has a committed lending relationship, the minimum 
rating is lowered to BBB+. The Group’s treasury function currently performs a weekly review of the credit ratings of all financial institution counterparties. 
Furthermore, the treasury function ensures that funds deposited with a single financial institution remain within the Group’s policy limits.
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are presented in the balance sheet net of allowances for doubtful receivables. Impairment is made where there is objective evidence 
that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables concerned. The balance is low relative to the 
scale of the balance sheet and, owing to the long-term nature and diversity of the Group’s tenancy arrangements, the credit risk of trade receivables is 
considered to be low. Furthermore, a credit report is obtained from an independent rating agency prior to the inception of a lease with a new 
counterparty. This report is used to determine the size of the deposit that is required from the tenant at inception. In general these deposits represent 
between three and six months’ rent.
Finance lease receivables 
This balance relates to amounts receivable from tenants in respect of tenant finance leases. This is not considered a significant credit risk as the tenants 
are generally of good financial standing. 140 Landsec Annual Report 2017
25. Financial risk management continued
(ii) Liquidity risk
The Group actively maintains a mixture of notes with final maturities between 2022 and 2036, commercial paper and medium-term committed bank 
facilities that are designed to ensure that the Group has sufficient available funds for its operations and its committed capital expenditure programme. 
Management monitors the Group’s available funds as follows:

Available facilities 1,499 1,433
Cash and available undrawn facilities 1,529 1,458
As a proportion of drawn debt 47.2% 45.0%
The Group’s core financing structure is in the Security Group, although the Non-restricted Group may also secure independent funding.
Security Group 
The Group’s principal financing arrangements utilise the credit support of a ring-fenced group of assets (the Security Group) that comprises the 
majority of the Group’s investment property portfolio and certain investments in joint ventures. These arrangements operate in ‘tiers’ determined by 
LTV and interest cover ratio (ICR) . This structure is most flexible at lower tiers (with a lower LTV and a higher ICR) and allows property acquisitions, 
disposals and developments to occur with relative freedom. In higher tiers, the requirements become more prescriptive. No financial covenant default is 
triggered until the applicable LTV exceeds 100% or the ICR is less than 1.0x.
As at 31 March 2017, the reported LTV for the Security Group was 28.3% (2016: 23.4%), meaning that the Group was operating in Tier 1 and benefited 
from maximum operational flexibility.
Management monitors the key covenants attached to the Security Group on a monthly basis, including LTV, ICR, sector and regional concentration  
and disposals.
Non-restricted Group
The Non-restricted Group obtains funding when required from a combination of inter-company loans from the Security Group, equity and external bank 
debt. Bespoke credit facilities are established with banks when required for the Non-restricted Group projects and joint ventures, usually on a limited-
recourse basis.
The table below analyses the Group’s financial liabilities into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period at the balance sheet date to 
the expected maturity date. The amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual undiscounted cash flows.

(iii) Market risk
The Group is exposed to market risk through interest rates, availability of credit and foreign exchange movements.
Interest rates
The Group uses derivative products to manage its interest rate exposure, and has a hedging policy that generally requires at least 80% of its existing 
debt plus increases in debt associated with net committed capital expenditure to be at fixed interest rates for the coming five years. Due to a 
combination of factors, principally the high level of certainty required under IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement’ , hedging 
instruments used in this context do not qualify for hedge accounting. Specific interest-rate hedges are also used within our joint ventures to fix the 
interest rate exposure on limited-recourse debt. Where specific hedges are used in geared joint ventures to fix the interest exposure on limited-recourse 
debt, these may qualify for hedge accounting.
At 31 March 2017, the Group (including joint ventures) had pay-fixed interest-rate swaps in place with a nominal value of £0.5bn (2016: £0.7bn), and its 
net debt was 88.9% fixed (2016: 94.9%). Based on the Group’s debt balances at 31 March 2017, a 1% increase in interest rates would increase the annual 
net finance expense in the income statement and reduce equity by £2m (2016: £2m). The sensitivity has been calculated by applying the interest rate 
change to the variable rate borrowings, net of interest-rate swaps and cash and cash equivalents.
Foreign exchange
Foreign exchange risk arises when future commercial transactions or recognised assets or liabilities are denominated in a currency that is not the 
Group’s functional currency.
As it is solely UK based, the Group does not frequently enter into any foreign currency transactions other than in connection with its financing activities. 
Where significant committed expenditure in foreign currencies is identified, it is the Group’s policy to hedge 100% of that exposure by entering into 
forward purchases of foreign currency to fix the Sterling value. At 31 March 2017, the Group had issued €307m, $118m and CHF35m of commercial 
paper, fully hedged through foreign exchange swaps. At 31 March 2016, the Group had no foreign currency exchange exposure. A 10% weakening or 
strengthening of Sterling would therefore have £nil (2016: £nil) impact on the Group’s income statement and equity. The Group’s foreign exchange risk 
is therefore low.

Valuation hierarchy
Interest-rate swaps, foreign exchange swaps, the redemption liability and other investments are the only financial instruments which are carried at fair 
value. For financial instruments other than borrowings disclosed in note 21, the carrying value in the balance sheet approximates their fair values. The 
table below shows the aggregate assets and liabilities carried at fair value by valuation method:

Note:
Level 1: valued using unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical financial instruments.
Level 2: valued using techniques based on information that can be obtained from observable market data.
Level 3: valued using techniques incorporating information other than observable market data.
The fair value of the Group’s finance lease obligations, using a discount rate of 4.2% (2016: 4.9%), is £42m (2016: £18m).
The fair value of the redemption liability is determined as the present value of the amount the Group would be required to pay to settle the liability (an 
exit price). The fair value is calculated by reference to the net assets of the underlying subsidiary. The valuation is not based on observable market data 
and therefore the redemption liability is considered to fall within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
The fair value of the other investments is calculated by reference to the net assets of the underlying entity. The valuation is not based on observable 
market data and therefore the other investments are considered to fall within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.

This section focuses on our working capital balances, including trade and other receivables, trade and other payables, and provisions.
26. Trade and other receivables
 Accounting policy
Trade and other receivables are recognised initially at fair value, subsequently at amortised cost and, where relevant, adjusted for the time value of 
money. A provision for impairment is made where there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the 
original terms of the receivables concerned. If collection is expected in more than one year, the balance is presented within non-current assets.

28. Investments in subsidiary undertakings
 Accounting policy
Investments in subsidiary undertakings are stated at cost in the Company’s balance sheet, less any provision for impairment in value.
In accordance with ‘IFRS 2 – Share Based Payments’ the equity settled share-based payment charge for the employees of the Company’s subsidiaries is 
treated as an increase in the cost of investment in the subsidiaries, with a corresponding increase in the Company’s equity.

 Accounting policy
Contributions to defined contribution schemes are charged to the income statement as incurred.
The pension obligations arising under the Group’s defined benefit pension scheme are measured at discounted present value. The scheme assets  
are measured at fair value, except annuities, which are valued to match the liability or benefit value. The operating and financing costs of the  
scheme are recognised separately in the income statement. Service costs are spread using the projected unit credit method. Net financing costs  
are recognised in the period in which they arise, calculated with reference to the discount rate, and are included in finance income or expense on  
a net basis. Re-measurement gains and losses arising from either experience differing from previous actuarial assumptions, or changes to those 
assumptions, are recognised immediately in other comprehensive income.
Defined contribution schemes
The charge to operating profit for the year in respect of the defined contribution scheme was £3m (2016: £2m).
Defined benefit scheme
The Pension & Assurance Scheme of the Land Securities Group of Companies (the Scheme) is a registered defined benefit final salary scheme subject  
to the UK regulatory framework for pensions, including the Scheme Specific Funding requirements. The Scheme is operated under trust and as such, the 
Trustees of the Scheme are responsible for operating the Scheme and they have a statutory responsibility to act in accordance with the Scheme’s Trust 
Deed and Rules, in the best interest of the beneficiaries of the Scheme, and UK legislation (including trust law). The Trustees and the Group have the 
joint power to set the contributions that are paid to the Scheme.
In setting contributions to the Scheme, the Trustees and the Group are guided by the advice of a qualified independent actuary on the basis of triennial 
valuations using the projected unit credit method. As the Scheme is closed to new members, the current service cost is expected to increase as a 
percentage of salary of the Scheme members, under the projected unit credit method, as members approach retirement. A full actuarial valuation  
of the Scheme was undertaken on 30 June 2015 by the independent actuaries, Hymans Robertson LLP . This valuation was updated to 31 March 2017 
using, where required, assumptions prescribed by IAS 19, ‘Employee Benefits’ . The next full actuarial valuation will be performed as at 30 June 2018.
As a result of the 30 June 2015 valuation, the employer contribution rate increased from 1 April 2016 to 43.1% (from 36.1%) of pensionable salary to 
cover the costs of accruing benefits. It was agreed that no further deficit contributions were required from the Group. Employee contributions are paid 
by salary sacrifice, and therefore appear as Group contributions. In the year ended 31 March 2017, employee contributions were 8.0% (2016: 8.0%) of 
monthly pensionable salary. The Group expects to make total employee and employer contributions of around £1m (2016: £1m) to the Scheme in the 
year to 31 March 2018.
All death-in-service and incapacity benefits arising during employment are wholly insured. No post-retirement benefits other than pensions are made 
available to employees of the Group.

Net pension surplus 14 25
During the year, the Scheme sold some corporate bonds and gilts to purchase a buy-in policy with Just Retirement for £111m. This insurance contract is 
valued as an asset using the same IAS 19 assumptions. Insurance contracts are annuities which are unquoted assets. All other Scheme assets have 
quoted prices in active markets. The Scheme assets do not include any directly owned financial instruments issued by the Group. Indirectly owned 
financial instruments had a fair value of £0.1m (2016: £0.1m).
The defined benefit scheme liabilities are split 11% (2016: 12%) in respect of active scheme participants, 25% (2016: 27%) in respect of deferred scheme 
participants, and 64% (2016: 61%) in respect of retirees. The weighted average duration of the defined benefit scheme liabilities at 31 March 2017 is  
17.3 years (2016: 16.7 years). 148 Landsec Annual Report 2017
32. Net pension surplus continued
The assumptions agreed with the Trustees of the Scheme for the triennial valuation at 30 June 2015 have been restated to the assumptions described by 
IAS 19, ‘Employee Benefits’ . The major assumptions used in the valuation were (in nominal terms):
Group
2017
%
2016
%
Rate of increase in pensionable salaries 3.40 3.15
Rate of increase in pensions with no cap 3.40 3.15

Discount rate 2.55 3.50
Inflation – Retail Price Index 3.40 3.15
 – Consumer Price Index 2.60 2.35
The mortality assumptions used in this valuation were:
Group
2017
Years
2016
Years
Life expectancy at age 60 for current pensioners – Men 30.8 29.6
 – Women 31.2 31.0
Life expectancy at age 60 for future pensioners (current age 40) – Men 33.8 33.2
 – Women 33.7 33.5
The sensitivities regarding the principal assumptions used to measure the Scheme liabilities are set out below. These were calculated using approximate 
methods taking into account the duration of the Scheme liabilities.
Assumption Change in assumption Impact on scheme liabilities
Discount rate Increase/decrease by 0.5% Decrease/increase by £21m
Rate of mortality Increase by 1 year Increase by £9m
Rate of inflation Increase/decrease by 0.5% Increase/decrease by £18m
As the above table demonstrates, changes in assumptions can have a significant impact on the Scheme liabilities. The assumptions agreed with the 
Trustees of the Scheme for the triennial valuation and subsequent interim updates differ from those prescribed by IAS 19, ‘Employee Benefits’ . Using the 
assumptions agreed with the Trustees would result in a balance sheet deficit for the Scheme of £8m at 31 March 2017, as opposed to a surplus of £14m.
In order to reduce risk within the Scheme, 48% (2016: 7%) of the Scheme assets are invested in annuities that match the liabilities of some pensioners. 
The assets that the Scheme holds are designed to match a significant proportion of the Scheme liabilities and the Scheme has hedged over 72% (2016: 
75%) of the inflation and interest rate risks (when measured on a gilts flat discount rate) to which it is exposed.
The Company did not operate any defined contribution schemes or defined benefit schemes during the financial year ended 31 March 2017 or in the 
previous financial year.

33. Share-based payments 
 Accounting policy
The cost of granting shares, options over shares and other share-based remuneration to employees and Executive Directors is recognised through the 
income statement. All awards are equity settled and therefore the fair value is measured at the grant date. Where the awards have non-market related 
performance criteria, the Group uses the Black-Scholes option valuation model to establish the relevant fair values. Where the awards have Total 
Shareholder Return (TSR) market related performance criteria, the Group has used the Monte Carlo simulation valuation model to establish the relevant 
fair values. The resulting values are amortised through the income statement over the vesting period of the awards. For awards with non-market related 
criteria, the charge is reversed if it appears probable that the performance or service criteria will not be met.
The following table analyses the total cost recognised in the income statement for the year between each plan, together with number of  
options outstanding.

A summary of the main features of each type of plan is given below. The plans have been split into two categories: Executive plans and other plans.  
For further details on the Executive plans, see the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 76 to 91.
Executive plans:
Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)
The LTIP is open to Executive Directors and Senior Management, with awards made at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee. In addition, other 
than for Executive Directors, an award of ‘matching shares’ can be made where the individual acquires shares in Land Securities Group PLC and pledges 
to hold them for a period of three years. Awards of LTIP shares and matching shares are subject to the same performance criteria and normally vest 
after three years. Awards may be satisfied by the issue of new shares, the transfer of treasury shares, other shares or nil cost options. The awards will be 
issued at nil consideration, subject to performance and vesting conditions being met. The weighted average share price at the date of vesting during 
the year was 1,006p (2016: 1,262p). The estimated fair value of awards granted during the year under the scheme was £4m (2016: £4m).
Deferred bonus share plan
The Executive Directors’ and Managing Directors’ annual bonus is structured in two distinct parts made up of an initial payment and deferred shares. 
The shares are deferred for one or two years and are not subject to additional performance criteria. Awards are satisfied by the transfer of existing 
shares held by the Employee Benefit Trust (EBT) at nil consideration, or by nil cost options. The weighted average share price at the date of vesting 
during the year was 887p (2016: 1,227p). The estimated fair value of awards granted during the year under the scheme was £0.8m (2016: £1.5m).
Other plans:
Executive share option scheme (ESOS)
The 2005 ESOS is open to managers not eligible to participate in the LTIP . Awards are discretionary and are granted over ordinary shares of the 
Company at the middle market price on the three dealing days immediately preceding the date of grant. Awards normally vest after three years and 
are not subject to performance conditions. Awards are satisfied by the transfer of shares from the EBT and lapse 10 years after the date of grant. The 
weighted average share price at the date of exercise for awards exercised during the year was 1,053p (2016: 1,249p). The estimated fair value of awards 
granted during the year under the scheme was £0.3m (2016: £0.3m).
Savings related share option plan
Under the savings related share option plan, Executive Directors and other eligible employees are invited to make regular monthly contributions into a 
Sharesave plan operated by Equiniti. On completion of the three or five year contract period, ordinary shares in the Company may be purchased at a 
price based upon the market price at date of invitation less 20% discount. The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for awards exercised 
during the year was 1,046p (2016: 1,238p). The estimated fair value of awards granted during the year under the scheme was £0.2m (2016: £0.3m). 150 Landsec Annual Report 2017

Expected dividend yield 3.48% 2.40% nil nil 3.48% 2.40% 2.94% 2.49%
Expected volatility is determined by calculating the historic volatility of the Group’s share price over the previous ten years. The expected life used in the 
model has been determined based upon management’s best estimate for the effects of non-transferability, vesting/exercise restrictions and 
behavioural considerations. Risk-free rate is the yield at the date of the grant of an award on a gilt-edged stock with a redemption date equal to the 
anticipated vesting of that award.
Fair value inputs for awards with market performance conditions
Fair values are calculated using the Monte Carlo simulation option pricing model for awards with market performance conditions. Awards made under 
the 2005 LTIP which were granted after 31 March 2009 include a TSR condition, which is a market-based condition. The inputs into this model for the 
scheme are as follows:

34. Ordinary share capital
 Accounting policy
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. External costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares are shown in equity as a deduction from 
the proceeds.
The consideration paid by any Group entity to acquire the Company’s equity share capital, including any directly attributable incremental costs, is 
deducted from equity until the shares are cancelled, reissued or disposed. Where own shares are sold or reissued, the net consideration received is 
included in equity. Shares acquired by the Employee Benefit Trust (EBT) are presented on the Group balance sheet as ‘own shares’ . Purchases of treasury 
shares are deducted from retained earnings.

 Accounting policy
The Group earns rental income by leasing its properties to tenants under non-cancellable operating leases. Leases in which substantially all risks and 
rewards of ownership are retained by another party, the lessor, are classified as operating leases. Payments, including prepayments, made under 
operating leases (net of any incentives received from the lessor) are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of  
the lease.
At the balance sheet date, the Group had contracted with tenants to receive the following future minimum lease payments:

The total of contingent rents recognised as income during the year was £45m (2016: £43m).
39. Events after the reporting period
On 13 April 2017, the Group’s joint arrangement, The Metro Shopping Fund Limited Partnership (Metro), completed the sale of ShopStop, Clapham 
Junction to DV4 (a fund owned by Delancey Real Estate Asset Management Limited (Delancey)). On the same date Delancey sold its stake in Metro to 
Invesco Real Estate European Fund. The partnership was subsequently renamed The Southside Limited Partnership and the £85m third-party debt in the 
fund was repaid in full. 
Since 31 March 2017, the Group has redeemed the £273m Queen Anne’s Gate bond in its entirety at a premium of £63m. The redemption was financed 
through existing Group facilities.
On 15 May 2017, the Group acquired three retail outlet centres from Britel Fund Trustees Limited (as trustee of the BT Pension Scheme). The three assets, 
Freeport, Braintree, Clarks Village, Street and Junction 32, Castleford, were acquired for a total consideration of £333m.

Reconciliation of segmental information note to statutory reporting
The table below reconciles the Group’s income statement to the segmental information note (note 4 to the financial statements). The Group’s income 
statement is prepared using the equity accounting method for joint ventures and includes 100% of the results of the Group’s non-wholly owned 
subsidiaries. In contrast, the segmental information note is prepared on a proportionately consolidated basis and excludes the non-wholly owned 
share of the Group’s subsidiaries. This is consistent with the financial information reviewed by management.

3.  Our NIY and Topped-up NIY relate to the Combined Portfolio, excluding properties in the development programme that have not yet reached practical completion, and are calculated by our 
external valuer. EPRA NIY and EPRA Topped-up NIY calculations are consistent with ours, but exclude all developments. 
4. Our measure reflects voids in our like-for-like portfolio only. The EPRA measure reflects voids in the Combined Portfolio excluding only the development programme. 
5.  The EPRA cost ratio is calculated based on gross rental income after rents payable, whereas our measure is based on gross rental income before rents payable. We do not calculate a cost ratio 
excluding direct vacancy costs as we do not consider this to be helpful.

Creating jobs and opportunities
Commitment
Employment: Help a total of 1,200 disadvantaged people to secure jobs 
by 2020. 
Performance
Since 2011 we have secured employment for 962 people from 
disadvantaged backgrounds. In 2016/17, 183 jobs have been secured 
(134 in London and 49 in Retail).

Commitment
Fairness: Ensure the working environments we control are fair and ensure 
that everyone who is working on our behalf – within an environment we 
control – is paid at least the Foundation Living Wage by 2020.
Performance
Landsec received accreditation from the Living Wage Foundation in March 
2017. We have a milestone programme now in place so that we can meet 
our 2020 commitment. 
Commitment
Diversity: Make measurable improvements to the profile – in terms of 
gender, ethnicity and disability – of our employee mix. 
Performance
With 36% of our management being female, we already exceed the recent 
Hampton-Alexander recommendations for females at our Executive 
Committee and senior leader level (combined percentage of 33%) and 
female representation has increased by 1% overall. We’ve also seen an 
increase of 3% in employees identified as black, asian or mixed ethnicity.

Commitment
Health, safety and security: Maintain an exceptional standard of health, 
safety and security in all the working environments we control.
Performance
This year we continued sharing best practice through our ‘One Best Way’ 
guidelines and our Health and Safety pledge, which new starters and 
external customers signed up to. We also maintained our OHSAS 18001 
certification, the benchmark for health and safety management systems. Additional information

Efficient use of natural resources
Commitment
Renewables: Continue to procure 100% renewable electricity across our 
portfolio and achieve 3 MW of renewable electricity capacity by 2030.
Performance
Our contract with SmartestEnergy has been in place since 1 April 2016; 
all electricity is from 100% renewable sources. We have agreed our new 
gas contract with Corona Energy which has taken effect from 1 April 2017. 
We are now procuring 15% of our total volume as green gas derived from 
100% waste streams. 
We have set a new metric to achieve 3 MW of renewable electricity 
capacity by 2030. Our current capacity is 0.6 MW, following the completion 
of our installations at Trinity Leeds and White Rose this will rise to 1.4 MW.
Commitment
Waste: Send zero waste to landfill with at least 75% recycled across all 
our operational and construction activities by 2020.
Performance
In 2016/17 we diverted 99.9% of waste from landfill and recycled 70.8%. 
This is an improvement from the year before which was 99.3% and 70.3%. 
Our London Portfolio continues to divert 100% from landfill with 77% of 
waste recycled. In our Retail Portfolio, we are diverting 99.9% from landfill 
and recycling 68.4%.
In construction activities for 2016/17, a total of 7,571 tonnes of construction 
waste was generated. Over 98% was recycled, with less than 2% being 
sent to landfill.

Performance
We have reduced portfolio carbon intensity by 18.5% compared to 
our 2013/14 baseline. This has been achieved via reductions in energy 
consumption and assisted by favourable changes in the UK’s energy 
generation mix.

The above chart shows the energy intensity improvements we have made 
in our London and Retail portfolios and Landsec as whole. Office buildings 
in London naturally have a much higher energy intensity than Retail assets 
and we have reduced London Portfolio intensity by 14% since 2013/14.  
Our Retail Portfolio intensity has reduced by 3%. Overall we have  
reduced Combined Portfolio intensity by 13% and are on track to meet  
our 2030 commitment. 164 Landsec Annual Report 2017
Sustainable design and innovation
Commitment
Resilience: Assess and mitigate site-specific climate change adaptation 
risks that are material across our portfolio.
Performance
This is a new commitment for 2017 and work is in progress to assess our 
climate risks and determine opportunities for mitigation. This work will be 
undertaken in collaboration with our Group Research and Insurance teams.
Commitment
Embodied carbon: Carry out embodied carbon analysis to inform the 
selection and procurement of building materials to reduce environmental 
impacts. Achieve at least a 15% reduction in embodied carbon.
Performance
Our Westgate Oxford development set an ultra-low carbon target 
requiring the reduction of embodied carbon by 25,777 tonnes. We’re 
delighted to report that we’ve met this target, avoiding over 30,000 
tonnes of embodied carbon emissions. This equates to an 18% saving, 
exceeding our corporate commitment. These are the emissions that would 
have been created if we’d used the initial design, which we’ve avoided 
through design development. This means the building has avoided as 
many emissions as it will generate over the next 30 years.
Commitment
Biodiversity: Maximise the biodiversity potential of all our development 
and operational sites and achieve a 25% biodiversity net gain across our 
five sites currently offering the greatest potential, by 2030.
Performance
We are focussing our work on the five sites that offer the greatest 
biodiversity potential. These are: Bluewater, Kent; Gunwharf Quays, 
Portsmouth; St David’s, Cardiff; The Galleria, Hatfield and White Rose, 
Leeds. We have identified opportunities to enhance biodiversity at each of 
these sites and expect to begin implementation next year.
The table below lists the five sites and rating classifications

Commitment
Wellbeing: Ensure our buildings are designed and managed to maximise 
wellbeing and productivity.
Progress
We have conducted a trial of WELL certification on the fit out of our new 
headquarters at 80-100 Victoria Street, SW1 to learn more about the 
process. The design incorporated many wellbeing features, and was 
recognised by staff in the Leesman® Workplace Survey, which ranked 
Landsec in the top 3% of companies surveyed. This performance will 
enable us to help our customers deliver WELL projects for their employees 
in the future.

performance and rates it on a scale which includes Pass, Good, Very Good, 
Excellent or Outstanding.
Greenhouse gas reporting
We report our full greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions annually in 
accordance to the World Resources Institute’s Greenhouse Gas Protocol. 
Landsec is also committed to EPRA Best Practice Recommendations for 
Sustainability reporting, for which we have won a Gold award for three 
years running. We believe that such reporting improves transparency and 
performance. We report our data using an operational control approach 
to define our organisational boundary. A detailed description of our 
reporting methodology and data, including our EPRA figures, can be 
found at www.landsec.com/sustainability
GHG emissions are broken down into three scopes, Scope 1,2 and 3.
Scope 1 emissions are direct emissions from activities controlled by 
us that release emissions into the atmosphere, whereas Scope 2 emissions 
are indirect emissions associated with our consumption of purchased 
energy. Scope 2 emissions are reported using both the ‘location-based’ 
and ‘market-based’ accounting methods. Location-based emissions are 
reported using UK Government Greenhouse gas reporting – Conversion 
factors 2016. Market-based emissions are reported using the conversion 
factor associated with each individual electricity supply as per the 
supplier’s guidance. Scope 1 emissions are currently reported using only  
the location-based method.
Scope 3 emissions are those that are a consequence of our actions, 
but which occur at sources we do not own or control and which are not 
classed as Scope 2 emissions. The GHG Protocol identifies 15 categories  
of which eight are directly relevant for Landsec.

Total GHG emissions using location-based emission factors have dropped 
by 8% since the previous year. This has been driven by a reduction in 
electricity consumption and the drop in national emission factors due to 
a cleaner energy mix. In terms of market-based emissions we have seen 
a significant reduction of 58%. This has been due to our move to 100% 
renewable electricity via our contract with SmartestEnergy. 
This is the first year where we have fully reported our Scope 3 
emissions having worked with the Carbon Trust to establish an accurate 
and repeatable methodology. We believe it was important to do so to fully 
understand and disclose the total emissions associated with our business. 
The table below provides a breakdown of our entire emission inventory 
including Scope 3.

The GHG Protocol splits Scope 3 emissions into 15 categories. We assessed 
each one individually and decided which ones were applicable to our 
business. For the categories that are applicable we have obvious hot spots 
which are highlighted below:
Landsec – Scope 3 GHG emissions 2016/17 (%) Table 112
Capital goods 45.82%  
Downstream leased assets 41.76%  
Purchased goods and services (PG&S) 9.96%  
Fuel- and energy-related activities 2.26%  
Others 0.20%  
The two largest contributing categories are Capital goods and 
Downstream leased assets, making up 80% of our entire emissions. 
Capital goods include the emissions associated with the manufacture 
and transport of materials used within our construction activity and 
Downstream leased assets are those associated with our customers 
within our assets. We are working to reduce our impacts in these 
categories by working closer with our supply chain partners and 
customers on reduction strategies. 168 Landsec Annual Report 2017

Notes:
1.  The market value figures are determined by the Group’s 
external valuer.
2.  The valuation movement is stated after adjusting for the 
effect of SIC15 under IFRS.
3.  Refer to glossary for definition.
4.  Annualised rental income is annual ‘rental income’ (as 
defined in the glossary) at the balance sheet date, except 
that car park and commercialisation income are included 
on a net basis (after deduction for operational outgoings). 
Annualised rental income includes temporary lettings.
5.  Annualised net rent is annual cash rent, after the deduction 
of ground rents, as at the balance sheet date. It is 
calculated with the same methodology as annualised rental 
income but is stated net of ground rent and before SIC15 
adjustments.
6.  Net estimated rental value is gross estimated rental value, 
as defined in the glossary, after deducting expected ground 
rents.
7.  Gross estimated rental value (ERV) – refer to glossary for 
definition. The figure for proposed developments relates to 
the existing buildings and not the schemes proposed.
8.  Net initial yield – refer to glossary for definition. This 
calculation includes all properties including those sites with 
no income.
9.  Equivalent yield – refer to glossary for definition. Proposed 
developments are excluded from the calculation of 
equivalent yield on the Combined Portfolio.
10.  The like-for-like portfolio – refer to glossary for definition. 
Capital expenditure on refurbishments, acquisitions of head 
leases and similar capital expenditure has been allocated to 
the like-for-like portfolio in preparing this table.
11.  The development programme – refer to glossary for 
definition. Net initial yield figures are only calculated for 
properties in the development programme that have

Purpose and link to strategy Operation Opportunity Discretion
Base salary
 — To aid the recruitment, 
retention and motivation of 
high performing executives
 — To reflect the value of 
their experience, skills and 
knowledge, and importance 
to the business.
 — Reviewed annually, with effect from  
1 June, and reflects:
 — Increases throughout the rest of  
the business
 — Market benchmarking exercise 
undertaken periodically to ensure  
salaries are set at around the  
median of the market competitive  
level for people in comparable roles  
with similar levels of experience, 
performance and contribution
 — Changes in the scope of a Director’s  
role may also require a further 
adjustment to salary.
 — For 2017/18, the annual base 
salaries of the Executive 
Directors are £784,041 (Chief 
Executive), and £510,367 (Chief 
Financial Officer), representing 
a 2% increase
 — The maximum annual salary 
increase will not normally 
exceed the average increase 
across the rest of the workforce 
(2017/18: 2%). Higher increases 
will be exceptional, and made 
in specific circumstances, 
including:
 — Increase in responsibilities  
or scope of the role
 — To apply salary progression 
for a newly appointed 
Director
 — Where the Director’s salary 
has fallen below the  
market positioning.
 — The Committee has the discretion 
to determine the precise amount 
of base salary within the Policy, 
including approving the salary for 
a newly-appointed Director. It will 
also determine whether there are 
specific reasons to award salary 
increases greater than those for  
the wider workforce.
Benefits
 — To provide protection and 
market competitive benefits 
to aid recruitment and 
retention of high performing 
executives.
 — Directors receive a combination of:
 — Car allowance
 — Private medical insurance
 — Life assurance
 — Ill health income protection
 — Holiday and sick pay
 — Professional advice in connection with 
their directorship
 — Travel, subsistence and accommodation 
as necessary
 — Occasional gifts, for example appropriate 
long service or leaving gifts.

Annual bonus
 — To incentivise the delivery 
of stretching, near-term 
business targets and 
personal performance 
objectives
 — To reward near-term 
outperformance relative to 
industry benchmarks
 — Specific measures and 
targets, for example 
successful planning 
applications and asset 
management initiatives, will 
provide future opportunity 
for the business and will 
increase the value of our 
properties in the short term
 — Other KPIs, such as 
development lettings targets, 
are likely to have a significant 
impact on capital growth 
and long-term revenue  
profit performance
 — The ability to recognise 
performance through 
variable remuneration 
enables the Group to control 
its cost base flexibly and 
react to events and  
market circumstances
 — Deferral of a portion of 
annual bonuses into shares 
encourages a longer-
term focus aligned to 
shareholders’ interests  
and discourages excessive 
risk taking.
 — All measures and targets are reviewed and 
set by the Board at the beginning of the 
year and payments are determined by the 
Committee after the year end, based on 
performance against the targets set
 — Specific measures and targets will be set 
each year, but will always include a measure 
of Total Property Return versus that of  
the market
 — Other measures and targets will reflect 
the most critical business performance 
indicators for the year ahead, and will be 
both specific and measurable. Revenue 
Profit performance will always feature as  
a key measure
 — The achievement of on-target performance 
should result in a payment of 50% of the 
maximum opportunity (i.e. 75% of salary)
 — A small proportion (no more than 20% 
of base salary) of a Director’s bonus is 
based on the Committee’s assessment 
of the achievement of pre-set personal 
performance objectives
 — The structure of the plan incentivises 
outperformance by ensuring that the 
threshold targets are stretching
 — Bonuses up to 50% of salary are paid  
in cash
 — Any amounts in excess of 50% of salary are 
deferred into shares for one year
 — Any amounts in excess of 100% of salary are 
deferred into shares for two years
 — Deferred shares are potentially forfeitable 
if the executive leaves prior to the share 
release date
 — Bonus payments are not pensionable
 — Withholding and recovery provisions 
(malus and clawback) apply where any 
overpayment was made as a result of a 
material misstatement of the Company’s 
results or a performance condition, or  
where there has been fraud or gross 
misconduct, whether or not this caused  
the overpayment.
 — Minimum bonus payable is  
0% of salary
 — Maximum bonus potential is 
150% of salary.
 — The Committee has the discretion 
to set targets and measures  
each year
 — The outturns for the Group element 
of the bonus plan are calculated 
formulaically and therefore the 
Committee has no discretion to 
adjust these, unless it feels it is 
necessary to adjust them down
 — The Committee does have the 
discretion to award appropriate 
bonus payments under the 
individual element (maximum 
20% of base salary) to reflect the 
performance and contribution of  
an individual Director
 — Within the Policy, the Committee 
will retain flexibility including:
 — When to make awards  
and payments
 — How to determine the size of  
an award, a payment, or when 
and how much of an award 
should be payable
 — Who receives an award  
or payment
 — Whether a departing Director 
should receive a bonus and 
whether and what proportion 
of awards should be paid at 
the time of leaving or at a 
subsequent date
 — Whether a departing Director 
should be treated as a “good 
leaver” in respect of deferred 
bonus shares
 — How to deal with a change of 
control or any other corporate 
event which may require 
adjustments to awards
 — To determine that no bonus or a 
reduced bonus is payable where 
the performance of the business 
has been poor, notwithstanding 
the achievement of objectives.

Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)
 — Incentivises value creation 
over the long-term in excess 
of that created by general 
market increases
 — Rewards execution of  
our strategy and the long-
term outperformance of  
our competitors
 — Aligns the long-term interests 
of Directors and shareholders
 — Promotes retention.
 — The Committee may make an annual award 
of shares under the LTIP
 — Vesting is determined on the basis of the 
Group’s achievements against stretching 
performance targets over a fixed three year 
financial period and continued employment. 
There is no re-testing
 — The Committee reviews the measures, their 
relative weightings and targets prior to  
each award
 — The measures selected are relative and directly 
aligned to the interests of shareholders. 
50% of an award is weighted to a measure 
of Total Property Return versus the industry 
benchmark over a three year period and 50% 
to Total Shareholder Return versus our listed 
comparator group over a three year period
 — For each measure, no awards vest for 
performance below that of the benchmark. 
Only a proportion (20%) will vest for matching 
the performance of the benchmark and 
significant outperformance is required for the 
maximum award to vest
 — Awards will be satisfied by either newly issued 
shares or shares purchased in the market and 
any use of newly issued shares will be subject 
to the dilution limits contained in the scheme 
rules or approved by shareholders
 — Executive Directors are required to hold vested 
shares for a further two years (including post-
employment) following the three year vesting 
period expiry
 — Withholding and recovery provisions (malus 
and clawback) apply where any overpayment 
was made as a result of a material 
misstatement of the Company’s results or a 
performance condition or where there has 
been fraud or gross misconduct, whether or 
not this caused the overpayment.
 — Normal and current award  
limit – 300% of salary.
 — The outturns of the LTIP are 
calculated formulaically and 
therefore the Committee has  
no discretion to adjust these,  
unless it determines they should  
be adjusted down
 — Within the Policy, the Committee  
will retain flexibility including:
 — When to make awards  
and payments
 — How to determine the size  
of an award, a payment, or  
when and how much of an  
award should vest
 — Who receives an award  
or payment
 — Whether a departing Director  
is treated as a “good leaver” 
for the purposes of the LTIP and 
whether and what proportion of 
awards vest at the time of leaving 
or at a subsequent vesting date
 — How to deal with a change of 
control or any other corporate 
event which may require 
adjustments to awards.
Savings Related Share Option Scheme (SAYE Scheme)
 — To encourage all employees 
to make a long-term 
investment in the Company’s 
shares, through a savings-
related arrangement.
 — All employees, including Executive Directors, 
are entitled to participate in the SAYE Scheme 
operated by the Company in line with UK 
HMRC guidelines currently prevailing.
 — The maximum participation 
levels may vary in line with HMRC 
limits. For 2017/18, participants 
may save up to £500 per 
month for either three or five 
years, using their accumulated 
savings at the end of the period 
to purchase shares at a 20% 
discount to the market price  
at the date of grant.
 — The Policy will apply as stated.
 — Within the Policy, the Committee 
will retain the flexibility to determine 
whether a departing Executive 
Director should be treated as a 
“good leaver” .
Share ownership guidelines
 — To provide close alignment 
between the longer-term 
interests of Directors and 
shareholders in terms of the 
Company’s growth  
and performance.
 — Executive Directors are expected to build up 
and maintain shareholdings with a value set 
at a percentage of base salary:
 — Chief Executive – 250% of salary
 — Other Executive Directors – 200% of salary
These levels are normally required to be achieved 
within five years of appointment in order to 
qualify for future long-term incentive awards. 
Deferred or unvested share awards not subject  
to performance conditions may count towards 
the ownership levels on a net of tax basis.
 — In exceptional circumstances, the 
Committee may extend the period 
by which share ownership levels are 
required to be achieved by up to 
two years. 178 Landsec Annual Report 2017

Base fee
 — To aid the recruitment, retention and motivation 
of high performing Non-executive Directors
 — To reflect the time commitment given by  
Non-executive Directors to the business.
 — The Chairman is paid a single fee for all Board 
duties and the other Non-executive Directors 
receive a basic Board fee, with supplementary 
fees payable for additional responsibilities
 — Reviewed (but not necessarily changed) 
annually by the Board, having regard to 
independent advice and published surveys
 — The Chairman’s fee is also reviewed  
by the Board rather than the  
Remuneration Committee.
 — The current fees for Non-executive Directors are 
shown in the Annual Report on Remuneration in 
section 3.2
 — Non-executive Director fees are typically 
reviewed annually but increased every two to 
three years
 — Any increases reflect relevant benchmark data 
for Non-executive Directors in companies of 
a similar size and complexity, and the time 
commitment required.
Additional fees
 — To reflect the additional time commitment 
required from Non-executive Directors in chairing 
various Board sub-committees or becoming the 
Board’s Senior Independent Director.
 — Reviewed (but not necessarily changed) 
annually by the Board, having regard to 
independent advice and published surveys.
 — The opportunity depends on which, if any, 
additional roles are assumed by an individual 
Director over the course of their tenure
 — Any increases reflect relevant benchmark data 
for Non-executive Directors in companies of 
a similar size and complexity, and the time 
commitment required.
Other incentives and benefits
 — Non-executive Directors do not receive any 
other remuneration or benefits beyond the fees 
noted above. Expenses in relation to Company 
business will be reimbursed
 — If deemed necessary, and in the performance 
of their duties, Non-executive Directors may 
take independent professional advice at the 
Company’s expense.
n/a
Share ownership
 — To provide close alignment between the  
longer-term interests of Directors and 
shareholders in terms of the Company’s

Non-executive Directors to own shares with a 
value of 100% of annual fees within three years 
of appointment.
2. Non-executive Directors
Remuneration policy
continued Additional information
179 Landsec Annual Report 2017
3.1 Service Agreements – Executive Directors
The Executive Directors have Service Agreements 
with the Company which normally continue 
until the Director’s agreed retirement date or 
such other date as the parties agree. In line 
with Group policy, the Executive Directors’ 
employment can be terminated at any time  
by either party on giving 12 months’ prior  
written notice. 
The Company allows Executive Directors 
to hold external non-executive directorships, 
subject to the prior approval of the Board, and 
to retain fees from these roles.
3.2 Termination Provisions –  
Executive Directors
An Executive Director’s Service Agreement may 
be terminated without notice and without 
further payment or compensation, except for 
sums earned up to the date of termination, 
on the occurrence of certain events such as 
gross misconduct. The circumstances of the 
termination (taking into account the individual’s 
performance) and an individual’s opportunity 
to mitigate losses are taken into account by 
the Committee when determining amounts 
payable on termination, including pay in lieu 
of notice. The Group’s normal approach is to 
stop or reduce compensatory payments to 
former Executive Directors when they receive 
remuneration from other employment during 
the compensation period. The Company does 
not make any arrangements that guarantee 
pensions with limited or no abatement on 
severance or early retirement. There are no 
special provisions for Executive Directors with 
regard to compensation in the event of  
loss of office.
Any share-based entitlements granted 
under the Company’s share plans will be 
determined on the basis of the relevant 
plan rules. The default position is that any 
outstanding unvested awards automatically 
lapse on cessation of employment. However, 
under the rules of the LTIP , in certain prescribed 
circumstances, such as redundancy, disability, 
retirement or other circumstances at the 
discretion of the Committee (taking into 
account the individual’s performance and the 
reasons for their departure), “good leaver” 
status can be applied. For example, if an 
executive’s role has effectively been made 
redundant, and there are no significant 
performance issues, the Committee is likely to 
look favourably on the granting of some “good 
leaver” provisions. However, if an executive 
has resigned for a similar role in a competitor 
organisation then such provisions are extremely 
unlikely to apply. Where “good leaver” provisions 
in respect of share awards are deemed to be 
appropriate, a participant’s awards should 
vest on a time pro-rata basis and subject to 
the satisfaction of the relevant performance 
criteria with the balance of the awards lapsing. 
The Committee retains discretion to decide 
not to pro-rate if it is inappropriate to do so in 
particular circumstances. For the avoidance 
of doubt, if the termination of employment is 
not for one of the specified reasons, and the 
Committee does not exercise its discretion to 
allow an award to vest, all outstanding awards 
automatically lapse. 
3.3 Remuneration of newly appointed 
Executive Directors
The remuneration package for a new externally 
appointed Executive Director would be set in 
accordance with the terms of the Company’s 
approved remuneration policy in force at the 
time of appointment. At present, the Policy on 
base salary will apply, but the Committee has 
the flexibility to set the salary of a new hire at 
a discount to the market level initially, with 
a series of planned increases implemented 
over the following few years (subject to 
performance in the role) to bring the salary to 
the desired positioning. Only in very exceptional 
circumstances will the salary of a newly 
appointed Director exceed the market median 
benchmark for the role.
The annual bonus would operate in 
accordance with the terms of the approved 
policy, albeit with the opportunity pro-rated 
for the period of employment in the first year. 
Depending on the timing and responsibilities 
of the appointment, it may be necessary 
to set different performance measures and 
targets initially. The LTIP would also operate in 
accordance with the Policy. The maximum level 
of variable pay that may be offered to a new 
Executive Director is therefore at an aggregate 
maximum of 450% of salary. This limit does not 
include the value of any buy-out arrangements 
deemed appropriate (see below).
In addition to the elements of the 
remuneration package covered by the Policy, 
the Committee may “buy out” certain existing 
remuneration of an incoming Executive Director 
through the offer of either additional cash 
and/or share-based elements (on a one-time 
basis or ongoing) when it considers these 
to be in the best interests of the Company. 
Any such payments would be based solely on 
remuneration lost when leaving the former 
employer and would take into account the 
existing delivery mechanism (i.e. cash, shares, 
options), time horizons and performance 
conditions. 
In the case of an internally appointed 
Executive Director, any variable pay element 
awarded in respect of the prior role would be 
paid out according to its terms, adjusted as 
relevant to take into account the appointment. 
In addition, any other ongoing remuneration 
obligations existing prior to appointment  
would continue, provided that they are  
put to shareholders for approval at the  
earliest opportunity.
For external and internal appointments, 
the Committee may agree that the Company 
will meet certain relocation expenses, on a one 
time basis, as appropriate. Where a Director is 
recruited from overseas, flexibility is retained 
to provide benefits that take account of 
market practice in their country of residence. 
The Company may offer a cash amount 
on recruitment, payment of which may be 
staggered over a period of up to two years, to 
reflect the value of benefits a new recruit may 
have received from a former employer.
Shareholders will be informed of the 
remuneration package and all additional 
payments to newly appointed Executive 
Directors at the time of their appointment.
3.4 Chairman and Non-executive Directors’ 
Letters of Appointment
The Chairman and the Non-executive Directors 
do not have Service Agreements with the 
Company. Instead, each of them has a Letter of 
Appointment which sets out the terms of their 
appointment, including the three months’ prior 
written notice on which their appointment can 
be terminated by either party at any time. The 
dates of the current Letters of Appointment are 
shown in the Annual Report on Remuneration 
and these, together with the Executive Directors’ 
Service Agreements, are available for inspection 
at the Company’s registered office.
On appointment, the fee arrangements for 
a new Non-executive Director would be set in 
accordance with the approved remuneration 
policy in force at that time.

e-Communication
We encourage shareholders to consider receiving their communications

for this service, you should go to www.landsec.com/ investors or

UK Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) taxation and status  
on payment of dividends 
As a UK REIT, Landsec does not pay corporation tax on rental profit and 
chargeable gains relating to property rental business.
However, it is required to distribute at least 90% of its qualifying 
income as Property Income Distributions (PIDs) . A REIT may in addition 
pay ordinary dividends and this will be treated in the same way as 
dividends from non-REIT companies.
UK shareholders will be taxed on PIDs received at their full marginal 
tax rates and on ordinary dividends received in line with the dividend 
tax regime introduced by the Government on 6 April 2016 – for more 
information see www.gov.uk/tax-on-dividends.
For most shareholders, PIDs will be paid after deducting withholding 
tax at the basic rate.
However, certain categories of shareholder may be able to receive 
PIDs gross (i.e. without deduction of withholding tax). These categories 
are principally UK companies, charities, local authorities, UK pension 
schemes and managers of ISAs, PEPs and Child Trust Funds.
Further information on UK REITs and the forms required to be 
completed to apply for PIDs to be paid gross are available on the 
Company’s website or from the Registrar.
Payment of dividends to UK resident shareholders
Shareholders whose dividends are currently sent to their registered 
address may wish to consider having their dividends paid directly into 
their personal bank or building society account. This has a number 
of advantages, including the crediting of cleared funds on the actual 
dividend payment date. If you would like your future dividends paid in this 
way, you should contact the Registrar or complete a mandate instruction 
available from www.landsec.com/ investors and return it to the Registrar.  
Under this arrangement, dividend confirmations are still sent to your 
registered address.
Payment of dividends to non-UK resident shareholders
Instead of waiting for a sterling cheque to arrive by post, shareholders can 
request that their dividends be paid directly to a personal bank account 
overseas. This is a service which the Registrar can arrange in over 30 
different countries worldwide, and in local currencies, and it normally costs 
less than paying in a sterling cheque. For more information, you should 
contact the Registrar on +44 (0)121 415 7049 or download an application 
form online at www.shareview.co.uk. Alternatively, you can contact the 
Registrar at the address given above.
Dividend Reinvestment Plan (DRIP) 
The DRIP gives shareholders the opportunity to use cash dividends to 
increase their shareholding in Land Securities Group PLC. It is a convenient 
and cost-effective facility provided by Equiniti Financial Services Limited. 
Under the DRIP , cash dividends are used to buy shares in the market as 
soon as possible after the dividend payment, with any residual cash being 
carried forward to the next dividend payment.
Details of the DRIP , including terms and conditions and participation 
election forms, are available at www.landsec.com/investors.

share at 31 March 1982, adjusted for the capitalisation issue in  
November 1983 and the Scheme of Arrangement in September 2002,  
was 203p. On the assumption that the 5 for 8 Rights Issue in March 2009

Shareholder security
Over the past few months, some of our shareholders have received 
unsolicited telephone calls or correspondence concerning investment 
matters from organisations or persons claiming or implying that they have 
some connection with the Company. These are typically from purported 
‘brokers’ who offer to buy shares at a price often far in excess of their 
market value. These operations are commonly known as ‘boiler rooms’ .
Shareholders are advised to be very wary of any offers of unsolicited 
advice, discounted shares, premium prices for shares they own or free 
reports into the Company. If you receive any such unsolicited calls, 
correspondence or investment advice:
 — ensure you get the correct name of the person and firm;
 — check that the firm is on the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) 
Register to ensure they are authorised at www.register.fsa.org.uk;
 — use the details on the FCA Register to contact the firm;
 — call the FCA Consumer Helpline (0800 111 6768) if there are no contact 
details in the Register or you are told they are out of date; and
 — if you feel uncomfortable with the call or the calls persist,  
simply hang up.
Additionally, feel free to report and/or discuss any shareholder  
security matters with the Company. To do this, please call  
+44 (0)20 7413 9000 and ask to be put through to a member of  
the Company Secretarial department.
1.  Lines are open 8.30am to 5.30pm (UK time), Monday to Friday, excluding public holidays. 
Calls are charged at the standard geographic rate and will vary by provider. Calls from outside 
the UK will be charged at the applicable international rate. 186 Landsec Annual Report 2017

when not wholly owned, together with our share of investment 
properties held in our joint ventures. 
Completed developments
Completed developments consist of those properties previously 
included in the development programme, which have been 
transferred from the development programme since 1 April 2015.
Development pipeline
The development programme together with 
proposed developments.
Development programme
The development programme consists of committed 
developments (Board approved projects with the building 
contract let), authorised developments (Board approved), 
projects under construction and developments which have 
reached practical completion within the last two years but are 
not yet 95% let.

Company immediately after the relevant dividend payment 
date. Full details appear on the Company’s website.
Earnings per share 
Profit after taxation attributable to owners of the parent 
divided by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in 
issue during the year.
EPRA
European Public Real Estate Association.
EPRA net initial yield
EPRA net initial yield is defined within EPRA’s Best Practice 
Recommendations as the annualised rental income based 
on the cash rents passing at the balance sheet date, less non-
recoverable property operating expenses, divided by the gross 
market value of the property. It is consistent with the net initial 
yield calculated by the Group’s external valuer.
Equivalent yield
Calculated by the Group’s external valuer, equivalent yield is 
the internal rate of return from an investment property, based 
on the gross outlays for the purchase of a property (including 
purchase costs), reflecting reversions to current market rent 
and such items as voids and non-recoverable expenditure 
but ignoring future changes in capital value. The calculation 
assumes rent is received annually in arrears. 
ERV – Gross estimated rental value 
The estimated market rental value of lettable space as 
determined biannually by the Group’s external valuer. For 
investment properties in the development programme, which 
have not yet reached practical completion, the ERV represents 
management’s view of market rents.
Fair value movement
An accounting adjustment to change the book value  
of an asset or liability to its market value (see also  
mark-to-market adjustment).
Finance lease
A lease that transfers substantially all the risks and rewards 
of ownership from the lessor to the lessee.
Net initial yield
Net initial yield is a calculation by the Group’s external valuer 
of the yield that would be received by a purchaser, based on 
the Estimated Net Rental Income expressed as a percentage 
of the acquisition cost, being the market value plus assumed 
usual purchasers’ costs at the reporting date. The calculation 
is in line with EPRA guidance. Estimated Net Rental Income 
is determined by the valuer and is based on the passing cash 
rent less ground rent at the balance sheet date, estimated non-
recoverable outgoings and void costs including service charges, 
insurance costs and void rates.
Net rental income
Net rental income is the net operational income arising from 
properties, on an accruals basis, including rental income, 
finance lease interest, rents payable, service charge income 
and expense, other property related income, direct property 
expenditure and bad debts. Net rental income is presented on 
a proportionate basis.
Over-rented
Space where the passing rent is above the ERV.
Passing cash rent
The estimated annual rent receivable as at the reporting date 
which includes estimates of turnover rent and estimates of 
rent to be agreed in respect of outstanding rent review or 
lease renewal negotiations. Passing cash rent may be more 
or less than the ERV (see over-rented, reversionary and ERV). 
Passing cash rent excludes annual rent receivable from units in 
administration save to the extent that rents are expected to be 
received. Void units and units that are in a rent-free period at 
the reporting date are deemed to have no passing cash rent. 
Although temporary lets of less than 12 months are treated 
as void, income from temporary lets is included in passing 
cash rents.
Planning permission
There are two common types of planning permission: full 
planning permission and outline planning permission. A full 
planning permission results in a decision on the detailed 
proposals on how the site can be developed. The grant of a 
full planning permission will, subject to satisfaction of any 
conditions, mean no further engagement with the local 
planning authority will be required to build the consented 
development. An outline planning permission approves 
general principles of how a site can be developed. Outline 
planning permission is granted subject to conditions known 
as ‘reserved matters’ . Consent must be sought and achieved 
for discharge of all reserved matters within a specified time-
limit, normally three years from the date outline planning 
permission was granted, before building can begin. In both the 
case of full and outline planning permission, the local planning 
authority will ‘resolve to grant permission’ . At this stage, the 
planning permission is granted subject to agreement of legal 
documents, in particular the s106 agreement. On execution 
of the s106 agreement, the planning permission will be issued. 
Work can begin on satisfaction of any ‘pre-commencement’ 
planning conditions. 
Pre-let
A lease signed with an occupier prior to completion of 
a development.
Pre-development properties
Pre-development properties are those properties within 
the like-for-like portfolio which are being managed to align 
vacant possession within a three year horizon with a view to 
redevelopment.
Property Income Distribution (PID)
A PID is a distribution by a REIT to its shareholders paid out of 
qualifying profits. A REIT is required to distribute at least 90% 
of its qualifying profits as a PID to its shareholders.
Proposed developments
Proposed developments are properties which have not yet 
received final Board approval or are still subject to main 
planning conditions being satisfied, but which are more likely 
to proceed than not.
Qualifying activities/ Qualifying assets
The ownership (activity) of property (assets) which is held to 
earn rental income and qualifies for tax-exempt treatment 
(income and capital gains) under UK REIT legislation.
Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT)
A REIT must be a publicly quoted company with at least three-
quarters of its profits and assets derived from a qualifying 
property rental business. Income and capital gains from 
the property rental business are exempt from tax but the 
REIT is required to distribute at least 90% of those profits to 
shareholders. Corporation tax is payable on non-qualifying 
activities in the normal way.
Gearing
Total borrowings, including bank overdrafts, less short-term 
deposits, corporate bonds and cash, at book value, plus 
cumulative fair value movements on financial derivatives as 
a percentage of total equity. For adjusted gearing, see note 20.
Gross market value
Market value plus assumed usual purchaser’s costs at the 
reporting date.
Head lease
A lease under which the Group holds an investment property.
Interest Cover Ratio (ICR)
A calculation of a company’s ability to meet its interest 
payments on outstanding debt. It is calculated using revenue 
profit before interest, divided by net interest (excluding the 
mark-to-market movement on interest-rate swaps, foreign 
exchange swaps, bond exchange de-recognition, capitalised 
interest and interest on the pension scheme assets and 
liabilities). The calculation excludes joint ventures. 
IPD
Refers to the MSCI IPD Direct Property indexes which measure 
the property level investment returns in the UK. 
Interest-rate swap
A financial instrument where two parties agree to exchange 
an interest rate obligation for a predetermined amount of time. 
These are generally used by the Group to convert floating-rate 
debt or investments to fixed rates.
Investment portfolio
The investment portfolio comprises the investment properties 
of the Group’s subsidiaries, on a proportionately consolidated 
basis where not wholly owned.
Joint venture
An arrangement in which the Group holds an interest and 
which is jointly controlled by the Group and one or more 
partners under a contractual arrangement. Decisions on the 
activities of the joint venture that significantly affect the joint 
venture’s returns, including decisions on financial and operating 
policies and the performance and financial position of the 
operation, require the unanimous consent of the partners 
sharing control.
Lease incentives
Any incentive offered to occupiers to enter into a lease. Typically, 
the incentive will be an initial rent-free period, or a cash 
contribution to fit-out or similar costs. For accounting purposes 
the value of the incentive is spread over the non-cancellable life 
of the lease.
LIBOR
The London Interbank Offered Rate, the interest rate charged 
by one bank to another for lending money, often used as a 
reference rate in bank facilities.
Like-for-like portfolio
The like-for-like portfolio includes all properties which have been 
in the portfolio since 1 April 2015, but excluding those which are 
acquired, sold or included in the development pipeline at any 
time since that date.
Loan-to-value (LTV) 
Group LTV is the ratio of adjusted net debt, including 
subsidiaries and joint ventures, to the sum of the market 
value of investment properties and the book value of trading 
properties of the Group, its subsidiaries and joint ventures, all 
on a proportionate basis, expressed as a percentage. For the 
Security Group, LTV is the ratio of net debt lent to the Security 
Group divided by the value of secured assets.
Market value
Market value is determined by the Group’s external valuer, in 
accordance with the RICS Valuation Standards, as an opinion 
of the estimated amount for which a property should exchange 
on the date of valuation between a willing buyer and a willing 
seller in an arm’s-length transaction after proper marketing. 
Mark-to-market adjustment
An accounting adjustment to change the book value of an asset 
or liability to its market value (see also fair value movement).
Net assets per share
Equity attributable to owners of the parent divided by the 
number of ordinary shares in issue at the year end. Net assets 
per share is also commonly known as net asset value per share 
(NAV per share). 188 Landsec Annual Report 2017
Rental value change
Increase or decrease in the current rental value, as determined 
by the Group’s external valuer, over the reporting period on a 
like-for-like basis.
Rental income
Rental income is as reported in the income statement, on 
an accruals basis, and adjusted for the spreading of lease 
incentives over the term certain of the lease in accordance with 
SIC 15. It is stated gross, prior to the deduction of ground rents 
and without deduction for operational outgoings on car park 
and commercialisation activities.
Return on average capital employed
Group profit before net finance expense, plus joint venture 
profit before net finance expense, divided by the average 
capital employed (defined as shareholders’ funds plus adjusted 
net debt).
Return on average equity
Group profit before tax plus joint venture tax divided by the 
average equity shareholders’ funds.
Revenue profit
Profit before tax, excluding profits on the sale of non-current 
assets and trading properties, profits on long-term development 
contracts, valuation movements, fair value movements on 
interest-rate swaps and similar instruments used for hedging 
purposes, the adjustment to finance expense resulting from 
the amortisation of the bond exchange de-recognition 
adjustment, debt restructuring charges, and any other items of 
an exceptional nature.
Reversionary or under-rented
Space where the passing rent is below the ERV.
Reversionary yield
The anticipated yield to which the initial yield will rise (or fall) 
once the rent reaches the ERV.
Scrip dividend
A scrip dividend is when shareholders are offered the 
opportunity to receive dividends in the form of shares instead 
of cash.
Security Group
Security Group is the principal funding vehicle for the Group 
and properties held in the Security Group are mortgaged for 
the benefit of lenders. It has the flexibility to raise a variety of 
different forms of finance.
Temporary lettings
Lettings for a period of one year or less. These are included 
within voids.
Topped-up net initial yield
Topped-up net initial yield is a calculation by the Group’s 
external valuer. It is calculated by making an adjustment to 
net initial yield in respect of the annualised cash rent foregone 
through unexpired rent-free periods and other lease incentives. 
The calculation is consistent with EPRA guidance.
Total business return
Dividend paid per share in the year plus the change in adjusted 
diluted net assets per share, divided by adjusted diluted net 
assets per share at the beginning of the year.
Total cost ratio
Total cost ratio represents all costs included within revenue 
profit, other than rents payable and financing costs, expressed 
as a percentage of gross rental income before rents payable. 
Total development cost (TDC)
Total development cost refers to the book value of the site 
at the commencement of the project, the estimated capital 
expenditure required to develop the scheme from the start 
of the financial year in which the property is added to our 
development programme, together with capitalised interest, 
being the Group’s borrowing costs associated with direct 
expenditure on the property under development. Interest is 
also capitalised on the purchase cost of land or property where 
it is acquired specifically for redevelopment. The TDC for trading 
property development schemes excludes any estimated tax 
on disposal.
Total property return
Valuation movement, profit/loss on property sales and net 
rental income in respect of investment properties expressed as 
a percentage of opening book value, together with the time 
weighted value for capital expenditure incurred during the 
current period, on the combined property portfolio.
Total Shareholder Return (TSR)
The growth in value of a shareholding over a specified period, 
assuming that dividends are reinvested to purchase additional 
units of the stock.
Trading properties
Properties held for trading purposes and shown as current 
assets in the balance sheet.
Turnover rent
Rental income which is related to an occupier’s turnover.
Valuation surplus/deficit
The valuation surplus/deficit represents the increase or decrease 
in the market value of the Combined Portfolio, adjusted for 
net investment. The market value of the Combined Portfolio is 
determined by the Group’s external valuer.
Voids
Voids are expressed as a percentage of ERV and represent all 
unlet space, including voids where refurbishment work is being 
carried out and voids in respect of pre-development properties. 
Temporary lettings for a period of one year or less are also 
treated as voids.
Weighted average cost of capital (WACC)
Weighted average cost of debt and notional cost of equity, 
used as a benchmark to assess investment returns.
Weighted average unexpired lease term
The weighted average of the unexpired term of all leases other 
than short-term lettings such as car parks and advertising 
hoardings, temporary lettings of less than one year, residential 
leases and long ground leases.
Yield shift
A movement (negative or positive) in the equivalent yield of 
a property asset.
Zone A
A means of analysing and comparing the rental value of retail 
space by dividing it into zones parallel with the main frontage. 
The most valuable zone, Zone A, is at the front of the unit. 
Each successive zone is valued at half the rate of the zone 
in front of it.
Glossary
continued Cautionary statement
This Annual Report and Landsec’s website may contain 
certain ‘forward-looking statements’ with respect to Land 
Securities Group PLC (“Company”) and the Group’s financial 
condition, results of its operations and business, and certain 
plans, strategy, objectives, goals and expectations with 
respect to these items and the economies and markets in 
which the Group operates.
Forward-looking statements are sometimes, but not 
always, identified by their use of a date in the future or such 
words as ‘anticipates’ , ‘aims’ , ‘due’ , ‘could’ , ‘may’ , ‘should’ , 
‘will’ , ‘would’ , ‘expects’ , ‘believes’ , ‘intends’ , ‘plans’ , ‘targets’ , 
‘goal’ or ‘estimates’ or, in each case, their negative or other 
variations or comparable terminology. Forward-looking 
statements are not guarantees of future performance. By 
their very nature, forward-looking statements are inherently 
unpredictable, speculative and involve risk and uncertainty 
because they relate to events and depend on circumstances 
that will occur in the future. Many of these assumptions, 
risks and uncertainties relate to factors that are beyond the 
Group’s ability to control or estimate precisely. There are a 
number of such factors that could cause actual results and 
developments to differ materially from those expressed or 
implied by these forward-looking statements. These factors 
include, but are not limited to, changes in the political 
conditions, economies and markets in which the Group 
operates (including the outcome of the negotiations to leave 
the EU); changes in the legal, regulatory and competition 
frameworks in which the Group operates; changes in the 
markets from which the Group raises finance; the impact 
of legal or other proceedings against or which affect the 
Group; changes in accounting practices and interpretation 
of accounting standards under IFRS, and changes in interest 
and exchange rates.  
Any forward-looking statements made in this Annual 
Report or Landsec’s website, or made subsequently, which 
are attributable to the Company or any other member of 
the Group, or persons acting on their behalf, are expressly 
qualified in their entirety by the factors referred to above. 
Each forward-looking statement speaks only as of the 
date it is made. Except as required by its legal or statutory 
obligations, the Company does not intend to update any 
forward-looking statements.
Nothing in this Annual Report or Landsec’s website 
should be construed as a profit forecast or an invitation to 
deal in the securities of the Company.
