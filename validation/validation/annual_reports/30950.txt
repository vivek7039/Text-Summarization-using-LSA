 Annual report and financial statements
For the year ended 31 December 2017
THE W ORLD’S LEADING  
SUPER Y A CHT SER VICE  
& SUPPL Y GROUP GYG is a market leading Superyacht painting, supply and maintenance 
company, offering services globally through operations in the 
Mediterranean, Northern Europe and the United States. The Company 
primarily trades under the Pinmar, Rolling Stock, Techno Craft and ACA 
Marine brands.
The Global Yachting Group was originally created in 2012 through the 
merger of the two leading Superyacht painting brands Pinmar and Rolling 
Stock; such expansion of the Group titled it as the only Superyacht painting 
company with global operations. In March 2017, the Group also acquired a 
majority stake in ACA Marine as part of its strategic growth plans in the 
European Superyacht finishing market. The Company was renamed GYG 
plc in July 2017 when it became a public company through an Initial Public 
Offering on the London Stock Exchange’s AIM market.
With over 70 years’ operating experience in the Superyacht industry  
and a highly-skilled workforce, GYG is a leading provider to the world’s 
superyacht fleet – including many of the largest ever built.
GYG is consistently at the forefront of new technology and continuously 
investing to improve efficiency, creativity and innovation – all backed up 
by strict quality control and the very best in after sales service.
Incorporated in the UK with its registered office in London, the Company’s 
principal operational base is in Palma de Mallorca, Spain. The Company 
also has offices in Barcelona, France, Germany, Holland, Italy, Monaco, the 
UK and the USA (namely Fort Lauderdale, West Palm Beach and Savannah, 
Georgia), giving the Group very broad international service capability –  
no matter the size or location of the project. C O NTENT S

Annual report and financial statements 2017 05
Overview THE PINMAR P AINT S T AND ARD
Introduced in 2011, the Pinmar Paint Standard was the 
industry’s first comprehensive statement of how a 
client’s expected paint finish should be measured  
and agreed. Designed to be universally-understood,  
it remains the most exacting and comprehensive 
guideline in existence and defines the high standard 
achievable on paint applications.
The Pinmar Paint Standard includes measuring methods 
and specific acceptance criteria applying to: Colour 
Shade, Gloss, Distinction of Image, Paint Film Thickness 
and Dust, as well as Fairing Straightness and other 
relevant criteria for New Builds.
Discussed, developed and agreed with leading 
paint manufacturers, the most important elements 
behind the Pinmar Paint Standard are used to 
establish if:
•  The chosen topcoat is fit for purpose;
•  The acceptance criteria can be achieved on the vessel, 
taking into account the environmental conditions 
available and the age and condition of the yacht and  
its existing paint system;
•  The topcoats applied reach the empirically measured 
expectations of the client.
The 2017 edition of The Superyacht Forum in Amsterdam 
saw the launch of the Pinmar Paint Standard 2.0. prompted 
both by the entry of new paint manufacturers to the 
market and changes to the technical formulation and 
performance of Superyacht paint products, the new 
standard takes into account the growing trend for darker 
pigments, metallic and pearlescent finishes. The Pinmar 
Standard 2.0 has been developed in consultation with the 
industry’s leading manufacturers and coating consultants, 
having analysed research data, and both test and live 
project results.
This new standard will give Pinmar clients an even better 
understanding of the quality and performance of their 
paint work, together with improved peace of mind during 
the warranty period – and beyond.
GYG’s operations can be divided into three key sales channels:
• Refit (included in the Coating segment): repainting and finishing of superyachts, 
normally as part of a refit programme. Revenues also include scaffolding and 
containment work;
• New Build (included in the Coating segment): fairing and painting of new vessels  
as part of the build process; and
• Supply: selling and delivery of maintenance materials, consumables, spare parts  
and equipment primarily to trade customers.
Superyachts require a major survey service every five years to comply with certain 
class, maritime laws and insurance requirements. Owners typically undertake an annual 
haul out and general maintenance to remain ahead of the service intervals and to keep 
the vessels in optimum condition. Owners often use the major servicing period as an 
opportunity for repainting the vessel, providing GYG with a source of repeat business.

06 GYG plc REFIT
GYG has unrivalled experience in the 
Superyacht refit market and has painted 
more yachts over 30m than any other 
company. Today it dominates the 50m+ 
market where the complexities and 
challenges are greatest and decision 
makers, be they; captains, owners’ 
representatives, management companies 
or shipyards, are seeking the most qualified 
and experienced partners who can deliver 
the highest quality, mitigate risk and also 
provide the best warranty and after-sale 
service on a global basis. GYG has the  
most trusted brands in the industry.
Thanks to years-long relationships with all 
the leading shipyards, GYG can undertake 
paint finishing and refinishing contracts  
all over the world, complementing in-house 
teams and services. We harmoniously work 
alongside other trades during the busy 
closing stages of a project to safeguard 
delivery; on schedule, on budget and to the 
quality standard.
With our portfolio of brands GYG can offer 
the complete package including yacht 
hardware removal, scaffolding and 
containment, as well as the latest in dark 
pigment, metallic or pearlescent finishes. 
Our equipment is developed to 
accommodate advancing technology whilst 
always being conscious of the environment. 
As with new builds, refit clients benefit  
from the quality assurance and peace  
of mind generated by the Pinmar Paint 
Standard 2.0 and a global warranty.
NEW BUILD
The exterior finish of a superyacht is the 
final flourish in a long and complex build 
process. It is a key factor in ensuring the end 
product looks exceptional upon delivery. 
GYG’s businesses have been responsible for 
the finish on many of the world’s largest, 
most exciting and innovatively designed 
yachts for more than 40 years.
Through its close relationships with new 
build shipyards, GYG is involved at the 
outset of any project. This allows us to 
develop the best techniques, invest in the 
latest equipment and assemble the most 
experienced teams required to fair and 
paint these ever-larger and more 
complicated superyachts. Our highly 
developed production processes are 
designed to synchronise with those of the 
shipyard to ensure maximum efficiency, 
control and visibility during each project.
Our pioneering of the adoption of 
electrostatic paint spraying for Superyachts, 
a technology developed within the 
automobile industry, is a case in point. 
Electrostatic shooting offers significant 
advantages over conventional paint 
spraying, not least being a reduction in the 
time required to top-coat larger Superyachts 
as well as a 60% improvement in paint 
transfer which massively reduces the 
environmental impact.
GYG has completed projects up to 162.5 
metres in Spain, France, Germany, Holland, 
Italy, the UK and the USA. Entrusted with 
the world’s finest yachts, we do not take  
our responsibility lightly and continue to 
cement our reputation through consistent 
delivery of excellent results – on time and 
on budget.
SUPPLY
Based in Spain with the ability to serve 
clients anywhere in the world, Pinmar 
Supply offers a comprehensive selection  
of marine products to the trade, retail 
customers and direct provisioning to 
superyachts worldwide.
Retail Division – Our network of shops 
located in key marinas in Barcelona and 
Palma de Mallorca, together with a mobile 
fleet of vans, means our team of experts 
swiftly source and supply everything from 
urgent spare parts to specialist safety 
equipment, paints and primers to 
trendsetting water sport toys.
Global Supply Team – Entirely location 
neutral, our Global Supply Team is a lifeline 
for clients on the move, in refit or still  
under construction. 
Working alongside our logistics division, 
the Global Supply Team organises the 
delivery of goods anywhere in the world, 
dealing confidently with hazardous 
materials or tight deadlines.
Trade Distribution – As one of the leading 
distributors in Spain for many of the marine 
industry’s biggest brands, Pinmar Supply

leading prices. Our team has the product 
knowledge and technical knowhow to

right products for the job.
The Pinmar Supply team pride themselves 
on their product knowledge and 
commitment to customer service which,

makes for a very strong supply proposition.
Annual report and financial statements 2017 07
Overview I am delighted to present my first Chairman’s statement as a public company 
on behalf of the Board of GYG plc. 
2017 was a milestone year in the Group’s development, with a successful 
IPO on the AIM Market of the London Stock Exchange in July while also 
delivering another year of strong growth. The IPO raised £6.9m which was 
used to settle pre-existing shareholder loan notes, accrued interest and 
fees and expenses in relation to the IPO and by the end of the year, net 
debt had been reduced to ¤6.7m. Prior to the IPO, significant highlights 
included the acquisition of ACA Marine in March.
As such, our strengthened financial position provides us with  
a strong platform to support future growth and development 
of the Group. The enhanced credibility and profile that we have 
gained as a result of the IPO will continue to help us secure 
larger orders and develop further growth opportunities to 
generate long-term value for shareholders.
RESULTS
We have delivered solid revenue growth in the year, up 14.7%  
to ¤62.6m (FY16: ¤54.6m), reflecting a good performance 
across all divisions. Adjusted EBITDA increased 7.6% to ¤7.2m 
(FY16: ¤6.7m), with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 11.5%  
(FY16: 12.2%). We ended the year with a solid balance sheet 
and maintained cash at ¤6.2m at 31 December 2017 (¤6.2m at 
31 December 2016).
DIVIDEND
As stated in our Admission Document, the Board has adopted 
a progressive dividend policy with growth in line with the 
growth in future earnings and the Board is therefore pleased to 
recommend a total dividend of 3.2 pence per ordinary share 
for the year ended 31 December 2017, reflecting the 6 months 
from IPO to the financial year end. If approved by the 
shareholders at the Annual General Meeting on 29 May 2018, 
the dividend will be paid on 15 June 2018 to shareholders  
on the register on 4 May 2018. The ex-dividend date will be  
3 May 2018.
CURRENT TRADING & OUTLOOK
We have had an encouraging start to 2018, with trading in line 
with the Board’s expectations. The Group had a busy first 
quarter in refit including a number of jobs that were pushed 
back by the 2017 hurricanes and has seen significant growth  
to the forward Order Book, having signed some major new 
build projects which will come on-stream later this year and 
during 2019 and 2020. Management are highly focused on 
delivering growth across the divisions in 2018, and the wider 
GYG team is strongly motivated to continue to deliver  
a premium quality service to our existing and new customers.  
I would like to take this opportunity to thank all of our 
colleagues across the world for their continued hard work to 
deliver these results. The Group is well positioned to continue 
to create long-term value for all shareholders.

Overview C H I EF E X E C U T IV E’ S R EP O R T
REMY MILLOTT  
Chief Executive Officer
10 GYG plc
I am pleased to report on GYG’s first year end results as a public limited 
company. Our successful IPO in July 2017 was a major milestone for the 
Group, further strengthening its position as the global market leader in the 
superyacht painting, supply and maintenance sector. Together with the 
acquisition of the majority shareholding in ACA Marine, GYG’s flotation on 
AIM represented a significant achievement for the Board of our Company 
and I am grateful for the dedicated support of my fellow Directors.
The Group delivered strong results with revenue of ¤62.6m  
in the year ended 31 December 2017 reflecting a 14.7% increase 
compared to FY16, and adjusted EBITDA of ¤7.2m (FY16: 
¤6.7m), an increase of 7.6%. We ended the year with cash of 
¤6.2m on a par with the previous year and a stronger balance 
sheet, having repaid ¤4.3m of loan notes post the IPO.  
This was achieved alongside a busy corporate agenda and 
challenging market conditions in the latter half of the year. 
Strong revenue growth was achieved in the first half, however 
as previously announced, the third quarter refit programme 
was affected by the disruption to seasonal cruising patterns 
from an extraordinary sequence of hurricanes. This caused 
delays to several major projects, leading to a softening of 
revenues in the second half of the year. Despite this, I am 
pleased to report that refit showed a strong recovery in the 
fourth quarter and as far as we can see these project deferrals 
resulted in work being postponed into 2018. The Group is well 
positioned with a strong forward Order Book in a market 
segment which continues to exhibit solid growth.
STRATEGY
The Group’s strategy remains the same as that detailed in our 
Admission Document and we will continue to leverage our 
market leadership in the refit sector where GYG holds a 30% 
share (up from 29% at the time of flotation), an 86% customer 
retention rate, and a preferred supplier status with many of the 
leading refit shipyards in the core locations. Our addressable 
coating market is forecast to grow at 6% per annum and we 
have the platform in place to grow with and above the market. 
The Group is targeting regional developments in the refit 
market by continuing to engage and enter into new agreements 
with shipyards, further strengthening our market position. 
The Group aims to increase its market share in new build 
through an organic growth strategy. The Board believes that 
being a listed group provides reassurance to shipyards due  
to the scale and security of the Group and provides confidence 
to them regarding the risk of awarding these large contracts.
In the USA, we are particularly excited about the potential of 
the newly refurbished Savannah Yacht Center in Georgia 
(“SYC”). GYG entered into a memorandum of understanding 
with SYC in August 2016 to establish a new painting facility to 
cater for superyacht refit projects. Whilst GYG already has 
bases in Fort Lauderdale and West Palm Beach, these facilities 
are mainly servicing yachts up to 70 metres therefore SYC 
opens up the 70+ metre US market. Post period end, the 
Group’s US subsidiary, Pinmar USA, won the first significant 
refit project on a circa 70 metre Dutch-built superyacht which 
has started this month and will run for approximately 14 weeks. 
Management anticipates SYC to form a major part of the  
US growth strategy as this shipyard capacity comes fully  
on stream in Q3 2018.
The Board has further targeted improvements to gross margins 
which are underpinned by a programme of management 
initiatives to improve production processes and internal 
systems. As a Group, we will continue to invest in technological, 
operational and our human resource development which will 
contribute to margin improvement as well as preserving the 
market leadership status of our portfolio of brands. 
Finally, the Board continues to evaluate earnings enhancing 
acquisitions to increase market share and enable expansion 
into new geographic markets or new complementary services 
to support the Group’s long-term strategy. Annual report and financial statements 2017 11

DIVISIONAL REVIEW
GYG is a market leading superyacht painting, supply and 
maintenance company offering its services globally through 
operations in the Mediterranean, Northern Europe and the 
USA. The Company’s brands include Pinmar, Rolling Stock, 
Pinmar Supply, Pinmar USA, Techno Craft and ACA Marine. 
GYG’s operations are separated into two divisions, Coating  
and Supply. 
The AIM IPO has certainly raised the profile of the Group 
providing a platform to engage directly with significant 
industry participants whilst giving corporate credibility and 
additional certainty to existing and potential clients. This has 
enabled the Group to continue growing market share in a 
growing market. In particular, the management team has a 
strategic focus on new build where it is looking to increase 
GYG’s market share as that market itself continues to expand.
COATING DIVISION 
This division, consisting of the refit and new build markets, 
performed very well in 2017 with revenue increasing 16.7%  
to ¤53.7m (FY16 ¤46.0m). This performance is underpinned  
by the industry trend of increasing average vessel size (44% 
growth in the last 11 years), resulting in a larger surface area  
to be treated. Particularly pleasing has been the 20% growth  
in revenue of the Group’s scaffolding company, Techno Craft.
With the recent contract win of a 117 metre new build in Norway 
and several large refit projects being carried out in new 
locations, the division is expanding its market share outside 
Spain while strengthening the Group’s reputation as a  
company that can achieve vast scopes of high quality work  
in short time frames. 
Importantly, the strong results in this division were achieved 
despite the challenges witnessed in the second half such  
as the hurricanes in the USA which not only interrupted 
production for a short period, but also disrupted normal 
cruising and refit patterns. 
Refit includes repainting and finishing of superyachts, normally 
as part of a refit programme, and its revenues also include 
scaffolding, containment and the removal of fittings undertaken 
by the Techno Craft business. 
A key driver of our business is that superyachts require a major 
survey and service every five years to comply with certain  
class regulations, maritime laws and insurance requirements.  
In addition, our strong warranty and network of relationships 
with shipyards supports strong repeat business enhancing 
revenue security.
GYG operates four brands in the refit sector each targeting 
specific regional markets and segments. Pinmar is the market 
leading brand focused on the large motor superyachts across 
all European refit locations. Pinmar USA is the leading brand 
on the East Coast of the USA, predominantly servicing the 
motor yacht market. Rolling Stock has its core in the sailing 
superyacht sector and specialises in metallic and performance 
coatings in Europe. ACA Marine, the Group’s most recent 
acquisition, is a regional brand focusing on the 40+ metre 
market in France.
GYG increased the scope of its refit network in 2017, signing 
commercial agreements with major refit shipyards in the USA 
and Italy which will facilitate the planned regional growth in 
2018, as stated at IPO. The Group also expanded its field sales 
force to service the enlarged network, implementing a tailored 
CRM system to manage the sales process. 
New Build covers the fairing and painting of new vessels as 
part of the build process and represents a significant growth 
opportunity for the Group.
2017 new build revenues were strong with the Group 
undertaking major projects in Holland, Germany and the USA. 
The fairing and painting of a new, large (70+ metre) superyacht 
will typically take 8-12 months, with the largest (150+ metre) 
vessels taking longer. Correspondingly, such major individual 
projects produce substantial and consistent revenues over  
a prolonged period contributing to the annual sales of the 
Coating division. 
Historically, GYG has been successful in winning major 
contracts to fair and finish iconic new build projects through its 
strong relationships with existing superyacht owners and their 
representatives. However, the paint contracts for the majority 
of the 50-70 metre new build projects are awarded by the 
shipyards to their long standing preferred local suppliers, 
hence GYG’s relatively low market share of 6% in this high value 
segment. One of the strategic drivers of the IPO was to further 
penetrate this sizeable market segment to drive the future 
growth of our new build operations. We are confident that we 
will be able to demonstrate to the leading new build yards in 
Holland, Germany and Italy that we can add value and reduce 
risk through our industry leading quality, production efficiency, 
project management protocols and global after sales service. 
Post period end, we signed a Letter of Intent (“LOI”) with the 
owner of ‘REV 182’, the world’s largest research and expedition 
vessel currently under construction. The 182 metre vessel, 
which is scheduled to be started in 2019 and delivered in 2020, 
will be contracted to the Group’s Rolling Stock division and the 
order includes the supply and application of the exterior filler 
and paint system for specified exterior areas of the vessel. 
This is the third explorer vessel of this type that GYG has been 
contracted to work on in the last two years, further establishing 
the Group as the specialist in this type of market. The works 
are scheduled to commence in 2019, strengthening the order 
book and providing a good visibility of income for the Group. 
SUPPLY DIVISION
The supply business operates through three distinct sales 
channels, namely retail, trade and superyacht provisioning.
The Supply division delivered revenues of ¤8.9m, up 4.2% on 
FY16 (¤8.6m). The retail turnover was in line with the previous 
year while the division’s growth came from the increased 
volumes through the trade accounts and the expansion of 
yacht provisioning. 
12 GYG plc OPERATIONAL REVIEW
During 2017, we completed a review of our production 
processes and have started to implement a number of quality, 
efficiency and productivity initiatives aimed at improving  
gross margins and reducing fixed costs. We expect to see the 
early benefits of these programmes over the course of 2018.
Through the Pinmar brand, GYG continues to lead the industry 
in terms of the delivery of quality standards. The Pinmar 
Standard was the first empirically based superyacht paint 
standard introduced to the industry in 2011, revolutionising  
the approach to the inspection and acceptance of paint works. 
In 2018, GYG launched the Pinmar Standard 2.0, an updated 
version of the standard which incorporates the expanded 
range of paint manufacturers and products available in the 
market today. 
The Group continues to innovate and invest in new application 
technology, leveraging its close relationship with all of the 
main superyacht paint manufacturers. Its adoption and 
industry development of electrostatic top-coat application is 
delivering significant time, quality and environmental benefits, 
further asserting the Group’s industry leadership. 
GYG continues to develop its Human Resources function  
with a structured in-house programme of skills development  
aimed at expanding the Coating division production capacity.  
We continue to strengthen our management team through 
strategic recruitment, bringing a mix of industry experience 
and related business expertise. 
We continue to improve our business processes, systems and 
infrastructure to support the growth and improve efficiency  
of the Group. In 2017, we implemented a new production 
application software to provide greater visibility and control 
over production activity, and a sales CRM system that provides 
data on the worldwide fleet of 5,700 superyachts and facilitates 
the management of the marketing and sales process. This has 
further improved our ability to forecast upcoming yacht  
refits and has provided our managers with a more efficient 
approach to marketing at the appropriate time before a refit. 
MARKET DEVELOPMENTS
The superyacht new build and refit painting market continues 
to exhibit consistent growth of approximately 6% per annum 
driven primarily by the refit market which, as previously 
mentioned, requires regular maintenance programmes. The 
new build market, particularly the larger superyacht segment 
(70+ metre), has been fuelled by the continued growth in the 
number of worldwide billionaires, (estimated 9% CAGR to 
2020) and continues to report growing order books and 
deliveries through 2020, indicating further new build painting 
and a growing fleet requiring refit.
We have noted the continuing increase in the size of vessels 
being produced and the demands this places on the global 
refit shipyard infrastructure. There are a limited number of 
yards with the infrastructure required to service the growing 
number of 100+ metre mega-yachts and GYG is well positioned 
with these yards to complete such orders. Time is a precious 
factor in the refit of these larger vessels as owners want access 
to their vessels or the ability to hire out during the main  
cruising season. The Group’s technical leadership and unrivalled 
experience in repainting the largest yachts to the highest 
industry standards, meeting clients demanding timescales, 
further accentuates our competitive advantage. 
OUTLOOK
The Group is well positioned in each of its core markets and the 
management team is focused on delivering the key objectives 
of revenue growth and margin improvement. The Group’s 
outlook for 2018 is positive with significant growth expected in 
the refit sector alongside further new build market penetration.

 The financial information for the ten-month period ended 31 December 2016 is the trading period for GYG plc (former Global Yachting Group Limited) since its incorporation 
date in February 2016, starting trading on 4 March 2016, to 31 December 2016. As consequence the financial information for the twelve-month period ended 31 December 
2017 is not directly comparable with that of the ten-month period ended 31 December 2016. To aid comparison to the twelve-month period ended 31 December 2017 
(referred to “FY16”), we have set out above the comparative financial information for the twelve-month period ended 31 December 2016, as well as the ten month 
information (below). The comparative financial information for the twelve month period ended 31 December 2016 is the combination of:
• The consolidated financial information of Hemisphere Yachting Services, S.L.U. and its subsidiaries for the period from 1 January 2016 to 3 March 2016 (the period until the 
acquisition by Global Yachting Group Limited); and,
• The consolidated financial information of Global Yachting Group Limited for the period from 4 March 2016 to 31 December 2016.
During the year ended 31 December 2017, the Company 
continued to focus on organic revenue growth through 
expanding shipyard and client relationships for the Coating 
division and an increasing offering for the Supply division.
The Company, during this time, also prepared for an IPO of its 
shares on AIM which was successfully completed on 5 July 
2017. The Company issued 6.9m new shares at a placing price 
of 100p (the “Placing Price”), raising gross proceeds of £6.9m. 
GYG used the funds principally to settle shareholder loan  
notes and related interest, advisor fees and expenses in relation 
to the IPO. 
The Board believes that the flotation on AIM has increased  
the Company’s overall reputation and profile, broadened and 
strengthened GYG’s shareholder base, and has provided  
the Company with the ability to incentivise key employees  
and to use AIM quoted shares as currency for potential  
future acquisitions.

Revenue in the year ended 31 December 2017 increased  
14.7% to ¤62.6m (FY16: ¤54.6m) with 16.7% growth in the 
Coating division, reflecting strong performances in new build, 
scaffolding and containment, and 4.2% growth in the Supply 
division in 2017. Our Refit division recorded high turnover in 
the first and second quarters, however the third quarter Refit 
programme was affected by the multiple hurricane disruption 
to seasonal cruising patterns causing delays to major projects 
which led to a softening of revenues in the second half of the 
year. Refit recovered in the fourth quarter, and the Group are 
seeing the project deferrals starting to flow through into the 
order book during 2018.
Operating expenses before share option charges and 
exceptional items were ¤57.3m in the year (FY16: ¤50.1m).  
The increase in operating costs predominantly reflects higher 
direct manpower, materials and other operating expenses in 
line with the increased turnover. 
With a gross profit margin across the Group of 27%, and 
adjusted EBITDA margin of 11.5%, we achieved adjusted 
EBITDA of ¤7.2m in the year (FY16: ¤6.7m) ); where the main 
contribution to this growth came from the new build division.
The Group delivered operating profit of ¤1.4m which includes 
¤3.9m of exceptional items, mainly related to professional  
fees and other related fees arising in connection with the IPO 
and the acquisition of ACA Marine, the coating business 
located in the South of France. This was against a FY16 
comparator of ¤1.9m which included ¤2.6m of exceptional 
items, mainly related to transaction fees in connection with  
the acquisition of Hemisphere Yachting Services, S.L.U. which 
was completed on 3 March 2016.
Financial expenses of ¤0.9m (FY16: ¤0.9m) related primarily  
to interest on the syndicated loan and loan notes (both signed 
in March 2016).
EARNINGS PER SHARE AND DIVIDENDS
Net loss for the year was ¤0.4m (2016: profit ¤0.1m). Loss per 
share was ¤0.01 (FY16: earnings of ¤0.01 per share) and 
adjusted basic earning per share was ¤0.14 (FY16: ¤0.31  
per share).
Basic earnings/(losses) per share are calculated by dividing 
net profit/(loss) for the year attributable to the Group (i.e. after 
tax and non-controlling interests) by the weighted average 
number of shares outstanding during that year.
Diluted earnings/(losses) per share have been calculated on  
a similar basis taking into account dilutive potential shares 
under the agreements disclosed in note 24 of the consolidated 
financial statements.
Adjusted basic earnings per share are presented to eliminate 
the effect of the exceptional items, amortisation of intangible 
assets and performance share plan costs (considering the tax 
effect of these adjustments).

Strategic Report
As stated in the Admission Document published at the time of 
the IPO, the Board’s intention is to implement a progressive 
dividend policy in line with the growth in future earnings, 
subject to the discretion of the Board and to the Company 
having sufficient distributable reserves. For the year ended  
31 December 2017 (being the first financial period end as an 
AIM quoted company), the Board recommends a total  
dividend for the year of 3.2 pence per ordinary share.  
This reflects an annualised dividend yield of 6.4% (calculated 
on the Placing Price) pro-rated for the period for which the 
Company has been AIM quoted before its financial year end 
(approximately six months).
FINANCIAL POSITION
Cash and cash equivalents totalled ¤6.2m at 31 December 2017, 
on par compared to ¤6.2m at 31 December 2016 and a stronger 
balance sheet having repaid ¤4.3m of loan notes and accrued 
interest on Admission, bringing the total net debt position to 
¤6.7m at 31 December 2017 (FY16: ¤10.4m) 
Total assets on the balance sheet were ¤52.7m as at 31 
December 2017, compared to ¤43.8m as at 31 December 2016 
reflecting the acquisition in France and the investment  
in scaffolding. 
Total liabilities were ¤35.4m (FY16: ¤32.5m) after the 
repayment of the above-mentioned loan notes on the 5 July 
2017 and total borrowings stood at ¤12.9m as at 31 December 
2017 (FY16: ¤16.7m).
CASH FLOW
Net cash from operating activities was ¤0.4m for the year 
(FY16: ¤3.3m) significantly impacted by the exceptional items. 
Net cash used in investing activities was ¤2.2m mainly 
corresponding to the ACA Marine acquisition in March and 
significant capex investments in terms of scaffolding (cash 
from investing activities in 2016: ¤0.6m) and net cash from 
financing activities was ¤1.7m primarily arising from the gross 
proceeds of the placing on Admission that were used to 
partially offset the fees and expenses in relation to the IPO and 
the settlement of the pre-existing shareholders loan notes and 
accrued interests on Admission (FY16: ¤1.7m). Overall net cash 
inflow for the year was ¤0.0m (FY16: net cash inflow of ¤2.9m).

Directors’ Governance Report DI R E C T O R S ’ R E P O R T
The Directors present their report together with the audited 
financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017.  
The Corporate Governance Statement on pages 24 and 25  
also forms part of this Directors’ Report.
GENERAL INFORMATION AND PRINCIPAL ACTIVITY
GYG plc is a public limited company incorporated in the United 
Kingdom, registered number 10001363, which is listed on the 
Alternative Investment Market (“AIM”) of the London Stock 
Exchange. Its principal activity is that of a holding and 
investment company.
The principal activity of the Group in the year under review  
was that of a superyacht painting, supply and maintenance 
company, offering services globally through operations in the 
Mediterranean, Northern Europe and the United States.
REVIEW OF BUSINESS
The Chairman’s Statement on page 8, the Chief Executive’s 
Report on pages 10 to 13 and the Financial Review on pages 14 
to 16 provide a review of the business, the Group’s trading for 
the year ended 31 December 2017, key performance indicators 
and an indication of future developments and risks, and form 
part of this Directors’ Report.
FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS 
Likely future developments in the business of the Group are 
discussed in the Strategic Report. 
RESULTS AND DIVIDEND
The Group has reported its consolidated financial statements 
in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
as adopted by the European Union. The results for the period 
and financial position of the Company and the Group are  
set out in the financial statements and are reviewed in the 
Strategic Report. 
The Company may by ordinary resolution from time to time 
declare dividends not exceeding the amount recommended  
by the Board. Subject to the Companies Act 2006, the Board 
may pay interim dividends, and also any fixed rate dividend, 
whenever the financial position of the Company, in the opinion 
of the Board, justifies its payment. All dividends shall be 
apportioned and paid pro-rata according to the amounts paid 
up on the shares.
As stated in the Admission Document, the Board’s intention is 
to implement a progressive dividend policy in line with the 
growth in future earnings, subject to the discretion of the 
Board and to the Company having sufficient distributable 
reserves. For the year ended 31 December 2017 (being the first 
financial period end as an AIM quoted company), the Board 
recommends a total dividend of 3.2 pence per ordinary share, 
equating to a 3.2% dividend yield, calculated on the Placing 
Price at IPO. This intention is based on an annualised dividend 
yield of 6.4% (calculated on the Placing Price) pro-rated for the 
period for which the Company will have been AIM quoted 
before its financial year end (approximately six months).
The dividend will be payable on 15 June 2018 to shareholders 
whose names appear on the register of members on 4 May 
2018. The ex-dividend date will be 3 May 2018.

An introduction from the Chairman
Dear Shareholders
I have pleasure in introducing this Corporate Governance 
Statement. During the year to 31 December 2017, GYG was a 
private Group for the period to 4 July 2017 and corporate 
governance was dictated by the requirements of its key 
shareholders. Following the IPO on 5 July 2017, the Board has 
adopted the principles of the Quoted Companies Alliance Code 
(the “QCA” Code) to the extent they consider it is appropriate 
to do so to support the Group’s governance framework. 
In this section of the annual report, the Company’s approach  
to governance is set out, and further information is provided 
on how the Board and its committees have operated following 
the IPO in July 2017.
The Board seeks to follow best practice in corporate governance 
to the extent appropriate to the Company’s size, nature and 
stage of its development and in accordance with the regulatory 
framework that applies to AIM companies. 
STEPHEN MURPHY 
Chairman
THE BOARD
The Board is responsible to the shareholders and sets the 
Group’s strategy for achieving long-term success. It is 
ultimately responsible for the management, governance, 
controls, risk management, direction and performance of  
the Group.
The Board currently comprises three Executive and two  
Non-Executive Directors. The skills and experience of the 
Board are set out in their biographical details on pages 18  
and 19. The experience and knowledge of each of the Directors 
gives them the ability to challenge strategy constructively  
and to scrutinise performance.
The Chairman, Stephen Murphy, is responsible for leadership of 
the Board, ensuring its effectiveness on all aspects of its role, 
setting its agenda and ensuring that the Directors receive 
accurate, timely and clear information. The Chairman also 
ensures effective communication with shareholders and 
facilitates the effective contribution of Non-Executive 
Directors. The Chairman’s other commitments are described 
on page 18. Remy Millott, as Chief Executive Officer, is 
responsible for the operational management of the Group and 
the implementation of Board strategy and policy. By dividing 
responsibilities in this way, no one individual has unfettered 
powers of decision-making.
The Directors acknowledge the importance of the principles of 
the QCA Code which recommend that a company should have 
at least two independent non-executive directors. The Board 
has, therefore, considered and determined that, since the date 
of their appointment on 5 July 2017, both the Chairman and the 
other Non-Executive Director are independent of the executive 
management and free from any relationship which could 
materially affect the exercise of their independent judgment.
The appointment of each of the Chairman and the other Non-
Executive Director is for an initial term of three years, with such 
appointments being terminable by either the Company or the 
individual Director on three months’ notice. Each appointment 
is contingent on satisfactory performance and to the re-
election criteria more fully explained in the following paragraph.
ELECTION OF DIRECTORS 
The Company’s current articles of association, which came into 
effect on 21 June 2017, state that all Directors are subject to 
election by shareholders at the first annual general meeting 
following their appointment by the Board. As all the current 
Directors have not been appointed or re-appointed by the 
Company in a general meeting since their appointment, they 
will all retire at the forthcoming annual general meeting and, 
being eligible, will offer themselves for re-election. 
At subsequent annual general meetings, one-third of the 
Directors must retire from office (or, if their number is not three 
or a multiple of three, the number nearest to but not exceeding 
one-third (unless their number is fewer than three, in which 
case one of them shall retire)). Additionally, any Director not 
otherwise required to retire from office at an annual general 
meeting shall do so unless he was appointed or re-appointed 
as a Director at either of the last two general meetings before 
that meeting.
RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE BOARD
The Board meets regularly to consider strategy, performance 
and the framework of internal controls. To enable the Board to 
discharge its duties, all Directors receive appropriate and 
timely information. Briefing papers are distributed to all 
Directors in advance of Board meetings. All Directors have 
access to the advice and services of the Chief Financial Officer 
who is responsible for ensuring that the Board procedures  
are followed and that applicable rules and regulations are 
complied with. 
All Directors also have access to the advice and services of the 
Company Secretary. The removal and appointment of the 
Company Secretary is a matter reserved for Board approval. 
The Board also obtains advice from independent professional 
advisers as and when required.
At each of its meetings, the Board reviews the strategy and 
evaluates the progress of the Group in achieving its annual 
objectives. It also considers the risk of potential activities and 
monitors financial progress against budget.

Directors’ Governance Report C O R P O R A TE G O V ER N A N C E S T A TEM ENT
( C O NT I N U ED )
In between Board meetings, the Executive Directors maintain 
regular informal contact with the Non-Executive Directors. 
Whilst the Board retains overall responsibility for, and control 
of the Group, day-to-day management of the business is 
conducted by the Executive Directors who meet with the 
senior management team on a weekly basis. The Non-Executive 
Directors also meet periodically without the presence of 
Executive Directors.
There is a formal schedule of matters reserved for decision by 
the Board in place which enables the Board to provide 
leadership and ensure effectiveness, a copy of which may be 
found at www.globalyachtinggroup.com. Such matters include 
business strategy and management, financial reporting 
(including the approval of the annual budget), Group policies, 
corporate governance matters, major capital expenditure 
projects, materials acquisitions and divestments and the 
establishment and monitoring of internal controls.
The Board considers that it has shown its commitment to 
leading and controlling the Group by meeting five times  
since the date of the IPO. The attendance of each Director  
at Board and Committee meetings during the period 5 July  
to 31 December 2017 is set out in the table below:

  Attendance is expressed as the number of meetings attended/number eligible to

INDUCTION OF NEW DIRECTORS  
AND PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT
On joining the Board, new Directors are advised of their legal 
and other duties and obligations as a director of a listed 
company. They also take part in a formal induction process, 
including the provision of past Board materials to provide 
background information on the Company and information on 
Board processes and governance framework. The induction is 
tailored to meet each new Director’s specific needs, and all the 
current Directors took part in a thorough induction process  
in conjunction with the Company’s listing on AIM. 
Throughout their period in office the Directors are continually 
updated on the Group’s business, the industry and competitive 
environment in which it operates, corporate social responsibility 
matters and other changes affecting the Group by written 
briefings and meetings with senior executives. They are 
reminded by the Company Secretary of these duties and are 
also updated on changes to the legal and governance 
requirements of the Group, and upon themselves as Directors, 
on an ongoing and timely basis. 
TIME COMMITMENTS
On joining the Board, Non-Executive Directors receive a formal 
appointment letter, which identifies the terms and conditions 
of their appointment and, in particular, the time commitment 
expected of them. A potential director candidate (whether  
an executive director or non-executive director) is required  
to disclose all significant outside commitments prior to  
their appointment. 
The Board is satisfied that both the Chairman and the other 
Non-Executive Director are able to devote sufficient time to 
the Company’s business.
BOARD PERFORMANCE AND APPRAISAL
The Board is committed to a formal annual Board evaluation 
and it is expected that this will be conducted by way of a 
questionnaire and Chairman interviews during 2018, the current 
Board only having been formed in July 2017. The outcome of 
this evaluation will be published in the next annual report.  
The performance of the Board, its committees and that of the 
individual Directors is, however, monitored by the Chairman  
on an ongoing basis.
EXTERNAL APPOINTMENTS
In the appropriate circumstances, the Board may authorise 
Executive Directors to take non-executive positions in other 
companies and organisations, provided the time commitment 
does not conflict with the Director’s duties to the Company, 
since such appointments should broaden their experience.  
The acceptance of appointment to such positions is subject  
to the approval of the Chairman. 
CONFLICTS OF INTEREST 
At each meeting the Board considers Directors’ conflicts of 
interest. The Company’s articles of association provide for the 
Board to authorise any actual or potential conflicts of interest. 
SHARE DEALING
The Directors understand the importance of complying with 
the AIM Rules and applicable legislation relating to dealings  
by Directors and employees of the Group in the Company’s 
ordinary shares, and the Company has established a share 
dealing code which the Directors believe is appropriate for  
a company quoted on AIM and is compliant with Rule 21 of  
the AIM Rules relating to dealing policies. The Company and 
the Directors take all reasonable steps to ensure compliance  
by the Company’s Directors and employees with such code.
BOARD COMMITTEES
With effect from Admission on 5 July 2017, the Board has 
established a Nomination Committee, an Audit Committee and 
a Remuneration Committee. The Board has delegated specific 
responsibilities to those committees as detailed below, and 
copies of each Committee’s terms of reference are available  
on the Company’s website at www.globalyachtinggroup.com.
The Company Secretary acts as secretary to each of the  
three Committees.

Details of the activities and responsibilities of the Nomination 
Committee are set out on page 26. 
Audit Committee 
A report on the duties of the Audit Committee and how it 
discharges its responsibilities is provided later in the Audit 
Committee report on pages 27 to 29. 
Remuneration Committee 
The Directors’ Remuneration Report and details of the activities 
of the Remuneration Committee are set out on pages 30 to 33. 
It sets out a summary of the Group’s policy on remuneration, 
having due regard to the interests of shareholders, and  
details of the elements of the remuneration package of each 
individual Director.
INTERNAL CONTROL AND RISK MANAGEMENT
The Board has overall responsibility for the Group’s internal 
control systems and for monitoring their effectiveness. The 
Board maintains a system of internal controls to safeguard 
shareholders’ investment and the Group’s assets, and has 
established a continuous process for identifying, evaluating 
and managing the significant risks the Group faces. 
The Board delegates to management the responsibility for 
designing, operating and monitoring both the systems and the 
maintenance of effective internal controls within the Group. 
The Company has also introduced a whistleblowing policy.
Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining 
adequate internal control and risk management systems 
relating to the financial reporting process and the Group’s 
process for the preparation of consolidated accounts. The 
systems and controls in place include policies and procedures 
which relate to the maintenance of records that accurately and 
fairly reflect transactions, correctly evidence and control the 
Group’s assets, provide reasonable assurance that transactions 
are recorded as necessary to permit the preparation of  
financial statements in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the EU, and review 
and reconcile reported results. 
The Board’s review process is, with the assistance of the Audit 
Committee, based principally on reviewing regular reports 
from management to consider whether significant risks are 
identified, evaluated, managed and controlled and whether 
any significant weaknesses are promptly remedied or indicate 
a need for more extensive monitoring. The system is designed 
to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve 
the Company’s objectives, and can only provide reasonable 
and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or 
loss. In assessing what constitutes reasonable assurance, the 
Board considers the materiality of financial and non-financial 
risks and the relationship between the cost of, and benefit 
from, internal control systems.
A formal risk assessment exercise has been conducted by 
management in conjunction with those employees who have 
responsibility for specific controls. The process reviewed, 
identified and prioritised risks, evaluated controls and assessed 
whether any improvements to such controls were necessary. 
The results of the risk assessment were subsequently reviewed 
by the Board and any significant weakness or failing which had 
been identified during the process was considered and, where 
it felt appropriate, the implementation of suitable remedial 
actions to mitigate the risk were approved by the Board. 
In addition to the ongoing monitoring of risk, it is intended that 
such a formal risk assessment exercise will be conducted on  
an annual basis.
The other key procedures which exist to provide effective 
internal controls and risk management systems are as follows: 
• lines of responsibility and delegated authorities are clearly 
defined;
• a formal risk register, which is regularly reviewed and 
updated;
• annual review of the Group’s insurance policies with its 
insurance broker to ensure that the policies are appropriate 
for the Group’s activities and exposures;
• a comprehensive system for consolidating financial results 
from Group companies and reporting these financial results 
to the Board; 
• annual revenue, cash flow and capital forecasts reviewed 
regularly during the year, regular monitoring of management 
accounts and capital expenditure reported to the Board and 
regular comparisons with forecasts;
• financial controls and procedures; 
• clear guidelines for the authorisation of significant 
transactions including capital expenditure and disposals 
under defined levels of authority;
• regular meetings of the Executive Directors; and
• an Audit Committee which approves audit plans and 
published financial information and reviews reports from 
the external Auditor arising from the audit and deals with 
significant control matters raised. 
The Group’s policies and procedures are regularly updated and 
distributed throughout the Group. The Board confirms that  
it has, during the reporting period, reviewed on an ongoing 
basis the effectiveness of the Company’s system of internal 
controls including financial, operational and compliance 
controls and risk management systems and has reviewed 
insurance provisions. No significant failing or weaknesses have 
been identified.
The Board monitors the activities of the Group through regular 
Board meetings and it retains responsibility for approving any 
significant financial expenditure or commitment of resources.

Directors’ Governance Report NOMINA TION C OMMITTEE REPOR T
In accordance with its terms of reference, the Nomination 
Committee is responsible for reviewing the structure, size and 
composition of the Board based upon the skills, knowledge 
and experience required to ensure that the Board operates 
effectively, and for identifying and nominating, for the approval 
of the Board, candidates to fill board vacancies as and when 
they arise. 
The Nomination Committee is also responsible for succession 
planning of the executive leadership team and makes 
recommendations to the Board for the re-appointment of any 
Non-Executive Directors if and when necessary. 
Stephen Murphy acts as Chairman of the Nomination 
Committee and its other member is Richard King. Both 
members are independent. The Nomination Committee meets 
at least once a year and at other times as and when required. 
Details of meeting attendance are shown in the Corporate 
Governance Statement on pages 23 to 25.
Since its establishment on 5 July 2017, the Nomination 
Committee has met once. At that meeting it reviewed the 
structure, size and composition of the Board and was of the 
view that the current composition of the Board of three 
Executive Directors and two independent Non-Executive 
Directors was appropriate at the present time, particularly in 
light of the fact that the current Board had only been formed 
at the time of the IPO. However, the Nomination Committee 
would continue to monitor and keep under review the  
structure, size and composition of the Board. The Nomination 
Committee also noted it responsibilities on succession  
planning and agreed that this would to be reviewed on  
an ongoing basis alongside the capability of the senior 
management and Directors. 
The Nomination Committee at its meeting during the period 
also considered the retirement and re-election of Directors, 
noting that under the Company’s articles of association 
Directors were subject to election by shareholders at the  
first annual general meeting after their appointment, and  
to re-appointment thereafter by rotation. Accordingly, the 
Nomination Committee concluded that all five Directors would 
be required to retire at the forthcoming annual general meeting 
and, being eligible, would offer themselves for re-election.

AUDIT COMMITTEE
The Audit Committee meets at least three times a year. Richard 
King acts as Chairman of the Audit Committee and has recent 
and relevant financial experience through his former role with 
EY as deputy Managing Partner of UK & Ireland and a member 
of both the Europe, Middle East, India and Africa (EMEIA) 
Board and Global management group, and his subsequent 
involvement either as chairman or non-executive director on a 
variety of private and public companies. He is also a Fellow of 
the Institute of Chartered Accountants. Stephen Murphy is the 
other member of the Audit Committee and is an Associate 
Member of the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants. 
Both of the Audit Committee members are independent. 
In accordance with the FRC’s Guidance on Audit Committees, 
no one other than the Audit Committee Chairman and the 
other member receive automatic invitations to meetings of the 
Audit Committee. The Chief Financial Officer and external 
Auditors are invited to attend meetings on a regular basis,  
and other non-members may be invited to attend all or part  
of any meeting and as and when considered appropriate  
and necessary. 
The Audit Committee intends to meet the external Auditor at 
least once a year without executive management present, and 
the Chairman of the Audit Committee keeps in touch on a 
continual basis with the key people involved in the Company’s 
governance, including the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief 
Financial Officer, the Company Secretary and the external 
audit lead partner. An induction programme is provided for 
new Audit Committee members covering the role of the Audit 
Committee, its terms of reference and an overview of the 
Group’s business, including the main business and financial 
dynamics and risks. 
SUMMARY OF THE ROLE OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE
In the course of discharging its duties and responsibilities, the 
Audit Committee focuses particularly on compliance with legal 
requirements and accounting standards and on ensuring that 
an effective system of internal financial controls is maintained. 
The Audit Committee has primary responsibility for monitoring 
the quality of internal controls, ensuring that the financial 
performance of the Group is properly measured and reported 
on, and for reviewing reports from the Group’s Auditors 
relating to the Group’s accounting and internal controls, in all 
cases having due regard to the interests of shareholders.  
Its other responsibilities include reviewing and monitoring:
• the integrity of the financial statements of the Group and 
any formal announcements relating to the Group’s financial 
performance;
• the Group’s internal financial controls and internal control 
and risk management systems;
• the requirement for an internal audit function;
• the Group’s whistleblowing, fraud detection and anti-bribery 
procedures;
• the external Auditor’s independence and objectivity and the 
effectiveness of the audit process; and 
• making recommendations to the Board on the appointment 
and re-appointment of the Group’s external Auditor.
The Audit Committee reports to the Board, identifying any 
need for action or improvement on any of these terms of 
reference and makes recommendations as to the steps to be 
taken. The effectiveness of the Audit Committee is reviewed  
by the Board annually.
EXTERNAL AUDITORS
The Audit Committee is responsible for making 
recommendations to the Board on the appointment, 
reappointment and removal of the external Auditor and 
assesses annually the qualifications, expertise, resources, 
remuneration and independence of the external Auditor.  
The Audit Committee also receives a report on the external 
audit firm’s own internal quality control procedures, and 
confirmation of the Auditor’s independence. For each annual 
cycle, the Audit Committee ensures that appropriate plans  
are in place for the external audit.
Deloitte LLP are the Company’s Auditor and were the Auditor 
of the Group for the financial years ended 31 December 2016, 
and 31 December 2017. Deloitte LLP are members of the 
Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales.  
In accordance with professional standards, the Deloitte LLP 
partner responsible for the audit will be rotated every five 
years. The current audit partner was appointed in respect  
of the year ended 31 December 2016. 
The Audit Committee annually reviews the effectiveness of the 
external Auditor. This process involves the external Auditor 
presenting to the Audit Committee its proposed audit scope, 
such presentation last having taken place in November 2017  
in relation to the financial statements for the year ended  
31 December 2017. The external Auditor also presents to the 
Audit Committee the output of its detailed year-end work and 
the Audit Committee challenges significant judgments (if any). 
In making its assessment of external Auditor effectiveness,  
the Audit Committee reviews the audit engagement letters 
before signature, reviews the external Auditor’s summary of 
Company issues, and conducts an overall review of the 
effectiveness of the external audit process and the external 
Auditor. The Audit Committee reports its findings to the Board.
The Audit Committee and the Board have been satisfied  
with the performance of the external Auditor during the year, 
and with the policies and procedures they have in place to 
maintain their objectivity and independence. There are no 
contractual obligations restricting the Company’s choice of 
external auditor.
The Audit Committee also approves in advance any non-audit 
services to be performed by the Auditor such as tax compliance 
and advisory work, audit-related assurance services (eg 
reviews of internal controls and reviewing the Group’s interim 
financial statements).

EXTERNAL AUDITORS (continued)
Any non-audit services that are to be provided by the external 
Auditor are reviewed in order to safeguard Auditor objectivity 
and independence. During the reporting period, non-audit 
services have been provided in respect of the interim review  
of the half year financial statements, reporting accountant 
services for the IPO which completed in July 2017, M&A due 
diligence for the acquisition of ACA SAS and tax compliance 
services. All non-audit services following the IPO have to be 
approved by the Chairman of the Audit Committee, who 
considers whether appropriate safeguards are in place in 
respect of non-audit services being delivered. These include 
delivery of non-audit services by a partner independent of  
the audit. Accordingly, the Board can confirm that during  
the reporting period there have been no non-audit services 
that are considered to have impaired the objectivity and 
independence of the external Auditor. A full breakdown of 
payments made to the external Auditor during the financial 
year is disclosed within note 7 on page 52. 
WORK UNDERTAKEN BY THE  
AUDIT COMMITTEE SINCE THE IPO
The Audit Committee has met four times since its establishment 
on 5 July 2017. Details of meeting attendance are shown in the 
Corporate Governance Statement on page 24. Deloitte LLP,  
as the Auditor, was also present at three of the meetings.
The key matters considered by the Audit Committee whilst 
discharging its duties and responsibilities are set out below:
• consideration and approval of the unaudited interim financial 
statements for the period ended 30 June 2017;
• discussions with the Auditor on the audit approach and 
strategy, the audit process, significant audit risks and key 
issues of focus for the annual audit;
• review of the financial integrity of the Group’s financial 
statements including relevant corporate governance 
statements; 
• approval of the audit fees for the financial year ended  
31 December 2017;
• approval of non-audit work to be carried out by the Auditor;
• consideration the independence and objectivity of the 
external Auditor;
• review of the internal controls and risk management systems 
within the Group;
• consideration of the requirement for the Group to have an 
internal audit function;
• review of the effectiveness of the external Auditor, as more 
fully described above;
• approval of the continuing appointment of Deloitte LLP  
as the Group’s Auditor; and
• post-period, review of the annual report and financial 
statements for the year ended 31 December 2017.
The ultimate responsibility for reviewing and approving the 
financial statements in the interim and annual reports remains 
with the Board. 
SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENTS RELATED  
TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The Audit Committee, in consultation with management and 
the Auditor, has considered a number of significant judgments 
relating to the preparation of the financial statements 
contained in this Annual Report as follows:
Revenue recorded for significant contracts
Revenue recorded through contract accounting is subject to 
estimation and judgment in the assessment of costs remaining 
to complete for contracts which are ongoing at year end. 
Understatement of expected or contingency costs would 
increase the percentage of completion causing revenue to be 
overstated. An overstatement of costs would have an opposite 
effect and impact on the completeness of revenue.
The Audit Committee has consulted with management and 
reviewed the Auditor’s findings following their detailed testing 
and review procedures on selected contracts with higher  
risk characteristics and is satisfied that revenue has been 
properly recognised.
Accounting for the acquisition of ACA SAS 
(a) Completeness and accuracy of fair value adjustments 
  As part of the process for accounting for the ACA 
acquisition, fair value adjustments have been recorded  
by management. There was a risk that these adjustments 
may be incomplete or inaccurate. A thorough review of  
fair value adjustments has been completed, agreeing 
estimates to latest evidence as appropriate, with the aim 
of confirming that the conditions for adjustment were  
in existence prior to the acquisition date and that the 
values agreed. 
(b) Accuracy of consideration paid and net assets acquired 
  As a result of the significant operational issues in ACA  
SAS at the time of acquisition, the estimation of the fair  
value of the consideration payable involved management’s 
judgment with regard to negotiations with the former 
majority shareholder of ACA SAS. The key contractual 
terms of the legal agreements documenting those 
negotiations have been reviewed in detail.
  The accuracy of the net assets acquired was also assessed 
which involved a detailed review of the relevant acquisition 
agreements and reports from management.
The Audit Committee has considered the Auditor’s findings 
and discussed the outcomes with management and, after due 
consideration, believes that the accounting and disclosures 
relating to the ACA acquisition are appropriate. 
28 GYG plc RISK MANAGEMENT AND INTERNAL CONTROL
The Board has overall responsibility for the Group’s internal 
control systems and for monitoring their effectiveness. The 
Board maintains a system of internal controls to safeguard 
shareholders’ investment and the Group’s assets, and has 
established a continuous process for identifying, evaluating 
and managing the significant risks the Group faces. The Board 
regularly reviews the process, which has been in place 
throughout the period and up to the date of approval of the 
annual report and financial statements. 
The Board’s internal control and risk management review 
process (conducted with the assistance of the Audit 
Committee), is outlined on pages 25 and 26.
INTERNAL AUDIT
The Board considers the need for an internal audit function 
annually and in consultation with the Auditor has concluded 
that, given the current size of the Group’s operations, it is  
not necessary at this time. In forming its decision, the Audit 
Committee considered that all of the finance function is located 
at the Palma Mallorca head office, and this finance team makes 
regular visits to overseas locations. The efficacy of internal 
controls was considered during the IPO process and the Audit 
Committee still believes these controls to be sufficient for  
a business the scale and complexity of the Group.

Directors’ Governance Report DI R E C T O R S ’ R E M U N E R A T I O N R E P O R T
As Chairman of the Remuneration Committee, I am pleased  
to present our report for the year ended 31 December 2017.
This report does not constitute a full directors’ remuneration 
report in accordance with the Companies Act 2006. As a 
company whose shares are admitted to trading on AIM, the 
Company is not required by the Companies Act to prepare 
such a report. We do, however, have regard to the principles  
of the QCA Code which we consider to be appropriate for  
an AIM company of our size. The report provides details of 
remuneration for all Directors and gives a general statement of 
policy on Directors’ remuneration as it is currently applied.  
It also provides a summary of the long-term share incentive 
scheme currently in place. 
STEPHEN MURPHY 
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
Key responsibilities
The Remuneration Committee is responsible for reviewing the 
performance of the Executive Directors and for determining 
their terms and conditions of service, including their 
remuneration and the grant of options, having due regard to 
the interests of shareholders. The remuneration of the Non-
Executive Directors is a matter for the Board or the shareholders 
(within the limits set out in the articles of association). 
Composition and meetings
The Remuneration Committee meets at least twice a year (and 
at such other times as may be deemed necessary). Stephen 
Murphy acts as Chairman of the Remuneration Committee,  
and Richard King is the other member. Both members are 
considered by the Board to be independent. 
Only members of the Remuneration Committee have the right 
to attend meetings, but other Directors and external advisers 
may be invited to attend all or part of any meeting as and  
when appropriate. No Director may be involved in discussions 
relating to their own remuneration.
The Remuneration Committee was established on 5 July 2017 
and met once during the period since that date. Details of 
meeting attendance are shown in the Corporate Governance 
Statement on page 24. 
Post-period, the Remuneration Committee met to conduct a 
review of all aspects of the remuneration packages of the 
Executive Directors to ensure that they continue to reward  
and motivate achievement of medium and long-term 
objectives, and to align the interests of Executive Directors  
and shareholders. This assessment included:
• considering whether bonus targets had been achieved for 
the year ended 31 December 2017;
• reviewing basic salaries payable for the year ending  
31 December 2018; and 
• setting bonus performance targets for the year ending  
31 December 2018.
POLICY ON EXECUTIVE REMUNERATION
The Remuneration Committee recognises the importance of 
the Company’s reward and performance strategy in recruiting 
and retaining high quality individuals who can lead, develop 
and sustain business growth over the longer term.
The policy of the Remuneration Committee is to ensure that 
the Executive Directors are fairly rewarded for their individual 
contributions to the Company’s overall performance and to 
provide them with a competitive remuneration package 
(including long-term incentive plans) to attract, retain and 
motivate individuals of the experience and competence 
required to ensure that the Company is managed effectively 
and successfully in the interests of shareholders. When setting 
the remuneration policy for Directors, the Remuneration 
Committee reviews and has regard to the pay and employment 
conditions across the Group, especially when determining 
salary increases.
The Chairman of the Remuneration Committee may consult 
with major shareholders from time to time, or when any 
significant remuneration changes are proposed, to understand 
their expectations with regard to Executive Directors’ 
remuneration and will report back to the Remuneration 
Committee. Any other concerns raised by individual 
shareholders will also be considered. The Remuneration 
Committee also takes into account emerging best practice  
and guidance from major institutional shareholders. 
The main elements of the remuneration packages of the 
Executive Directors are as follows:
Basic annual salary
Basic salary is reviewed annually by the Remuneration 
Committee and takes into account a number of factors, 
including the current position and development of the Group, 
individual contribution and market salaries for comparable 
organisations. There is no prescribed minimum or maximum 
increase, and there is no obligation on the Remuneration 
Committee to increase basic salary.
Directors’ salaries for the year ending 31 December 2018 remain 
at the same level as for the year ended 31 December 2017.
The Company does not provide an occupational pension 
scheme for Executive Directors, nor does it make contributions 
into the private pension schemes of the Executive Directors.
Discretionary bonus
At the discretion of the Remuneration Committee, taking into 
account performance against certain financial and individual 
targets, an Executive Director may be entitled to an annual 
discretionary cash bonus on such terms and subject to such 
conditions as may be decided from time to time by the 
Remuneration Committee. Bonuses will normally be capped  
at 80% of the relevant Executive Director’s salary.
On conducting its review of performance against the bonus 
targets which had been set for the year ended 31 December 
2017, the Remuneration Committee concluded that these 
targets had not been sufficiently met and, therefore,  
no bonuses were awarded to the Executive Directors for  
that period.
30 GYG plc For the year ending 31 December 2018, the annual bonuses for 
Executive Directors will be determined by a combination of the 
achievement of financial targets and individual targets. The 
individual targets are linked to certain KPIs and are underpinned 
by a condition relating to the Company’s financial performance.
The Board considers that the actual targets for the year ending 
31 December 2018 bonus are commercially sensitive and full 
details will be disclosed retrospectively in the Annual Report 
for that financial year, provided they are not considered 
commercially sensitive at that time. In accordance with the 
Directors’ remuneration policy, targets are stretching and 
aimed at rewarding performance against specific near-term 
goals, which are consistent with the interests of shareholders 
and the overall strategic direction of the business.
Long-Term Incentive Plan
In order to operate the discretionary share-based incentive 
awards to Executive Directors and selected employees, the 
Company has established a performance share plan, the GYG 
plc Performance Share Plan 2017 (the “PSP”), which was 
adopted by the Board on 23 June 2017. This is expected to 
form the sole long-term incentive arrangement for Executive 
Directors and selected senior managers. 
The Remuneration Committee supervises the operation of the 
PSP. Any employee (including an Executive Director) of the 
Company and its subsidiaries is eligible to participate in the 
PSP at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee.
The Remuneration Committee may grant awards to acquire 
ordinary shares as conditional share awards or as nil (or 
nominal) cost options. The Remuneration Committee may also 
decide to grant cash-based awards of an equivalent value to 
share-based awards or to satisfy share-based awards in cash, 
although it is not the current intention to do so.
The extent of vesting of awards granted to the Executive 
Directors of the Company will normally be subject to 
performance conditions set by the Remuneration Committee 
measured over at least three years. The extent of vesting of 
awards granted to other participants may be subject to 
performance conditions set by the Remuneration Committee.
In line with the proposal set out in the Admission Document, 
on 11 July 2017 nil-cost options were granted under the PSP to 
the Executive Directors at an exercise price of £0.002 per 
share, further details of which are set out on page 33 this 
Directors’ Remuneration report. These options will vest in 2020 
to the extent to which stretching earnings per share targets  
are met in the financial year ending 31 December 2019. 
Benefits in kind
Ancillary benefits provided to Executive Directors currently 
include critical illness cover, the reimbursement of all reasonable 
and authorised expenses and (in the case of the Chief Executive 
Officer and the Managing Director) provision of a company car. 
The Remuneration Committee reviews the level of benefit 
provision from time to time and has the flexibility to add or 
remove benefits to reflect changes in market practices or the 
operational needs of the Company.

THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017

Company’s Board during the year to 31 December 2017 was

POLICY ON NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION
Non-Executive Directors receive a fixed fee and do not receive 
any pensions payments or other benefits. An additional fee is 
payable to the Director performing the role of Chairman of the

CONCLUSION
This report is intended to provide shareholders with sufficient 
information to judge the impact of the decisions taken  
by the Remuneration Committee and to assess whether  
remuneration packages for Directors are fair in the context  
of business performance.
The Remuneration Committee is mindful of shareholder views, 
and we believe that our Directors’ remuneration policy is 
aligned with the achievement of the Company’s business 
objectives and the interests of shareholders.

The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report 
and the financial statement in accordance with applicable law 
and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and 
parent company financial statements for each financial year. 
Under that law, they are required to prepare the Group financial 
statements in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards, as adopted by the EU, and applicable 
law, and have elected to prepare the parent company financial 
statements on the same basis.
Under company law the Directors must not approve the 
financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a 
true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and parent 
company and of their profit or loss for that period. In preparing 
each of the Group and parent company financial statements, 
the Directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently;
• make judgements and accounting estimates that are 
reasonable and prudent; 
• state whether they have been prepared in accordance with 
IFRSs as adopted by the EU; and 
• prepare the financial statement on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the 
parent company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the parent 
company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy 
at any time the financial position of the parent company and 
enable them to ensure that its financial statements comply 
with the Companies Act 2006. They have general responsibility 
for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to 
safeguard the assets of the Group and to prevent and detect 
fraud and other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, the Directors are also

REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Opinion
In our opinion:
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as at  
31 December 2017 and of the Group’s profit for the year then ended;
• the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union;
• the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Accounting 
Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice), including FRS 101 “Reduced Disclosure Framework”; 
and
• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
We have audited the financial statements of GYG plc (the ‘parent company’) and its subsidiaries (the ‘Group’) which comprise:
• the consolidated statement of comprehensive income;
• the consolidated balance sheet;
• the consolidated statement of changes in equity;
• the consolidated cash flow statement;
• the Group related notes 1 to 28;
• the parent company balance sheet;
• the parent company statement of changes in equity; and
• the parent company related notes 1 to 7.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and IFRSs as adopted by the 
European Union and, as regards the parent company financial statements, as applied in accordance with the provisions of the 
Companies Act 2006.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK) and applicable law.  
Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial 
statements section of our report. 
We are independent of the Group and the parent company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our 
audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical Standard as applied to listed entities, and we have fulfilled 
our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained  
is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Revenue recorded for significant contracts 
Key audit matters The key audit matters that we identified in the current year were:
• Accounting for the acquisition of ACA SAS; and
• Revenue recorded for significant contracts not completed at year end.
Materiality The materiality that we used in the current year was ¤400k which was determined using a range  
of bases. This equates to 0.6% of revenue, 9.5% of pre-tax profit before exceptional items and 5.5%  
of adjusted EBITDA.
Scoping Our audit scope covered 12 components. Of these 12, four were subject to a full audit, whilst the 
remaining eight were subject to specified audit procedures. The coverage achieved was 100% of 
revenue, 98% for both expenses and net assets.
Conclusions relating to going concern 
We are required by ISAs (UK) to report in respect of the following matters where:
• the Directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in preparation of the financial statements 
is not appropriate; or 
• the Directors have not disclosed in the financial statements any identified material uncertainties that 
may cast significant doubt about the Group’s or the parent company’s ability to continue to adopt 
the going concern basis of accounting for a period of at least twelve months from the date when the 
financial statements are authorised for issue.
We have nothing  
to report in respect  
of these matters.
Key audit matters 
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial 
statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to 
fraud) that we identified. These matters included those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, the allocation 
of resources in the audit and directing the efforts of the engagement team.
These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion 
thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
Accounting for the acquisition of ACA SAS
Key audit matter 
description
On 11 March 2017, the Group acquired 70% of the equity of ACA SAS for ¤1,429 thousand funded  
by cash. The acquisition resulted in recognition of customer relationships of ¤626 thousand,  
brand of ¤547 thousand and goodwill of ¤710 thousand. There is judgement involved in assessing 
the fair value of net assets, in particular in assessing the status of certain significant coating and 
painting contracts of large vessels ongoing at the point of acquisition. 
In addition, there were significant operational issues in ACA SAS at the point of acquisition and 
therefore, estimation of the fair value of the consideration payable involves judgement related to the 
negotiations with the former majority shareholder of ACA SAS.
Please see critical judgements and accounting policy on pages 45 to 50 and 62 to 63, notes 2, 3 and 
22 and discussion in the Strategic Report on page 28. 
36 GYG plc How the scope of our 
audit responded to the 
key audit matter
We evaluated the design and implementation of controls over the acquisition accounting process. 
We assessed the accuracy of the net assets acquired and the fair value acquisition adjustments 
calculated by management by: reviewing in detail the relevant acquisition agreements, meeting 
with operational management regarding the status of ongoing contracts at the point of acquisition 
and inspection of supporting documentation. Specialists were used in our assessment of the 
appropriateness of intangible assets identified on acquisition. We also reviewed the adequacy of the 
disclosures in the financial statements relating to the acquisition. 
We assessed the determination of the consideration value by reviewing the legal agreements to 
understand the key contractual terms and negotiations with the former majority shareholder of 
ACA SAS. 
Key observations We concluded that the acquisition of ACA SAS has been appropriately accounted for and disclosed 
in the financial statements. We found no material issues as a result of our procedures.
Revenue recorded for significant contracts
Key audit matter 
description
The total revenue of the Group is ¤62,638 thousand, which consists mainly of significant contracts 
relating to coating and painting of large vessels. There is a risk that revenue recorded in respect to 
ongoing contracts is incorrectly calculated or recorded in the wrong period due to management 
judgement involved in the calculation, specifically in relation to estimates of costs to complete of 
contracts ongoing at year-end and any amendments to the original contract. 
Please see critical judgements and accounting policy on pages 45 to 52, notes 2, 3 and 4 and 
discussion in the Strategic Report on page 28. 
How the scope of our 
audit responded to the 
key audit matter
We evaluated the design and implementation of controls over the revenue cycle. 
We evaluated management’s methodology for compliance with accounting standards, re-performed 
calculation of the costs to complete, checked percentage completion to third party records and 
those of operational management, reviewed the appropriateness of the movements in the year and 
assessed the historical accuracy of management’s estimates through prior years by comparison to 
forecasting precision in previous years. 
Key observations We concluded that the revenue recorded for the GYG contracts has been appropriately accounted 
for. We found no material issues as a result of our procedures.

Our application of materiality 
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements that makes it probable that the economic 
decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced. We use materiality both in planning the scope 
of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work. 
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:
Group financial statements Parent company financial statements
Materiality ¤400k ¤340k
Basis for determining 
materiality
The materiality was determined using a range 
of bases. This equates to 0.6% of revenue, 
9.5% of pre-tax profit before exceptional items 
and 5.5% of adjusted EBITDA.
The materiality was determined based on 2% 
of total assets.
Rationale for the 
benchmark applied
We considered a range of bases in determining 
materiality including revenue, pre-tax profit 
before exceptional items and adjusted EBITDA 
on the basis that these measures are all key 
performance indicators used by the market. 
Pre-tax profit and EBITDA were adjusted to 
exclude costs that are non-recurring (see 
notes 2.9 and 2.10 to the financial statements). 
This basis is consistent with management’s 
focus on adjusted metrics to evaluate financial 
performance.
We considered total assets the key performance 
indicator used by the market for a holding 
company.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the Committee all audit differences in excess of ¤20k, as well as 
differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. We also report to the Audit 
Committee on disclosure matters that we identified when assessing the overall presentation of the financial statements.
An overview of the scope of our audit 
Our Group audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of the Group and its environment, including Group-wide controls,  
and assessing the risk of material misstatement at the Group level. The Group’s head office is located in Palma, Spain and all the 
books and records for the Group are maintained there. Therefore, we have involved a component audit team based in Spain.
We focused our Group audit scope on 12 components. We perform full scope audits for four of the Group’s subsidiaries, including 
the newly acquired ACA SAS. Specified audit procedures were performed on material account balances in the remaining  
eight components. These components account for 100% of the Group’s revenue, 98% of the Group’s expenses and 98% of the 
Group’s net assets.
At the Group level we also tested the consolidation process and carried out analytical procedures to confirm our conclusion that 
there were no significant risks of material misstatement of the aggregated financial information of the remaining balances not 
subject to full audit, or audit of specified account balances. 
The Group audit team maintained high level of oversight of the work performed by the component audit team, including numerous 
onsite visits, regular briefings and discussions, inclusion in their risk assessments processes and review documentation of the 
findings of their work.
38 GYG plc An overview of the scope of our audit (continued)
Other information 
The Directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information 
included in the annual report, other than the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon.
Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent 
otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other 
information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with  
the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be  
materially misstated.
If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to 
determine whether there is a material misstatement in the financial statements or a material 
misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that 
there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact.
We have nothing  
to report in respect  
of these matters.
Responsibilities of Directors 
As explained more fully in the Directors’ responsibilities statement, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial 
statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the Directors determine  
is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud  
or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the Directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s and the parent company’s ability  
to continue as a going concern, disclosing as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis  
of accounting unless the Directors either intend to liquidate the Group or the parent company or to cease operations, or have  
no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements 
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance  
is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect  
a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually  
or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these 
financial statements.
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting Council’s 
website at: www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor’s report.

F I N A N C IA L S T A TEM ENT S
For the year ended 31 December 2017 
1. GENERAL INFORMATION
GYG plc (hereinafter the “Company”) was incorporated on  
11 February 2016, as a private company limited by shares, as 
Dunwilco 2016 Limited under the United Kingdom Companies 
Act 2006. Subsequently, on 21 May 2016, the Company’s 
corporate name was changed to Global Yachting Group 
Limited, on 25 May 2017 to GYG Limited, on 22 June 2017  
the Company re-registered as a public limited company and  
on 5 July 2017 the Company completed an Initial Public 
Offering (“IPO”) and was admitted to the AIM Market of the 
London Stock Exchange (see note 22). The address of the 
registered office is Cannon Place, 78 Cannon Street, London 
EC4N 6AF, United Kingdom.
The principal activity of the Group is superyacht painting, 
supply and maintenance, offering services globally through 
operations in the Mediterranean, Northern Europe and the 
United States. 
These consolidated financial statements are presented in Euro 
which is the currency of the primary economic environment  
in which the Group operates.
2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
2.1. Basis of preparation
These consolidated financial statements were prepared by the 
Board of Directors in accordance with the application of 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted 
by the European Union.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared 
under the historical cost convention unless indicated otherwise 
in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. 
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
Comparative information
The financial information for the 10 month period ended  
31 December 2016 is the trading period for GYG plc (former 
Global Yachting Group Limited) since its incorporation date  
in February 2016, starting trading on 4 March 2016, to  
31 December 2016. As consequence the financial information 
for the twelve-month period ended 31 December 2017 is not 
directly comparable with that of the ten-month period ended 
31 December 2016.
2.2. Adoption of international financial reporting standards
In the current year, the Group has adopted the amendments to 
IFRSs issued by the International Accounting Standards Board 
(IASB) that are mandatory effective for an accounting period 
that begins on or after 1 January 2017. Their adoption has not 
had any material impact on the disclosures or on the amounts 
reported in these financial statements.
The Group has not applied the following new and revised  
IFRSs that have been issued but are not yet effective for the  
period ended 31 December 2017. However, they are available 
for early application:
•  IFRS 15 “Revenue from contracts with customers”. IFRS 15 
specifies how and when an IFRS reporter will recognise 
revenue as well as requiring such entities to provide users 
of financial statements with more informative, relevant 
disclosures. Its application is effective for an entity’s first 
annual IFRS financial statements for periods beginning 
on or after 1 January 2018, with early adoption permitted. 
Management have performed an initial analysis on the type 
of revenues and contracts with customers, concluding that 
the standard is not expected to have a significant impact on 
the Group financial statements.
•  IFRS 9 “Financial instruments”. IFRS 9 is the IASB’s 
replacement of IAS 39 Financial Instruments “Recognition 
and Measurement”. This replacement introduces a new 
expected loss impairment model and limited changes to the 
classification and measurement requirements for financial 
assets. Its application is effective for reporting periods 
beginning on or after January 1, 2018, with early adoption 
permitted. Management have performed an analysis on the 
type of financial instruments, concluding that the standard 
is not expected to have a significant impact on the Group 
financial statements.
•  IFRS 16 “Leases” (published in January 2016). New standard 
on leases. IFRS 16 is the IASB’s replacement of IAS 17.  
Its application is effective for reporting periods beginning on 
or after January 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted. IFRS 
16 eliminates the classification of leases as either operating 
leases or finance leases for a lessee. Leases are ‘capitalised’ 
by recognising the present value of the lease payments and 
showing them either as lease assets (right-of-use assets) 
or together with property, plant and equipment. IFRS 16 
replaces the straight-line operating lease expense for those 
leases applying IAS 17 with a depreciation charge for the 
lease asset (included within operating costs) and an interest 
expense on the lease liability (included within finance 
costs). At 31 December 2017 operating lease commitments 
amounted to ¤3,746 thousand before the application of any 
discount rate to these future cash flows, and the charge to 
the income statement for operating lease costs was ¤999 
thousand. Management are in the process of performing 
further analysis to determine the value of the right-of-use 
asset and associated lease liabilities, including whether  
and when extension and termination options are likely to  
be exercised.
2.3. Going concern
The Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group 
has adequate resources to continue in operational existence 
for the foreseeable future. The Directors have considered the 
Group forecasts and projections, taking account of reasonably 
possible changes in trading performance and the current 
economic uncertainty, and are satisfied that the Group should 
be able to operate within the level of its current facilities. 
Further, the Directors have reviewed the terms of the underlying 
agreements, including a review of forecast compliance with 
loan covenants, and are satisfied that these terms will be met 
for a period of no less than 12 months from the date of these 
financial statements. Accordingly, they have adopted the going 
concern basis in preparing these financial statements. 46 GYG plc
2.4. Basis of consolidation
The Group financial statements incorporate the financial 
statements of the Company and enterprises controlled by the 
Company (and its subsidiaries) made up to 31 December  
each period. 
Control is achieved where the Company has the power to 
govern the financial and operating policies of an investee 
entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during  
the period are included in the consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income from the effective date of acquisition  
or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate. Where 
necessary, adjustments are made to the financial information of 
subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with 
those used by the Group. All intra-group transactions, balances, 
income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation process.
2.5. Business combinations
Acquisitions of subsidiaries and businesses are accounted for 
using the acquisition method. The consideration for each 
acquisition is measured as the aggregate of the fair values  
(at the date of exchange) of assets given, liabilities incurred  
or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in 
exchange for control of the acquire. Acquisition-related costs 
are recognised in profit or loss as incurred.
The acquirer’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent 
liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 
are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date.
2.6. Intangible assets
Intangible assets acquired separately
Intangible assets with finite useful lives that are acquired 
separately are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation 
and accumulated impairment losses. Amortisation is 
recognised on a straight-line basis over their estimated  
useful economic lives. The estimated useful economic life and 
amortisation method are reviewed at the end of each reporting 
period, with the effect of any changes in estimate being 
accounted for on a prospective basis. Intangible assets with 
indefinite useful economic lives that are acquired separately 
are carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
Computer software is valued at acquisition cost, amortisation 
is registered as a function of the useful economic life 
determined between 3 and 5 years.
Goodwill 
Goodwill arising in a business combination is recognised as an 
asset at the date that control is acquired (the acquisition date). 
Goodwill is measured as the excess of the sum of the 
consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling 
interest in the acquire and the fair value of the acquirer’s 
previously held equity interest (if any) in the entity over the net 
of the acquisition-date fair value of the identifiable assets 
acquired and the liabilities assumed.
Goodwill is not amortised but is reviewed for impairment at 
least annually. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill 
is allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units 
(‘‘CGUs’’) expected to benefit from the synergies of the 
combination. CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated are 
tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there 
is an indication that the unit may be impaired. If the recoverable 
amount of the CGU is less than the carrying amount of the unit, 
the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying 
amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the 
other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying 
amount of each asset in the unit. An impairment loss recognised 
for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.
On disposal of a subsidiary, the attributable amount of goodwill 
is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
Intangible assets acquired in a business combination
Intangible assets acquired in a business combination and 
recognised separately from goodwill are initially recognised  
at their fair value at the acquisition date (which is regarded  
as their cost).
Subsequent to initial recognition, intangible assets acquired in 
a business combination are reported at cost less accumulated 
amortisation and accumulated impairment losses, on the same 
basis as intangible assets that are acquired separately.
Order backlog has an estimated useful economic life of less 
than one year. Customer relationships and brands have an 
estimated useful economic life of 15 years.
Derecognition of intangible assets
An Intangible asset is derecognised on disposal, or when no 
future economic benefits are expected from use or disposal. 
Gains or losses arising from de recognition of an intangible 
asset, measured as the difference between the net disposal 
proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset, are recognised 
in profit or loss when the asset is derecognised.
2.7. Revenue recognition
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration 
received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for 
goods and services provided in the normal course of business, 
net of discounts, VAT and other sales-related taxes. Revenue is 
reduced for any rebates and other similar allowances.
Sale of goods
Supply revenues from the sale of goods are recognised when 
the goods are delivered and titles have passed, at which time 
all the following conditions are satisfied:
• the Group has transferred to the buyer the significant risks 
and rewards of ownership of the goods;
• the Group retains neither continuing managerial involvement 
to the degree usually associated with ownership nor effective 
control over the goods sold;
• the amount of the revenue can be measured reliably;
• it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the 
transaction will flow to the Group; and
• the costs incurred or to be incurred in respect of the 
transaction can be measured reliably.
Rendering of services
Coating revenues from contracts to provide services are 
recognised by reference to the stage of completion method. 
The stage of completion of a contract is determined as follows:
N O T E S T O T H E C O N S O L I D A T E D 
F I N A N C IA L S T A TEM ENT S ( C O NT I N U ED ) Annual report and financial statements 2017 47
Financial Statements
• Revenue is recognised by reference to the stage of 
completion of the refit or new build project, determined  
as the proportion of the total time expected on the project 
that has elapsed at the end of the reporting period;
• revenue from time and material contracts is recognised at 
the contractual rates as labour hours and direct expenses  
are incurred; and
• servicing fees included in the price of products sold are 
recognised by reference to the proportion of the total cost 
of providing the servicing for the product sold.
2.8. Leases
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of 
the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of 
ownership to the lessee. All other leases are classified as 
operating leases.
Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of 
the Group at their fair value or, if lower, at the present value of 
the minimum lease payments, each determined at the inception 
of the lease. The corresponding liability to the lessor is included 
in the balance sheet as obligations under finance leases.
Finance lease payments are apportioned between interest and 
reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant 
rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Interest 
on obligations under finance leases is recognised in profit or 
loss. Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to 
the consolidated statement of comprehensive income on a 
straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease except 
where another more systematic basis is more representative of 
the time pattern in which economic benefits from the lease 
asset are consumed. In the event that lease incentives are 
received to enter into operating leases, such incentives are 
recognised as a liability. The aggregate benefit of incentives is 
recognised as a reduction of rental expense on a straight-line 
basis, except where another systematic basis is more 
representative of the time pattern in which economic benefits 
from the leased asset are consumed.
2.9. Exceptional items
Certain items are presented in the Consolidated Statement of 
Comprehensive Income as exceptional where, in the judgement 
of the Directors, by virtue of their nature, size or incidence in 
order to obtain a clear and consistent presentation of the 
Group’s underlying business performance they need to be 
disclosed separately. Examples of items which may give rise  
to disclosure as exceptional items include restructuring costs  
and transaction fees. See note 6 for further details.
2.10. Adjusted EBITDA
Certain non-IFRS measures such as operating profit before 
finance costs, taxation, depreciation, amortisation, performance 
share plan charges and exceptional items (“Adjusted EBITDA”) 
have been included in the financial information, as the Directors 
and Proposed Directors believe that these provide important 
alternative measures with which to assess the Group’s 
performance. You should not consider “Adjusted EBITDA” as 
an alternative for Revenue or Operating Profit which are IFRS 
measures. Additionally, the Company’s calculation of “Adjusted 
EBITDA” may be different from the calculation used by other 
companies and therefore comparability may be limited.
2.11. Foreign currency
For the purpose of presenting these financial statements, the 
assets and liabilities of the Group’s foreign operations are 
translated at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet 
date. Income and expense items are translated at the average 
exchange rates for the period, unless exchange rates fluctuate 
significantly during that period, in which case the exchange 
rates at the date of transactions are used. Exchange differences 
arising, if any, are recognised in other comprehensive income 
and accumulated in a separate component of equity (attributed 
to no monetary items are recognised in profit or loss in the 
period in which they arise except for non-controlling interests 
as appropriate). Exchange differences are recognised in profit 
or loss in the period in which they arise except for:
• exchange differences on foreign currency borrowings 
relating to assets under construction for future productive 
use, which are included in the cost of those assets when they 
are regarded as an adjustment to interest costs on those 
foreign currency borrowings;
• exchange differences on transactions entered into in order 
to hedge certain foreign currency risks; and
• exchange differences on monetary items receivable from or 
payable to a foreign operation for which settlement is neither 
planned nor likely to occur (therefore forming part of the net 
investment in the foreign operation), which are recognised 
initially in other comprehensive income and reclassified from 
equity to profit or loss on repayment of the monetary items.
2.12. Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently 
payable and deferred tax.
2.12.1. Current Tax
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the 
period. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the 
consolidated statement of comprehensive income because it 
excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or 
deductible in other periods and it further excludes items that 
are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current 
tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
The Spanish subsidiaries group companies, are included  
in a consolidated tax return within fiscal group under  
Spanish regulation.
2.12.2. Deferred Tax
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable 
on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and 
liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding  
tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and  
is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. 
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable 
temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised 
to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be 
available against which deductible temporary differences  
can be utilised. 48 GYG plc
2.12.2. Deferred T ax (continued)
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary 
difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or 
from the initial recognition (other than in a business 
combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that 
affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary 
differences arising on investments except where the Group is 
able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and  
it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in 
the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each 
balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no 
longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available 
to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to 
apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is 
realised based on tax laws and rates that have been enacted  
or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. Deferred 
tax is charged or credited in the consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income, except when it relates to items charged 
or credited in other comprehensive income, in which case the 
deferred tax is also dealt with in other comprehensive income.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a 
legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against 
current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes 
levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to 
settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
2.13. Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less 
accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment loss.
Depreciation is recognised so as to write off the cost of assets 
(other than land and assets under construction) less their 
residual values over their useful economic lives, using the 
straight-line method in the following bases:
Useful economic
lives (years)
Property 10–33
Plant and equipment 3–10
Other plant, tools and furniture 4–10
Other tangible assets 3–20
The estimated useful economic lives, residual values and 
depreciation method are reviewed at the end of each reporting 
period, with the effect of any changes in estimate accounted 
for on a prospective basis.
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their 
expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets. 
However, when there is no reasonable certainty that ownership 
will be obtained by the end of the lease term, assets are 
depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and their  
useful lives.
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an item 
of property, plant and equipment is determined as the 
difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying 
amount of the asset and is recognised in profit or loss.
2.14. Impairment of tangible and intangible assets  
excluding goodwill
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying 
amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine 
whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered 
an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable 
amount of the asset is estimated to determine the extent of the 
impairment loss (if any). Where the asset does not generate 
cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group 
estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit 
to which the asset belongs.
An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is tested for 
impairment at least annually and whenever there is an 
indication that the asset may be impaired.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell 
and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future 
cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax 
discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the 
time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which 
the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) 
is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying 
amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to  
its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised 
immediately in profit or loss.
2.15. Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower cost and net realisable 
value. Costs of inventories are determined on weighted average 
price basis. Net realisable value represents the estimated 
selling price for inventories less all estimated costs of 
completion and costs necessary to make the sale.
2.16. Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present 
obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event,  
it is probable that the Group will be required to settle that 
obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount 
of the obligation.
The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of 
the consideration required to settle the present obligation at 
the balance sheet date, taking into account the risks and 
uncertainties surrounding the obligation. Where a provision is 
measured using the cash flows estimated to settle the present 
obligation, its carrying amount is the present value of those 
cash flows.
When some or all of the economic benefits required to settle  
a provision are expected to be recovered from a third party,  
a receivable is recognised as an asset if it is virtually certain 
that reimbursement will be received and the amount of the 
receivable can be measured reliably.

F I N A N C IA L S T A TEM ENT S ( C O NT I N U ED ) Annual report and financial statements 2017 49
Financial Statements
2.17. Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the 
Group’s balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the 
contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial assets and financial liabilities are initially measured at 
fair value. Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the 
acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities 
(other than financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value 
through profit or loss) are added to or deducted from the fair 
value of the financial assets or financial liabilities, as appropriate, 
on initial recognition. Transaction costs directly attributable to 
the acquisition of financial assets or financial liabilities at fair 
value through profit or loss are recognised immediately in 
profit or loss.
2.18. Financial assets
Financial assets are classified into the following specified 
categories: financial assets ‘at fair value through profit or loss’ 
(FVTPL), ‘held-to-maturity’ investments, ‘available-for-sale’ 
(AFS) financial assets and ‘loans and receivables’. The 
classification depends on the nature and purpose of the 
financial assets and is determined at the time of initial 
recognition. All regular way purchases or sales of financial 
assets are recognised and de recognised on a trade date basis. 
Regular way purchases or sales are purchases or sales of 
financial assets that require delivery of assets within the time 
frame established by regulation or convention in the marketplace.
Financial assets belonging to the Company are classified in 
these categories:
Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with 
fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an 
active market. Loans and receivables (including trade and 
other receivables, bank balances and cash, and others describe) 
are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest 
method, less any impairment.
Interest income is recognised by applying the effective interest 
rate, except for short-term receivables when the effect of 
discounting is immaterial.
Held for trading 
A financial asset is classified as held for trading if:
• it has been acquired principally for the purpose of selling it 
in the near term; or
• on initial recognition it is part of a portfolio of identified 
financial instruments that the Group manages together and 
has a recent actual pattern of short-term profit-taking; or
• it is a derivative that is not designated and effective as a 
hedging instrument.
Financial assets at FVTPL are stated at fair value, with any 
gains or losses arising on re measurement recognised in profit 
or loss. The net gain or loss recognised in profit or loss 
incorporates any dividend or interest earned on the financial 
asset and is included in the “other gains and losses” line item  
in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
2.18.1. Effective interest method
The effective interest method is a method of calculating the 
amortised cost of a debt instrument and of allocating interest 
income over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is 
the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts 
(including all fees and points paid or received that form an 
integral part of the effective interest rate, transaction costs and 
other premiums or discounts) through the expected life of the 
debt instrument, or, where appropriate, a shorter period, to the 
net carrying amount on initial recognition.
2.18.2.  Impairment of financial assets
Financial assets, other than those at FVTPL, are assessed for 
indicators of impairment at the end of each reporting period. 
Financial assets are considered to be impaired when there is 
objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events that 
occurred after the initial recognition of the financial asset, the 
estimated future cash flows of the investment have been affected.
2.19. Financial liabilities
Financial liabilities (including borrowings and trade and other 
payables) are subsequently measured at amortised cost using 
the effective interest method.
2.20. Derivative financial instruments
The Group enters into interest rate swaps to manage its 
exposure to interest rate risks.
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date 
derivative contracts are entered into and are subsequently re 
measured to their fail value at the end of each reporting period. 
The resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss 
immediately unless the derivative is designated and effective 
as a hedging instrument, in which event the timing of the 
recognition in profit or loss depends on the nature of the  
hedge relationship.
2.21. Related party transactions
The Group performs all its transactions with related parties on 
an arm’s length basis. The Group carries out all its related-
party transactions (financial, commercial or otherwise) by 
setting transfer prices stipulated by the OECD to regulate 
transactions with subsidiaries.
2.22. Consolidated cash flow statements
In these financial statements cash and cash equivalents 
comprise cash and short-term bank deposits with an original 
maturity of three months or less, net of outstanding bank 
overdrafts. The carrying amount of these assets is approximately 
equal to their fair value.
The consolidated cash flow statements have been prepared 
using the indirect method and the terms used are defined  
as follows:
• Cash flows: inflows and outflows of cash and cash 
equivalents, which are short-term, highly liquid investments 
that are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
• Operating activities: the principal revenue-producing activities 
of the entities composing the consolidated Group and other 
activities that are not investing or financing activities. 50 GYG plc
2.22. Consolidated cash flow statements (continued)
• Investing activities: the acquisition and disposal of long-term 
assets and other investments not included in cash and cash 
equivalents, if they have a direct impact on current cash flows.
• Financing activities: activities that result in changes in the 
size and composition of the equity and liabilities that are not 
operating activities, if they have a direct impact on current 
cash flows.
2.23. Share-based payments
Equity-settled share-based payments to employees and other 
providing similar services are measured at the fair value of the 
equity instruments at the grant date. The fair value excludes 
the effect of non-market vesting conditions. Details regarding 
the determination of the fair value of equity-settled share-
based pay are set out in note 24.
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-
settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line 
basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of 
equity instruments that will eventually vest. At each balance 
sheet date, the Group revises its estimate of the number of 
equity instruments expected to vest as a result of the effect  
of non-market-based vesting conditions. The impact of the 
revision of the original estimates, if any, is recognised in profit 
or loss such that the cumulative expense reflects the revised 
estimate, with a corresponding adjustment to equity reserves.
Equity-settled share-based payment transactions with parties 
other than employees are measured at the fair value of the 
services received, except where the fair value cannot be 
estimated reliably, in which case they are measured at the fair 
value of the equity instruments granted, measured at the date 
the counterparty renders the service. 
3. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS AND KEY 
SOURCES OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY
In the application of the Group’s accounting policies, which  
are described in note 2, the Directors are required to make 
judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying 
amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent 
from other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions 
are based on historical experience and other factors that are 
considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from  
these estimates. 
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on  
an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are 
recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the 
revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision 
and future periods if the revision affects both current and 
future periods.
3.1 Critical judgements in applying the Group’s  
accounting policies
The following are the critical judgements, apart from those 
involving estimations (which are dealt with separately below), 
that the Directors have made in the process of applying the 
Group’s accounting policies and that have the most significant 
effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements.
3.1.1. Provisions
When evaluating the impact of potential liabilities arising from 
claims against the Group, the Directors take legal advice to 
assist them in arriving at their estimation of the liability taking 
into account the probability of the success of any claims and 
also the likely development of claims based on recent trends.
3.2. Key sources of estimation uncertainty
When preparing the financial statements, management 
undertakes a number of judgements, estimates and 
assumptions about the recognition and measurement of 
assets, liabilities, income and expenses based on historical 
experience and other factors considered reasonable at the 
time. Actual outcomes are likely to differ from the estimates 
made by management and actual results will seldom equal 
projected results. 
The Group does not have any major sources of estimation 
uncertainty that have a significant risk of resulting in a material 
adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities 
within the next financial year. Information about judgements, 
estimates and assumptions, which have the most significant 
effect on the recognition and measurement of assets, liabilities, 
income and expenses, although do not have a significant risk 
of resulting in a material adjustment to the carrying amounts 
of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are 
discussed below.
3.2.1. Impairment of goodwill
Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an 
estimation of the value in use of the cash-generating units to 
which goodwill has been allocated. The value in use calculation 
requires the Directors to estimate the future cash flows 
expected to arise from the cash-generating unit and a suitable 
discount rate in order to calculate present value. Where the 
actual future cash flows are less than expected, an impairment 
loss may arise.
3.2.2. Revenue recognition
Revenue from contracts to provide services is recognised by 
reference to the stage of completion of the contract, 
determined as the proportion of the total labour hours 
expected to provide the service that have elapsed at the end of 
the reporting period. This requires the Directors to estimate 
labour hours to complete, based on the Company’s experience 
and professional judgement.
4. SEGMENT INFORMATION
The Groups reportable segments are determined by the 
internal reporting regularly provided to the Group’s Chief 
Operating Decision Maker. The Chief Operating Decision Maker, 
who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing 
performance of the operating segments, has been identified  
as the Board of Directors.
The Board of Directors has determined that, based on the 
Group’s management and internal reporting structure, the 
Group has two reportable segments, Coatings – the provision 
of painting and other finishing services to yachts and 
superyachts and Supply – the distribution of yachting supplies 
to trade and other customers.

11. EARNINGS PER SHARE
From continuing operations
Basic earnings/(losses) per share are calculated by dividing net profit/(loss) for the year attributable to the Group (i.e. after tax 
and non-controlling interests) by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during that year.
Diluted earnings/(losses) per share have been calculated on a similar basis taking into account dilutive potential shares under the 
agreements disclosed in note 24.
Adjusted basic earnings per share are presented to eliminate the effect of the exceptional items, amortisation of intangible assets 
and performance share plan costs (considering the tax effect of these adjustments).

At 31 December 2016 the Group had no convertible securities and therefore diluted earnings per share were the same as basic 
earnings per share.

12. GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS (CONTINUED)
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired. 
Determining the recoverable amount of goodwill requires the use of estimates by management. 
The recoverable amount is the higher of the fair value minus the costs of selling and its value in use. The Group uses cash-flow 
discounting methods to determine such amounts. 
The discounted cash-flows are calculated based on 3-year projections of the budgets approved by the management.  
These cash-flows consider past experience and represent the best estimate of management on future market developments  
and Group performance. 
The key assumptions for determining the fair value minus costs of selling and value in use include the weighted average cost of 
capital, which has been estimated at 11.8% for the goodwill registered and a long-term growth rate of 1.0% per cent for each of the 
Coating and Supply segments. These estimates, including the methodology used, may have a significant impact on the registered 
values and impairment losses. Management has concluded that the estimated growth rate used does not exceed the average  
long-term growth rate for the relevant markets where the Group operates (Europe and USA).
According to the impairment test carried out at year-end, there are no impairment losses on the registered goodwill.

Trade receivables disclosed above are classified as loans and receivables and are therefore measured at amortised cost. 
Trade and other receivables are all current and any fair value difference is not material. Trade receivables are considered past  
due once they have passed their contracted due date.
Amounts invoiced to customers are due in 30 days. The Group recognises an allowance for doubtful debts of 100% against those 
receivables overdue that after a specific analysis are considered not recoverable. 
Trade receivables disclosed above include amounts (see below for aged analysis) which are past due at the reporting date but 
against which the Group has not recognised an allowance for doubtful receivables because there has not been a significant change 
in credit quality of the customers and the amounts are still considered recoverable. The average age of trade receivables at  
31 December 2017 is 28 days (36 days in 2016).
The Group does not hold any collateral or other credit enhancements over any of its trade receivables nor does it have a legal right 
of offset against any amounts owed by the Group to the counterparty.
Amounts receivable from customers can be analysed as follows:
 31 December 2017

31 December 2016

17.1. Summary of the borrowing arrangements
Syndicated loan –
On 3 March 2016, the Group subsidiary, Hemisphere Coating Services, S.L., signed a syndicated loan agreement with three financial 
institutions for a total amount of ¤13,707 thousand expiring on March 2021. This syndicated loan is guaranteed by certain of the 
Group subsidiaries and consists of two different facilities:
• Facility A: loan for a total amount of ¤9,180 thousand with biannual maturities of ¤918 thousand until expiration on March 2021 
since the beginning of the contract.
• Facility B: loan for a total amount of ¤4,000 thousand of euros maturing at the end of the contract.
Both facilities bear interest at EURIBOR +3%.
Additionally, the loan includes a revolving credit facility which limit amounts to ¤527 thousand with biannual maturities coinciding 
with those for the facility A. It bears interest at EURIBOR + 3%. 
In March 2016, the Group entered into this syndicated loan with the primary purpose of financing the dividends to be paid  
to former shareholders at the time, refinancing the indebtedness of the Group and financing any costs and expenses incurred  
in relation to the transaction discussed in note 6.
The loan requires compliance with certain financial covenants measured biannually at 30 June and 31 December each year.  
At 31 December 2017 and 2016 the Group has achieved the financial covenants required by the syndicated loan.
Shareholders’ loan notes –
On the 23 June 2017 the shareholders approved the repayment of the total amount of the Investor Loan Notes immediately 
following Admission of the Company to AIM.  60 GYG plc

As of 31 December 2017, the Group has a current provision amounting to ¤304 thousand, for re-painting guarantees contemplated 
in the contractual agreements with clients for the painting of boats and vessels. This provision is calculated as an average 
percentage of the guarantees borne in the past three years compared to the total turnover for the corresponding year. 
As of 31 December 2017, the Group has a non-current provision amounting to ¤800 thousand relating to contractual claims made 
by a shipyard against the Group under the terms of a Superyacht painting agreement, entered into between the Group and the 
shipyard in relation to i) damage to the paint work of the superyacht since completion of the services, ii) undulations, and iii) 
certain visible defects in the topcoat paint of the hull of the Superyacht. The claims regarding damage to the paint work and the 
undulations have been rejected by the Group with supporting evidence. Investigations are being carried out in conjunction with 
the relevant paint manufacturer in relation to the visible defects in the topcoat paint. It is estimated that the Group’s cost of repair 
works for this would be in the region of ¤800 thousand. The paint manufacturer has agreed to meet the costs of repair works up 
to ¤825 thousand. A receivable has been recognised for ¤800 thousand, being the estimated cost of the works. Negotiations are 
ongoing between the Group, the paint manufacturer and the shipyard in order to reach a settlement on this matter.
In 2017, the Group has proceeded to pay the balance registered as legal and tax provisions at 31 December 2016.
At 31 December 2017 the Group and its legal advisers consider that the provisions recorded are sufficient for covering future obligations.

share capital. ACA, SAS is a superyacht painting and finishing company operating out of the South of France and was acquired 
with the objective to drive growth in this region.

Additionally, the Group is party to certain agreements in relation to the shares in ACA, SAS with SARL Atko, a company controlled 
by Christopher Atkinson, who is also the general manager and former majority shareholder of ACA, SAS:
a) ACA Marine UK is party to an initial agreement dated 11 March 2017 and modified on 12 December 2017 where an additional cash 
consideration was agreed in relation with the transfer of the industrial business and property owned by ACA, SAS to a company 
controlled by Christopher Atkinson. The estimated additional consideration for this matter amounts to ¤164 thousand.
b) Included in the above agreements a put and call option agreement between ACA Marine UK and SARL Atko (further details  
of which are set out below).
Non-controlling interests
The non-controlling interest (30%) in ACA, SAS recognised at the acquisition date was measured by reference to the fair value  
of the non-controlling interest and amounted to ¤309 thousand.
Goodwill arising on acquisition
The goodwill arising from the acquisition amounting to ¤710 thousand corresponds to a premium paid for entering a new market 
as well as acquisition synergies.
None of the goodwill recognised is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.
Other financial liabilities
On the purchase date the parties also signed a Put and Call Option Agreement in which the Group granted to SARL Atko the right 
to require the Group to acquire and receive the amount of shares that SARL Atko holds in ACA, SAS. This option is exercisable 
during a period of one month commencing on the third anniversary of the date of the put and call option agreement  
(being 11 March 2020). As at 31 December 2017, this option was deemed to have a negligible fair value, however a financial liability 
of ¤963 thousand has been recognised based on the expected purchase price for the equity if the seller exercises their option.
Impact of acquisition on the results of the Group
ACA, SAS contributed ¤2,283 thousand revenue and ¤400 thousand gross margin to the Group’s profit for the period between 
the date of acquisition and balance sheet date.

Management of the Group’s financial risks is centralised in the Group’s Finance Department, which has established mechanisms  
to monitor interest rate and exchange rate exposure, as well as credit and liquidity risk. The main financial risks affecting the  
Group are indicated below:
1. Credit risk
Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group. 
The Group has adopted a policy of only dealing with creditworthy counterparties. Credit exposure is controlled by counterparty 
limits. There are no significant counterparties.
2. Liquidity risk
The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate cash reserves.
3. Market risk
The Group’s activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in interest rates. The Group’s management focuses on 
the uncertainty of financial markets and attempts to minimise the potential adverse effects on its profitability. The Group enters 
into derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to interest rate risk, with three Interest Rate Swaps to mitigate the risk 
of rising interest rates. 66 GYG plc

resolution, and resolutions 11, 12 and 13 will be proposed as 
special resolutions:
10  That: 
(a)  the Directors be generally and unconditionally 
authorised pursuant to section 551 of the Companies 
Act 2006 (the “Act”) to: 
(i) allot shares in the Company, and to grant rights to 
subscribe for or to convert any security into shares 
in the Company: 
A. up to an aggregate nominal amount of 
£31,062.24; and 
B. comprising equity securities (as defined in the 
Act) up to an aggregate nominal amount of 
£62,217.76 (including within the applicable

paragraph A. above), in connection with an 
offer by way of a rights issue: 
i. to holders of ordinary shares in proportion 
(as nearly as may be practicable) to their 
existing holdings; and 
ii. to people who are holders of other equity 
securities if this is required by the rights of 
those securities or, if the Directors consider 
it necessary, as permitted by the rights of 
those securities, 
 and so that the Directors may impose any 
limits or restrictions and make any 
arrangements which they consider necessary 
or appropriate to deal with treasury shares, 
fractional entitlements, record dates, legal, 
regulatory or practical problems in, or under 
the laws of, any territory or any other matter; 
 for a period expiring (unless previously renewed, 
varied or revoked by the Company in general 
meeting) at the end of the next annual general 
meeting of the Company after the date on which 
this resolution is passed (or if earlier at the close of 
business on 29 August 2019); and

authority had not expired; 
(b)  subject to paragraph (c) below, all existing authorities 
given to the Directors pursuant to section 551 of the 
Act be revoked by this; and 
(c)  paragraph (b) above shall be without prejudice to the 
continuing authority of the Directors to allot shares, or 
grant rights to subscribe for or convert any security 
into shares, pursuant to an offer or agreement made by 
the Company before the expiry of the authority 
pursuant to which such offer or agreement was made.  72 GYG plc
11   That, subject to the passing of resolution 10, the Directors 
be generally empowered pursuant to section 570 and 
section 573 of the Act to allot equity securities (as defined 
in the Act) for cash pursuant to the authority conferred  
by resolution 10 as if section 561(1) of the Act did not apply 
to the allotment provided that this power: 
(a)  shall be limited to the allotment of equity securities in 
connection with an offer of equity securities (but in the 
case of the authority granted under resolution 10(a)(i)
B by way of a rights issue only): 
i.  to the ordinary shareholders in proportion (as 
nearly as may be practicable) to their existing 
holdings; 
ii.  to holders of other equity securities, if this is 
required by the rights of those securities or, if the 
Directors consider it necessary, as permitted by 
the rights of those securities, and so that the 
Directors may impose any limits or restrictions  
and make any arrangements which they consider 
necessary or appropriate to deal with treasury 
shares, fractional entitlements, record dates, legal, 
regulatory or practical problems in, or under the 
laws of, any territory or any other matter; and 
(b) in the case of the authority granted under resolution 
10(a)(i)A shall be limited to the allotment of equity 
securities for cash otherwise than pursuant to 
paragraph (a) up to an aggregate nominal amount of 
£4,664.00. This power applies in relation to a sale of 
shares which is an allotment of equity securities by 
virtue of section 560(3) of the Act as if in the first 
paragraph of this resolution the words “pursuant to  
the authority conferred by resolution 10” were omitted; 
(c) expires (unless previously renewed, varied or revoked 
by the Company in a general meeting) at the end  
of the next annual general meeting of the Company 
after the date on which this resolution is passed or,  
if earlier, at the close of business on 29 August 2019, 
but the Company may make an offer or agreement 
before the power expires which would or might require 
equity securities to be allotted after expiry of this 
power and the Directors may allot equity securities in 
pursuance of that offer or agreement as if this power 
had not expired.
12   That, subject to the passing of resolution 10, the Directors 
be generally empowered in addition to any power granted 
under resolution 11, to allot equity securities (as defined 
in the Act for cash pursuant to the authority conferred  
by resolution 10 as if section 561(1) of the Act did not apply 
to the allotment provided that this power: 
(a)  In the case of the authority granted under resolution 
10(a)(i)(A) shall be: 
(i)  limited to the allotment of equity securities up to 
an aggregate nominal amount of £4,664.00; and 
(ii)  used only for the purposes of financing (or 
refinancing, if the authority is to be used within  
six months after the original transaction) a 
transaction which the Directors determine to be  
an acquisition or other capital investment of a kind 
contemplated by the Statement of Principles on 
Disapplying Pre-Emption Rights most recently 
published by the Pre-Emption Group prior to the 
date of this notice. This power applies in relation  
to a sale of shares which is an allotment of equity 
securities by virtue of section 560(3) of the Act  
as if in the first paragraph of this resolution the 
words “pursuant to the authority conferred by 
resolution 10” were omitted; 
(b) expires (unless previously renewed, varied or revoked 
by the Company in a general meeting) at the end of 
the next annual general meeting of the Company after 
the date on which this resolution is passed or, if earlier, 
at the close of business on 29 August 2019, but the 
Company may make an offer or agreement before the 
power expires which would or might require equity 
securities to be allotted after expiry of this power and 
the Directors may allot equity securities in pursuance 
of that offer or agreement as if the authority had  
not expired.
13  That the articles of association of the Company shall be 
amended with effect from the conclusion of the annual 
general meeting by making the alterations marked on 
the print of the articles of association of the Company 
produced to the meeting and initialled by the Chairman  
for the purposes of identification. 
Your Board believes that the resolutions to be proposed as 
ordinary and special business at the annual general meeting 
are in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders 
as a whole. Accordingly, your Directors unanimously 
recommend that shareholders vote in favour of the resolutions, 
as they intend to do in respect of their own beneficial holdings 
of shares in the Company.

EXPLANATORY NOTES TO THE RESOLUTIONS
The notes on the following pages explain the resolutions to  
be proposed at the annual general meeting of GYG plc (the 
“Company”) to be held at the offices of CMS Cameron McKenna 
Nabarro Olswang LLP, Cannon Place, 78 Cannon Street, 
London EC4N 6AF, United Kingdom on 29 May 2018 at 11.30 
am (the “annual general meeting”).
Resolutions 1 to 10 are proposed as ordinary resolutions.  
This means that for each of those resolutions to be passed, 
more than half of the votes cast must be in favour of the 
resolution. Resolutions 11, 12 and 13 are proposed as special 
resolutions. This means that for each of those resolutions to  
be passed, at least three quarters of the votes cast must be  
in favour of the resolution.
RESOLUTION 1 – ADOPTION OF REPORT AND ACCOUNTS
For each financial year, the Directors are required to present 
the Directors’ Report, the audited accounts and the Auditor’s 
report to shareholders at a general meeting. The financial 
statements and reports laid before the annual general meeting 
are for the financial year ended 31 December 2017, and the 
Company proposes a resolution on its financial statements  
and reports.
RESOLUTION 2, 3, 4, 5, AND 6 –  
RE-ELECTION OF DIRECTORS 
All Directors are subject to election by shareholders at the first 
annual general meeting following their appointment by the 
Board. The Company’s current articles of association, which 
came into effect on 21 June 2017, state that all Directors are 
subject to election by shareholders at the first annual general 
meeting following their appointment by the Board. As all the 
current Directors have not been appointed or re-appointed by 
the Company in a general meeting since their appointment, 
they will all retire at the forthcoming annual general meeting 
and, being eligible, will offer themselves for re-election. 
Resolutions 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 propose the re-election of Remy 
Millott, Gloria Fernandez, Rupert Savage, Stephen Murphy and 
Richard King respectively. 
At subsequent annual general meetings, one-third of the 
Directors must retire from office (or, if their number is not three 
or a multiple of three, the number nearest to but not exceeding 
one-third (unless their number is fewer than three, in which 
case one of them shall retire)). Additionally, any Director not 
otherwise required to retire from office at an annual general 
meeting shall do so unless he was appointed or re-appointed 
as a Director at either of the last two general meetings before 
that meeting.
The biographies of each of the five Directors are set out on 
pages 18 and 19 of the annual report and financial statements 
for the year ended 31 December 2017.
RESOLUTIONS 7 AND 8 – RE-APPOINTMENT  
OF AUDITOR AND AUDITOR’S REMUNERATION
Resolutions 7 and 8 propose the re-appointment of Deloitte 
LLP as the Company’s Auditor for the year ending 31 December 
2018, and the authorisation of the Directors to agree the 
Auditor’s remuneration. The Directors will delegate this 
authority to the Audit Committee.
RESOLUTION 9 – DIVIDEND
A total dividend can only be paid after shareholders have 
approved it in general meeting. Shareholders are being asked 
to approve a total dividend of 3.2 pence per ordinary share in 
respect of the year ended 31 December 2017. If shareholders 
approve the recommended total dividend, it will be paid on  
15 June 2018 to shareholders on the Company’s register of 
members at the close of business on the record date, which  
is 4 May 2018. The ex-dividend date will be 3 May 2018.
RESOLUTION 10 – AUTHORITY TO ALLOT SHARES
The Company’s Directors may only allot shares or grant rights 
to subscribe for, or convert any security into shares,  
if authorised to do so by shareholders. This resolution seeks  
to grant an authority under section 551 of the Act to authorise 
the Directors to allot shares in the Company or grant rights  
to subscribe for, or convert any security into, shares in the 
Company and will expire at the conclusion of the next annual 
general meeting of the Company or 29 August 2019 if earlier.
Paragraph (a)(i)A of resolution 10 will, if passed, authorise the 
Directors to allot shares or grant rights to subscribe for, or  
to convert any security into, such shares in the Company up  
to a maximum nominal amount of £31,062.24. This amount 
represents no more than 33.33% of the Company’s issued share 
capital as at 13 April 2018 (being the latest practicable date 
prior to the publication of this notice of annual general).
Paragraph (a)(i)B of resolution 10 authorises the Directors  
to allot, in addition to the shares referred to in (a)(i)A further 
shares up to an aggregate nominal amount of 33.33% of  
the Company’s issued share capital in connection with a  
pre-emptive offer to existing shareholders by way of a rights 
issue (with exclusions to deal with fractional entitlements  
to shares and overseas shareholders to whom the rights  
issue cannot be made due to legal and practical problems). 
This is in accordance with the latest guidelines published by 
the Investment Association.
This authority will expire on the conclusion of the next annual 
general meeting of the Company or 29 August 2019 if earlier. 
The Board has no present intention to exercise this authority. 
However, it is considered prudent to maintain the flexibility 
that this authority provides. The Company’s Directors intend  
to renew this authority annually. 
RESOLUTIONS 11 AND 12 –  
DISAPPLICATION OF PRE-EMPTION RIGHTS
These resolutions will be proposed as special resolutions. 
Under section 561(1) of the Act, if the Directors wish to allot 
ordinary shares, or grant rights to subscribe for, or convert 
securities into, ordinary shares, (which for this purpose includes 
a sale of treasury shares for cash) other than pursuant to an 
employee share scheme, they must in the first instance offer 
them to existing shareholders in proportion to their holdings. 
There may be occasions, however, when the Directors need the 
flexibility to finance business opportunities by the issue of 
shares without a pre-emptive offer to existing shareholders. 
This cannot be done under the Act unless the shareholders 
have first waived their pre-emption rights.  74 GYG plc

( C O NT I N U ED )
RESOLUTIONS 11 AND 12 –  
DISAPPLICATION OF PRE-EMPTION RIGHTS (continued)
The Directors have no present intention of exercising these 
authorities, but these resolutions are considered appropriate 
to give Directors the flexibility referred to above. The Directors 
intend to renew these authorities annually. If given, the 
authorities granted under resolutions 11 and 12 will expire at the 
conclusion of the next annual general meeting of the Company 
or 29 August 2019 if earlier. 
Resolution 11 asks shareholders to waive their pre-emption 
rights and, apart from rights issues or any other pre-emptive 
offer concerning equity securities, the authority contained in 
this resolution will be limited to the issue of shares for cash up 
to an aggregate nominal value of £4,664.00 (which includes, 
for this purpose, the sale on a non-pre-emptive basis of any 
shares held in treasury), which represents no more than 5%  
of the Company’s issued ordinary share capital (excluding 
treasury shares) as at 13 April 2018 (being the latest practicable 
date prior to the publication of this notice of annual general 
meeting). The Directors confirm that they have no intention to 
issue more than 7.5% of the issued share capital (excluding 
treasury shares) for cash on a non-pre-emptive basis during 
any rolling three-year period pursuant to the authority granted 
by resolution 11 and equivalent future authorities and the  
sale on a non-pre-emptive basis of any shares held in treasury 
will be considered an issue for cash for this purpose. 
Resolution 11 also seeks a disapplication of the pre-emption 
rights on a rights issue, so as to allow the Directors to make 
exclusions or such other arrangements as may be appropriate 
to resolve legal or practical problems which, for example, 
might arise with overseas shareholders. 
The Pre-Emption Group (the “PEG”) has issued a revised 
Statement of Principles (the “PEG Principles”) indicating  
that, in addition to the standard annual disapplication of  
pre-emption rights up to a maximum equal to 5% of issued 
ordinary share capital (requested in resolution 11), the PEG is 
supportive of extending the general disapplication authority 
by an additional 5% in certain specified circumstances.  
The PEG has recommended that companies request this  
additional disapplication authority in a separate resolution.  
Resolution 12 asks the shareholders to grant this additional  
disapplication authority. 
The authority sought in resolution 12 will be limited to the  
issue of shares for cash up to an aggregate nominal value  
of £4,664.00. (which includes, for this purpose, the sale of  
any shares held in treasury), which represents no more  
than 5% of the Company’s issued ordinary share capital  
(excluding treasury shares) as at 13 April 2018 (being the  
latest practicable date prior to the publication of this Notice) 
and may be used only for transactions that the Directors 
determine to be acquisitions or capital investments that fall 
within the PEG Principles.
RESOLUTION 13 – AMENDMENT TO THE  
COMPANY’S ARTICLES OF ASSOCIATION
The Company is seeking shareholder approval to amend its 
articles of association to include the following new regulation:
“80.2 The Directors will receive their remuneration from the 
subsidiary where they hold their service agreement as a 
consideration for the management services they render 
to the Company or any of its subsidiaries.”
The purpose of this amendment is to enable the Directors to 
be remunerated by the relevant Group subsidiary company for 
the management services rendered by them either to the 
Company or to any of its subsidiaries.”
PROCEDURAL AND EXPLANATORY NOTES
Entitlement to attend and vote
1  The right to attend and vote at the annual general meeting 
is determined by reference to the Company’s register 
of members. Only a member entered in the register of 
members as at close of business on 24 May 2018 (or, if 
the annual general meeting is adjourned, in the register of 
members as at the close of business on the date which 
is two business days before the time of the adjourned 
annual general meeting) is entitled to attend and vote at 
the annual general meeting and a member may vote in 
respect of the number of ordinary shares registered in the 
member’s name at that time. Changes to the entries in the 
register of members after that time shall be disregarded in 
determining the rights of any person to attend and vote at 
the annual general meeting.
Proxies
2
(a) As a member of the Company you are entitled to appoint 
a proxy to exercise all or any of your rights to attend, 
speak and vote at the annual general meeting. You can 
only appoint a proxy using the procedures set out in  
these notes.
(b) Appointment of a proxy does not preclude you from 
attending the meeting and voting in person. If you have 
appointed a proxy and attend the meeting in person,  
your proxy appointment will automatically be terminated.
(c) A proxy does not need to be a member of the Company 
but must attend the meeting to represent you. To appoint 
as your proxy a person other than the Chairman of the 
meeting, insert their full name in the box on your proxy 
form. If you sign and return your proxy form with no 
name inserted in the box, the Chairman of the meeting 
will be deemed to be your proxy. Where you appoint as 
your proxy someone other than the Chairman, you are 
responsible for ensuring that they attend the meeting and 
are aware of your voting intentions. If you wish your proxy 
to make any comments on your behalf, you will need to 
appoint someone other than the Chairman and give them 
the relevant instructions directly.
(d) You may appoint more than one proxy provided each 
proxy is appointed to exercise the rights attached to a 
different share or shares held by you. You may not appoint 
more than one proxy to exercise rights attached to any  
one share. Annual report and financial statements 2017 75
(e) If the proxy is being appointed in relation to less than 
your full voting entitlement, please enter in the box 
provided the number of shares in relation to which they 
are authorised to act as your proxy. If left blank your proxy 
will be deemed to be authorised in respect of your full 
voting entitlement (or if this proxy form has been issued 
in respect of a designated account for a shareholder, the 
full voting entitlement for that designated account). In the 
event of a conflict between a blank proxy form and a proxy 
form which states the number of shares to which it applies, 
the specific proxy form shall be counted first, regardless of 
whether it was sent or received before or after the blank 
proxy form, and any remaining shares in respect of which 
you are the registered holder will be apportioned to the 
blank proxy form. If you submit more than one completed 
valid proxy, the proxy received last before the latest time 
for receipt of proxies will take precedence.
(f)  To appoint more than one proxy, you may photocopy the 
proxy form. Please indicate in the box on the form the 
number of shares in relation to which they are authorised 
to act as your proxy. Please also indicate with an “X” in the 
place provided on the proxy form if the proxy instruction 
is one of multiple instructions being given. All forms  
must be signed and should be returned together in the 
same envelope. 
(g) To direct your proxy how to vote on the resolutions mark 
the appropriate box on your proxy form with an ‘X’.  
To abstain from voting on a resolution, select the relevant 
‘‘Vote withheld’’ box. A vote withheld is not a vote in law, 
which means that the vote will not be counted in the 
calculation of votes for or against the resolution. If you 
mark with an “X” “discretion”, or if no voting indication is 
given, your proxy will vote or abstain from voting as he  
or she sees fit.
(h) To appoint a proxy using this form, your proxy form  
must be: 
• completed and signed by the appointor or their duly 
authorised attorney;
• sent or delivered to the Company’s Registrars, Link 
Asset Services, at: PXS, 34 Beckenham Road, Beckenham 
BR3 4TU; and
• received by post or by hand by Link Asset Services no 
later than 11.30 am on 24 May 2018 (together with any 
power of attorney or other authority under which it  
is signed or a notarially certified copy of such power  
or a copy certified in accordance with the Power of  
Attorney Act 1971 or in some other manner approved  
by the Directors).
Completed proxy forms should NOT be sent to the Company’s 
registered office.
(i)  In the case of a member which is a company, your proxy 
form must be executed under its common seal or signed 
on its behalf by a duly authorised officer of the Company 
or an attorney for the Company stating their capacity  
(eg Director, Secretary).
(j)  Any power of attorney or any other authority under which 
your proxy form is signed (or a duly certified copy of  
such power or authority) must be included with your  
proxy form.
(k) CREST members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies 
by using the CREST electronic appointment service may 
do so by using the procedures described in the CREST 
Manual (available via www.euroclear.com/CREST) subject 
to the provisions of the Company’s articles of association. 
CREST personal members or other CREST sponsored 
members, and those CREST members who have appointed 
a voting service provider(s), should refer to their CREST 
sponsor or voting service provider(s), who will be able to 
take the appropriate action on their behalf. To be valid, 
the appropriate CREST message, regardless of whether it 
constitutes the appointment of a proxy or an amendment 
to the instructions given to a previously appointed proxy, 
must be transmitted so as to be received by our agent 
Link Asset Services, whose CREST participant ID is RA10,  
by 11.30 am on 24 May 2018. 
(l)  In the case of joint holders, where more than one of 
the joint holders purports to appoint a proxy, only the 
appointment submitted by the most senior holder will be 
accepted. Seniority is determined by the order in which 
the names of the joint holders appear in the Company’s 
register of members in respect of the joint holding  
(the first named being the most senior). 
(m) If you submit more than one valid proxy appointment, the 
appointment received last before the latest time for the 
receipt of proxies will take precedence.
(n) Save through CREST, we do not have a facility to receive 
proxy forms electronically. Therefore, you may not use any 
electronic address referred to in the proxy form or any 
related document to submit your proxy form.
(o) Pursuant to Regulation 41 of the Uncertificated Securities 
Regulations 2001, the Company specifies that only those 
members entered on the register of members of the 
Company as at close of business on 24 May 2018 or, in 
the event that this meeting is adjourned, on the register 
of members as at close of business on the day two days 
before the date of any adjourned meeting shall be entitled 
to attend and vote at the meeting in respect of the number 
of ordinary shares registered in their names at that time. 
Changes to the entries on the register of members after 
close of business on 24 May 2018, or in the event that this 
meeting is adjourned, in the register of members after 
close of business on the day two days before the date of 
the adjourned meeting shall be disregarded in determining 
the rights of any person to attend or vote at the meeting. 76 GYG plc

Corporate representatives 
3  A shareholder of the Company which is a corporation may 
authorise a person or persons to act as its representative(s) 
at the annual general meeting. In accordance with the 
provisions of the Act, each such representative may 
exercise (on behalf of the corporation) the same powers 
as the corporation could exercise if it were an individual 
shareholder of the Company, though there are restrictions 
on more than one such representative exercising powers  
in relation to the same shares.
Nominated persons
4  Any person to whom this Notice is sent as a person 
nominated under section 146 of the Act to enjoy 
information rights (a Nominated Person) may, under an 
agreement between him/her and the member by whom 
he/she was nominated, have a right to be appointed  
(or to have someone else appointed) as a proxy for the 
annual general meeting. If a Nominated Person has no 
such proxy appointment right or does not wish to exercise 
it, he/she may, under any such agreement, have a right

Issued share capital and total voting rights
6  As at close of business on 13 April 2018, being the last 
practicable day prior to the publication of this Notice, the 
Company’s issued share capital comprised 46,640,000 
ordinary shares of £0.002 each. Each ordinary share 
carries the right to one vote at a general meeting of the 
Company and, therefore, the total number of voting rights 
in the Company as at the date of this Notice is 46,640,000.
Members’ requests under section 527 of the Act
7  Under section 527 of the Act members meeting the 
threshold requirements set out in that section have the 
right to require the Company to publish a statement on a 
website setting out any matter relating to: (i) the audit of 
the Company’s Accounts (including the Auditor’s Report 
and the conduct of the audit) that are to be laid before 
the annual general meeting; or (ii) any circumstance 
connected with an auditor of the Company ceasing to hold 
office since the last annual general meeting. The Company 
may not require the members requesting any such website 
publication to pay its expenses in complying with sections 
527 or 528 of the Act. Where the Company is required 
to place a statement on a website under section 527 of 
the Act, it must forward the statement to the Company’s 
Auditor not later than the time when it makes the statement 
available on the website. The business which may be dealt 
with at the annual general meeting includes any statement 
that the Company has been required under section 527  
of the Act to publish on a website.
Members’ rights to ask questions
8  Any member attending the annual general meeting has 
the right to ask questions. The Company must cause to 
be answered any such question relating to the business 
being dealt with at the annual general meeting but no 
such answer need be given if: (a) to do so would interfere 
unduly with the preparation for the annual general meeting 
or involve the disclosure of confidential information;  
(b) the answer has already been given on a website in the 
form of an answer to a question; or (c) it is undesirable 
in the interests of the Company or the good order of the 
annual general meeting that the question be answered.
Inspection of documents
9  Copies of the Executive Directors’ service contracts 
and the letters of appointment of the Non-Executive 
Directors will be available for inspection at the office of the

the annual general meeting, and at the place of the annual 
general meeting from 15 minutes before the annual general 
meeting until it ends.

10  Security measures will be in place to ensure your safety at 
the annual general meeting. Please do not bring suitcases, 
large bags or rucksacks. If you do, we may ask you to leave 
the item in the cloakroom. Recording equipment, cameras 
and other items that might interfere with the good order 
of the meeting will not be permitted. Mobile phones must 
be turned off or on silent during the meeting. Please also
