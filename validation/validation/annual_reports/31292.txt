Our key focus areas
Original game content  
& IP development
We build original content from our own 
London, Victoria and Brest based studios 
incorporating social meta games and real 
money mechanics with well-known brands.
Data and algorithmic 
optimisation
‘It’s all about the data’ - from advanced 
algorithms to individual landing pages 
designed to give the player an optimised 
experience.
Responsible  
gambling
Gaming Realms is committed to providing 
an environment for customers to play 
responsibly and securely. Since commencing 
operations we have had measures in place 
to encourage responsible play – to keep it 
fun – and have provided tools to help keep 
customers’ gaming and spending within  
their control. 
Gaming Realms has worked closely with 
other operators to help develop and shape 
a responsible approach to customers across 
the industry. Internally, we regularly conduct 
training for all our employees to raise 
awareness of problem gambling. 
Our marketing and advertising strategies 
comply with the Committee of Advertising 
Practice (CAP), the Broadcast Committee of 
Advertising Practice (BCAP) and the Industry 
Group for Responsible Gambling (IGRG) 
advertising codes. Gaming Realms has also 
implemented new policies in response to the 
published guidelines from the UK Gambling 
Commission and the Competition and 
Markets Authority to ensure our terms are 
clear and fair.
In addition, we fund research, education 
and treatment of problem gambling through 
donations to GambleAware.
In 2017 we made several improvements to 
our processes to improve risk profiling and 
alerts for customers who may exhibit signs 
of problem gambling. We also established 
a dedicated team to focus on identifying 
concerns around problem gambling, source 
of funds and affordability.
All our customers have access to tools to help 
manage their gameplay, including:
 » Session reminders – alerting customers when 
they’ve been playing for a set period
 » Deposit Limits – customers can set daily, 
weekly or monthly deposit limits
 » Cool down – customers may configure a 
period of time in days or weeks during which 
play on any of our sites will be stopped
 » Self-exclusion – customers may exclude 
themselves permanently from all our sites
Advanced mobile  
gaming platform
We have invested significantly in our  
mobile based gambling and social  
platforms powered by algorithmic  
CRM and personalised content. Our real 
money gaming business is operated  
from Guernsey and fully licensed by  
the UK Gambling Commission for both 
development and operation.
Strategic partners  
and licensing
Partners include Fremantle, Zynga, IWG,  
Pala Interactive and Scientific Games.  
Not only do we leverage our own IP  
across multiple brands, but we also  
license Slingo into markets adjacent  
to the Group’s core mobile gaming business.

(Soc/RM) Page title
 am pleased to report that the 
Group delivered a positive Adjusted 
EBITDA of £0.8m for 2017 (2016: 
£2m loss). This was achieved in part through 
significant cost reductions primarily in Social 
Publishing, and our rationalisation in overall 
marketing.
The Group’s strategy of disposing of non-core 
assets, and concentrating on delivering 
operating profit in its two main business 
units, has resulted in the Group ending 2017 
in a much stronger position than the previous 
year. Following this strategy, we sold our  
non-core affiliate business for £2.4m in 
March 2018.
We were able to grow Real Money Gaming 
revenue by 5% to £22.7m during the year 
(2016: £21.5m). This was achieved through 
operational improvements including player 
management, where bonus costs reduced  
to circa 26% of Gross Gaming Revenue  
(2016: 29%), and despite a 17% reduction  
in marketing costs. 
The UK Real Money Gaming market has 
been challenging, with a great deal of new 
regulation to contend with as well as adverse 
changes in Point of Consumption tax. It 
would therefore be remiss of me not to 
emphasise the adverse effect that increased 
Government regulation has had on our UK 
Real Money Gaming business. Implementing 
changes to comply with the various laws 
incurs one off costs where it involves changes 
to our platforms and software, and recurring 
daily costs where it affects the operation of 
the sites. This has put pressure on margins 
throughout the last two years. On 17 May 
2018, the Government announced that it 
proposes to reduce the permitted maximum 
allowed stake on Fixed Odds Terminals in 
betting shops to £2 from the current £100. 
Due to the resulting loss of tax revenue, 
the Government also announced that 
Remote Gaming Duty will be raised at the 
next Budget in November 2018 in order to 
balance the budget. This makes it likely that 
there will be a further rise in the rate of Point 
of Consumption tax.
The Group’s strategy of disposing of non-core assets, and 
concentrating on delivering operating profit in its two  
main business units, has resulted in the Group ending  
2017 in a much stronger position than the previous year. 
Michael Buckley
Chairman
Chairman’s Statement
Delivering growth
I
We had a significant year in Social Publishing, 
with a reorganisation of the business and a 
substantial reduction in costs of circa £3m on 
an annualised basis. This was accompanied by 
a reduction of 45% in marketing expenditure 
which resulted in a reduction of 13%  
in revenues to £6.9m (2016: £7.9m),  
whilst reducing losses by 97% to £0.1m  
(2016: £1.8m). 
We continued to execute synergies and 
leverage Slingo across our business. For 
example we took Slingo Originals games 
produced in our studio in London for real 
money, and offered these through our 
Slingo Arcade mobile app. These synergies 
helped take our Social Publishing business to 
profitability in H2 2017. Given these positive 
results, we have refocused our social growth 
exclusively through development of the 
Slingo Arcade app on which we will publish 
Slingo Originals content.
With the increase in our library of proprietary 
games, we are developing high margin 
revenue opportunities in game content 
licensing. We launched into the New 
Jersey, USA market in H2 2017, going live 
with Caesers Interactive, Resorts Digital 
Gaming and Rush Street Interactive. Our 
game licensing in New Jersey has grown 
in Q1 2018, with the addition of Golden 
Nugget and Pala Interactive. In March 2018, 
GGR from our games accounted for over 
3% of the total New Jersey online casino 
market. Currently we have 9 games live 
in that market, with a pipeline of content 
to be produced for Real Money Gaming to 
distribute with existing and new partners 
during the current year.

Sale of non-core  
affiliate business
In December 2017, the Group entered into a 
10-year framework services agreement with 
the Jackpotjoy Group, under which we will 
supply various real money gaming services 
including the licensing of Slingo Originals 
content. The Company also signed a separate 
agreement to build Jackpothappy as a white 
label site on the Gaming Realms proprietary 
platform.
As part of the arrangements between the 
two companies, the Jackpotjoy Group 
entered into a £3.5m secured convertible 
loan agreement with the Company full  
details of which are given later in this  
Report and Accounts.
In summary, the Group has delivered an 
annual positive Adjusted EBITDA for the 
first time, significantly reduced run rate 
costs, has achieved a break-even position 
in Social Publishing, and is licensing games 
into New Jersey and Europe via its RGS. This 
is in addition to having a growing profitable 
UK based Real Money Gaming operation 
all leveraging our Slingo Originals games. 
Through focus on these tightly integrated 
core activities, we are now in a position to 
drive further profitable growth in the future. 
Outlook for 2018
The Board has approved the 2018 operating 
plan which is to increase top line growth 
in UK real money gaming from our Grizzly 
operating platform and continue the 
development and licensing of mobile focused 
gambling games. 
We plan to expand our presence in Europe 
and extend the recent licensing deals with 
888 and Gala Bingo with deals involving 
other large operators. Benefits flowing from 
these activities should be supplemented 
by the benefits we hope to achieve from 
the 2017 investment in development and 
integration synergies within our social 
publishing business.
Capitalising on our success in New Jersey, 
we will licence Slingo Originals to more 
operators as well as licence our content in 
other States approving real money online 
gaming such as Pennsylvania. We will also 
pursue opportunities in Columbia and one or 
more provinces in Canada. On 14 May 2018, 
the US Supreme Court announced a decision 
to reverse a ban on sports betting within the 
USA. Whilst the expansion of sports betting 
on a state by state basis will no doubt be a 
slower process than many operators would 
like, the introduction of legalised betting 
into many states is likely to be a precursor 
to other forms of regulated online gaming. 
In the longer term, it seems likely that this 
decision will enable the Company to expand 
further into the US market, and is a cause for 
some additional optimism for the future.
Based on the Company’s performance to 
date in 2018, the board believes that the 
results for the year ending 31 December 
2018 should be in line with management’s 
current expectations.

Chief Executive’s Review
n 2017, the Group continued its 
strategy to focus on developing its 
unique proprietary content, ‘Slingo 
Originals’, and achieve a positive 
Adjusted EBITDA result.
Real Money Gaming delivered revenue 
growth in the very competitive UK market, 
despite the headwinds of increased 
regulation and Point of Consumption tax. We 
continued to develop and distribute market 
leading mobile content onto our Grizzly 
platform as well as to third party operators. 
We also streamlined our Social Publishing 
business, reducing losses to break even and 
creating further synergies with our games 
studio in London.
The investment in both our proprietary 
platform and mobile content development 
has led to the continued growth in a younger, 
more casual player set. Mobile play has 
increased to 84.0% (2016: 80.0%) of gross 
gaming revenue. 
Growth in 2017 has been supported by key 
media deals with ITV, including Love Island 
and Dancing On Ice, as well as continuing 
relationships with Fremantle for the X Factor 
and Britain’s Got Talent, which have allowed 
us to offer a more targeted gambling offering 
to our key demographic. 
Real Money Gaming delivered revenue growth in the very

Chief Executive Officer
A focused strategy
I
Overview
We have augmented this by the in-house 
creation of 11 new unique ‘Slingo Original’ 
mobile games bringing us to 19 in total, 
which account for over £123m (2016: £86m) 
in wagering on the platform or 27% of the 
gross gaming revenue for the year. 
Gambling player deposits increased to 
£49.8m (2016: £49.0m). We have also 
managed to reduce bonus costs to 26% 
(2016: 29%) of gross gaming revenue. The 
cost per acquisition on the platform was £74 
(2016: £86), and we gained 108,720 (2016: 
116,349) new depositing players in the year. 
Our revenue per depositing player increased 
7% to £162 (2016: £153). 
Demand for our unique content has led to 
the development of a Remote Game Server 
(‘RGS’) which allows our ‘Slingo Original’ 
games to be licensed to third party operators 
as premium content. 2017 saw the launch of 
Slingo Orignals in New Jersey and in Europe. 
This will form a key part of our strategy in 
2018 as we look to expand the reach of our 
content into new international territories. In 
2018 we have achieved growth to 3% of the 
online casino market in New Jersey as well as 
sign deals with several ‘tier one operators’ in 
Europe. We are aiming to be live with 10 ‘tier 
one operators’ by the end of the year. This 
will build high margin, recurring revenue in 
adjacent markets.
We have further integrated the social 
business in H2 2017 with the creation of a 
shared development path which now allows 
us to deliver content simultaneously to both 
real money gaming and social audiences. The 
first offering in this regard is Slingo Arcade 
which, following launch in late Q4/16 has 
become our highest grossing social app with 
very encouraging metrics. In future, emphasis 
will be on using this channel to monetize 
content developed for real money gaming 
similar to licensing our content to third party 
operators. This has resulted in a reduction 
in Social Publishing headcount from 53 in 
June 2016 to 19 in December 2017. With the 
reduction in costs and marketing, we have 
seen revenues fall 13% however this delivered 
a reduced full year EBITDA loss of £0.1m 
(2016: £1.8m). 
Key goals for 2018
 » Continued profitability in Real Money 
Gaming and Social Publishing; following 
2017 cost reductions and operational 
improvements
 » Continue strategic investment in Slingo 
Originals content library for overall revenue 
growth but with greater emphasis on 
content licensing
 » Increase B2B partners on Grizzly platform
 » Increase new licensees for Slingo Original 
content
 » Further expansion of strategic media 
partnerships across all revenue streams

4 June 2018 Market overview
We are continuing to focus on the younger 
more casual gambling demographic. We 
are targeting them through mobile delivery 
and original game IP. This is enabling us to 
acquire and engage players away from the 
more crowded, male orientated sportsbook 
market. The 25 to 34 year-old group are our 
largest segment accounting for over 40% of 
all players. As a result of our content strategy, 
women are delivering higher lifetime values 
on the platform despite the fact that the 
active players, male to female ratio is 50:50.

Overview
Gaming Realms has delivered a maiden full year Adjusted 
EBITDA of £0.8m (2016: loss £2.0m). This was driven by 
revenue growth in RMG (5%) and significant cost savings 
across both RMG and Social Publishing.
Mark Segal
Chief Financial Officer
Financial review
A strong performance
Y
ear-on-year revenue declined 7% to 
£31.6m (2016: £34.0m) due to the 
prior year disposal of the white label 
operations and agency business, 
which generated £1.9m of the £3.7m 
Affiliate marketing revenue in 2016. Like for 
like revenue (excluding the disposed assets) 
was down by 1%.
Marketing for the year, was £10.4m  
(2016: £14.8m) as the Group has focused on 
more cost-efficient marketing strategies.
Loss after tax from continuing operations 
reduced by £0.7m to £6.0m. Total loss after 
tax increased to £8.2m due to impairment of 
£3.1m in respect of the discontinued Affiliate 
marketing segment.
Real money gaming
Real money gaming on the Grizzly platform 
has grown 5% to £22.7m (2016: £21.5m). 
This reflects the continuing investment into 
development and targeted marketing. 
Operating expenses include point of 
consumption tax, third party royalties and 
transaction costs. Operating costs have 
increased 15% to £8.9m (2016: £7.5m) 
because of the increase in revenue and 
size of the operation. Changes in point 
of consumption tax basis resulted in 
costs increasing to 38% (2016: 35%) as a 
proportion of revenue. 
Adjusted EBITDA improved by 113% to £2.7m 
(2016: 1.3m) with cost savings of £1.7m 
achieved in marketing.
Affiliates
Affiliate marketing generated revenues of 
£1.3m (2016: £1.8m). 2016 also included 
£1.9m of revenue attributable to the 
disposed white label and agency business. 
The Affiliate business was reclassified as held 
for sale as at 31 December 2017 with £3.1m 
of impairment recognised. The Group has 
sold the affiliate marketing business in Q1 
2018 for £2.4m.  9 Financial Statements Strategic Report Corporate Governance 9 Financial Statements Strategic Report Corporate Governance

Social publishing 
We achieved profit for Social Publishing 
in H2 2017, delivering a reduced full year 
loss of £0.1m (2016: loss £1.8m) as a 
result of reducing marketing by 45% and 
administrative expenses by 28%. Despite the 
reduction in marketing investment, Social 
Publishing revenue decreased by only 13% to 
£6.9m (2016: £7.9m).
During the year, Gaming Realms closed its 
Seattle operations resulting in restructuring 
costs in year of £0.9m, which will provide 
annual synergies of over £3m going forward.
Licensing 
Licensing revenue increased 7% to £0.8m 
(2016: £0.8m) despite having less brand 
licensing in year. We launched in New Jersey 
and Europe during 2017 from where we will 
see contributions in 2018 and beyond.
Cashflow, Balance Sheet  
and Going Concern
Net cash decreased by £1.3m in 2017  
(2016: increased by £0.1m) due to continued 
investment in development of £3.2m. The 
prior year cash position was improved by the 
sale of the white label business for £1.2m and 
share issues totalling £4m.
Net assets totalled £16.2m (2016: £24.3m). The 
reduction year-on-year is as a result of annual 
amortisation of Intangible assets of £4.9m 
and Impairment of the Affiliate CGU of £3.1m
Following the restructure of Social Publishing, 
the 2018 sale of the Affiliates CGU, and the 
global high margin opportunities in game 
content licensing the Directors believe the 
Group is in a strong position and expects to be 
cash generative for 2018. 
As a result the Directors consider that the 
Group has adequate resources to continue its 
normal course of operations for the  
foreseeable future. 
Dividend
During the year, Gaming Realms did not pay 
an interim or final dividend. The Board of 
Directors are not proposing a final dividend 
for the current year.
Corporation and  
deferred taxation
The Group received £389,354 (2016: 
£27,961) in research and development 
credits in the year and has recognised 
an unwind of deferred tax of £223,617 
(2016: £248,941) which arose on business 
combinations.

Principal risks and uncertainties
Risk type Level Description of risk How this risk is managed
Regulatory  
and legislation
Online gambling and gaming is subject to a dynamic  
and complex regulatory regime. 
The Group now holds licences from the Alderney 
Gambling Control Commission, the UK Gambling 
Commission and a transactional waiver for New Jersey 
Division for Gaming Enforcement whilst it seeks a full  
New Jersey licence.
It is key to the Group to maintain compliance with all 
licences and any new ones that are required. These 
are critical to the continuing operation of the Group’s 
gambling activities and also the production and supply  
of its unique content into both its operations and other  
third parties.
The Group has a compliance team to ensure 
that all regulatory guidelines are met in 
its gambling operations. The Group also 
maintains close legal counsel to advise on 
any changes to the regulatory framework, 
as well as updates on territories currently 
outside the Group’s activities.
Taxation risk From the end of 2014, the Group has been subject to 
point of consumption tax in relation to its gambling 
activities within the UK. Any changes to the tax rate or 
the point at which it is incurred may adversely affect  
duty payable.
The Group continues to take advice and 
keep up to date with changes in the 
gambling tax regime.
Residency The Group has legal entities in several jurisdictions, 
including US, Canada and Alderney. Its real money 
gaming operations are based in Alderney where there is  
a zero rate for corporation tax and is outside the scope  
of VAT. If there was a change to the rate of corporate tax 
or VAT in Alderney, it would have an adverse effect on the 
amount of tax payable within the Group.
The Group has undertaken a detailed 
transfer pricing exercise to ensure that 
revenue and profits are attributed correctly 
between the operating locations and 
continues to monitor taxation policies in  
all jurisdictions.
Competition The online and free to play gaming markets are highly 
competitive in North America and the UK. Failure to be 
able to hold a competitive advantage would result in 
attracting less players and have lower engagement on 
our apps and sites. 
In following the Group’s strategy of 
developing new unique IP and content, 
the Group feels well placed to be able to 
compete in the markets it operates in. It 
invests significant resource to be able to 
improve its development and operations.
Diverse products and geographies also 
helps to diversify the risk.
Brexit On 23 June 2016 the UK voted to leave the EU. This may 
reduce the Group’s ability to operate on an unfettered 
basis in certain EU markets.
The Group, along with other EU based online gaming 
operators, have previously relied on the ability to 
challenge such protectionist measures through the EU 
Court of Justice (‘CJEU’). In the event that the UK was to 
leave the EU, unless the Group was to re-domicile certain 
of its subsidiaries within the EU, it would no longer be 
able to rely on such protection. Such a re-domiciliation 
could give rise to higher taxes payable.
The Group will continue to closely monitor 
the situation and respond as the timing and 
terms of the UK’s exit from the EU  
become clearer.
High risk Medium risk Low risk
The Board constantly monitors and assesses risks and uncertainties within the Group’s 
trading activities. There will always be a level of risk that needs to be evaluated against  
the Group’s potential returns in any activity. 11 Financial Statements Strategic Report Corporate Governance
Risk type Level Description of risk How this risk is managed
Time to market The Group invests highly in technology and bringing 
new products and games to market. A delay in time to 
market will result in a loss of competitive advantage, 
a loss in potential revenue and also increasing cost of 
development.
The Group has invested highly in having a 
dual product track to allow its products and 
games to be ready for both licensing and 
publishing exploitation in the same release.
Extensive work is undergone on the 
planning stage to ensure that time frames 
can be met and products go live at the 
highest standard.
Dependence on 
technology
As a provider of online gambling services, the Group’s 
business is reliant on technology and advanced 
information systems. If the Group does not invest in the 
maintenance and further development of its technology 
systems, there is a risk that these systems may not cope 
with the needs of the business and may fail. The Group is 
reliant on the Internet and is vulnerable to activities such 
as distributed denial of service attacks, other forms of 
cyber-crime and a wide range of malicious viruses.
The Group continues to invest in its 
proprietary platform to ensure the 
necessary features and functionality meet 
partner needs. In addition, it has adopted 
industry standard protections to detect 
intrusions or other security breaches and 
implements preventative measures to 
protect against sabotage, hackers, viruses 
and other cyber-crime.
The group also holds relevant insurance to 
cover against this.
Dependence  
on third-party 
service  
providers
The Group engages with a number of providers of non-
proprietary third-party games and payment processing 
services, as well as other important service providers. In 
the event that there is any interruption to the products or 
services provided by third parties, problems in supplying 
the products, one or more ceased to be provided or 
are provided on onerous terms to the Group, this may 
have an adverse effect on the Group’s business and 
performance.
The Group uses reliable industry suppliers 
and ensures that contractual agreements 
with key partners offer adequate 
protection.
The team The ability to carry out the Groups strategy is dependent 
on the engagement of its senior management team, its 
technology, marketing and operations teams. The group 
operates with a small team across 3 main locations.
If key employees leave, there is a risk of loss of 
knowledge.
The Group continues to invest in its 
employees to ensure that it can attract, 
recruit and maintain a high-quality team.

Chief Executive Officer
4 June 2018 15 Financial Statements Strategic Report Corporate Governance
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report 
and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law 
and regulations. 
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements 
for each financial year. Under that law the Directors have elected 
to prepare the Group financial statements in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRSs’) as adopted by the 
European Union and the company financial statements in accordance 
with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United 
Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law. Under company 
law the Directors must not approve the financial statements unless 
they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of 
affairs of the Group and Company and of the profit or loss of the 
Group for that period. The Directors are also required to prepare 
financial statements in accordance with the rules of the London 
Stock Exchange for companies trading securities on the Alternative 
Investment Market (‘AIM’).
In preparing these financial statements, the Directors are required to:
 » select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently; 
 » make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable  
and prudent; 
 » state whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as 
adopted by the European Union, subject to any material departures 
disclosed and explained in the financial statements; and 
 » prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless 
it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will continue 
in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure that the 
financial statements comply with the requirements of the Companies 
Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the 
Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention 
and detection of fraud and other irregularities. 
Website publication
The Directors are responsible for ensuring the Annual Report 
and the financial statements are made available on a website. 
Financial statements are published on the Company’s website in 
accordance with legislation in the UK governing the preparation 
and dissemination of financial statements, which may vary from 
legislation in other jurisdictions. The maintenance and integrity of 
the Company’s website is the responsibility of the Directors. The 
Directors’ responsibility also extends to the ongoing integrity of the 
financial statements contained therein.
Statement of Directors’ responsibilities Gaming Realms plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 16
Corporate Governance
Corporate Governance
Although companies traded on AIM are not required to provide 
corporate governance disclosure, or follow guidelines in the UK 
Corporate Governance Code (the ‘Code’) issued by the Financial 
Reporting Council (‘FRC’), the Directors recognise the value and 
importance of high standards of corporate governance. 
Given the Company’s size and the constitution of the Board, the 
following is a brief summary of the main aspects of corporate 
governance currently in place. 
The Board has established an Audit Committee and a Remuneration 
Committee with formally delegated responsibilities. 
The Remuneration Committee is chaired by Mark Wilson. Its 
other members are currently Michael Buckley and Jim Ryan. This 
committee reviews the performance of the Executive Directors 
and makes recommendations to the Board on matters relating to 
their remuneration and terms of employment. The Remuneration 
Committee also makes recommendations to the Board on proposals 
for the granting of share options and other equity incentives. 
The Board sets the remuneration and terms and conditions of 
appointment of the Non-Executive Directors. 
The Audit Committee is chaired by Jim Ryan. Its other members are 
Atul Bali and Michael Buckley. The Committee determines the terms 
of engagement of the Company’s auditors and, in consultation with 
them, the scope of the audit. It receives and reviews reports from 
management and the Company’s auditors relating to the interim and 
annual financial statements and the accounting and internal control 
systems in use by the Group. The Audit Committee has unrestricted 
access to the Company’s auditors. Under its terms of reference, the 
Audit Committee monitors, amongst other matters, the integrity of 
the Group’s financial statements. The Committee is responsible for 
monitoring the effectiveness of the external audit process and making 
recommendations to the Board in relation to the re-appointment of 
the external auditors. It is responsible for ensuring that an appropriate 
business relationship is maintained between the Group and the 
external auditors, including reviewing non-audit services and fees. 
The Committee meets with Executive Directors and management as 
well as meeting privately with the external auditors. 
There is not a separate Nominations Committee and the Board as a 
whole considers recommendations for appointments to the Board. 
The Directors follow the guidance set out by Rule 21 of AIM Rules 
relating to dealings by Directors in the Company’s securities 
and, to this end, the Company has adopted an appropriate share 
dealing code. 
Going concern 
Under company law, the Company’s Directors are required to consider 
whether it is appropriate to prepare financial statements on the basis 
that the Group and Company are a going concern. As part of the 
normal business practice the Group prepares annual and three-year 
plans and, in reviewing this information, the Company’s Directors are 
satisfied that the Group and the Company have reasonable resources 
and future cash flows to enable them to continue in business for 
the foreseeable future. For this reason, the Company and Group 
continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial 
statements. 17 Financial Statements Strategic Report Corporate Governance
Independent Auditors’ report
to the Members of Gaming Realms plc
Opinion
We have audited the financial statements of Gaming Realms plc (the 
‘parent company’) and its subsidiaries (the ‘group’) for the year ended 
31 December 2017 which comprise the Consolidated Statement of 
Comprehensive Income, the Consolidated and Company Statement 
of Financial Position, the Consolidated and Company Statement of 
Changes in Equity, the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows and 
notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant 
accounting policies. 
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the 
preparation of the financial statements is applicable law and 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by 
the European Union and, as regards the parent company financial 
statements, as applied in accordance with the provisions of the 
Companies Act 2006.
In our opinion:
 » the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the 
group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as at 31 December 2017 
and of the group’s loss for the year then ended;
 » the group financial statements have been properly prepared in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union;
 » the parent company financial statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union 
and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies 
Act 2006; and
 » the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the 
requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards 
on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our responsibilities 
under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s 
responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our 
report. We are independent of the group and the parent company 
in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our 
audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical 
Standard as applied to listed entities, and we have fulfilled our other 
ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We 
believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and 
appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Conclusions relating to going concern
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in 
relation to which the ISAs (UK) require us to report to you where:
 » the Directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in the 
preparation of the financial statements is not appropriate; or
 » the Directors have not disclosed in the financial statements any 
identified material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt about 
the group’s or the parent company’s ability to continue to adopt 
the going concern basis of accounting for a period of at least twelve 
months from the date when the financial statements are authorised 
for issue.
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional 
judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial 
statements of the current period and include the most significant 
assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) 
we identified, including those which had the greatest effect on: the 
overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit; and 
directing the efforts of the engagement team. 
These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the 
financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, 
and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
Revenue recognition (with reference to Note 9)
Key audit matter
The group has a number of revenue streams. The details of the 
accounting policies applied during the period are given in Note 1 to 
the financial statements. 
For its B2C revenue streams, the group is reliant on IT systems which 
record all gaming transactions including deposits, withdrawals, wins 
and losses and their ability to process data accurately is critical.
Management make certain judgements around revenue recognition 
and the treatment of contractual arrangements for revenue streams 
entered into. There is a potential risk that revenue is recorded 
incorrectly from a timing perspective or that it is inappropriately 
recognised on a gross versus net basis. 
Our response
We assessed the design and implementation of the controls over the 
group’s revenue cycles. 
We assessed whether the revenue recognition policies adopted by the 
group comply with IFRS and Industry standards.
We tested revenue through substantive procedures. This included 
agreement to underlying source data, and the use of IT audit data 
analytic techniques to underpin our substantive testing of certain 
revenue streams. 
We reviewed a sample of key contracts entered into during the year 
to assess whether the revenue had been recognised in accordance 
with the group’s accounting policy, to assess the critical estimates 
and judgements, and whether any other terms within the contract 
had any material accounting or disclosure implications.
Impairment of capitalised development costs and 
other intangibles (with reference to Note 13)
Key audit matter
In accordance with IAS 36, the group monitors the carrying value of 
goodwill and other intangible assets for indications of impairment. 
Recoverable amount is the higher of value in use and fair value 
less cost to sell. If the carrying value of these assets exceeds their 
recoverable amount there is a risk of material misstatement. The 
group performs annual impairment reviews for each CGU. 
The Group has made losses in the current and preceding year, the 
Group also continues to evolve and adapt its operations. 
Impairment reviews require significant judgement from management 
and are based on assumptions in respect of future profitability and 
the allocation of assets and liabilities between CGUs. This risk is 
considered significant due to the level of judgement involved and 
the opportunity for management bias within the impairment model 
assumptions. Gaming Realms plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 18
Independent Auditors’ report
to the Members of Gaming Realms plc continued
Our response
Where recoverable amount was based on value in use, the audit team 
challenged the appropriateness of the key assumptions used in the 
discounted cash flow models prepared by management and applied 
sensitivities to assess the potential for impairment of goodwill and 
those assets where indications of impairment were present. Our work 
was based on our assessment of the historical accuracy of the group’s 
estimates in previous periods, our understanding of the commercial 
prospects of the assets, discussions with managements surrounding 
the future plans for the operation, identification and analysis of 
changes in assumptions from prior periods and an assessment of the 
consistency of assumptions across the impairment reviews.
Where recoverable amount was based on fair value less cost to sell, 
the audit team obtained supporting evidence for the identified fair 
value and considered the sensitivity and judgement applied to the 
amounts identified. 
We considered the appropriateness of the related disclosures 
provided in the group financial statements, including disclosure of the 
significant judgements and estimates, and the sensitivity disclosures 
made by management.
Capitalisation of development costs and other 
intangibles (with reference to Note 13)
Key audit matter
The group has material expenditure on internal development 
of intangible software assets. Such expenditure should only be 
capitalised when it qualifies under the specified criteria of IAS 38 
and as such this is an area of judgement. For internally generated 
intangible assets, capitalised cost should meet the following criteria:
 » Technical feasibility
 » Intention to complete and use/sell
 » Ability to use/sell
 » Probable future economic benefits
 » Technical, financial and other resources to complete
 » Accurately identify and measure expenditure
Upon completion of development, the costs are amortised to the 
consolidated income statement over the estimated economic 
life. There are a number of judgements involved in accounting for 
development expenditure, including whether the activities are 
appropriate for capitalisation in accordance with the criteria of the 
standard, the allocation of the development costs to a particular 
product and the estimated useful economic life of each product. 
The risk also encompasses the possibility that the development 
activities may supersede costs previously capitalised. Due to the 
level of judgement, there is considered to be an inherent risk of 
management override.
Our response
We assessed the design and implementation of the controls over the 
group’s capitalisation cycles. 
We assessed whether the capitalisation policies adopted by the group 
comply with IFRS and Industry standards.
The audit team tested a sample of costs capitalised in the year to 
ensure they met the criteria of IAS 38, including agreement of the 
costs to source documentation. 
Our application of materiality
We apply the concept of materiality both in planning and performing 
our audit, and in evaluating the effect of misstatements. For 
planning, we consider materiality to be the magnitude by which 
misstatements, including omissions, could influence the economic 
decisions of reasonable users that are taken on the basis of the 
financial statements. In order to reduce to an appropriately low level 
the probability that any misstatements exceed materiality, we use 
a lower materiality level, performance materiality, to determine the 
extent of testing needed. Importantly, misstatements below these 
levels will not necessarily be evaluated as immaterial as we also take 
account of the nature of identified misstatements, and the particular 
circumstances of their occurrence, when evaluating their effect on 
the financial statements as a whole.
Level of materiality applied and rationale
We consider Net Revenue to be the most appropriate performance 
measure for the basis of materiality in respect of the audit of the 
group. Using this benchmark, we set materiality at £316k (2016: 
£330k) being 1% (2016: 1%) of Revenue. 
Materiality in respect of the audit of the Parent Company has been 
set at £300k (2016: £313k) using a benchmark of 2% of total assets, 
limited to 95% of group materiality (2016: 2% total assets, limited 
to 95% of group materiality). We consider total assets to be the 
most appropriate measure for the basis of materiality as the Parent 
Company is a holding company.
Performance materiality was set at 75% (2016: 75%) of materiality 
for both the group and parent company audits. In setting the level of 
performance materiality we considered a number of factors including 
the expected total value of known and likely misstatements (based 
on past experience and other factors) and management’s attitude 
towards proposed adjustments.
Component materiality
We set materiality for each component of the group, other than 
the parent company, at 10-75% of materiality to account for the 
aggregation risk. 
Agreement with the Audit Committee
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the 
Committee all audit differences individually in excess of £16k (2016: 
£16k). We also agreed to report differences below this threshold that, 
in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.
An overview of the scope of our audit
Our group audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of the 
group and its environment, including the group’s system of internal 
control, and assessing the risks of material misstatement in the 
financial statements at the group level. 
In determining the scope of our audit we considered the level of work 
to be performed at each component in order to ensure sufficient 
assurance was gained to allow us to express an opinion on the 
financial statements of the group as a whole. 
The group consists of 8 components all of which were subject to a full 
audit by the group audit team.
We tailored the extent of the work to be performed on each 
component, which was performed by the group audit team, based 
on our assessment of the risk of material misstatement at each 
component.  19 Financial Statements Strategic Report Corporate Governance
We obtained an understanding of the entity-level controls of the 
group as a whole which assisted us in identifying and assessing risks of 
material misstatement due to fraud or error, as well as assisting us in 
determining the most appropriate audit strategy.
Other information
The Directors are responsible for the other information. The other 
information comprises the information included in the annual report, 
other than the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon. 
Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other 
information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated 
in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion 
thereon.
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our 
responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, 
consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent 
with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit 
or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such 
material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we 
are required to determine whether there is a material misstatement 
in the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other 
information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude 
that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are 
required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.
Opinions on other matters prescribed by the 
Companies Act 2006
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course  
of the audit:
 » the information given in the strategic report and the Directors’ report 
for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared 
is consistent with the financial statements; and
 » the strategic report and the Directors’ report have been prepared in 
accordance with applicable legal requirements.
Matters on which we are required to report  
by exception
In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the group and the 
parent company and its environment obtained in the course of the 
audit, we have not identified material misstatements in the strategic 
report or the Directors’ report.
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in 
relation to which the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to 
you if, in our opinion:
 » adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent 
company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received 
from branches not visited by us; or
 » the parent company financial statements are not in agreement with 
the accounting records and returns; or
 » certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are not 
made; or 
 » we have not received all the information and explanations we require 
for our audit.
Responsibilities of Directors
As explained more fully in the Directors’ responsibilities statement set 
out on page 15, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of 
the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true 
and fair view, and for such internal control as the Directors determine 
is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are 
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the Directors are responsible for 
assessing the group’s and the parent company’s ability to continue as 
a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going 
concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the 
Directors either intend to liquidate the group or the parent company 
or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit  
of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the 
financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report 
that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level 
of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in 
accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement 
when it exists.
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered 
material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be 
expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the 
basis of these financial statements
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the 
financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting Council’s 
website at: www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description 
forms part of our auditor’s report.
Use of our report
This report is made solely to the parent company’s members, as a 
body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 
2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state 
to the parent company’s members those matters we are required 
to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To 
the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume 
responsibility to anyone other than the parent company and the 
parent company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this 
report, or for the opinions we have formed.

1. Accounting policies
General information
Gaming Realms Plc (the ‘Company’) and its subsidiaries (together the ‘Group’).
The Company is admitted to trading on AIM of the London Stock Exchange. It is incorporated and domiciled in the UK. The address of its 
registered office is One Valentine Place, London, SE1 8QH.
Basis of preparation
The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are set out below. 
The consolidated financial statements are presented in sterling.
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, International Accounting 
Standards and Interpretations (collectively IFRSs) as adopted by the EU. 
The preparation of financial statements in compliance with adopted IFRSs requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also 
requires Group management to exercise judgement in applying the Group’s accounting policies. The areas where significant estimates and 
judgments have been made in preparing the financial statements and their effect are disclosed in Note 2.
Basis of consolidation 
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the assets and liabilities of all subsidiaries of the Company as at 31 December 2017 and the 
results of all subsidiaries for the year then ended. 
Where the Company has control over an entity, it is classified as a subsidiary. The Company controls an entity if all three of the following 
elements are present: power over the entity, exposure to variable returns from the entity, and the ability of the investor to use its power to 
affect those variable returns. Control is reassessed whenever facts and circumstances indicate that there may be a change in any of these 
elements of control.
Intercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between entities in the Group are eliminated. Unrealised losses are 
also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of the impairment of the asset transferred. Accounting policies of subsidiaries have 
been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the results of business combinations using the acquisition method. In the statement 
of financial position, the acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities are initially recognised at their fair values at the 
acquisition date. The results of acquired operations are included in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income from the date on 
which control is obtained. They are deconsolidated from the date on which control ceases.
Going concern
The Directors consider that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason, 
they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
Revenue
Revenue comprises net gaming revenue derived from real money gaming, licensing, advertising and social publishing.
Net gaming revenue derived from real money gaming
Net gaming revenue derives from online gambling operations and is defined as the difference between the amounts of bets placed by the 
players less amounts won by players. It is stated after deduction of certain bonuses, jackpots and prizes granted to players.
Net gaming revenue is recognised to the extent that its probable economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be reliably 
measured. Revenue is recognised in the accounting periods in which the player activity is concluded.
Affiliate revenue
Revenue is derived from marketing services provided in relation to online bingo and casino products. The commission revenue is calculated 
either as a percentage of net gaming revenue from the operators or in line with contracts (typically based on fixed price per player). 
Commission revenue is recognised to the extent that the probably economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be reliably 
measured. Revenue is recognised in the accounting periods in which the marketing services are provided.
Advertising revenue
Advertising revenue derives from contractual relationships with agencies, advertising brokers and certain advertisers for advertisements within 
our social games. Advertising revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue 
can be reliably measured. Revenue is recognised in the accounting periods in which the advertising is provided.
Social publishing revenue
Social publishing revenue derives from the purchase of credits and awards on the social gaming sites. Social publishing revenue is recognised to 
the extent that it is probable economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be reliably measured. Revenue is recognised in the 
accounting periods in which the user credit has been purchased.
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
for the year ended 31 December 2017 25 Financial Statements Strategic Report Corporate Governance
Licensing revenue
Licensing revenue derives from contractual relationships for the use of intellectual property. Revenue is recognised where substantially all risk 
and rewards have been transferred and there are no further monetary or financial obligations to be fulfilled by the licensor. However, where 
there is ongoing obligations to the Group, license fees are recognised over the estimated period of the license to the licensee.
Administrative expenses
Administrative expenses include staff costs, share-based payments, professional, consulting and legal fees and other costs.
Adjusted EBITDA
EBITDA is a non-GAAP company specific measure defined as loss before tax adjusted for finance income and expense, depreciation and 
amortisation. 
Adjusted EBITDA excludes non-recurring material items which are outside the normal scope of the Group’s ordinary activities. Adjusted EBITDA 
is considered to be a key performance measure by the Directors as it serves as an indicator of financial performance. The adjusting items are 
separately disclosed in order to enhance the reader’s understanding of the Group’s profitability and cash flow generation. Adjusting items 
include EBITDA from discontinued operations, costs arising from a fundamental restructuring of the Group’s operations, acquisition costs, and 
revaluation of balances denominated in non-presentational currency. Management have observed the FRC’s guidance published in November 
2017 regarding the treatment of share-based payments and have now included this charge in Adjusted EBITDA.
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of a business combination over the total acquisition date fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities 
and contingent liabilities acquired. 
Cost comprises the fair value of assets given, liabilities assumed and equity instruments issued, plus the amount of any non-controlling interests 
in the acquiree plus, if the business combination is achieved in stages, the fair value of the existing equity interest in the acquiree. Contingent 
consideration is included in cost at its acquisition date fair value and in the case of contingent consideration classified as a financial liability, 
remeasured subsequently through profit or loss. 
Goodwill is capitalised as an intangible asset with any impairment in carrying value being charged to the consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income. Where the fair value of identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities exceed the fair value of consideration 
paid, the excess is credited in full to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income on the acquisition date.
Impairment of non-financial assets
Impairment tests on goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful economic lives are undertaken annually. Other non-financial 
assets are subject to impairment tests whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be 
recoverable. Where the carrying value of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount (ie the higher of value in use and fair value less costs to sell), 
the asset is written down accordingly.
Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the impairment test is carried out on the smallest group 
of assets to which it belongs for which there are separately identifiable cash flows; its cash generating units (‘CGUs’). Goodwill is allocated on 
initial recognition to each of the Group’s CGUs that are expected to benefit from a business combination that gives rise to the goodwill.
Impairment charges are included in the income statement, except to the extent they reverse gains previously recognised in other 
comprehensive income. An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed.
Discontinued operations
The results of operations disposed of or classified as held for sale during the year are included in the consolidated statement of comprehensive 
income up to the date of disposal. A discontinued operation is a component of the Group’s business that represents a separate major line of 
business or geographical area of operations or is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale, that has been disposed of, has been 
abandoned or that meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale. 
Discontinued operations are presented in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income as a single line which comprises the post-tax 
profit or loss of the discontinued operation along with the post-tax gain or loss recognised on the re-measurement to fair value less costs to sell 
or on disposal of the assets or disposal groups constituting discontinued operations.
Foreign currency
Transactions entered into by Group entities in a currency other than the currency of the primary economic environment in which they operate 
(their ‘functional currency’) are recorded at the rates ruling when the transactions occur. Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are 
translated at the rates ruling at the reporting date. Exchange differences arising on the retranslation of unsettled monetary assets and liabilities 
are recognised immediately in the statement of comprehensive income. Foreign exchange differences arising from financing transactions are 
recognised in finance income/loss, differences arising from trading balances are recognised in administration costs.
On consolidation, the results of overseas operations are translated into sterling at rates approximating to those ruling when the transactions 
took place. All assets and liabilities of overseas operations, including goodwill arising on the acquisition of those operations, are translated 
at the rate ruling at the reporting date. Exchange differences arising on translating the opening net assets at opening rate and the results of 
overseas operations at actual rate are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the foreign exchange reserve. Gaming Realms plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 26
1. Accounting policies (continued)
Exchange differences recognised as profit or loss in Group entities’ separate financial statements on the translation of long-term monetary 
items forming part of the Parent company’s net investment in the overseas operation concerned are reclassified to other comprehensive 
income and accumulated in the foreign exchange reserve on consolidation.
On disposal of a foreign operation, the cumulative exchange differences recognised in the foreign exchange reserve relating to that operation 
up to the date of disposal are transferred to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income as part of the profit or loss on disposal.
Financial assets
The Group classifies its financial assets depending on the purpose for which the asset was acquired. The Group has not classified any of its 
financial assets as held to maturity.
The Group’s accounting policies for financial assets are as follows:
Loans and receivables
These assets are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. They arise 
principally through the provision of goods and services to customers (e.g. trade receivables), but also incorporate other types of contractual 
monetary asset. They are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs that are directly attributable to their acquisition or issue, and 
are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, less provision for impairment. 
Impairment provisions are recognised when there is objective evidence (such as significant financial difficulties on the part of the counterparty 
or default or significant delay in payment) that the Group will be unable to collect all of the amounts due under the terms receivable, the 
amount of such a provision being the difference between the net carrying amount and the present value of the future expected cash 
flows associated with the impaired receivable. For trade receivables, which are reported net, such provisions are recorded in a separate 
allowance account with the loss being recognised within administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. 
On confirmation that the trade receivable will not be collectable, the gross carrying value of the asset is written off against the associated 
provision.
The Group’s loans and receivables comprise trade and other receivables and cash and cash equivalents in the consolidated statement of 
financial position. 
Available-for-sale investments
Non-derivative financial assets not included in the above categories are classified as available-for-sale and comprise principally the Group’s 
strategic investments in entities not qualifying as subsidiaries, associates or jointly controlled entities. They are carried at fair value with 
changes in fair value, other than those arising due to exchange rate fluctuations and interest calculated using the effective interest rate, 
recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the available-for-sale reserve. Exchange differences on investments 
denominated in a foreign currency and interest calculated using the effective interest rate method are recognised in profit and loss. 
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, other short-term highly liquid investments with original 
maturities of three months or less and – for the purpose of the statement of cash flows - bank overdrafts. Bank overdrafts are shown within 
trade and other payables in current liabilities on the consolidated statement of financial position.
Assets held for sale
Non-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale if the carrying amount will be recovered through a sale transaction rather 
than through continuing use. This condition is regarded as being met only when the sale is highly probable, management is committed to a sale 
plan, the asset is available for immediate sale in its present condition and the sale is expected to be completed within one year from the date of 
classification. These assets are measured at the lower of carrying value and fair value less associated costs of sale except where the assets were 
previously classified as available for sale, in which case they are carried at fair value. Following their classification as held for sale, non-current 
assets (including those in a disposal group) are not depreciated.
Financial liabilities
Financial liabilities held by the Group consist of deferred consideration, customer funds, trade payables, long-term borrowings and other short-
term monetary liabilities, which are held at amortised cost, and derivative liabilities which are held at fair value through profit and loss.
The Group’s accounting policies for financial liabilities are as follows:
Amortised cost
Financial liabilities measured at amortised cost are initially recognised at fair value net of any transaction costs directly attributable to the issue 
of the instrument and subsequently recognised at amortised cost. 
Deferred consideration arising from business combinations is recognised at present value and unwound over the period until settlement.
Derivative liabilities
Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the contract date and are subsequently measured at their fair value at 
each balance sheet date with movements recognised in the statement of comprehensive income. 
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
for the year ended 31 December 2017 continued 27 Financial Statements Strategic Report Corporate Governance
Embedded derivatives are separated and fair-valued through the statement of comprehensive income when they are not closely related to their 
host contracts and meet the definition of a derivative, or where the host contract is not carried at fair value.
Share capital
Financial instruments issued by the Group are classified as equity only to the extent that they do not meet the definition of a financial liability or 
financial asset.
The Group’s ordinary shares are classified as equity instruments.
Non-controlling interests
Non-controlling interest is initially recognised at the present ownership instruments’ proportionate share in the recognised amounts of the 
acquiree’s identifiable net assets. The total comprehensive income of non-wholly owned subsidiaries is attributed to owners of the parent and 
to the non-controlling interests in proportion to their relative ownership interests.
Share-based payments
Where equity-settled share options are awarded to employees, the fair value of the options at the date of grant is charged to the consolidated 
statement of comprehensive income over the vesting period. Non-market vesting conditions are taken into account by adjusting the number 
of equity instruments expected to vest at each reporting date so that, ultimately, the cumulative amount recognised over the vesting period is 
based on the number of options that eventually vest. Non-vesting conditions and market vesting conditions are factored into the fair value of 
the options granted. As long as all other vesting conditions are satisfied, a charge is made irrespective of whether the market vesting conditions 
are satisfied. The cumulative expense is not adjusted for failure to achieve a market vesting condition or where a non-vesting condition is  
not satisfied.
Where equity instruments are granted to persons other than employees, the consolidated statement of comprehensive income is charged with 
the fair value of goods and services received.
The fair value of share options issued without market-based vesting conditions is measured by the application of the Black-Scholes option 
pricing model by reference to the grant date of the options. The fair value of share options issued with market-based vesting conditions is 
measured by use of the Monte Carlo method.
Externally acquired intangible assets
Externally acquired intangible assets are initially recognised at cost and subsequently amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful 
economic lives. 
Intangible assets are recognised on business combinations if they are separable from the acquired entity or arise from other contractual/
legal rights. The amounts ascribed to such intangibles are arrived at by using appropriate valuation techniques (see section related to critical 
estimates and judgements below).
Internally generated intangible assets (development costs)
Expenditure on internally developed products is capitalised if it can be demonstrated that:
 » it is technically feasible to develop the product for it to be sold;
 » adequate resources are available to complete the development;
 » there is an intention to complete and sell the product;
 » the Group is able to sell the product;
 » sale of the product will generate future economic benefits; and
 » expenditure on the project can be measured reliably.
Capitalised development costs are amortised over the periods the Group expects to benefit from selling the products developed. 
Development expenditure not satisfying the above criteria and expenditure on the research phase of internal projects are recognised in the 
consolidated statement of comprehensive income as incurred.
The significant intangibles recognised by the Group, their useful economic lives and the methods used to determine the cost of intangibles 
acquired in a business combination are as follows:
Intangible asset Useful economic life
Customer databases 1-2 years
Development costs 3 years
Intellectual property 8 years
Domain names 2-3 years
Software 3 years
Research and development tax
Research and development taxation relief is recognised once management considers it probable that any amount claimable will be received. Gaming Realms plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 28
1. Accounting policies (continued)
Deferred taxation
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised where the carrying amount of an asset or liability in the consolidated statement of financial 
position differs from its tax base, except for differences arising on:
 » The initial recognition of goodwill
 » The initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction which is not a business combination and at the time of the transaction affects 
neither accounting nor taxable profit
 » Investments in subsidiaries and jointly controlled entities where the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the difference and it is 
probable that the difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Recognition of deferred tax assets is restricted to those instances where it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the 
difference can be utilised. 
The amount of the asset or liability is determined using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date and are 
expected to apply when the deferred tax liabilities/(assets) are settled/(recovered). 
Property, plant and equipment
Items of property, plant and equipment are initially recognised at cost. As well as the purchase price, cost includes directly attributable costs 
and the estimated present value of any future unavoidable costs of dismantling and removing items. The corresponding liability is recognised 
within provisions.
Depreciation is provided on all property, plant and equipment at rates calculated to write off the cost less estimated residual value, of each 
asset evenly over its expected useful life as follows:
Office, furniture and equipment 20% per annum straight-line
Computer equipment 33% per annum straight-line
Leasehold improvements Over the life of the lease
Player liabilities
Liabilities to players comprise the amounts that are credited to customers’ accounts including provision for bonuses granted by the Group. 
These amounts are repayable in accordance with the applicable terms and conditions. 
Standards and interpretations
There are no new standards, interpretations or amendments which became effective in the period which have had a material effect on the 
Group’s financial information.
Based on management’s review to date, IFRS 9 is not expected to have any financial impact on the financial statements other than the 
classification of investments currently classified as available for sale investments. Management do not consider that the adoption of the 
expected credit loss impairment model will have a material impact on reported results.
When considering IFRS 16, the Group operates from leased offices in 4 countries. Total lease commitments at the reporting date are £1.4m and 
total rent costs expensed in the income statement in 2017 is £0.3m. Management are undertaking a review to calculate the initial recognition 
of right of use assets and the related liabilities. 
Management have considered the impact of IFRS 15 on the business by product (see Note 9). Management consider the recognition basis 
will remain unchanged for RMG, Affiliate and Social publishing revenues, which generate the majority of the Groups revenues. Management 
continue to review revenue recognition under IFRS 15 for the licencing revenues, where terms differ by contract, but do not anticipate a 
material impact on the financial statements.
2. Critical accounting estimates and judgements
The Group makes certain estimates and assumptions regarding the future. Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated based on 
historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. In 
the future, actual experience may differ from these estimates and assumptions. The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of 
causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below.
Estimates
(a) Impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets
Goodwill and other intangible assets are reviewed for impairment and their values are written-down on the basis of the Group’s expectations 
of future economic benefits expected to be received. Any process which attempts to estimate future outcomes to determine the recoverable 
amount is subject to uncertainty. The recoverable amount is determined based on the lower of value in use calculations, which require the 
estimate of future cash flows and the choice of discount rate to calculate the present value of the cash flows, and fair value less costs to sell. 
Calculations are based on management’s forecasts for the period, and past experience of the same or similar assets. Where it is believed that 
the estimation uncertainty can give rise to material differences in asset carrying values, this will be stated in the relevant notes to the financial 
statements. See Note 13.
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
for the year ended 31 December 2017 continued 29 Financial Statements Strategic Report Corporate Governance
(b) Amortisation of development costs
Capitalised development costs are subject to amortisation over the estimated useful life and reviewed for impairment whenever events or 
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The estimated useful life of these assets is based on 
management’s estimates of the period over which the assets are expected to generate revenue and are periodically reviewed to confirm they 
are still appropriate.
(c) Carrying value of loan and derivative liabilities 
Loans and derivative liabilities are measured at fair value which is dependent on future outcomes and market rates. Any process which attempts 
to estimate future outcomes is subject to uncertainty. See Note 21 for more detail.
Judgements
(a) Revenue recognition
Social publishing revenue is recognised as the service is delivered. This is considered to be when the player buys credits to play the game on 
the basis that there is no further service to be delivered. In addition, revenue generated from in app advertisements is recognised when the 
advertisement is displayed or offer has been completed by the customer and confirmed by third-party reports.
(b) Capitalisation of development costs
The identification of development costs that meet the criteria for capitalisation is dependent on management’s judgement and knowledge of 
the work done. Development costs of gaming software platforms are separately identified. Key judgements relate to the separately identified 
projects, the expected future benefits and the useful economic life and are based on the information available at each period end. Economic 
success of any development is assessed on a reasonable basis but remains uncertain at the time of recognition. 
(c) Deferred tax
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised for temporary differences and for tax loss carry-forwards. The assessment of temporary 
differences and tax loss carry-forwards is based on management’s estimates of future taxable profits against which the temporary differences 
and loss carry-forwards may be utilised.
The Group has not recognised a deferred tax asset in respect of their losses as there is no track record of taxable profits at this time.  
Deferred tax assets will be recognised when the Group has established a track record of expected future taxable profit.

Disposal of third-party platform driven website properties
On 4 March 2016, the Group disposed of its third-party platform driven website properties, for a total consideration of £2.4m. Black Spark 
Media Limited paid the Group an upfront cash payment of £1.2m with the remaining £1.2m payable by Silverspin Media Limited, settled by way 
of waiving the final earn out payment to the previous shareholders of Blueburra Holding Limited. Chris Phillips and Scott Logan, shareholders of 
Silverspin Media, and who were Directors of the Company’s subsidiaries Blueburra Holdings Limited and Digital Blue Limited at the time of the 
disposal, are therefore classified as related parties. The above waiving of £1.2m contingent consideration in exchange for the disposal of assets 
constitutes a major non-cash transaction in the year. An additional £500,000 was receivable under a transitional services agreement over a 
5-month period with Black Spark Media Limited. The value of net assets disposed totalled £2.4m resulting in a loss on disposal of £19,452. Gaming Realms plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 30
4. Adjusted EBITDA (continued)
Disposal of digital marketing agency
On 6 June 2016, the Group entered into a strategic partnership with digital marketing company Ayima Limited. Under the terms of the 
partnership, the Group has agreed to contribute assets comprising its external digital marketing agency to Ayima Limited. As consideration 
for the disposal of the Assets, the Group were issued shares to 10% of the enlarged issued share capital of Ayima Limited. The 10% shares were 
valued at approximately £540,000, based on a valuation performed by an external advisor. This is a level 3 valuation as defined by IFRS 13. 
The investment is now held as an available for sale investment (see Note 14). The value of net assets disposed of totalled £0.2m resulting in 
profit on disposal of £338,286.
Discontinued
The Affiliate marketing CGU has been reclassified as held for sale as management were actively seeking a sale of this business as at 
31 December 2017. The sale concluded in March 2018 (see Note 30).

 On the 1 August 2013 the Company granted options to B Shares under the Gaming Realms 2013 EMI plan. The B Share value will be 20 pence less than the 
prevailing price of the ordinary shares and will therefore have no value unless the value of the new ordinary shares exceeds 20 pence. EMI options can only be 
granted to employees who meet the statutory working time requirement, and cannot normally be exercised before 15 July 2015. All options granted under 
the New Share Option Scheme on Admission will be exercisable over B Shares at their nominal value of £0.01 and will be capable of exercise, subject to certain 
exceptions, after two years of the date of grant.

The Group has four reportable segments. The social publishing segment provides freemium games to the US and Europe. Licensing segment 
includes IP brand and content licensing to partners in the US and Europe. The real money gaming division operates our brands direct to the end 
user. In 2016 the Group disposed of its white label and agency business which formed part of the RMG segment. It has been separated in the 
revenue by product table below for information. The Affiliate marketing segment provides digital marketing and referrals for group and third-
party brands and has been classed as held for sale during the year (see Note 19).

Changes in tax rates and factors affecting the future tax charge
At Summer Budget 2015, the government announced legislation setting the Corporation Tax rate at 19% for the years starting 1 April 2017, 
2018 and 2019 and at 18% for the year starting 1 April 2020. At Budget 2016, the government announced a further reduction to the 
Corporation Tax rate for the year starting 1 April 2020, setting the rate at 17%. Accordingly, deferred tax balances as at 31 December 2017 
have been recognised at 17% (2016: 20%).
There are unused tax losses carried forward as at the balance sheet date of £32.0m (2016: £24.8m) equating to an unrecognised deferred 
tax asset of £6.1m (2016: £5.0m). No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of these losses, as the recoverability of any asset is 
dependent upon sufficient profits being achieved in future years to utilise this asset. The timings of such profits are uncertain.

12. Loss per share
Basic loss per share is calculated by dividing the loss attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of shares in issue 
during the year. For fully diluted loss per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of 
dilutive potential ordinary shares. The Group’s potentially dilutive securities consist of share options, performance shares and a convertible 
bond. As the Group is loss-making, none of the potentially dilutive securities (see Note 26) are currently dilutive.

Goodwill
In accordance with IAS 36, the Group regularly monitors the carrying value of its intangible assets for impairment. A detailed impairment test 
was undertaken at 31 December 2017 to assess whether the carrying value of assets was supported by its recoverable amount. The Group has 
4 CGUs (2016: 3) for which the carrying amount of goodwill is allocated. During the year the Group split its RMG and Affiliate marketing CGUs in 
preparation for sale. The Affiliate marketing CGU has subsequently been transferred to HFS (see Note 19).
The recoverable amount is the higher of the CGU’s fair value less costs of disposal, and value in use. The recoverable amount of the Affiliate 
marketing CGU was assessed based on fair value less costs to sell. This resulted in an impairment of £3.1m which has been treated as 
discontinued. See Note 19 for further information, cause of impairment and basis for fair value. 
All other CGUs are based on value in use. Value in use is calculated as the net present value of future cash flows derived from those assets and  
is based on several assumptions which feed into a forecast model based on past player lifetime values and experience.
Cash flow projections have been prepared for a five-year period following which a long-term growth rate of 5% (2016: 2%) has been assumed. 
A discount rate of 16-20% (2016: 25%) has been used in discounting the projected cash flows and is based on the Group’s specific risk adjusted 
Weighted Average Cost of Capital. 
The discount rates used have been considered based on the risks involved in each of the underlying business units and terminal growth rates 
and reflect the expected growth in underlying EBITDA expected from these units. These CGUs have been considered for impairment and 
sensitivities have been calculated around the terminal growth rates and discount factors used together with specific scenarios including the 
loss of revenue where those revenues might be considered to be at risk. No indicators of impairment have arisen as a result as the impact of all 
sensitivities were judged to be within tolerable levels.
The key assumptions of the forecasts were as follows:
 » number of new player depositing registrations;
 » rate of retention of existing players;
 » spending patterns of players; and
 » CPA or installs from different acquisition sources.
The above assumptions are based on the trends noted to date, industry standard measurements and management’s experience. 
The carrying amount of goodwill is allocated to the CGUs as follows:

The Group has restricted cash of £18,702 (2016: £18,802) relating to funds held in Swiss subsidiaries which are currently in liquidation. 
The funds are restricted and are not included in the consolidated statement of cash flows.
19. Assets and liabilities classfified as held for sale
During H2 2017 the Board concluded to pursue the sale of the affiliate marketing business. Advisors were appointed and offers invited, which 
were actively being discussed during late 2017. The group has therefore reclassified this business as held for sale as at 31 December 2017. 
As a result, an impairment of £3.1m has been recognised based on the recoverable amount of goodwill attributable to this segment. 
Recoverable amount has been calculated as fair value less the costs of disposal. Fair value is measured at £2.4m based on active offers received 
during late 2017. The impairment has been included in discontinued operations as below.
In March 2018 the Group sold its Affiliate business, for total consideration of £2.4 million to First Leads Ltd. First Leads has paid £2.0m on 
closing, and a further £0.4m will be payable on 31 December 2018, based on the achievement of performance targets.

£1m, however this has been renewed during 2018 with an increased facility of £2m, available for two years which will be reduced in certain 
circumstances.
21. Arrangement with Jackpotjoy Group
In December 2017 the group entered into a £3.5m secured convertible loan agreement with Jackpotjoy plc and group companies (together 
‘Jackpotjoy Group’) alongside a 10-year framework services agreement for the supply of various real money services.
Under the framework services agreement the first £3.5m of services are provided free-of-charge within the first 5 years. This will be recognised 
as revenue as it is utilised.
The convertible loan has a duration of 5 years and carries interest at 3-month LIBOR plus 5.5%. It is secured over the Group’s Slingo assets 
and business. At any time after the first year, Jackpotjoy Group may elect to convert all or part of the principal amount into ordinary shares 
of Gaming Realms Plc at a discount of 20% to the share price prevailing at the time of conversion. To the extent that the price per share at 
conversion is lower than 10p (nominal value), then the shares can be converted at nominal value and the difference paid in cash. Under this 
arrangement, the maximum dilution to Gaming Realms shareholders will be approximately 12%, assuming the convertible loan is converted 
in full.
The number of shares is variable. The option therefore violates the fixed-for-fixed criteria for equity classification and as a result is classified as a 
liability. The fair value of the conversion feature is determined at each reporting date with changes recognised in profit or loss. The fair value as 
at 31 December 2017 was £0.6m based on a probability assessment of conversion and future share price. This is a level 2 valuation as defined 
by IFRS 13.
The remaining £2.9m of proceeds plus an estimate for free-of-charge services is accounted for as an interest-bearing loan. The interest rate 
used to discount the loan was calculated as 30.8%.

21. Arrangement with Jackpotjoy Group (continued)
The proceeds are first allocated to the fair value of the derivative liability. The key assumptions used to estimate the derivative liability are  
as follows:
 » Future share price 
 » Probability assessment of expected conversion
 » Timing and proportion converted to shares by JackpotJoy Group
The proceeds are then allocated between the use of the free services and the interest-bearing loan. The key assumptions used to estimate this 
split are:
 » Timing and amount of usage of the free services
 » Future 3-month LIBOR rates
Key sensitivities in the calculation of the above values include:
 » For every £0.5m reduction in the estimate of free services, there will be an equal reduction in the interest expense over the term
 » Each 1% increase in 3-month LIBOR would result in an additional £35k interest payable per annum, or £140k in total assuming no capital is 
repaid or converted to shares
 » If the share price does not exceed 12p there will be no value in the conversion element meaning the carrying value of the loan will increase by 
£0.6m and interest expense will decrease by £0.6m
22. Financial instruments and risk management – Group
The Group is exposed through its operations to risks that arise from use of its financial instruments. The Group’s financial assets and liabilities are 
shown on the face of the consolidated statement of financial position and in the table below and they can be classified wholly as either loans 
and receivables, other assets or other liabilities.

Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of 
the instrument.
The Group classifies its financial instruments in the following categories:
 » Available for sale;
 » Loans and receivables at amortised cost;
 » Other financial liabilities at amortised cost; and
 » Financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss.
The classification depends on the purpose for which the financial assets and liabilities were acquired. Management determines the classification 
of its financial instruments at initial recognition or in certain circumstances on modification.
Financial assets of the Group classified as loans and receivables or available for sale. Financial liabilities are held at amortised cost or fair value. 
In the Directors’ opinion, there is no material difference between the book value and the fair value of any of the financial instruments.
The Group has some exposure to credit risk and liquidity risk. There has been no material change to the financial instruments used within the 
business during the year except for contingent consideration and therefore no material changes to the risk management policies put in place by 
the Board which are now discussed below.
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
for the year ended 31 December 2017 continued 41 Financial Statements Strategic Report Corporate Governance
The Board has overall responsibility for the determination of the Group’s risk management objectives and policies. Whilst acknowledging this 
responsibility, it has delegated the authority and day to day responsibility for designing and operating systems and controls which meet these 
risk management objectives to the finance and administration function. The Board regularly reviews the effectiveness of these processes in 
meeting its objectives and considers any necessary changes in response to changes within the business or the environment in which it operates.
Currency risk
The Group is exposed to currency risk on translation and on sales and purchases that are denominated in a currency other than Pounds Sterling 
(GBP). The currency in which these transactions are primarily denominated is US Dollars (USD).
The Group’s policy is, where possible to allow group entities to settle liabilities denominated in their functional currency with the cash 
generated from their own operations in that currency. Where group entities have liabilities denominated in a currency other than their 
functional currency cash already denominated in that currency will, where possible, be transferred from elsewhere in the Group.
As of 31 December 2017 the Group’s net exposure to foreign exchange risk was as follows:

Other 37,837 (3,881) – – – –
581,834 (2,710,683) – – – 41,322
The effect of a 20% strengthening of the US Dollar against Sterling at the reporting date on the US Dollar denominated receivables carried 
at that date would, all other variables held constant, have resulted in a decrease in losses and an increase in net assets of £116,367 (2016: 
increase in losses and decrease of net assets of £542,137). A 20% weakening in the exchange rate would, on same basis increase loss after tax 
and decrease net assets by £116,367. (2016: decrease loss after tax and increase net assets by £542,137).
Liquidity risk
The Group’s policy is to ensure that it will always have sufficient cash to allow it to meet its liabilities when they become due. Customer funds 
are kept in dedicated client accounts, separately from the Group’s operational bank accounts.

22. Financial instruments and risk management – Group (continued)
Financial liabilities measured at fair value
The fair value hierarchy of financial liabilities measured at fair value is provided. 
The fair value of derivative liabilities totalling £0.6m was based on a probability assessment of conversion and future share price. This is a level 2 
valuation as defined by IFRS 13.
The fair value measurement hierarchy is based on the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The inputs are categorised into 
three levels, with the highest level (level 1) given to inputs for which there are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets 
or liabilities and the lowest level (level 3) given to unobservable inputs. Level 2 inputs are directly or indirectly observable inputs other than 
quoted prices. 
Capital management
The Group is funded through shareholders’ funds, a £3.5m facility with JackpotJoy Group (Note 21) and a £1m overdraft facility with Barclays 
(Note 20). In the prior year, the primary funding was through shareholders’ funds.
The Group monitors its capital structure, which comprises all components of equity (i.e. share capital, share premium, non-controlling interest 
and retained earnings) and monitors external debt.
The Group is not subject to any externally imposed capital requirements.
Changes in liabilities
The Group has adopted the amendments to IAS 7 for the first time in the current year. The amendments require an entity to provide disclosures 
that enable users of financial statements to evaluate changes in liabilities arising from financing activities, including both cash and non-cash 
changes. The Group’s liabilities arising from financing activities consist of JPJ Arrangement (Note 21), Derivative liability (Note 21) and deferred 
consideration. A reconciliation between the opening and closing balances of these items is provided below. Consistent with the transition 
provisions of the amendments, the Group has not disclosed comparative information for the prior year.

26. Share-based payments 
Gaming Realms 2013 EMI Plan
On 1 August 2013 the Company adopted the Gaming Realms 2013 EMI Plan to allow, at the discretion of the Board, any eligible employee to 
be granted EMI or non-EMI qualified options at an exercise price to be determined by the Board but not to be less than the nominal value of a 
share and will vest subject to such time based and share price performance-based conditions as the Board may determine. 
Options to acquire ordinary shares under the EMI plan may be granted up to a maximum of £3,000,000 (based on the market value of the 
shares placed under option at the date of the grant).
No consideration is payable for the grant to of the option and the options are not transferable or assignable. Cash consideration is paid to the 
Company by the employee at the point that the share options are exercised. 
In 2013, the Company granted options for B Shares under the Gaming Realms 2013 EMI plan. B Share value will be 20 pence less than the 
prevailing price of the ordinary shares and will therefore have no value unless the value of the new ordinary shares exceeds 20 pence. EMI 
options can only be granted to employees who meet the statutory working time requirement and cannot normally be exercised before 15 July 
2015. All options granted under the New Share Option Scheme on Admission will be exercisable over B Shares at their nominal value of £0.01 
and will be capable of exercise, subject to certain exceptions, after two years of the date of grant.
Options are not exercisable later than midnight on the day before the tenth anniversary of the date of grant.
Options were fair valued using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, or where there are market-based performance conditions, a Monte Carlo 
simulation pricing model. Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Company’s competitors in the sector.
The following information is relevant in the determination of the fair value of options granted during the prior year under the equity-settled 
share-based remuneration schemes operated by the Group.

Parent Company Statement of Changes in Equity
for the year ended 31 December 2017 Gaming Realms plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 48
1. Principal accounting policies
These financial statements present the results of Gaming Realms plc for the year ended 31 December 2017.
These financial statements were prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework (FRS 101). 
The financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention. No profit and loss account is presented by the Company as 
permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006. 
The financial statements are prepared in Sterling. 
Basis of preparation
The accounting policies which follow set out those policies which apply in preparing the financial statements for the year ended  
31 December 2017. 
The Company has taken advantage of the following disclosure exemptions under FRS 101: 
a)   IFRS 2 Share-based Payment disclosure, the share-based payment arrangement concerns its own equity instruments and its separate financial 
statements are presented alongside the consolidated financial statements of the Group. 
b)  IFRS 7 Financial Instruments disclosures, given that equivalent disclosures are included in the consolidated financial statements of the Group 
in which the entity is consolidated. 
c)  IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement disclosures. 
d)  Certain disclosures required by IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements, including certain comparative information in respect of share 
capital movements.
e) IAS 7 Statement of Cash Flows and related notes. 
f) IAS 24 Related Party Disclosures relating to key management personnel compensation. 
g)  IAS 24 Disclosure of related party transactions entered into between two or more members of a group, given that any subsidiary which is a 
party to the transaction is wholly owned by such a member. 
Investments
Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less provision for impairment in value, except for investments acquired before 1 October 2013 
where shares issued to effect business combinations and the conditions of the Companies Act 2006 are met, merger relief was applied and the 
resulting investment is recorded at the nominal value of the shares issued.
Available-for-sale investments
Non-derivative financial assets not included in the above categories are classified as available-for-sale and comprise principally the Group’s 
strategic investments in entities not qualifying as subsidiaries, associates or jointly controlled entities. They are carried at fair value with 
changes in fair value, other than those arising due to exchange rate fluctuations and interest calculated using the effective interest rate, 
recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the available-for-sale reserve. Exchange differences on investments 
denominated in a foreign currency and interest calculated using the effective interest rate method are recognised in profit and loss. 
Taxation
Current tax, including UK corporation tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using the tax rates and laws that have 
been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet. 
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date, where 
transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the 
balance sheet date.
A net deferred tax asset is recognised as recoverable and therefore recognised only when, on the basis of all available evidence, it can be 
regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits against which to recover carried forward tax losses and from which 
the future reversal of underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the period in which the timing differences are expected to 
reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Foreign currencies
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are recorded at exchange rates as of the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are reported at the rates of exchange prevailing at that date.
Financial liabilities
Financial liabilities held by the company consist of trade payables, deferred consideration, long-term borrowings and other short-term monetary 
liabilities, which are held at amortised cost, and derivative liabilities which are held at fair value through profit and loss.
