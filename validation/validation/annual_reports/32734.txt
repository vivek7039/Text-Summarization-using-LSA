Annual Report for the year ended 30 April 2017
CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
The Group continues to develop its three operating divisions on its multi-jurisdictional platform. The Group sees considerable 
opportunities to expand delivery of its core offerings through a combination of organic growth and strategic acquisition. 
The recent listing on The International Stock Exchange (“TISE”) represents a considerable step forward for the Group.
Culture
The Group has taken a commercial and enterprising 
approach to its development and it is extremely mindful of 
the importance of compliance and regulation. Effective risk 
management and regulatory compliance are essential in 
today’s climate as regulatory and reporting regimes across 
the world continue to develop.
The Board sees significant opportunity for the Group to take 
advantage of the operational platform it has created over 
the last three years since the merger of Praxis and IFM whilst 
maintaining a considered and risk conscious approach to 
growth.
With a highly qualified and professional staff base, the Board 
considers that the Group is well placed for a business climate 
of increasing regulation, transparency and enhanced 
reporting requirements.
Strategy
The Group continues to develop its professional approach to 
existing business, risk management, client take-on, business 
development and acquisitions.
The Group has integrated several acquisitions over the 
last few years and continues to grow via a combination of 
organic growth and value-accretive acquisitions that help to 
diversify its jurisdictional reach and service offerings.
The senior management team has a pragmatic and 
considered evaluation method for acquisitions that 
continues to deliver significant stakeholder value. The Board 
plays an active role in the process and is of the opinion that 
the direction being taken continues to be effective.
The Group is majority owned by management. This ensures 
alignment of interest with external shareholders. The Board 
actively seeks to widen share ownership amongst employees 
through share option and buy-as-you-earn schemes.
Governance
The Board considers effective governance to be at the heart 
of good business management and has performed a full 
review of the governance regime and mechanisms within 
the Group.
The Group’s approach is set out within this report and 
focusses on ensuring that the process the Group follows to 
make key business decisions allows for careful consideration 
of the impact those decisions have on the wider stakeholder 
group.
The mechanisms and approach taken comply with the 
Finance Sector Code of Corporate Governance issued by 
the Guernsey Financial Service Commission and have been 
developed with UK Corporate Governance Code in mind.
Board Composition
The Board is made up of two non executive directors and 
the Chief Executive Officer. During this period of significant 
growth the Group needs to remain flexible whilst ensuring 
effective governance and considered decision making.
Board members have been carefully selected for their 
experience in similar environments to that in which the 
Group currently operates and to assist with delivery of the 
Group’s growth strategy. Annual Report for the year ended 30 April 2017
 www.praxisifm.com 4
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S STATEMENT
The results set out within this report show continued growth of the business during the year ended 30 April 2017.  
The year has seen the integration of new business into Guernsey, Geneva and Mauritius together with expansion into the 
UK and Middle East.
Group Activity
This year has seen considerable change within the Group 
culminating in raising external capital and listing on The 
International Stock Exchange in April 2017. As anticipated, 
the listing has delivered many benefits for the Group.
We have made considerable progress integrating our 
previous acquisitions whilst maintaining strong organic 
growth.
We have restructured the governance regime and we were 
delighted to appoint two experienced non executives, 
Andrew Haining as Non-Executive Chairman and Iain Stokes 
as Non-Executive director and Chair of the Audit Committee. 
The executive directors who previously sat on the Group 
Board now sit on the Management Committee.
Andrew has a wealth of experience in mergers and 
acquisitions over a 30 year career in banking and private 
equity. Iain was previously Group Managing Director at 
Mourant International Fund Administration (‘MIFA’) where 
he was part of the executive team that managed the sale of 
MIFA to State Street.
Performance
The year ending 30 April 2017 saw Group revenues grow 
to £35.1m. This represents a 26% uplift against 2016. It has 
been achieved through a combination of acquired revenues 
and continued organic growth.
The core business has grown strongly with a compound 
annual growth rate (“CAGR”) of 17% over the last five years 
and 19% during 2017.
Unadjusted EBITDA (£8.3m) grew by 29% during the year as 
our smaller, more recently established businesses matured 
and the integration of acquired business was completed. 
The Group has fully expensed significant amounts of short 
term and one off costs associated with its listing and its 
recent acquisitions. As the Group continues to evolve we 
expect to reap the benefits of this investment.
Our Trust and Corporate Division remains the largest 
segment of our business and it performed well last year with 
revenues rising to £22.3m.
The Funds Division has another strong year with a 28% 
growth in revenue. Our IFM AIFM business grew particularly 
strongly.
The Pensions Division continues to build critical mass 
and despite a very competitive environment, is delivering 
growth for the Group.
Within Ancillary Services, our Treasury and our Asset Finance 
businesses performed very strongly. During the year, we 
made the strategic decision to dispose of our interest in 
United Ventures and this process was completed well before 
the year end.
Staff
Our staff are fundamental to our success. The Group 
employs more than 300 people across 9 jurisdictions. The 
vast majority of colleagues are client facing and spend 
their time dedicated to delivering service excellence to our 
widely varied clients.
We actively encourage our colleagues to undertake 
professional qualification and engage in continuing 
professional development. More than 68% of staff are either 
qualified or studying for a professional qualification. We 
believe this ethos delivers a high level of professionalism 
across the Group that is at the core of our culture and 
business approach.
We want our employees to benefit from their collective 
efforts and the Group’s success. Over 53% of staff members 
have an equity interest in the Group. Since the year end we 
introduced a buy-as-you-earn share scheme to extend this 
further, with 27% of our staff choosing to participate in the 
scheme.
New Business
The revenues of our core businesses grew strongly last year, 
continuing a long term trend of growth.
As the Group grows, we continue to refine our approach 
and the new business pipeline remains good across all three 
Divisions. 5 www.praxisifm.com
Annual Report for the year ended 30 April 2017
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S STATEMENT (continued)
Projects
During the year a new version of the core administration 
platform was installed, with Jersey migrating across from 
their legacy system.
Exposure to cyber threats and the potential impact is 
greater in Financial Services than in other businesses. We 
have invested considerable time and resources in order to 
protect our businesses. Additionally we have invested in 
training and system monitoring to limit the impact caused 
by any potential interruption.
Integration of Acquisitions
During the prior year, the Group acquired 100% of the 
equity in Ampersand Management which had offices in 
Geneva and Mauritius. This acquisition, together with that 
of Balmor Management, has had a very beneficial impact on 
the performance of our Geneva operations and the teams 
are fully integrated into the existing PraxisIFM business.
The Group has successfully integrated the Confiance 
team and clients into our Guernsey Trust operation and 
the combined business is performing above our initial 
expectations at the time of acquisition.
The UK Fund Administration business acquired in 2015 has 
been fully integrated into our Fund Administration Division.
Acquisitions and New Ventures
During this Financial Year the Group made two further 
acquisitions and opened one new operation.
Cavendish Corporate Investments is a Guernsey company 
specialising in the business of writing pensions and annuities 
on human life and bespoke annuities.
Ryland Gray is based in the United Arab Emirates and 
specialises in the administration of End of Service Benefit 
Schemes. 
The Group was delighted to obtain the first license for Trust 
Administration in Abu Dhabi Global Markets. Subsequent to 
the year end the Group also obtained the first license for 
Fund Administration in Abu Dhabi Global Markets.
Summary
We have had a busy 12 months and I would like to take the 
opportunity to thank everyone who has helped the Group 
to date. Annual Report for the year ended 30 April 2017

being fund management, treasury services and asset 
finance.
The Group can trace its roots back over 45 years and since 2015, the Group has consolidated its two offices in Geneva and

Dhabi and disposing of part of its joint venture in United Ventures Limited. The Group has offices in Guernsey, Jersey, Geneva,

STAKEHOLDER RELATIONS

ourselves on providing our clients with dedicated and 
highly experienced professionals who can provide them 
with an efficient, informed and intelligent service.

essential to the Group’s continued success, and the following 
specific initiatives have been undertaken with this in mind;

and provide exposure to all areas of the business.

ownership of the Group and have a vested interest in its 
continued growth.
Continued support for our staff in selecting and attending 
external courses that fit in with personal development 
objectives and ongoing technical requirements.
Regulators
The Group operates within complex regulatory 
environments in each of its jurisdictions. We aim to ensure 
we meet or exceed those regulatory requirements.
We put compliance at the forefront of everything we do 
from client engagement to reporting and it remains a core 
focus in all day-to-day activity and staff training.
We deal with our Regulators in an open manner and have a 
constructive dialogue with them as required.

Our shareholder base provides the capital that underpins 
the Group’s ability to operate, to grow and to deliver long 
term strategic plans.

and timely communication with its shareholders subject to 
statutory and regulatory constraints. Attendance at the AGM 
is encouraged and all questions are welcomed. Shareholders

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT (continued)
Composition of the Board
The Board consists of the Non-Executive Chairman, one 
Non-Executive director and the Chief Executive Officer.
The Board considers independence to be key to effective 
governance and so intends to maintain a majority of 
independent directors.
The Board has considerable combined experience, skills and 
expertise in corporate management with a particular focus 
on growth through acquisition.
The Board works closely with the executive management 
committee to ensure delivery of the Group’s strategic 
objectives.
The intention is to appoint at least one more Non-Executive 
director to the Board during 2017/18.
Responsibilities of the Board
The Board is responsible to the Group’s shareholders and 
sets the strategic direction of the Group.
It is also responsible for the management, governance, 
controls, risk management, performance, reporting and 
direction of the Group.
The Board retains approval of financial reporting, internal 
controls, investments and acquisitions, communication 
with shareholders, significant expenditure and changes to 
the structure and capital of the Group.
Board meetings and information to the Board
The Board meets on a quarterly basis and is provided with 
detailed financial and operational management reports on 
a timely basis in advance of the meetings.
The Board also meets separately at least once a year to 
consider the strategic direction, approve the annual report, 
the interim report and the annual budget.
Support to the Board
The Chairman, with the support of the Company secretary, 
has the responsibility to ensure Board members receive 
timely and accurate information. The Company secretary 
provides the Board members with papers in advance of 
each meeting.
The Company secretary also provides minutes for each 
meeting and ensures effective feedback is communicated 
from the Board to the executive where appropriate.
Board evaluation
The Board will be evaluated on an annual basis to ensure 
that it continues to be able to conduct its activities and 
discharge its responsibilities effectively.
Internal control
The Board has overall responsibility for internal controls 
and the management of risk. The Board has delegated 
responsibility for internal controls to the Audit Committee.
However, internal controls remain a key part of each staff 
member’s core responsibilities.
Risk Management

RISK STATEMENT
Risk Appetite
The Group must take risks in order to achieve its strategic objectives and deliver beneficial outcomes for its stakeholders.  
The Group will take risks in a controlled and considered manner ensuring that risks are kept to a level of impact acceptable by 
the Board. 
The Board has delegated risk management to the Management Committee. The Group operates a multi-layered approach 
to risk management. The Management Committee monitors and manages Group level risk and each business unit has a risk 
committee to manage operational and other risks at the local level.
Whilst commercial risk is the driver of business development, the Group is averse to regulatory risk which carries the 
consequences of significant damage to its reputation and a threat to its ability to carry on its core regulated activities. 
Regulatory compliance and compliance in areas such as Anti Money Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism 
are considered vital to the long term, sustainable growth of the Group.
Key Risks
The Board has identified certain areas of risk that are specific to the business of the Group and are monitored closely by the 
Group Risk Committee.
Service Risk The Group administers client structures in accordance with standard terms of business and 
administration agreements (the “contractual framework”) which define the services to be 
delivered and limit the scope of services the Group is responsible for.
 Errors or breaches may occur resulting in the invocation of PraxisIFM’s contractual protections 
and potentially give rise to a claim against the Group.
 The Group operates robust procedures and processes to ensure services are delivered in 
accordance with the contractual framework.
Key Personnel Risk The Group is dependent upon key senior management personnel who have extensive experience 
and knowledge of the Group, the Group’s markets, product offering, client base, and administered 
structures.
 The Board works with senior management to ensure that there are effective succession plans.  
The Group continuously engages with its network to identify potential future leaders.
 A key part of the acquisitions strategy is to identify key people to help the development of the 
Group and to achieve its strategic objectives.
Litigation Risk The Group takes such precautions as it considers appropriate to avoid or minimise the likelihood 
of any legal proceedings or claims against it, and any resulting financial loss.
 The costs of defending against claims or any settlement of a claim may be covered by professional 
indemnity insurance up to the limit of the Group’s policies.
Fiduciary Risk The Group acts in a fiduciary capacity on many client structures. This may involve acting as trustees 
and/or acting as directors on administered entities where responsibility for decision making is 
assumed. Acting in a fiduciary capacity creates specific legal obligations, a breach of which could 
give rise to a claim against the Group and its employees, and/or regulatory sanction.
 The procedures and processes operated by the Group have been designed to address the 
risks associated with acting in a fiduciary capacity and whenever possible the Group’s terms of 
business seek to cap or otherwise limit liability except in cases of fraud, wilful misconduct or gross 
negligence, or in respect of any other liability which cannot lawfully be excluded. 17 www.praxisifm.com
Annual Report for the year ended 30 April 2017
RISK STATEMENT (continued)
Third Party Service  The Group is reliant upon third party service providers for certain aspects of its businesses (for
Providers Risk example its clients’ banking arrangements and operating software for its core administration 
services).
 Any interruption or deterioration in the performance of these third party service providers or 
software could impair the timing and quality of the Group’s services and profitability.
 The Group operates an internal control process when engaging third party service providers that 
includes a risk assessment covering regulatory, operational and financial aspects.
Regulatory Risk The Group is subject to the laws and regulations of the countries in which it operates. Many of the 
Group’s subsidiaries operate in a regulated environment and are subject to ongoing supervision 
and other regulatory requirements.
 Any breach of any applicable law, regulations, licence conditions or the requirements of the 
relevant regulatory authority could result in the Group, its directors and key personnel being 
fined or being the subject of criminal or other disciplinary proceedings and have material adverse 
consequences for the Group and its business.
 The Group operates strict internal process and procedures to ensure that regulatory and legal 
requirements are understood and adhered to in each of its jurisdictions. In addition the Group 
ensures its employees receive effective training and ongoing support.
Acquisition Risk Acquisitions give rise to inherent execution and integration risk. The process of integration may 
produce unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures and may absorb significant attention 
of the Group’s management that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development of 
the business. 
 In addition, acquisitions also involve a number of other risks including unforeseen liabilities, 
difficulties in realising costs or revenues, loss of key employees and client relationship issues.
 The Group conducts full financial, operational and personnel assessment and due diligence 
processes to minimise uncertainty and the potential for unforeseen issues.
 The Group has a detailed integration plan for new acquisitions to ensure effective on boarding 
and merging of people, operational procedures, training, systems and reporting.
 The Investment Committee oversees the engagement, due diligence and integration processes 
to ensure they are carried out, are effective and provide sufficient reporting to the Board.
Technology Risk The Group operates on technology platforms to deliver client services. The Group’s systems are 
hosted locally in the Channel Islands and in Geneva.
 The Board is aware of and is regularly updated with information regarding cyber security and the 
potential threats posed by poor data management, hackers and criminals.
 The Board has instigated a full review of the Group’s systems and technology roadmap to ensure 
continued data security and enhancements to technological capability. Annual Report for the year ended 30 April 2017

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS REPORT

Statement of Financial Position, the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity, the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows 
and the related notes 1 to 27. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law 
and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice). 
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Section 262 of the Companies (Guernsey) 
Law, 2008. Our audit work is undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required 
to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or 
assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this 
report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of the directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement within the Directors’ Report, the directors are responsible 
for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view.
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements in accordance with applicable law 
and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Financial Reporting 
Council’s Ethical Standards for Auditors. 
Scope of the audit of the financial statements 
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give 
reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. 
This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s circumstances and have been 
consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; 
and the overall presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non financial information in 
the Directors’ Report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and to identify any information 
that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course 
of performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications 
for our report.
Opinion on the financial statements 
In our opinion the financial statements:
• give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 30 April 2017 and of the Group’s profit for the year then 
ended;
• have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and
• have been properly prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies (Guernsey) Law, 2008. 19 www.praxisifm.com

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS REPORT (continued)
Matters on which we are required to report by exception

to you if, in our opinion:
• proper accounting records have not been kept by the parent company; or
• the financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records; or
• we have failed to obtain all the information and explanations, which, to the best of our knowledge and belief, are necessary 
for the purposes of our audit.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. Statutory information
PraxisIFM Group Limited is a company domiciled in Guernsey, Channel Islands, registration number 30367. The registered 
office is Sarnia House, Le Truchot, St Peter Port, Guernsey. The nature of the Company’s operations and its principal activity are 
set out in the directors’ report.
2. Accounting Policies
The following accounting policies have been used consistently in dealing with items considered material to the Group’s affairs. 
These accounting policies have been consistently applied to all years presented unless otherwise stated.
Basis of preparation of financial statements
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with FRS 102, the Financial Reporting Standard applicable in 
the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland, and applicable law. The financial statements have been prepared on the 
historical cost basis except for the modification to fair value for certain financial instruments as specified in the accounting 
policies below.
Consistent with the requirements of Guernsey Company Law, the parent Company has elected not to prepare a Company only 
income statement and statement of financial position.
Going concern
Based on current trading and three year projections, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and the 
Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Therefore, they continue to 
adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the annual financial statements.
Basis of consolidation
The Group’s consolidated financial statements consolidate the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries and 
associated undertakings drawn up to 30 April each year. The results of the subsidiaries and other interests acquired or sold are 
consolidated for the period from or to the date on which control passed.
Turnover
Fee income is recognised as contractual work is performed in relation to those fees, with invoiced amounts being adjusted 
accordingly for any elements of accrued or deferred income.
Certain fees are raised on a one-off basis to cover the lifetime of the relevant entity. Where this occurs the Group assesses the 
expected level of material time involvement in future years and makes an appropriate provision to defer the recognition of 
part of that fee.
Accrued income
Accrued income is recognised to the extent that the Group has obtained a right to consideration through the performance 
of administration related services. A provision is made for non-recoverable costs. Unbilled income is valued using average 
recovery rates appertaining during the year. 27 www.praxisifm.com
Annual Report for the year ended 30 April 2017
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)
Expenses
Expenses are recognised when they are incurred, meaning when the goods are received or the services are provided, with 
invoiced amounts being adjusted accordingly for any elements of accrued or prepaid expense.
Interest income and expense
Interest income and expense is recognised on an accruals basis.
Consolidation, investment in subsidiaries and related companies
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the 
Group. Control is achieved where the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to 
obtain benefits from its activities.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in total comprehensive income from the 
effective date of acquisition and up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate using accounting policies consistent with 
those of the parent. All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated in full on consolidation.
Fiduciary assets
The Group, through its subsidiaries, acts as trustee and in other fiduciary capacities that result in the holding or placing of 
assets on behalf of individuals, trusts, retirement benefit plans and other institutions. These assets/liabilities and income/
expenses arising thereon are excluded from the financial statements, as they are not assets, liabilities, income or expenses of 
the Company or of the Group.
Tangible assets
Tangible fixed assets are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and any provision for impairment.
Depreciation
Depreciation is provided on all tangible fixed assets at rates calculated to write down the cost, less estimated residual value of 
each asset class on the following bases:
Furniture, fixtures and fittings 5 years straight line
Computer equipment 5 years straight line
Leasehold property and improvements Over the life of the lease
Impairment of assets
At each reporting date fixed assets are reviewed to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered 
an impairment loss. If there is an indication of possible impairment, the recoverable amount of any affected asset is estimated 
and compared with its carrying amount. If the estimated recoverable amount is lower, the carrying amount is reduced to its 
estimated recoverable amount, and an impairment loss is recognised immediately in the income statement.
If an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to the revised estimate of its 
recoverable amount, but not in excess of the amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been 
recognised for the asset in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised immediately in the income statement. Annual Report for the year ended 30 April 2017
 www.praxisifm.com 28
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)
Other interests
Investments in unlisted company shares have been classified as fixed asset investments as the Group intends to hold them on 
a continuing basis. The shares are carried at their estimated value which is either based on the market price, if one is available, 
or the cost originally paid less any impairment identified.
Intangible assets
Intangible assets are measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses.
Amortisation
Amortisation is provided on all intangible assets at rates calculated to write down the cost, less estimated residual value of 
each asset class on the following bases:
Business software 10 years straight line
Goodwill Over the estimated useful life
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiary undertakings and businesses, representing any excess of the fair value of 
the consideration given over the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired is capitalised and written off on 
a straight line basis over the useful life. Goodwill is reviewed annually for indications of impairment and if there are any, an 
impairment review is carried out and, if necessary, a provision is made.
Debtors
Short term debtors are measured at transaction price, less any impairment. Loans receivable, where the repayment date is in 
the future, are measured initially at fair value, net of transaction costs, and are measured subsequently at amortised cost using 
the effective interest method, less any impairment. Loans that are repayable on demand are initially recognised at carrying 
value.
Creditors
Short term trade creditors are measured at the transaction price. Other financial liabilities, including bank loans, are measured 
initially at fair value, net of transaction costs, and are measured subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest 
method.
Financial liabilities and equity
Financial liabilities and equity are classified according to the substance of the financial instrument(s)’ contractual obligations, 
rather than the financial instrument(s)’ legal form.
Allowances for bad and doubtful debt
Allowances are made for bad and doubtful debts. Estimates of recoverability are based on ageing of the debts and historical 
experience. 29 www.praxisifm.com
Annual Report for the year ended 30 April 2017
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)
Leases
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of 
ownership of the leased asset to the Group. All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Assets held under finance leases are recognised initially at the fair value of the leased asset (or, if lower, the present value of 
minimum lease payments) at the inception of the lease. The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the statement 
of financial position as a finance lease obligation. Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of 
the lease obligation using the effective interest method so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of 
the liability. Finance charges are deducted in measuring profit or loss. Assets held under finance leases are included in tangible 
fixed assets and depreciated and assessed for impairment losses in the same way as owned assets.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
The aggregate benefit of lease incentives is recognised as a reduction to the expense recognised over the lease term on a 
straight line basis.
Pension costs
The Group operates defined contribution pension schemes. Contributions to the Group’s defined contribution pension 
schemes are charged to the profit and loss in the year in which they become payable.
Taxation
Current tax, including Guernsey Income Tax and foreign tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid or recovered using the 
tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the financial year end.
Foreign exchange
Functional currency and presentation currency
The functional currency of the Group is Sterling (£). For the purpose of the consolidated and individual financial statements of 
the Group, the results and financial position are presented in Sterling (£).
Transactions and balances
In preparing the financial statements of the individual entities, transactions in currencies other than the functional currency 
of the individual entities (foreign currencies) are recognised at the spot rate at the dates of the transactions, or at an average 
rate where this rate approximates the actual rate at the date of the transaction. At the end of each reporting period, monetary 
items denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing at that date. Non-monetary items that are 
measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated. Exchange differences are reclassified to profit 
or loss.
Translation of Group companies
The results of foreign operations are translated at the average rates of exchange during the year and their balance sheets at 
the rates ruling at the financial year end. Exchange differences arising on consolidation are recognised in the capital reserves.
Dividends
Equity dividends are recognised when they become legally payable. Interim equity dividends are recognised when paid.  
Final equity dividends are recognised when approved by the shareholders at an annual general meeting. Annual Report for the year ended 30 April 2017

3. Judgements in applying accounting policies and key sources of estimation uncertainty
In preparing these financial statements, the directors have made the following judgements:
Determine whether leases entered into by the Group either as a lessor or a lessee are operating leases or finance leases. These 
decisions depend on an assessment of whether the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred from the lessor to 
the lessee on a lease by lease basis.
Determine whether there are indicators of impairment of the Group’s tangible and intangible assets. Factors taken into 
consideration in reaching such a decision include the economic viability and expected future financial performance of the 
asset.
Other key sources of estimation uncertainty
Tangible assets
Tangible fixed assets are depreciated over their useful lives taking into account residual values, where appropriate. The actual 
lives of the assets and residual values are assessed annually and may vary depending on a number of factors. In re-assessing 
asset lives, factors such as technological innovation, product life cycles and maintenance programmes are taken into account. 
Residual value assessments consider issues such as future market conditions, the remaining life of the assets and projected 
disposal values.
Goodwill expected useful life
The expected useful life of the goodwill arising on consolidation is estimated based on a variety of factors, such as the expected 
use of the acquired business, the expected useful life of the cash generating units to which the goodwill is attributed, any 
legal, regulatory or contractual provisions that can limit useful life, and assumptions that market participants would consider 
in respect of similar businesses.
Goodwill impairment 
Should any of the factors taken into account in determining the expected useful life of goodwill arising on consolidation 
experience a significant change, an impairment charge will be recognised to the extent that the value and estimated remaining 
useful life of the goodwill are a true reflection of its value to the business, based on the factors above.
Allowance for bad and doubtful debts
The trade debtors balance in the Group’s Consolidated Statement of Financial Position comprises a large number of relatively 
small balances. An allowance is made for the estimated irrecoverable amounts from debtors and this is determined by 
reference to past default experience.
Contingent deferred consideration in respect of the Confiance Limited acquisition
The value of future purchase consideration payable to the vendors is based on management’s estimate of retained turnover 
calculated in accordance with the provisions of the Share Purchase Agreement. 31 www.praxisifm.com

Acquisition of Praxis Fund Holdings Limited minority interest
On 12 April 2017 the Group acquired 53% of Praxis Fund Holdings Limited for £8,609,785.
Previously, Praxis Fund Holdings Limited was consolidated as a subsidiary, due to the voting rights of the existing 47% holding 
leading to control of the entity. As set out in FRS 102.9.19D, the transactions shall be accounted for as a transaction between 
equity holders. Therefore, no goodwill has been recognised on the purchase of the 53% of Praxis Fund Holdings Limited, and

to retained reserves.

26. Disputed insurance claim
In November 2013 Invescap Holdings Limited (“IHL”) filed a counterclaim against Confiance Limited in the sum of £2,183,141 
plus interest in relation to various alleged frauds against IHL by Mr Lee Douglass a former employee and director of IHL. It was 
alleged that Confiance Limited and others were responsible for allowing Mr Douglass to misappropriate the sums claimed.
On 1 October 2015, Confiance Limited was notified by AmTrust Europe Limited, the Insurer of the £4m over £1m Professional 
Indemnity Insurance excess layer, that it was seeking to deny cover in relation to the policy year 2012/2013 on the basis that 
the 2012 Proposal Form contained alleged untrue statements, material non-disclosure of facts and that material facts were 
suppressed and not disclosed. The counterclaim by IHL was notified and covered during Policy Year 2012/2013. Confiance 
Limited has been advised and is acting as a prudent uninsured party in relation to the counterclaim by IHL. The directors were 
advised and believed that the likely cost of the IHL counterclaim would be a maximum of £3,500,000. The Primary and all other 
excess Professional Indemnity Insurance layers continue to be in force.
On 1 June 2016, Confiance Limited together with the Group entered into a Settlement Agreement with IHL and Karim Issa 
Mawji (“KM”) against whom Confiance Limited alleged inter alia contributory negligence, whereby Confiance Limited agreed 
to pay IHL the sum of £3,200,000 and to KM the sum of £120,000 in full and final settlement of the proceedings.
The Group agreed to provide Confiance Limited with sufficient funding to enable full settlement with IHL and KM. The Group 
has notified Confiance Limited that is has deemed the 2,074,158 outstanding Loan Notes cancelled as of 1 June 2016 and 
that it reserves its rights under the SPA in respect of the balance of the disputed insurance claim and pursuant to clause 3.2 of 
the Loan Note instrument no interest is due. Confiance Limited took legal advice and is actively pursuing the reinstatement 
of the indemnity from its professional indemnity insurers in respect of the settlement of the litigations. It was indemnified in 
respect of defence costs by the primary layer insurers, but is currently in dispute with the first excess layer insurer concerning 
the balance of the insurance claim. On 27 March 2017, the company assigned the claim to RRRL Limited. Annual Report for the year ended 30 April 2017

In July 2017, the Group launched a Buy-As-You-Earn (“BAYE”) share purchase scheme (the “Scheme”) for employees. The 
Scheme grants employees an option to purchase shares at the previous year end market price (in this case 30 April 2017) at 
the end of the following financial year. Upon the option exercise date falling due, employees can elect to exercise their options, 
or withdraw their contributions. Since the launch of the scheme, 80 employees have entered.
