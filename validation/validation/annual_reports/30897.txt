We have one simple goal: to revolutionise the world’s ability to locate, 
connect and manage industrial assets, making them more productive, 
flexible, profitable and safe. We are proud to be a trusted adviser to some 
of the biggest automotive, aerospace, telecoms and utility companies in the 
world, offering in-depth knowledge of the sectors in which we operate and 
the challenges that our customers face, at every level of the organisation. 
Our solutions are based on powerful enterprise platforms, supported 
by a range of customer-led applications, that use location to enable our 
customers to deliver a real-time digital twin of their physical operations, 
proven to drive quality, increase productivity, manage complexity and 
reduce costs. 
Ubisense has carved out a unique place for itself in the quest to enable the 
creation of digital twins across both sides of the business. A digital twin is a 
digital replica of a physical object or process, interpreting a wide range of 
technology to create a 'living' model that supports a production process 
during its lifecycle. 
We have two enterprise products that enable the creation of digital twins. 
RTLS SmartSpace 
Delivering new levels of visibility and control, SmartSpace provides a foundation 
platform for manufacturers’ Industry 4.0 strategy. Enabling customers to create 
a real-time digital twin of the production environment, Ubisense’s technology 
connects activities in the real world to manufacturing execution and 
planning systems, making real-world processes involving moving assets 
visible and measurable.
Geospatial myWorld
myWorld transforms the ability of infrastructure companies to manage 
their geographically dispersed assets by creating a single architecture 
for geospatial-based applications. It enables customers to create a real-time 
digital twin of their physical operations that can be shared by thousands 
of field and office staff across all departments, connecting seamlessly 
to other critical enterprise systems. • 2017: Strong progress was demonstrated in terms of revenue 
growth of our own products, cost management and order book
• Software focus: New strategy is delivering significant wins 
across both sides of the business, with a 21% increase in 
software sales
• Global growth: Demand for Ubisense solutions has 
increased across new centres of manufacturing such as 
Turkey and Thailand
• RTLS SmartSpace product development: Modularised the 
enterprise software platform to address Industry 4.0 and 
emerging opportunities for Industrial Internet of Things 
(“IIo T”) applications
• Geospatial myWorld product development: Extended the 
product portfolio to include an analytics suite that significantly 
reduces time to market for cable and telecoms network builds 
and upgrades

1 Ubisense Group plc Annual Report 2017
STRATEGIC HIGHLIGHTS In October 2017, we led 
a successful £5.5 million 
fundraise with new and 
existing shareholders, 
highlighting some of the 
customer productivity 
improvement opportunities 
based on Ubisense 
software platforms.”
“
Board of directors and Governance 
At the end of 2016, we welcomed Richard Petti 
to the Board as the new Chief Executive Officer. I’m 
delighted that he has stepped into the role successfully, 
enabling me to resume my non-Executive Chairman 
role in August 2017. Richard has led the business, 
clarifying the positioning and strategy of the company’s 
two product portfolios, focusing and training the sales 
force whilst we continue to build the sales capacity. 
The structure of the Board and individual responsibilities 
remain unchanged from last year. We ensure that 
the Company adopts proper standards of corporate 
governance and that the principles of best practice 
as set out in the UK Corporate Governance Code 
are followed where reasonably practicable. The 
Board continually reviews its composition and that 
of its committees and feels that, at this stage of the 
Group’s development, the skills and mix of its 
members best serves our current needs.
Group strategy 
In October 2017 we led a successful £5.5 million 
fundraise with new and existing shareholders, to 
allow us to capitalise on our strategy and accelerate 
our go-to-market and development activity. 
Driving value from 
our own products 
We've refocused our sales effort and development towards the two 
enterprise location intelligence software platforms – Real-Time Location 
System (RTLS) SmartSpace and Geospatial myWorld. 
Results overview 
2017 results continued to demonstrate that Ubisense 
has excellent products which deliver measurable 
benefits for customers as they strive for productivity 
improvements. In total, Ubisense has delivered 28% 
revenue growth for the company’s own products, 
RTLS SmartSpace and Geospatial myWorld, offsetting 
the planned decline in Geospatial revenues associated 
with third party products. We have continued to see 
growth in our own software revenues, which remains 
of key importance to us as we drive growth in new 
and recurring revenues.
The RTLS SmartSpace agreement with Lockheed 
Martin for the F35 program highlighted the productivity 
gains that industrial customers need to make, with 
integration of location information a key success-enabling 
factor. The strength of our technology alongside a 
flexible, highly scalable software platform that can 
integrate multiple location technologies were key 
factors in this aerospace win. A win in the satellite 
and space sector highlights the further opportunities 
that exist in high-tech manufacturing. 
Our Geospatial myWorld customers are now exploiting 
the flexibility of the platform to create new use cases 
liberating geospatial information across their 
organisation, integrating with other platforms and 
driving productivity improvements. For Ubisense, 
this drives sales of additional licences, further 
services engagements and involvement in 
customers’ longer term IT strategy.

CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT Enabling our customers to 
create digital twins of their 
physical environments is 
helping companies worldwide 
to improve their profitability 
and meet the most stringent 
quality control requirements. ”
“
Some of the customer productivity improvement 
opportunities based on Ubisense software 
platforms include:
RTLS SmartSpace: substantial investment in Industry 
4.0 / Smart Factory / Industrial Internet of Things (IIo T) 
in industry with automation of non-linear processes 
using location information.
Geospatial myWorld: communications and utility 
operators spending billions of dollars upgrading 
their networks, needing to optimise the workflow 
across their organisation with accurate real-time 
geographically-based information. 
For the Geospatial business, we will continue to 
leverage the highly specialist skills that we have in 
the team, focusing on increasing the volume of 
myWorld activity. In line with our strategy to reduce 
third party Geospatial consulting services, agreement 
was reached in March 2018 to dispose of that part 
of the Japanese business effective 30 March 2018. 
To strengthen sales of our own products we have 
recruited strong new sales leadership in Japan and 
are making good progress on sales of myWorld and 
SmartSpace with our Japanese and Thai partners. 
Corporate social responsibility 
We are committed to corporate social responsibility 
that is tangible, practical and fits with the ethos of the 
business; this ensures that it is supported globally. 
During 2017 we continued our charity day program, 
allowing employees to take time off to support 
their charity of choice as well as organising local 
fundraising events. We continue to collaborate with 
local and national organisations to engage interns, 
industrial placements, apprenticeships and mentoring 
schemes, as well as being active members of local 
networks and clubs. 
Current trading and outlook
The market opportunity for the Group is excellent for 
both divisions, with software-led strategies targeting 
productivity-enhancing opportunities in industry sectors 
that are growing and investing heavily in digitisation. 
By enabling our customers to create digital twins of 
their physical environments, we are helping companies 
worldwide to improve their profitability and meet the 
most stringent quality control requirements.
Trading in the first two months of 2018 has been in 
line with our expectations and we intend to build on 
our strengths through continued focus on developing 
and commercialising our software portfolio. We have 
improved the sales and go-to-market skills of the 
organisation and intend to further accelerate the 
momentum of sales of our own products through 
both divisions, which will ultimately drive improved 
gross margin and profitability.
We expect that the run-off of legacy third party services 
revenues will largely complete over the course of 2018, 
following which our results should better reflect the 
growth we are targeting in our own products, and as 
the proportion of third party services revenue in our mix 
declines, our gross margin will also naturally increase.
The growing success of our products, our stronger 
pipeline and discussions with customers lead us to be 
very excited about the prospects for our myWorld and 
RTLS SmartSpace products.
Our success is thanks to our people; we have a great 
team who have not only made this growth possible but 
are well positioned to take the business forwards.
I would like to thank our shareholders - old and new - 
for their continued support and our employees for their 
commitment in delivering success across both divisions.

Strategic report
3 Ubisense Group plc Annual Report 2017 Bringing the 
digital twin to life
We have made good progress in realigning our 
business around our two core products. 
Market opportunity 
Ubisense excels at helping customers to convert 
their physical worlds into a living, breathing digital 
twin of their core operational assets, products and 
processes. In fact, Lockheed Martin, a giant in the 
aerospace industry, recently listed digital twins as the 
number one technology trend of 2018. This is why in 
2017 we have sold more of our own products to 
more customers. 
Looking at the trends in our main markets of automotive, 
aerospace, telecoms and utilities we see some 
common challenges such as increased competition 
from globalisation, more demanding technical savvy 
customers and ageing workforces with skill gaps. 
However, as we look more closely within our target 
segments we also see some very positive indicators 
including automotive manufacturing output at an all-time 
high of 93.5m units
1
, aircraft order backlogs at an all-time 
high of 8-10 years
2
 and global rollout plans for millions 
of homes worldwide to be connected to fibre 
broadband services in the next few years. 
These long term trends are creating tremendous 
opportunities for us. This is why Lockheed Martin has 
trusted Ubisense with its mission critical function of 
controlling all shop floor tool operations for its high 
profile F-35 fighter program. This is also why Daimler 
has standardised every plant worldwide to work with 
our SmartSpace software to deliver their global vision 
of a “paperless factory”. And this is why one of the 
largest North American utilities business has employees 
using our myWorld solution every day.
Our solutions are chosen because they combine 
industry-leading technology that includes: indoor 
and outdoor geolocation, wirelessly enabled 
machine-to-machine and machine-to-device 
communication, advanced analytics and big 
data middleware. 
Underlying strategic focus
Our progress in 2017 can most easily be measured 
by observing the percentage of revenue our own 
products generate. For 2017 I am proud to report 
that not only did we break the 50% barrier but that 
we exceeded 60%. This important shift in our revenue 
mix  has been achieved by focusing on a 
three-point strategy:
1. Refocusing the business: 
Since 2016 we have been growing our focus on 
own-product sales into four main verticals: automotive, 
aerospace, telecoms and utilities. In doing so we are 
actively managing out our legacy third-party Geospatial 
service business which has now been reduced 
by 22% year on year. This has allowed greater 
management focus on building a stronger business 
that is based on our own products. Our goal is to 
become a market standard in each of our chosen 
verticals, we are focusing on the top global quartile 
of our selected market, which means concentrating 
our efforts on a group of approximately 200 global 
companies worldwide. 
Focusing ensures that we develop a deeper 
understanding of our chosen markets. In 2017 
we seeded our product roadmaps with extensive 
customer research which has helped us understand 
new areas where existing and prospective customers 
are facing specific problems. This market research 
has led to the launch of important new products 
in both product lines and increased pipeline 
generation. By increasing our focus on specific 
verticals we have been able to offer existing 
customers new product roadmaps that align with 
their challenges, and give new customers reasons 
to adopt Ubisense technology.
4 Ubisense Group plc Annual Report 2017
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S STATEMENT Real progress towards our 
goal of revolutionising the 
world’s ability to locate, 
connect and manage 
industrial assets.”
Financial results
The repositioning work has allowed us to increase 
the percentage of software across the board and in 
a typical transaction software will be the dominant 
source of revenue and margin. This ability to drive 
software sales underpins our goal of increasing 
margin and recurring revenue by way of maintenance 
and support services.
With respect to financial performance, we were 
able to grow our top line to £27.3 million, more than 
overcoming the decline in our legacy third party 
service revenues. This top line growth is thanks to the 
increased sales of our own products, which grew at 
an impressive rate of 28%. Our margins made some 
positive progress which will improve further as the 
momentum builds from the sales of our own products. 
Above all, the Ubisense team continues to work hard 
to deliver improved returns for your investment. 
Richard Petti
Chief Executive Officer
14 March 2018
2.  Improved sales execution: 
Within our own organisation we have strengthened 
our go-to-market capabilities by recruiting market 
leading sales, pre-sales and marketing talent over 
2017 and we have invested in training to help our 
organisation successfully complete complex 
multi-stakeholder buying processes. 
As a result of this we have seen a significant shift in 
the shape of our pipeline, and across both business 
lines we have seen increases in the number of 
opportunities in the £250K–£1m band by an average 
of 115% and the £1M+ band by 25%. We have also 
increased our presence in new markets such 
as Thailand and Turkey by signing new distribution 
agreements with carefully selected partners that 
have both sales and delivery capabilities into our 
strategic markets of automotive, aerospace, 
telecoms and utilities. 
3. Repositioning the product portfolio: 
Thanks to our renewed engagement with our chosen 
markets we have invested in the development of our 
two enterprise class software solutions: SmartSpace 
and myWorld. Both product sets have been elevated 
from a positioning perspective so that our ability 
to solve enterprise level problems are more clearly 
communicated to our target markets. This elevation 
takes the form of positioning our products in the context 
of enterprise systems already in place (in manufacturing, 
for example, this is referred to as the ‘manufacturing 
enterprise systems stack’) and targeting our messaging 
directly at specific job roles. 
In addition to elevating the two products, we have 
invested in modularising them, separating functionality 
into applications which can be packaged to address 
customer specific needs. This approach allows us to 
position both products along the value chains of our 
target market and illustrates how our products can 
improve core operations at each node in the value 
chain of their added-value operations. By positioning 
our product along the value chain we have been able 
to offer specific solutions to the challenges in particular 
areas, thereby eliminating the need to purchase 
enterprise licenses to solve discrete problems and 
preserving more value for future sales.

CASE STUDIES Thailand’s booming 
automotive sector 
Ubisense selected as technology to drive Industry 4.0 in Thailand’s booming automotive sector
Ubisense SmartSpace has attracted a network of 
partners around the world, including Logiprotech in Thailand. 
Founder Ryoichi Sasaki was President of T oyota Thailand 
plus the President of T oyota Motor Asia-Pacific and is at the 
forefront of driving Industry 4.0 in the region. 
He said: “In May 2017 we began a feasibility study 
on Ubisense products in Thailand. We were of the view 
that the latest information technology based on Ubisense 
market-leading RTLS technology would attract the potential 
demand for breakthrough improvement in the production 
and logistics operations across the region.”
“ We soon recognised that it would make sense to bring in 
Ubisense products to further enhance the competitive edge 
of various industries in Thailand. The Thai government is 
actively promoting the “Thailand 4.0”, the policy to make 
effective use of the most up-to-date technologies in an 
attempt to restructure and revitalise the industries in 
Thailand. Taking such factors into consideration, we 
decided to establish a new joint venture company called 
LPTT, “Logiprotech (Thailand) Co., Ltd.”, in June 2017.”
“ The Thailand 4.0 policy also gives new government 
incentives to the latest technologies administered by 
BOI, Board of Investment. They confirmed that our RTLS, 
based on Ubisense technology, satisfies the BOI criteria 
allowing our project to receive relevant incentives. This 
will certainly contribute to the successful development 
of our project.”
“ LPTT launched its first project at a factory of T oyota Motor 
Thailand at the beginning of November 2017. This is the 
very first step significantly meaningful to the future of our 
project. T oyota is well known as one of the most successful 
automotive manufacturers. In particular, T oyota Production 
System (TPS), is highly recognised on a global basis. I 
believe that the Io T technology will help to further develop 
TPS and hope that our system based on Ubisense RTLS 
will be able to contribute to such activities. We intend to 
continue our efforts in deploying our system in Thailand 
and eventually in other countries in Southeast Asia. We 
are beginning to receive a number of positive enquiries 
from other automotive companies as well as other 
industries than automotive field in Thailand.”
“ Southeast Asia or ASEAN has huge potential as a big 
growing market and also as a competitive and reliable 
manufacturing base. This area, in particular Thailand as 
the leading country in the region, has signs of needing 
something innovative to stimulate to dramatically heighten 
their production and logistics capabilities. I believe that 
Ubisense RTLS will satisfy such requirements due to its 
unique and distinctive technology.”
Thailand’s automotive sector
• As of 2017, Thailand’s automotive industry was 
the largest in Southeast Asia and the 12th largest 
in the world 
• The Thailand industry has an annual output of nearly 
two million vehicles. That’s more than countries such 
as Belgium, UK, Italy, Czech Republic and Turkey

visibility of a communications 
or utility business by delivering 
a location-based common 
operational view of the 
enterprise”
Ubisense responds to market 
demand for improving fiber network 
Research by Accenture and PwC summarise the opportunity that 
the global rollout of fiber represents for Ubisense. 
“ The communication industry has made dramatic advances 
in the last five years, witnessing rapid adoption of the latest 
generation of connected devices and increasing investments 
in faster networks. At the same time, digital has transformed 
the consumer experience, bringing new expectations and 
different rules of engagement
1
.”
“ The coming era of next-generation broadband networks 
is bringing about the end of telecommunications operators’ 
traditional deployment model. A number of changes will 
require innovative responses: Consumers are demanding 
ever greater bandwidth to support new applications and 
services. A larger variety of access network technology 
and rollout options, along with their substantial deployment 
costs, are forcing operators to make tough choices
2
.”
The broadband industry now needs to roll-out next-generation 
fiber network within aggressive time frames and fixed budgets 
– improving fibre network technology deployment strategies 
and solutions is top priority. 
In response, Ubisense has launched myWorld Fiber Planning. 
Now rolled out for a Tier 1 broadband customer, Ubisense’s 
Fiber Planning automates the network infrastructure layout 
and optimizes the design, utilizing existing infrastructure 
where possible for the lowest cost results. 
Utilising complex mathematical analytical models 
provided by a partner and integrated with myWorld, it 
allows customers to produce high quality cost-optimized 
Fibre to the Home (“FTTH”) layouts quickly, enabling 
faster and more accurate capital planning, prioritization, 
and mobilization – improving overall time to market. 
Ubisense myWorld Fiber Planning has enabled a customer 
to: “Reduce the planned number of designers for a large, 
multi-year FTTX project from 100 to 20.”
Key benefits include: 
• Reduces labour costs associated with the engineering 
and design process by over 40% 
• Time to market is reduced 10 – 20% for any size Fibre 
to the Home/Cabinet (“FTTX”) roll-out 
• Enables rapid adjustment to account for field changes 
• Produces the most cost effective standards based 
designs for any scenario reducing capital costs
Fiber to the X (FTTX) comprises the many variants of fiber 
optic access infrastructure–including fiber to the home 
(FTTH), fiber to the premise (FTTP), fiber to the building 
(FTTB), fiber to the node (FTTN), and fiber to the curb 
or cabinet (FTTC).

18 Ubisense Group plc Annual Report 2017 I’m pleased to present the 2017 results which reflect 
the continued progress that we’ve made in redefining 
our software-led strategy and building our go-to-market 
activity. Our strategy to enable digital twins for both 
divisions is aligned to our customers’ desire to drive 
productivity and operational performance improvements 
in line with the digitisation and Industry 4.0 themes 
which are attracting significant investment spend. 
With our new modularised software offerings aiding 
the Return on Investment proposition to our target 
customers, we have developed a stronger pipeline of 
better qualified opportunities including increased 
software values, which will lead to further growth in 
orders, revenues and margins delivering profitability. 
A 28% increase in revenues of Ubisense products 
has exceeded the decline in services associated 
with third-party and non-core products within the 
Geospatial division. The successful placing in 
November 2017 supports the future growth plans 
of the Group through investment in go-to-market 
and product development capacity.
Revenue
The Group is organised into two divisions, RTLS 
SmartSpace and Geospatial myWorld. Both divisions 
provide software solutions and services to enterprise 
customers, with RTLS SmartSpace additionally 
providing hardware solutions. The revenue 
composition by division is summarised in

CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER’S STATEMENT Revenue continued
The software focus in both divisions delivered good 
progress in 2017 with sales into new sectors as well 
as expanding deployments with existing customers. 
Modularisation of our software platform offerings 
together with sales of the new myWorld Fiber Planning 
product have been key factors in supporting 2017 
growth and provide a foundation for growth in future 
years. The increase in software revenue leads directly 
to increasing maintenance and support revenues 
with a 34% increase shown in 2017 over 2016. 
These maintenance and support revenues are 
recurring contracts, which are expected to be 
renewed by customers annually.  
Orders
Bookings for own products in 2017 were £17.5 million 
(2016: £15.5 million). The increase was in line with the 
strategy to focus on our own products. £10.7 million 
of new orders related to RTLS SmartSpace 
(2016: £10.9 million), £6.8 million related to 
Geospatial myWorld (2016: £4.6 million). 
Total bookings of new customer orders in 
2017 were £22.7 million (2016: £29.3 million).
The order book backlog as at 31 December 2017 
was £8.7 million (2016: £12.6 million), most of which 
will be recognised during 2018. £3.6 million of this 
related to RTLS SmartSpace (2016: £3.7 million), 
£2.9 million related to Geospatial myWorld 
(2016: £1.8 million) and £2.2 million to Geospatial 
third party Services (2016: £7.1 million).
Gross margin
The Group gross margin increased to 40% in 2017 from 39% in 2016. 
Gross margin by division is summarised as follows;

The gross margin of the RTLS SmartSpace division has reduced compared to 2016 due to a revenue mix 
with a higher proportion of lower margin hardware and services revenues. The Geospatial division’s gross 
margin increased due to growth in myWorld software revenues partially offset by the 3rd party costs of the 
mathematical model embedded in the myWorld Fiber Planning product.

Other operating expenses include sales, marketing, product development, administration. Operating loss 
reduced to £3.1 million (2016: £6.2 million) due to impairments recognised in 2016. Share-based payments 
expense of £0.3 million (2016: £nil) relates to shares options granted in December 2016.
20 Ubisense Group plc Annual Report 2017
CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER’S STATEMENT continued Adjusted EBITDA excludes amortisation and impairment, 
depreciation, share-based payments, unrealised 
foreign exchange gains on intercompany trading 
balances and non-recurring items and is reported 
as it reflects the performance of the Group. Adjusted 
EBITDA was £0.4 million (2016: £0.3 million) with the 
improvement driven by higher revenues at an 
increased gross margin.
Finance costs
Net interest payable for the period was £0.1 million 
(2016: £0.3 million) with reduced costs in 2017 following 
the restructuring of the HSBC debt in 2016.
Income tax
The Group has a net tax credit of £0.1 million 
(2016: £1.1 million) as a result of non-cash deferred 
tax movements. The Group does have substantial 
tax losses carried forward but does not currently 
recognise a deferred tax asset in respect of 
these losses. 
Earnings and dividend 
Loss before tax reduced to £3.1 million (2016: £6.4 million) 
and loss after tax was £3.1 million (2016: £5.3 million). 
The adjusted diluted loss per share was 4.3 pence 
(2016: 3.9 pence loss per share). Reported basic and 
diluted loss per share was 5.2 pence (2016: 10.4 pence). 
The Board does not propose a dividend for the year. 
Impact of IFRS 15
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers 
will replace IAS 18 Revenue. The new standard is 
applicable from 1 January 2018, however 2017 
comparatives will be restated under IFRS 15.  
IFRS 15 introduces a number of new concepts and 
requirements relating to revenue recognition, and 
also provides guidance and clarification on 
existing practice.
The Group has assessed the impact of IFRS 15 
and the results of the assessment are stated on 
page 47. The majority of Ubisense’s sales are for 
products sold on a standalone basis and it is 
expected that the revenue recognition policy 
applied to these sales will be unaffected by the 
application of IFRS 15. Larger, more complex 
contracts, which involve multiple performance 
obligations, that include a combination of products 
and services, are affected by the application 
of IFRS 15. IFRS 15 requires the Group to evaluate 
the performance obligations for the contracted 
products and services to identify whether these 
components are distinct. Accordingly, the 
significance of the impact of IFRS 15 is dependent 
upon the details of those complex contracts 
particularly those with delivery close to a financial 
reporting period end.
The financial impact of the adoption of IFRS 15 
will be disclosed within the interim results to 
30 June 2018.
Impact of IFRS 16
IFRS 16 Leases will replace IAS 17 and three 
related interpretations. Leases will be recorded 
on the statement of financial position in the form 
of a right-of-use asset and a lease liability. The 
consolidated income statement will be impacted 
through reduced operating expenses, and higher 
depreciation and finance costs. The new standard 
is applicable from 1 January 2019 with an option to 
adopt it early. The Group intend to early adopt IFRS 
16 from 1 January 2018 alongside IFRS 15 Revenue.
The Group leases all of the premises from which it 
conducts business with annual commitments under 
operating leases totalling £0.7 million and therefore 
the impact of IFRS 16 will be material to the financial 
statements. The Group has assessed the impact of 
IFRS 16 and the results of the assessment are stated 
on page 48.
Consolidated statement of financial position
In November 2017, the Group completed a share 
placing raising gross proceeds of £5.5 million with 
the placement of 17,187,500 new ordinary shares 
at a price of £0.32 per share with new and existing 
shareholders. The net proceeds of £5.2 million from 
the placing will be used to grow the business, investing 
in go-to-market capacity and product development.
Alongside the fundraise, the terms of the HSBC loan 
were renegotiated and this is discussed further in 
note 17 to the consolidated financial statements.
As at 31 December 2017, the Group had a positive 
net cash position of £6.6 million (2016: £0.2 million) 
being £9.1 million of cash and £2.5 million of debt. 
In January 2018 a further repayment of £0.8 million 
was made.
Strategic report
21 Ubisense Group plc Annual Report 2017 Non-current assets
Total non-current assets were £3.5 million 
(2016: £4.4 million).
Capitalised development costs represent the key 
intangible assets of the Group whereby this investment 
in Ubisense's own products will deliver the future 
growth of the business. Capitalised development 
costs of £1.6 million (2016: £1.9 million) were recognised 
in 2017 offset by amortisation of £2.2 million (2016: 
£2.6 million). The appropriateness of the assessment 
of the useful life of current development projects 
was reviewed, but no change has been made to the 
current three year amortisation period, due to the 
fast moving nature of the technology. The recoverable 
amount of the capitalised development costs is 
supported through the growth in revenues of 
Ubisense’s own RTLS SmartSpace and myWorld 
products achieved in 2017 and anticipated in 
future periods.
Current assets
Total current assets increased to £21.1 million 
(2016: £17.8 million).
Cash increased to £9.1 million (2016: £3.5 million).
Trade receivables net of provisions decreased to 
£6.2 million (2016: £9.2 million) due to the timing of 
deals during the year. 
Amounts recoverable on contracts totalled £2.7 million 
(2016: £2.9 million) which are generated from services 
contracts or end of period deliveries, and are then 
invoiced in the following month or as the relevant 
milestone is reached. 
Hardware inventories increased to £1.5 million 
(2016: £1.1 million) due to the completion of a RTLS 
SmartSpace sensor build program prior to the year 
end. The Group continues to manage its investment 
in inventory through the sales forecasting process 
and regular review of the expected lead times to 
create RTLS SmartSpace hardware. The sensor 
build programs are sized to try to balance volume 
demands against unit cost efficiency and need to 
work on a 4–6 month lead time as increased global 
demand is extending component lead times.
Total assets
Total assets increased to £24.6 million 
(2016: £22.1 million).
Current liabilities
Total current liabilities increased to £10.0 million 
(2016: £9.0 million). Trade payables increased to 
£3.0 million (2016: £1.5 million) which was partly 
due to inventory related purchases close to 
the year end.
Non-current liabilities
Total non-current liabilities decreased to £2.5 million 
(2016: £3.4 million) following the reduction in long-term 
debt from £2.5 million in 2016 to £1.8 million as at 
31 December 2017.
Net assets
Net assets increased to £12.1 million (2016: £9.8 million) 
following the placement of 17,187,500 new ordinary 
shares at £0.32 in November 2017.
Cash and cash flow
Operating cash flow before working capital movement 
was £0.4 million inflow (2016: £0.3 million).
Operating cash flows from operating activities after 
adjusting for working capital and tax was £3.6 million 
inflow (2016: £2.0 million outflow). Working capital 
improvements were driven by a reduction in the 
trade receivables balance at year end.
The Group had investment outflows of £2.1 million 
(2016: £2.0 million), which is largely made up of 
expenditure on product development.
Cash inflows from financing activities were £4.3 million 
(2016: £1.8 million). This included net proceeds from 
placings of £5.2 million (2016: £4.5 million) offset 
by repayment of borrowings and interest on 
those borrowings.

CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER’S STATEMENT continued PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES
Principal risk and impact Mitigation
Strategic risks
Growth management
Near-term expansion is expected in the future to develop existing markets and to 
expand into new markets. The risks associated with growth include the delivery of 
market penetration through the conversion of leads to sales, and control of increases 
in fixed operating costs to support revenue growth. If the Group is unable to manage 
expansion effectively, its business and financial results could suffer.
• Close monitoring of business development 
strategy and regular reviews of the sales 
opportunity pipeline at Board meetings.
• Head office support of regional office development 
in the event of accelerated regional growth.
• Development of systems and processes that can 
scale with the business while maintaining good 
financial management.
Dependence on key customers
The Group has a concentrated customer base, many of which are substantially larger 
enterprises than the Group. The Group is reliant on significant projects with its key 
customers to deliver financial results. The conversion of opportunities to signed contracts 
and then the subsequent timing of the projects is not fully under the control of the Group. 
• The Group’s management performs regular reviews 
of the opportunity pipeline, including critical stages 
to complete the larger deals with status reported 
at Board meetings.
• Increase the breadth of the opportunity pipeline 
through recruitment of more quota-carrying sales 
and pre-sales personnel.
• The Group continues to invest in the key customer 
relationships that it has successfully retained over 
many years, while also maintaining a strategy to 
extend and diversify its customer base.
Technological risk
The Group operates in an industry where competitive advantage is heavily dependent 
on technology. Technological development may reduce the importance of the 
Group’s function in the market.
• Regular monitoring of the industry and advances 
through participation in research forums.
• Review of the RTLS SmartSpace and myWorld product 
roadmaps by the Board to ensure competitiveness.
• Continued investment in technologies that meet 
customer needs.
• Monitoring of planned R&D to ensure resources 
are allocated to deliver advances that are aligned 
to the Group strategy.
The Directors of Ubisense Group plc confirm that we have carried out a detailed assessment of the principal risks facing the 
Company, including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity. Risks that present 
a potential material impact are identified and governed in accordance to our risk management policies.
Effective risk management is critical to the achievement of the Group’s long-term growth. The Board has overall accountability for 
ensuring that risk is effectively managed across the Group through the implementation and review of the Group’s risk processes.
The principal risks listed in the table are those we believe could cause our results to differ materially from expected and historical 
results. They are also the risks that may impact the achievement of the Group’s strategic priorities.
How we manage risk
Strategic report
23 Ubisense Group plc Annual Report 2017 Principal risk and impact Mitigation
Operational risks
Customer satisfaction and retention 
Barriers to entry into the market are high with proof of delivery in customer environments 
essential. The Group operates in a market with a small number of significant customers 
and reputational damage through poor customer satisfaction could be significant. 
Large customers generate a high proportion of recurring business as well as up sell 
and cross sell opportunities. These customers also provide solution references and 
often trial new products or updates to existing ones. 
Additionally, poor customer satisfaction could result in delays in the timing of 
customer payments which would reduce the working capital available to the Group.
• Maintain regular communications with customers.
• Ensure appropriate level of resources are applied 
to key customer accounts.
• Deal with issues quickly through a clear 
escalation path.
Intellectual property (“IP”)
The Group has a patent portfolio filed in territories worldwide. Should a third party 
successfully demonstrate priority over any of these rights, it could inhibit the Group, or the 
Group’s customers, from selling products in certain territories.
Failure to protect the Group’s IP may result in another party using its proprietary 
technology without authorisation. There may not be adequate protection for the IP in 
every country in which the Group’s products are made available and policing 
unauthorised use is difficult and expensive.
Furthermore, the Group may need to take legal action to enforce its intellectual 
property, to protect trade secrets or to determine the validity or scope of the 
proprietary rights of others. The costs of protecting IP and the diversion of resources 
and management time may be substantial, and there can be no guarantees as to the 
outcome of litigation.
• The Group regularly reviews the patent status of its 
intellectual property within its core territories, 
working with advisers.
Staff recruitment and retention
The Group’s success is substantially dependent upon recruiting, retaining and 
incentivising senior management and key technically skilled employees, the loss 
of whom could have an adverse impact on the performance of the business.
• The Group has in place appropriate incentive 
structures to attract and retain the calibre of 
employees necessary to ensure the efficient 
development and management of the Group.
• The Group has implemented Employer of Choice 
initiatives including career planning and 
organisational development.
Legal and regulatory breaches
The Group is required to comply with local laws, regulations and legislation in each 
jurisdiction in which it operates. These include compliance with financial reporting 
and conduct requirements, Health & Safety, Data Protection and anti-Bribery rules.
Failure to comply with local laws may result in the cessation of the ability to trade in that 
jurisdiction, fines or the allocation of resources to perform corrective actions. 
• The Group monitors new developments taking 
input from local advisers.
• The Group regularly reviews its processes to 
ensure that the risk of default is minimised.
International trade
On 29 March 2019, the UK will leave the European Union. The risks associated with Brexit 
include a potential increase in the level of market volatility, barriers to trade between 
the UK and the EU following the end of any transition arrangements that come into 
force post Brexit, and may impact the investment plans of our customers.
The Group is exposed to economic downturn within the markets in which it operates.
• European customers enter into contracts with local 
subsidiaries of Ubisense Group plc including legal 
entities based in France and Germany.
• The Group could consider moving its manufacturing 
location if trade barriers became 
prohibitively expensive.
• The Group’s customer sales are spread across 
multiple territories which will partially mitigate 
against a down-turn in any one region.
Digital infrastructure and cyber security
Breaches of the Group’s digital security through cyber attacks or otherwise, 
or failure of the Group’s digital infrastructure could seriously disrupt operations, 
including the provision of customer services and result in the loss or misuse of 
sensitive information, legal or regulatory breaches resulting in potential liability, 
and reputational damage among the customer base leading to a decline in revenues.
• The Group continues to invest in resources in 
enhancing site resilience and defences, improving 
network monitoring and reviewing the incident 
response processes to mitigate the impact of a 
security breach.
• Short and medium-term cyber security plans are 
regularly reviewed by the Board.

PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES continued Principal risk and impact Mitigation
Financial risks
Future funding requirements
The Group may need to raise additional funding beyond that provided by the share 
placing in November 2017 and the existing HSBC facility. There is no certainty that 
such fundraising will be possible or on acceptable terms. In addition, the terms of 
any such financing may be dilutive to, or otherwise adversely affect shareholders.
• Clear communication of our medium and long-term 
strategy to our investors and bankers.
• Monitoring of mid to long-term cash flow 
requirements and anticipated business 
performance. Adjusting activities through the 
business planning process.
Bank covenants
In October 2016, the Group restructured the HSBC working capital loan facility. As at 
31 December 2017, the balance of the facility was £2.5 million. The Group is required to 
meet the covenants as explained in note 17 to the financial statements. If the Group were 
unable to meet the covenants of the facility the debt would be repayable on demand, 
which would have an impact on the working capital available to the business.
• Net cash position of £6.6 million (2017: £0.2 million).
• Monitoring of cash flow requirements and adjusting 
activities through the business planning process.
• Monitoring of covenants and testing for actual or 
forecast breach throughout the year.
Taxation
The Group operates globally and is exposed to international tax laws. Changes to 
taxation legislation such as the withdrawal/reduction of UK tax incentives to perform R&D, 
would have an adverse impact on the working capital of the Group.
• The Group reviews local compliance and 
upcoming changes to legislation with its advisers 
and continues to update forecasts accordingly.
Foreign exchange risk
The Group’s international operations expose it to a number of risks that include the 
effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. A major proportion of the 
Group’s receivables and payables is currently denominated in Canadian dollars, US 
dollars, Euros and Japanese Yen.
• The Group relies on a partial natural hedge of 
Canadian dollar, US dollar, Euro and Japanese Yen 
receivables being in the same currency as the 
local operation’s payables.
• The Group’s working capital is forecast and monitored 
in the local currency of each subsidiary allowing 
the foreign currency exposure across the Group 
to be reviewed.
Financial reporting risk
In preparing the financial statements, the Group makes accounting estimates that 
have a significant risk of causing material adjustment to the carrying amounts of 
assets and liabilities within the next financial year. These judgements are detailed 
further in note 4 to the financial statements and include revenue recognition, the 
treatment of RTLS SmartSpace and myWorld development costs and valuation  
of inventories.
A material error in the accounting estimates applied during a reporting period would 
impact upon bank covenants testing for the existing HSBC loan and could 
adversely impact the ability of the Group to raise additional funding. 
• In forming our accounting judgements, management 
discuss estimates with internal experts within the 
Ubisense Group to ensure all relevant facts 
are understood. 
• The underlying fact pattern and conclusions reached 
in making accounting judgements are discussed in 
detail with the Audit Committee of the Group. 
• Early consideration of forthcoming changes such 
as IFRS 15 and IFRS 16. 
Risks reported in prior year which are no longer considered to be principal risks
Credit risk associated with delays in customer payment, was identified as a principal risk in prior periods due to the potential 
impact on working capital available to the Group. While the risks continue to be monitored, management no longer believe this 
to be a principal risk due to the stronger cash position of the Group. As the majority of the Group’s customers are large, blue-chip 
utilities, telecoms and manufacturing companies, the risk of non-payment is more likely to be related to customer satisfaction 
and this continues to be a principal risk that has been considered above.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT
Although not required to do so by the 
AIM Listing Rules, the Directors have chosen 
to provide selected corporate governance 
disclosures with this report, which they 
consider to be valuable to the reader.
The Directors believe that effective 
corporate governance, appropriate to 
the Group considering its size and stage 
of development, will assist in the delivery 
of corporate strategy, the generation of 
shareholder value and the safeguarding 
of shareholders’ long-term interests. We 
do not comply with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code June 2016 (“the Code”). 
However, the Directors are committed, 
wherever it is reasonably practicable, to 
ensure that the Group is managed in 
accordance with the principles set out 
in the Code.
Composition of the Board
The Board comprises the Non-Executive 
Chairman, four Non-Executive Directors 
and two Executive Directors. Biographical 
details of all members of the Board are 
set out on pages 26 and 27. In May 2016, 
the Chairman moved from a Non-Executive 
position to Executive on the departure of 
the previous CEO. The Chairman resumed 
a Non-Executive position on 1 August 2017.
Since the flotation of the Company in 2011, 
no equity-based incentives have been 
granted to Non-Executive Directors and 
there are no such plans for any such 
grants in the future. The Chairman was 
granted share options in December 2017 
while he was Executive Chairman and 
these options remain active. At the end 
of the year, all Non-Executive Directors 
except Oliver Scott held shares in Ubisense 
Group plc. Oliver Scott is a partner and 
founder of Kestrel Partners who have a 
significant interest in Ubisense Group plc.
The holding of shares and/or share options 
by Non-Executive Directors could, among 
other things, be relevant in determining 
whether a Non-Executive Director is 
independent. Therefore, after detailed 
consideration, the Board has determined 
that Paul T aylor and Ian Kershaw are the 
only independent Non-Executive Directors 
within the meaning of the Code, noting 
that their shareholdings in the Group are 
small. Paul Taylor is recognised by the 
board as the Senior Independent Director.
The roles of Non-Executive Chairman 
and Chief Executive Officer are vested 
in separate individuals, each with a clear 
allocation of accountability and responsibility. 
The Non-Executive Chairman has prime 
responsibility for running the Board and 
the Chief Executive Officer has executive 
responsibilities for the Group’s strategic 
development, operations and results. 
The structure of the Board is such that 
there is no one individual or group 
dominating the decision making process.
The role of the Board
The Board holds full meetings at least 
ten times per year, with attendance 
required in person whenever possible. 
The principal matters that it considers 
are as follows:
• reviewing operating and 
financial performance;
• ensuring that appropriate 
management development and 
succession plans are in place;
• determining corporate strategy, including 
consideration and approval of the 
Company’s annual strategy review;
• establishing dividend policy;
• approving and accepting all new 
committed funding facilities;
• approving and accepting major 
changes in the capital structure 
of the Company;
• reviewing and approving formal 
treasury policies relating to funding, 
liquidity, transactional foreign exchange 
and interest rate risk management;
• reviewing the health and safety 
and environmental performance 
of the Group;
• approving corporate acquisitions, 
mergers, divestments, joint ventures 
and major capital expenditure; and
• receiving, reviewing and approving 
recommendations by the designated 
committee on matters related to audit, 
nominations and remuneration.
The Board is supplied with information in 
a timely manner and in a form and of a 
quality appropriate to enable it to discharge 
its duties. The Board has a policy to set 
out which matters are reserved for the 
decision of the Board and those to which 
the Executive Directors need not refer 
for approval. This policy also requires 
that all recommendations and decisions 
by a Board Committee are approved or 
ratified by the Board.
Summary of Board meeting 
attendance in 2017
The Board is expected to meet regularly 
on a formal basis at least ten times a year.

The role of each Committee is described in more detail below:
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee has responsibility 
for the following matters:
Financial reporting
• Review of all financial reports released 
to the market and shareholders.
• Review of significant reporting issues 
and key judgements.
• Review of accounting policies 
selected and their application.
External audit
• Recommending appointment, 
re-appointment or removal of the 
external auditors.
• Overseeing the Group’s relationship 
with the external auditors, including 
assessing their independence.
• Agreeing the annual audit plan and 
reviewing the finding and 
effectiveness of the audit.
Whistleblowing
• Review of the Group’s whistleblowing 
policies and procedures.
As part of its procedures, the Committee 
discusses the interim and annual financial 
statements with the external auditors. 
When appropriate, non-Committee 
members are invited to attend. During 
the period under review, the Committee 
has met four times on a formal basis. The 
Committee is expected to meet formally 
four times a year.
Nomination Committee
The Nomination Committee has 
responsibility for the following matters:
• Reviewing the size and composition 
of the Board to ensure that an 
appropriate mix of skills, knowledge 
and experience is achieved.
• Succession planning for the Board 
and other key management roles.
• Identifying and recommending to the 
Board candidates to fill Board vacancies.
• Ensuring Non-Executive Directors are 
able to make the necessary time 
commitments to fulfil their role.
• Ensuring Non-Executive Directors 
receive letters of appointment, 
detailing their responsibilities.
• Making recommendations to the Board 
about the appointment, removal or 
continuation in office of any Director.
During the period under review, the 
Committee has met twice on a formal 
basis. The Committee is expected to 
meet formally twice a year.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee has 
responsibility for the following matters:
• Agreeing the framework for the 
Group’s remuneration policy for 
Directors and key management 
personnel, including determining 
individual remuneration policies for 
Executive Directors.
• Approving the design and targets for 
short and long term incentive plans.
• Determining the policy and scope of 
pension arrangements.
• Ensuring contractual terms and payments 
made on termination are fair to both 
the individual and the Group.
• Agreeing the policy for authorising 
expense claims by the Chairman and 
Chief Executive.
The Group has a formal and transparent 
procedure for developing policy on 
Directors’ remuneration. No Director is 
involved in deciding his own remuneration.
The Committee aims to set levels of 
remuneration for Executive Directors 
that are sufficient to attract, retain and 
motivate directors of the quality required, 
without paying more than necessary, 
and that are appropriate for the size 
and complexity of the Group. It aims 
to see that a significant proportion of 
each Executive Director’s remuneration 
package is performance-related.
During the period under review, the 
Committee has met twice on a formal 
basis. The Committee is expected to 
meet formally twice a year.
Internal control
The Board of Directors has overall 
responsibility for the Group’s system 
of internal control and for reviewing 
its effectiveness. The risk managing 
process and systems of internal control 
are designed to manage rather than 
eliminate the risk of failure to achieve 
the Group’s objectives. It should be 
recognised that such systems can only 
provide reasonable but not absolute 
assurance against material misstatement 
or loss. The Directors acknowledge their 
responsibilities for the Group’s system 
of internal control and for reviewing its 
effectiveness. The principal features of 
the system of internal financial controls are:
• Budgetary control over all operations, 
measuring performance against 
pre-determined targets on at least 
a monthly basis.
• Regular forecasting and reviews covering 
trading performance, assets, liabilities, 
cash flows and bank covenants.
• Delegated limits of authority covering 
key financial commitments including 
capital expenditure and recruitment.
• Identification and management of key 
business risks.
The Board continually reviews the 
effectiveness of other internal controls, 
including financial, operational, compliance 
controls and risk management. 30 Ubisense Group plc Annual Report 2017

Post-balance sheet events
On 6 March, Ubisense Group plc entered

geospatial services business of its 
Japanese subsidiary, Geoplan Company 
Limited. Under the terms of the agreement 
customer relationships, the Geoplan brand 
name, fixed assets including certain market 
specific products, stock and 13 employees 
will be transferred to a new company, 
with the new company being sold for 
a consideration of JPY 100 million 
(approximately £0.7 million). The assets 
being sold have an immaterial carrying 
value within the consolidated statement

transaction is 30 March 2018.
Alongside this transaction, Ubisense has 
agreed, subject to contract completion, 
to acquire the 23% minority interest of 
Geoplan Company Limited. The acquisition 
of this minority interest will give the Group 
100% ownership of its remaining Japanese 
operations. Geoplan Company Limited will 
be renamed Ubisense Japan K.K.
These transactions are consistent with 
Ubisense’s strategy of refocusing the 
Group on growing revenues from its own 
IP whilst managing the reduction in third 
party geospatial services revenues. 
Dividends
The Directors do not recommend payment 
of a dividend for the year (2016: £nil).
Auditor
A resolution to re-appoint Grant Thornton 
UK LLP as the Group’s auditor will be 
proposed at the forthcoming Annual 
General Meeting. In accordance 
with normal practice, the Directors 
will be authorised to determine the 
Auditor’s remuneration.

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT
Introduction
Ubisense Group plc has elected voluntarily 
to prepare a Directors’ remuneration report. 
As a company admitted to trading on the 
AIM, the Company is not required to provide 
a formal remuneration report and this is 
provided to give greater transparency of 
the Group’s remuneration policy.
This report is on the activities of the 
Remuneration Committee for the period 
to 31 December 2017. It sets out the 
remuneration policy and remuneration 
details for the Executive and Non-Executive 
Directors of the Company.
Composition of the Remuneration 
Committee
The Remuneration Committee comprises 
of Ian Kershaw, Paul T aylor and Oliver Scott 
who are Non-Executive Directors of 
the Company.
The Committee advises the Board on 
remuneration policy and defines the 
remuneration and terms and conditions 
of employment of the Executive Directors. 
In addition, it reviews the remuneration 
policy for the Group as a whole and 
oversees and approves the Group’s 
share incentive plans for all participants.
Oliver Scott who is not an independent 
Director, sits on the Remuneration 
Committee. The Board acknowledge that 
this is not considered best practice but 
feel that it is appropriate for the scale 
and structure of the Group at this stage 
given his knowledge, experience and 
ability to represent investor interests.
Remuneration practice overview
The Committee believes in pay for 
performance and that Executive Directors’ 
remuneration should be designed to 
promote the long-term success of 
the Group. 
When reviewing and setting remuneration 
policy, the Committee benchmarks 
remuneration against quoted companies 
of a similar size and considers a range of 
factors including the Group’s strategy 
and circumstances, the prevailing economic 
environment and best practice guidelines. 
The policy must also enable Ubisense 
Group plc to attract, retain and motivate 
the talent it needs to ensure success.
The remuneration of the Non-Executive

Directors, the Senior Independent 
Director and the Chairman, rather 
than the Remuneration Committee.
Remuneration of Executive 
Directors
The Executive Directors are entitled to 
receive base salary, benefits, employer 
pension contributions and to participate 
in share option schemes approved by 
the Remuneration Committee.
The appointment of the Chief Executive 
Officer and the Chief Financial Officer is 
terminable on six months’ notice by 
either party.
Base salary
Base salaries are reviewed annually and 
adjustments made if required to reflect 
Group performance, individual performance 
and market rates. Remuneration is through 
the Group’s flexible benefits scheme under 
which the individuals can elect to switch 
basic salary into pension contributions 
and other benefits.
Benefits
The Group offers benefits to all employees 
including life assurance and healthcare 
solutions, appropriate to each of the 
markets in which it operates.
Bonuses
Executive Directors are eligible to participate 
in an annual bonus programme, which is 
calculated by reference to the annual 
financial targets of the Group and the 
achievement of strategic goals set by 
the Remuneration Committee.
Pensions
The Group operates a defined contribution 
personal pension scheme. Under the 
scheme rules the Group pays a matched 
contribution of up to 5% of base salary as 
adjusted for current pension legislation. 
The scheme is open to Executive 
Directors and employees.
Remuneration of Non-Executive 
Directors
The Non-Executive Directors have 
entered into letters of appointment 
with the Company. The appointments 
are terminable on one month’s notice 
by  either party. The Non-Executive 
Directors, including the Non-Executive 
Chairman, may participate in the 
Group’s pension scheme.
The appointment of the Non-Executive 
Chairman is terminable on three months’ 
notice by either party.  33 Ubisense Group plc Annual Report 2017

DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES STATEMENT
The Directors are responsible for 
preparing the Annual Report and the 
financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to 
prepare financial statements for each 
financial year. Under that law the Directors 
are required to prepare the consolidated 
financial statements in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRSs) as adopted by the European 
Union and have elected to prepare the 
parent company financial statements in 
accordance with United Kingdom 
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice 
(United Kingdom Accounting Standards 
and applicable law, including FRS 102 
‘The Financial Reporting Standard’ 
applicable in the UK and Republic of 
Ireland). Under company law the 
directors must not approve the financial 
statements unless they give a true and 
fair view of the state of affairs and profit 
or loss of the Company and Group for 
that period. In preparing these financial 
statements, the Directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies 
and then apply them consistently;
• make judgements and estimates that 
are reasonable and prudent;
• state whether applicable IFRSs as 
adopted by the European Union have 
been followed, subject to any material 
departures disclosed and explained in 
the consolidated financial statements;
• state whether applicable UK Accounting 
Standards have been followed, subject 
to any material departures disclosed 
and explained in the Company 
financial statements; and
• prepare the financial statements on 
the going concern basis unless it is 
inappropriate to presume that the 
Company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping 
adequate accounting records that are 
sufficient to show and explain the 
Company’s transactions and disclose 
with reasonable accuracy at any time 
the financial position of the Company 
and enable them to ensure that the 
financial statements comply with the 
Companies Act 2006. They are also 
responsible for safeguarding the assets 
of the Company and hence for taking 
reasonable steps for the prevention and 
detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors confirm that:
• so far as each Director is aware, there 
is no relevant audit information of 
which the companies auditor is 
unaware; and 
• the Directors have taken all the steps 
they ought to have taken as Directors 
in order to make themselves aware of 
any relevant audit information and to 
establish that the companies auditor 
is aware of that information.
The Directors are responsible for the 
maintenance and integrity of the corporate 
and financial information included on 
the Company’s website. Legislation 
in the United Kingdom governing 
the preparation and dissemination of 
financial statements may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions.  35 Ubisense Group plc Annual Report 2017

Opinion
Our opinion on the financial statements is unmodified
We have audited the financial statements of Ubisense Group plc (the ‘Parent Company’) and its subsidiaries (the ‘Group’) for 
the year ended 31 December 2017 which comprise the Consolidated Income Statement, the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive 
Income, the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity, the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position, the Consolidated 
Statement of Cash Flows and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies. The financial 
reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the Group financial statements is applicable law and International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union. The financial reporting framework that has been applied 
in the preparation of the Parent Company financial statements is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards, including 
Financial Reporting Standard 102 ‘The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland’ (United Kingdom 
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
In our opinion:
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the Parent Company’s affairs as at 
31 December 2017 and of the Group’s loss for the year then ended;
• the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union;
• the Parent Company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice; and
• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our responsibilities 
under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our 
report. We are independent of the Group and the Parent Company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant 
to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical Standard as applied to listed entities, and we have 
fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have 
obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Who we are reporting to
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 
2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members those matters we are required to 
state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume 
responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for 
the opinions we have formed.
Conclusions relating to going concern
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the ISAs (UK) require us to report to you where:
• the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is not appropriate; or
• the directors have not disclosed in the financial statements any identified material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt 
about the Group’s or the Parent Company’s ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting for a period of 
at least twelve months from the date when the financial statements are authorised for issue.
Overview of our audit approach
• Overall Group materiality: £271,000, which represents 1% of the Group’s revenue excluding rental income;
• We performed full scope procedures at Ubisense Group plc, Ubisense Limited, Ubisense Inc.; 
targeted procedures on Ubisense Solutions Inc, Ubisense GmbH, Ubisense Inc (Japan), Geoplan Co. 
Limited; analytical procedures were performed for all other components; and
• Key audit matters were identified as 
• improper recognition of revenue due to fraud; 
• the capitalisation of intangible development costs may not be appropriate; and 
• impairment of the carrying value of capitalised development costs.

Key audit matters
The graph below depicts the audit risks identified and their relative significance based on the extent of the financial statement 
impact and the extent of management judgement. 
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial 
statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to 
fraud) that we identified. These matters included those that had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the allocation of 
resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of 
the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
Key Audit Matter – Group How the matter was addressed in the audit – Group 
Improper recognition of revenue due to fraud
Under International Standard on Auditing (UK) 240 ‘The Auditor’s 
Responsibilities Relating to Fraud in an Audit of Financial Statements’, 
there is a rebuttable presumed risk that revenue may be misstated 
due to the improper recognition of revenue due to fraud.
The Group has recognised revenues of £27.3m (2016: £26.5m) 
in the year. Whilst the Group is organised into two divisions, 
revenue comprises sales of hardware, software, maintenance 
and support and labour and installation services. The nature 
of the Group’s revenue involves the processing of numerous 
transactions, with each stream possessing different revenue 
recognition criteria.
As the Group’s revenue is material to the financial statements, 
comprises various streams and is subject to different recognition 
policies, the presumed risk of improper recognition of revenue 
due to fraud has been identified as a significant risk, which 
was one of the most significant assessed risks of 
material misstatement.
We have ensured the occurrence of revenue by selecting a 
sample of sales orders from the four revenue streams and 
testing as follows:
Hardware – agreement to signed contracts or shipping 
documentation to ensure occurrence 
Software – agreement to customer confirmation of receipt for 
new licences, or purchase orders for renewed licences. 
Where no purchase orders are received we have agreed the 
invoices to cash receipt 
Maintenance and support – obtained purchase orders, 
recalculated revenue recognised and verified the 
appropriateness of any deferred income at the year end 
Labour and installation services – agreement to signed 
contracts or purchase orders. Percentage completion workings 
were obtained and verified to timesheets, subcontractor 
invoices or other supporting documentation. The appropriateness 
of any deferred or accrued income balances was verified by 
recalculating revenue recognised to date against invoices and 
other supporting documentation.

Improper recognition of revenue due to fraud –  
continued
Other audit work included, but was not restricted to: 
• the testing of revenue recognition policies for consistency 
and compliance with relevant accounting standards;
• analytical procedures over revenue in total disaggregated 
by revenue stream, operating segment, location and month 
(month by month analysis of current year against prior year 
revenue) to identify and analyse key movements and 
significant transactions which have occurred in the year;
• obtaining explanations and corroborating evidence for 
key movements and significant transactions identified. 
 The Group’s accounting policy on revenue recognition is 
disclosed in note 3 to the financial statements and related 
disclosures are included in note 5. 
Key observations
Our testing did not identify any material misstatements in the 
revenue recognised during the year or any instances of revenue 
not being recognised in accordance with stated accounting policies
Capitalisation of intangible development costs may 
not be appropriate
Under IAS 38 ‘Intangible Assets’, development costs must be 
capitalised if the recognition criteria is met, including determining 
whether the project provides a future economic benefit to the Group. 
This presents a risk that development costs are incorrectly capitalised.
During the year, the Group has capitalised £1.6m (2016: £1.9m) 
in development costs in relation to various projects. 
The capitalisation of these costs is subject to specific recognition 
criteria, as set forth in IAS 38, which includes the judgments and 
assumption involved in determining whether the projects will 
provide future economic benefit to the Group and be financially 
viable. This leads to a risk that these criteria may not be met.
Due also to the materiality of the balance, the capitalisation of 
intangible development costs has been identified as a significant 
risk, which was one of the most significant assessed risks of 
material misstatement. 
Our audit work included, but was not restricted to: 
• assessing product development activities alongside the 
qualifying nature of the projects to ensure that capitalisation 
is in accordance with the appropriate criteria under IAS 38; 
and
• detailed substantive testing on capitalised labour cost 
additions in the year has been performed, tracing 
employee costs to supporting documentation, including 
timesheets and salary data.
The Group’s accounting policy on intangible assets is shown 
in note 3 to the financial statements and related disclosures 
are included in note 11. 
Key observations
Our testing did not identify any material misstatements in the 
capitalisation of intangible development costs in accordance 
with IAS 38. Intangibles capitalised were found to be in 
accordance with stated accounting policies.

Financial statements
Key Audit Matter – Group How the matter was addressed in the audit – Group 
Carrying value of capitalised development costs may 
not be appropriate
There is a risk, due to the degree of uncertainty involved in 
forecasting and discounting future cash flows associated with 
development projects, that development assets may be impaired.
The net book value of capitalised development costs at the year 
end amounted to £2.7m (2016: £3.3m), including amortisation 
charged on capitalised development costs of £2.2m (2016: £2.6m). 
These costs are amortised by the company to ensure the capitalised 
cost reflects the anticipated benefit of the development project 
to the Group over time. In accordance with IAS 36, ‘Impairment 
of Assets’, an annual review is required to assess whether there 
is any indication that assets may be impaired. Due to the financial 
performance of the group, an impairment review has been performed 
by management to determine whether the carrying value of 
these assets is appropriate.
The impairment review is based on identifiable assets for which 
future revenues and gross margins can be assigned to calculate 
a value in use based on a discounted cash flow model. Management’s 
assessment of the potential impairment of the Group’s development 
costs incorporates key assumptions over the timing and extent 
of future revenues, gross margin and the discount rate used.
Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in forecasting and 
discounting future cash flows, we therefore identified the 
impairment of the carrying value of capitalised development 
costs as a significant risk, which was one of the most significant 
assessed risks of material misstatement.
Our audit work included, but was not restricted to: 
• assessing the amortisation policy applied against capitalised 
development costs for consistency with prior year and 
adequacy of the useful economic life; 
• comparing projects against which amounts are capitalised to 
the net present value calculations, produced by management, 
based on future income generation the technology will realise; 
• checking the mathematical accuracy of the impairment models;
• testing the accuracy of management’s estimates used in 
the net present value calculations by comparing the 2017 
budgeted sales and gross profit to the results achieved for 
the year and performing sensitivity analysis of expected 
revenue for 2018 onwards;
• evaluating the sensitivity of the discount rate applied 
to future cash flow;
• discussing and corroborating the ongoing viability of 
projects with relevant Group personnel; and
• assessing management’s review of possible impairment 
of intangible assets and challenging the basis of key 
assumptions used.
The Group’s accounting policy on intangible assets is 
disclosed in note 3 to the financial statements and related 
disclosures are included in note 11. 
Key observations
Our testing did not identify any material misstatements in the 
carrying value of the capitalised development costs and any 
reasons for impairment of intangible assets or additional factors 
to consider that would impact the carrying value of intangible 
assets recognised within the financial statements and we 
found no material errors in the calculations.
We did not identify any Key Audit Matters relating to the audit of the financial statements of the Parent Company. 40 Ubisense Group plc Annual Report 2017

Our application of materiality
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements that makes it probable that the economic 
decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced. We use materiality in determining the nature, 
timing and extent of our audit work and in evaluating the results of that work. 
Materiality was determined as follows:
Materiality measure Group Parent
Financial statements as a whole £271,000 which is 1% of the Group revenue 
excluding rental income for the year. 
This benchmark is considered the most 
appropriate because the Group is a 
commercially focused organisation 
with fluctuating results.
Materiality for the current year is higher 
than the level that we determined for the 
year ended 31 December 2016 using the 
same basis.
£203,000 which is 1% of expected total 
assets restricted to Group performance 
materiality. This benchmark is considered 
the most appropriate because the Parent 
Company does not generate revenues or 
profits and holds investments in subsidiaries.
Materiality for the current year is higher 
than the level that we determined for the 
year ended 31 December 2016 using the 
same basis.
Performance materiality used to drive 
the extent of our testing
75% of financial statement materiality. 75% of financial statement materiality.

We also determine a lower level of specific

An overview of the scope of our audit
Our audit approach was a risk-based approach founded on a thorough understanding of the Group’s business, its environment 
and risk profile and in particular included:
• evaluation by the Group audit team of identified components to assess the significance of that component and to determine 
the planned audit response based on a measure of materiality. Significance was determined as a percentage of the Group’s 
total assets, revenues and profit before taxation; 
• full scope audit procedures performed at Ubisense Group plc, Ubisense Limited and Ubisense Inc, targeted procedures 
performed at Ubisense GmbH, Ubisense Solutions Inc, Ubisense Inc (Japan) and Geoplan Co. Limited, and analytical 
procedures performed at all other components; 
• component auditors were used to complete audit procedures for Ubisense GmbH, Ubisense Inc (Japan) and Geoplan Co. Limited. 
The Group audit team sent Group instructions to the component auditors as to the required procedures to be completed over 
the significant areas for Group purposes within each component. The Group audit team reviewed the underlying audit working 
papers for these significant areas; 
• the total percentage coverage of full-scope and targeted procedures over the Group’s revenue was 100%; 
• the total percentage coverage of full scope and targeted procedures over the Group’s total assets was 96%; and
• our audit approach in the current year is consistent with the audit approach adopted for the year ended 31 December 2016 
being substantive in nature. 41 Ubisense Group plc Annual Report 2017
Financial statements
Other information
The directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the annual 
report set out on pages 1 to 34, other than the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon. Our opinion on the financial 
statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not 
express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. 
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether 
the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to 
be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine 
whether there is a material misstatement in the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other information. If, based on the 
work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. 
We have nothing to report in this regard.
Our opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006 is unmodified
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:
• the information given in the strategic report and the directors’ report for the financial year for which the financial statements 
are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and
• the strategic report and the directors’ report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.
Matters on which we are required to report under the Companies Act 2006
In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and the Parent Company and its environment obtained in the 
course of the audit, we have not identified material misstatements in the strategic report or the directors’ report. 
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report 
to you if, in our opinion:
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been 
received from branches not visited by us; or
• the Parent Company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
• certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit 
Responsibilities of directors for the financial statements
As explained more fully in the directors’ responsibilities statement set out on page 34, the directors are responsible for the preparation of 
the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the directors determine 
is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s and the Parent Company’s ability to continue 
as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the 
directors either intend to liquidate the Group or the Parent Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is 
a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material 
misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, 
they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting Council’s 
website at: www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor’s report.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1 General information
Ubisense Group plc (“the Company”) and its subsidiaries (together, “the Group”) deliver Enterprise Location Intelligence solutions 
that enable customers with complex operations to track the precise location of assets across their business in real-time to deliver 
operational efficiencies, increase flexibility, quality, and reduce costs. We offer in-depth knowledge of the sectors in which we 
operate and have long-standing relationships with many of our customers across target markets including automotive, aerospace, 
communications and utilities. 
The Company is a public limited company which is listed on the Alternative Investment Market (“AIM”) of the London Stock Exchange 
(UBI) and is incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom. The value of Ubisense Group plc shares, as quoted on the 
London Stock Exchange at 31 December 2017, was 45 pence per share (31 December 2016: 41.5 pence).
The Company was incorporated as Ubisense Trading Limited on 11 October 2005 and changed its name to Ubisense Group plc 
on 31 May 2011 ahead of its initial public offering and listing on AIM on 22 June 2011. The address of its registered office is 
St. Andrew’s House, St. Andrew’s Road, Chesterton, Cambridge, CB4 1DL.
The Group has its main operations in the UK, USA, Canada, Germany, France and Japan and sells its products and services 
mainly in North America, Europe and Asia. The Group legally consists of ten companies headed by Ubisense Group plc. A full list 
of subsidiaries is given in note 22 of the financial statements.
The consolidated financial statements have been approved for issue by the Board of Directors on 14 March 2018.
2 New accounting standards
For the purposes of the preparation of the consolidated financial statements, the Group has applied all standards and 
interpretations as adopted in the European Union that are effective for accounting periods beginning on or before 1 January 2017. 
The accounting policies used are the same as set out in detail in the Report and Accounts 2016 and have been applied consistently 
to all periods presented in the financial statements. No new standards or amendments or interpretations to existing standards that 
became effective during the year were material to the Group. No new standards, amendments or interpretations to existing 
standards having an impact on the financial statements that have been published and that are mandatory for the Group’s 
accounting periods beginning on or before 1 January 2018, or later periods, have been adopted early. 
Standards and interpretations not yet applied by the Group 
The following new Standards and Interpretations, which are yet to become mandatory, have not been applied in the Group’s 
financial statements. 
• IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’ (effective date financial year commencing on/after 1 January 2018)
• IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from contracts with customers’ (effective date financial year commencing on/after 1 January 2018)
• IFRS 16 ‘Leases’ (effective date financial year commencing on/after 1 January 2019)
IFRS 9
The Directors are of the opinion, that the application of IFRS 9 will not have a significant impact, other than increased disclosures, 
on the financial statements of the Group.
IFRS 15
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers will replace IAS 18 Revenue. The new standard is applicable from 1 January 2018. 
IFRS 15 introduces a number of new concepts and requirements relating to revenue recognition, and also provides guidance and 
clarification on existing practice.
For sales within the RTLS SmartSpace division, the Group contracts with customers to provide software, maintenance & support, 
hardware or services. The contractual arrangements may be to provide one of these elements on a standalone basis or to provide 
a combination of products and services. Currently, software licence revenue is recognised at the point the software is delivered to 
the customer, hardware is recognised on dispatch to the customer, maintenance and services are recognised over the term of the 
agreement on a straight line basis and installation and consultancy services are recognised as the service is performed.
For sales connected to the myWorld product, the Group contracts with customers to provide software, maintenance & support, or 
services. The contractual arrangements may be to provide one of these elements on a standalone basis or to provide a combination 
of the products and services. Currently, software licence revenue is recognised at the point the software is delivered to the customer 
provided that only configuration is required. Maintenance and service revenues are recognised over the term of the agreement on a 
straight line basis. Consultancy and customisation services are recognised as the service is performed.
The majority of Ubisense’s sales are for products sold on a standalone basis and it is expected that the revenue recognition policy 
applied to these sales will be unaffected by the application of IFRS 15. Larger, more complex contracts, which involve multiple 
performance obligations that include a combination of products and services, are affected by the application of IFRS 15. 
Accordingly, the significance of the impact of IFRS 15 is dependent upon the timing of the delivery of performance obligations 
within complex contracts close to a financial reporting period end. The key area under review is the number of distinct 
performance obligations for sales which include a combination of some or all of the above products and services.  NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued
48 Ubisense Group plc Annual Report 2017
2 New accounting standards continued
IFRS 15 continued
Under IFRS 15, the Group must evaluate the performance obligations for the promised goods or services to identify whether the 
products and/or services are distinct. A promised good or service is distinct if both the customer benefits from the item either 
on its own or together with other readily available resources and it is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract 
(i.e. the Group does not provide a significant service integrating, modifying or customising it). The details of the performance 
obligations within complex contracts with a combination of goods and services is currently being assessed, and will be 
considered further to ensure an accurate conclusion is reached. The financial impact of the adoption of IFRS 15 will be 
disclosed within the interim results to 30 June 2018.
IFRS 16
IFRS 16 Leases will replace IAS 17 and three related interpretations. Leases will be recorded on the statement of financial position in 
the form of a right-of-use asset and a lease liability. The consolidated income statement will be impacted through reduced 
operating expenses, and higher depreciation and finance costs. The new standard is applicable from 1 January 2019 with an option 
to adopt it early. The Group intend to early adopt IFRS 16 from 1 January 2018 alongside IFRS 15 Revenue.
The Group leases all of the premises from which it conducts business with annual commitments under operating leases totalling 
£0.7 million. Application of IFRS 16 will result in the Group no longer recognising rental expense associated with the leased 
premises within operating expenses in the consolidated income statement. The Group will recognise a right-of-use asset in 
respect of the leasehold premises within the consolidated statement of financial position alongside a liability for the leasehold 
commitments, and depreciation and finance costs in the consolidated income statement. Accordingly, total assets will increase 
as will total liabilities. Additionally, the Group leases other assets including motor vehicles, however, the impact of application of 
IFRS 16 to these leases will not be material.
3 Summary of significant accounting policies
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are set out below. These policies 
have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated. 
Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements of Ubisense Group plc have been prepared in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as adopted by the European Union (IFRSs as adopted by the EU) and the Companies Act 2006 
applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical 
cost convention. The consolidated financial statements are presented in GBP and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand 
pounds (£’000) except when otherwise indicated.
The preparation of these financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the Directors to make certain critical accounting 
estimates and judgements that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. The areas 
involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated 
financial statements, are disclosed in note 4.
Going concern basis
The Group’s business activities, together with factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position are set out 
in the Strategic report and Directors’ report on pages 1 to 31.
In determining the basis for preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Directors are required to consider whether the 
Company can continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future, being a period of not less than twelve months from the 
date of the approval of the consolidated financial statements.  Financial statements
49 Ubisense Group plc Annual Report 2017
3 Summary of significant accounting policies continued
Going concern basis continued
The Group had cash of £9.1 million at the balance sheet date. As disclosed in note 17, the Group amended the terms of it’s HSBC 
loan in November 2017, with covenants requiring £750,000 repayable on or before each of 31 December 2017 and 31 January 
2018 and then £187,500 each quarter starting on 31 March 2019. The amended financial covenant on operating cash flow before 
working capital adjustments is £2 million negative in 2017, £2 million negative in 2018, £1 million negative in 2019 and £1 million 
positive from 2020 onwards. The balance of this facility as at 31 December 2017 was £2.5 million. 
Management prepares detailed working capital forecasts which are reviewed by the Board on a regular basis. The forecasts 
include assumptions regarding the opportunity funnel from both existing and new clients, growth plans, risks and mitigating 
actions. In particular, operating cashflow and profitability are highly sensitive to revenue mix and the positive contribution of 
continuing growth in software sales.
In reaching their going concern conclusion, the Directors have considered the following points:
• The Group had cash, net of debt of £6.6 million as at 31 December 2017.
• It is not anticipated that the Group will breach the covenants of the existing working capital facility which are described in note 17.
• The Group has met the next repayment instalment of £0.75 million during January 2018 and no further capital repayments are 
due within the next 12 months.
The Group’s forecasts and projections, taking account of reasonably possible changes in trading performance, support the conclusion 
that there is a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future, a period of not less than twelve months from the date of this report. The Group, therefore, 
continues to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
Consolidation
The Group financial statements include the results, financial position and cash flows of the Company and all of its subsidiary undertakings. 
Subsidiary undertakings are those entities controlled directly or indirectly by the Company. Control arises when the Company has 
the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity, uses this power to affect the returns from that entity and has 
exposure to variable returns from its investment in the entity. 
Co-terminus financial statements of the subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting year as the Company, using consistent 
accounting policies. Businesses acquired or disposed during the year are accounted for using acquisition method principles from, 
or up to, the date control passed. Intra-group transactions and balances are eliminated on consolidation. All subsidiaries use 
uniform accounting policies for like transactions and other events and similar circumstances. 
Non-controlling interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries are identified separately from the Group’s equity therein. 
Non-controlling interests consist of the amount of those interests at the date of the original business combination and the 
non-controlling interest’s share of changes in equity since the date of combination. 
Foreign currencies
a. Functional and presentation currency 
The functional currency of each Group entity is the currency of the primary economic environment in which each entity operates. 
The consolidated financial statements are presented in GBP.
b. Transactions and balances
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency of each Group entity using the exchange rates prevailing 
at the dates of transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at rates ruling at the 
period end date. Such exchange differences are included in the income statement within “operating expenses”. Non-monetary 
items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates as at the dates 
of the initial transactions.
c. Consolidation
For the purpose of presenting consolidated financial statements, the results and financial position of all the Group entities (none 
of which have the currency of a hyperinflationary economy) that have a functional currency other than GBP are translated into 
GBP as follows:
• assets and liabilities for each statement of financial position are translated at the exchange rate at the period end date;
• income and expenses for each income statement are translated at the exchange rate ruling at the time of each period the 
transaction occurred; and
• all resulting exchange differences are recognised in other comprehensive income. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued
50 Ubisense Group plc Annual Report 2017
3 Summary of significant accounting policies continued
Segment reporting
IFRS 8 requires a “management approach” under which information in the financial statements is presented on the same basis 
as that used for internal management reporting purposes.
The Group is organised on a global basis into two operating segments based on the Group’s divisions: RTLS SmartSpace and 
Geospatial. The Directors believe that the Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) is the Chief Executive Officer of the Group. 
The CODM and the rest of the Board are provided with information on a divisional basis to assess the financial performance of, 
and allocate resources to, each division and central resources. 
The internal management accounting information is prepared on an IFRS basis but has a non-GAAP “Adjusted EBITDA” as the 
primary measure of profit and this is reported on the face of the income statement. 
Revenue recognition
Revenue represents amounts derived from the provision of goods and services which fall within the Group’s ordinary activities, 
exclusive of discounts, value added tax and other similar sales taxes. Revenue is measured by reference to the fair value of 
consideration received or receivable.
Revenues on product sales are recognised at the time that units are shipped, except for shipments under arrangements involving 
significant acceptance requirements. Under such arrangements, revenue is recognised when the Group has substantially met all 
its performance obligations.
Revenue earned from sales under licence agreements is recognised when the software is made available. When the sale 
includes a period of support and maintenance, a proportion of the revenue is deferred and recognised straight line over the 
period of support. For licence rental fees, amounts are recognised over the period of the contract, commencing from when the 
software is available for use.
Services and training revenue from time and materials contracts is recognised in the period that the services and training are 
provided on the basis of time worked at agreed contractual rates and as direct expenses are incurred.
Revenue from fixed price, long-term customer specific contracts, including customisation and modification, is recognised on the 
stage of completion of each assignment at the period end date compared to the total estimated service to be provided over the 
entire contract where the outcome can be estimated reliably. If a contract outcome cannot be estimated reliably, revenues are 
recognised equal to costs incurred, to the extent that costs are expected to be recovered. An expected loss on a contract is 
recognised immediately in the income statement.
Where bundled sales including a combination of some or all of the above are made, the revenue attributable to the deal is apportioned 
across the constituents of the bundle, and then recognised according to the policies stated above.
Employee benefits
a. Retirement benefits
The Group operates various defined contribution pension arrangements for its employees.
For defined contribution pension arrangements, the amount charged to the income statement represents the contributions 
payable in the period. Differences between contributions payable in the period and contributions actually paid are shown as 
either accruals or prepayments in the statement of financial position.
b. Share-based payments
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees. Vesting conditions are continuing employment and 
can include, for senior employees, a diluted EPS performance target or share price target. Equity-settled share-based payments 
are measured at fair value at the date of grant using an appropriate pricing model. The fair value is expensed on a straight-line 
basis over the vesting period, together with a corresponding increase in equity in the share-based payment reserve, based on 
the Group’s estimate of the number of shares that will eventually vest. 
Operating lease income and expense
The Group as the lessor
a. Rental income
Rental income from operating leases is recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease. Initial direct costs 
incurred in negotiating the lease are recognised straight-line over the lease term. Rental income is presented within the 
Geospatial division within note 5.
The Group as the lessee
b. Rental expense
Operating lease rentals are charged as operating expenses to the income statement in equal annual amounts over the lease 
term. Assets leased under operating leases are not recorded in the statement of financial position because the lessor retains 
a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership.  Financial statements
51 Ubisense Group plc Annual Report 2017
3 Summary of significant accounting policies continued
Operating lease income and expense continued
c. Lease incentives
The benefit of lease incentives such as rent-free periods or up-front cash payments are spread equally on a straight-line basis 
over the lease term. 
Non-recurring items
Non-recurring items are disclosed separately in the financial statements where it is necessary to do so to provide further 
understanding of the financial performance of the Group. They are material one-off items of income or expense that have 
been shown separately due to the significance of their nature or amount and do not reflect the ongoing cost base or 
revenue-generating ability of the Group.
Interest income and expense
Interest income and expense is included in the income statement on a time basis, using the effective interest method by reference 
to the principal outstanding.
Tax 
The tax charge or credit comprises current tax payable and deferred tax:
a. Current tax
The current tax charge represents an estimate of the amounts payable or receivable to or from tax authorities in respect of the 
Group’s taxable profits and is based on an interpretation of existing tax laws. Taxable profit differs from profit before tax as reported 
in the income statement because it excludes certain items of income and expense that are taxable or deductible in other years or 
are never taxable or deductible. Taxation received is recognised only when it is probable that the Group is entitled to the asset.
b. Deferred tax
Deferred income taxes are calculated using the liability method on temporary differences. This involves the comparison of the 
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements with their respective tax bases. In addition, tax 
losses available to be carried forward as well as other income tax credits to the Group are assessed for recognition as deferred 
tax assets. However, deferred tax is not provided on the initial recognition of goodwill, nor on the initial recognition of an asset 
or liability, unless the related transaction is a business combination or affects tax or accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are always provided in full. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that the 
underlying deductible temporary differences will be able to be offset against future taxable income. Deferred tax assets and 
liabilities are calculated, without discounting, at tax rates that are expected to apply to their respective period of realisation, 
provided they are enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date. Deferred tax is recognised as a component of tax 
expense in the income statement, except where it relates to items charged or credited directly to other comprehensive income 
or equity when it is recognised in other comprehensive income or equity.
Business combinations
The Group applies the acquisition method to account for business combinations. The consideration transferred for the acquisition 
of a subsidiary is the fair values of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred to the former owners of the acquiree and the equity 
interests issued by the Group. The consideration transferred includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent 
consideration arrangement. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination 
are measured initially at their provisional fair values at the acquisition date. Fair values are reassessed during the measurement 
period and updated if required. The Group recognises any non-controlling interest in the acquiree on an acquisition-by-acquisition 
basis, either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest’s proportionate share of the recognised amounts of the acquiree’s 
identifiable net assets. 
If the business combination is achieved in stages, the acquisition date fair value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest in 
the acquiree is remeasured to fair value at the acquisition date through profit or loss.
Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the Group is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. Subsequent 
changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration that is deemed to be an asset or liability is recognised in accordance 
with IAS 39 either in profit or loss or as a change to other comprehensive income. Contingent consideration that is classified as 
equity is not remeasured and its subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity.
Goodwill
Goodwill is initially measured as the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred and the fair value of non-controlling 
interest over the net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. If this consideration is lower than the fair value of the net 
assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognised in profit or loss.
Goodwill arising on an acquisition of a business is the difference between the fair value of the consideration paid and the net fair 
value of the assets and liabilities acquired. Goodwill is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued

Research and development
Expenditure on research activities is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.
Development activities involve a plan or design for the production of new or substantially improved products and processes. 
Development expenditure is only capitalised if all of the following conditions are met:
• completion of the intangible asset is technically feasible so that it will be available for use or sale;
• the Group intends to complete the intangible asset and use or sell it;
• the Group has the ability to use or sell the intangible asset;
• the intangible asset will generate probable future economic benefits. Among other things, this requires that there is a market 
for the output from the intangible asset or for the intangible asset itself, or, if it is to be used internally, the asset will be used 
in generating such benefits;
• there are adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the intangible 
asset; and
• the expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during its development can be measured reliably.
Internally-generated intangible assets, consisting mainly of direct labour costs, are amortised on a straight-line basis over their 
useful economic lives. Amortisation is shown within administrative expenses in the income statement. The estimated useful lives 
of current development projects are three years. Upon completion the assets are subject to impairment testing. 
Where no internally-generated intangible asset can be recognised, development expenditure is recognised as an expense in the 
period in which it is incurred.
Other intangible assets
Intangible assets that are purchased separately, such as software licences that do not form an integral part of related hardware, 
are capitalised at cost and amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful economic life which is typically 3 years. 
Acquired intangible assets
Intangible assets acquired through a business combination are initially measured at fair value and amortised on a straight line 
basis over their useful economic lives. Amortisation is shown within operating expenses in the income statement. All acquired 
intangibles were fully amortised or impaired as at 31 December 2016 and 2017.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment loss. 
Depreciation is charged to the income statement so as to write off the cost or valuation less estimated residual values over their 
expected useful lives on a straight-line basis over the following periods:
• Fixtures and fittings: three to ten years, or period of the lease if shorter
• Computer equipment: three years
Residual values and useful economic lives are assessed annually. The gain or loss on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined 
as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in operating expenses.
Impairment of non-financial assets
Assets that have an indefinite useful life – for example, goodwill or intangible assets not ready to use – are not subject to 
amortisation and are tested at least annually for impairment and whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired. 
Assets that are subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that 
the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. 
The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value in use. For the purposes of assessing 
impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows (cash-generating units). 
Impairment losses are recognised immediately in profit or loss.
Non-financial assets other than goodwill that suffered an impairment are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at each 
reporting date. Where an impairment loss is reversed, it is reversed to the extent that the increased carrying amount does not 
exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised in prior years. A reversal 
of an impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is the actual cost of third-party components and labour, 
and is applied on a first in, first out basis. Net realisable value is based on estimated selling price less additional cost to completion 
and disposal. Provision is made for obsolete, slow moving or defective items where appropriate and are recognised as an expense 
in the period in which the write-down or loss occurs. Financial statements

Trade receivables
Trade receivables are amounts due from customers for products sold or services performed in the ordinary course of business. 
If collection is expected in one year or less, they are classified as current assets. If not, they are presented as non-current assets.
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest 
method, less provision for impairment.
Cash and cash equivalents
In the consolidated statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks 
and other short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.
Trade payables
Trade payables are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of business from 
suppliers. Accounts payable are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year or less. If not, they are presented 
as non-current liabilities.
Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Borrowings
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently carried at amortised 
cost; any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement 
over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.
All borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement in the period they are incurred.
Share capital and share premium
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown 
in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds. The nominal value of shares issued is classified as share capital and the 
amounts paid over the nominal value in respect of share issues, net of related costs, is classified as share premium.
Share-based payment reserve
The share-based payment reserve relates to a cumulative charge made in respect of share options granted by the Company to 
the Group’s employees under its employee share option plans.
Translation reserve
Exchange differences relating to the translation of the results and net assets of the Group’s foreign operations from their functional 
currencies to the Group’s presentation currency of GBP, are recognised directly in other comprehensive income and accumulated 
in the translation reserve.
Retained earnings
Retained Earnings include all current and prior period retained profits/losses. 
Non-controlling interests
Non-controlling interests, presented as part of equity, represent a proportion of a subsidiary’s profit or loss and net assets that is 
not held by the Group. The Group attributes total comprehensive income or loss of subsidiaries between the assets of the parent 
and the non-controlling interests based on their respective ownership interests. 
4 Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation and uncertainty
The Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future. The resulting accounting estimates will, by definition, seldom 
equal the related actual results. The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the 
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are addressed below.
Capitalisation, amortisation and impairment of development costs
The point at which development costs meet the criteria for capitalisation is critically dependent on management’s judgement of 
the point at which technical and commercial feasibility is demonstrable. The carrying amount of capitalised development costs at 
31 December 2017 is £2.7 million (2016: £3.3 million).
Capitalised development costs are amortised over a three years period which is management’s estimate of the useful lives of 
current development projects. In reaching this conclusion, management have made assumptions in respect of future customer 
requirements and developments within the industry.
The Group tests capitalised development costs for impairment annually in accordance with the accounting policy stated in note 3. 
In performing the impairment review, management is required to make assumptions of the future cash flows generated from the 
SmartSpace and myWorld products. This includes consideration of both the current business pipeline and estimations beyond the 
existing pipeline. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued
54 Ubisense Group plc Annual Report 2017
4 Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation and uncertainty continued
Revenue recognition
Significant management judgement is applied in determining the allocation and timing of the recognition of revenue on fixed 
price, long-term customer specific contracts. In this process management takes into account milestones, hardware supplied, 
actual work performed, and further obligations and costs expected to complete the work. The carrying value of amounts 
recoverable on contracts at 31 December 2017 is £2.7 million (2016: £2.9 million).
Inventories
The provision for obsolete, slow-moving or defective inventory is based on management’s estimation of the commercial life of 
inventory lines and is applied on a prudent basis. In assessing this, management takes into consideration the sales history of 
products and the length of time that they have been available for resale.
Deferred tax
A deferred tax asset is recognised where the Group considers it probable that future tax profits will be available against which the 
tax credit will be utilised in the future. This specifically applies to tax losses and to outstanding vested share options at the statement 
of financial position date. In estimating the amount of the deferred tax asset that should be recognised, the Directors make judgements 
based on current budgets and forecasts about the amount of future taxable profits and the timings of when these will be realised. 
No deferred tax asset is currently recognised.
5 Segment information
5.1 Operating segments
Management has determined the operating segments to be the Group’s divisions based on the information reported to the 
Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) for the purpose of assessing performance and allocating resources. The CODM is 
the Chief Executive Officer. 
The Real-Time Location Systems (RTLS) division takes real-time location data from Ubisense’s own sensing hardware, or from 
standards based integration with third party hardware, and transforms this data into high value spatial event information, 
delivering highly reliable, automatic, adaptive asset identification, precise real-time location and spatial-monitoring to offer 
meaningful insights that help businesses make smarter decisions. 
The Geospatial division delivers software solutions that integrate data from any source – geographic, real-time asset, GPS, location, 
corporate and external cloud-based sources – into a live geospatial common operating picture, empowering all users in the 
customer’s organisation to access, input and analyse operational intelligence to proactively manage their networks, respond 
quickly to emergency events and effectively manage day-to-day operations.
Each operating segment is managed separately by a business unit leader as each deals with different technologies and predominately 
a different customer base. The performance of the operating segments is assessed on a measure of contribution, being gross profit 
less sales and business unit marketing expenditure. Assets and liabilities are not presented to the CODM on a divisional basis.
Costs incurred centrally or not directly attributable to either the RTLS or Geospatial divisions are reported in the Central division. 
The results of each segment are prepared using accounting policies consistent with those of the Group as a whole. 
No intra-segmental transactions are reported.

9.2 Factors that may affect future tax charges
The Group has tax losses of £24.5 million (2016: £17.6 million) that are available for offset against future taxable profits of those 
subsidiary companies in which the tax losses arose. Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of these losses as 
they may not be used to offset taxable profits elsewhere in the Group, and they have arisen in subsidiaries whose future taxable 
profits are uncertain. No deferred tax has been recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries, because the 
earnings are continually reinvested by the Group and no tax is expected to be payable on them in the foreseeable future.
On 26 October 2015, the UK Government substantially enacted reductions to the UK corporation tax rates. Effective from 1 April 
2020, the rate will further reduce to 18%. The deferred tax balances have been measured at 19%, the rate of realisation expected.

Basic EPS (pence) (5.2) (10.4)
Diluted EPS (pence) (5.2) (10.4)
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing profit/(loss) for the period attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company 
by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period. For diluted earnings per share, the weighted 
average number of shares is adjusted to allow for the effects of all dilutive share options and warrants outstanding at the end of 
the year. Options have no dilutive effect in loss-making years, and hence the diluted loss per share for the year is the same as the 
basic loss per share.
The Group also presents an adjusted diluted earnings per share figure which excludes amortisation and impairment of acquired 
intangible assets and goodwill, share-based payments charge, unrealised foreign exchange gains/(losses) on intercompany 
trading balances and non-recurring items from the measurement of profit for the period.

Capitalised product development costs relate to expenditure that can be applied to a plan or design for the production of new 
or substantial improvements to SmartSpace and myWorld products. The Group is loss making and this is an indicator for potential 
impairment of development costs. Management have completed impairment reviews through estimating the future discounted 
cash flows to be generated from these assets and concluded that no impairment is required as the cash flows exceeded the 
carrying value of the asset.
The remaining average amortisation period for capitalised product development costs is 2 years.

Ubisense Group plc acquired the Ubisense Inc (formerly named Geoplan Interworks K.K.) group of companies (“Geoplan”) 
in December 2013. The purchase consideration contained a contingent cash element, which was settled in full during 2017. 
17 Bank loans
In October 2016, an £8.0 million HSBC working capital facility was restructured, becoming a £4.0 million repayment loan 
with £0.75 million repayable each year. £0.75 million of this facility was repaid in each of December 2016 and December 2017.
This loan is secured on the fixed and floating assets of the Group, attracts an interest charge of LIBOR + 3% and is subject 
to an operating covenant linked to “operating cash flow” performance (profit or loss before tax adding back any non-recurring items, 
finance costs, foreign exchange costs, share based payments, depreciation, amortisation or capitalisation of product development). 
Following the placing in November 2017, the terms of the operating covenant were amended as follows: 2017 - from nil to £2 million 
negative; 2018 - from £1 million positive to £2 million negative; 2019 – from £1 million positive to £1 million negative, 2020 and beyond 
– remained at £1 million positive.
The covenants require future repayments of £750,000 before 31 January 2018 and then £187,500 each quarter starting 
on 31 March 2019.

The Group operates a number of plans to award options over shares in the Company to incentivise high performing key 
employees of the Group periodically. 
Other than the December 2016 share option plan set out in note 20.4, the options generally vest evenly over three years on the 
anniversary from the date of the grant or entirely on the third anniversary from the date of grant, depending on continuing service 
during the vesting period. The contractual life of the options is ten years from the date of grant after which they expire if unexercised.

20.4 Principal assumptions 
On 14 December 2016 Ubisense Group plc implemented a new long-term incentive share option plan for Executive Directors 
and key management. Ubisense Group plc granted 5,600,000 options of two pence each in the Company with an exercise price 
set at the nominal value. The options vest if the Company’s share price exceeds 70p for 60 consecutive calendar days between 
the 2nd and 3rd anniversary of issue and the period of employment continues for over three years. No charge had been 
recognised in the 2016 financial statements in respect of these share options granted and the Directors had assessed the impact 
on the 2016 financial statements to be immaterial.
The share options were valued using a Monte Carlo valuation model during 2017. The expected life is the expected period from 
grant to exercise based on management’s best estimate of the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural 
considerations. The risk-free return is an average yield on the zero-coupon UK Government Bond in issue at the date of grant 
with a similar life to the option. Volatility is estimated at the grant date based on the historical daily share price movements of the 
company over a four-year period. Financial statements

21 Operating lease commitments
Leases as lessee
On 22 December 2017, Ubisense entered into a new ten year lease arrangement in respect of it’s UK head office reducing the 
space from 13,981 to 7,552 sq ft.
At 31 December 2017, the Group has lease agreements in respect of property and equipment for which payments extend over a 
number of years. The Group enters into these arrangements as these are a cost-efficient way of obtaining the short-term benefits 
of these assets. The Group lease rental charge is disclosed in note 8.1. There are no other material off-balance sheet arrangements.
The Group’s future aggregate minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases are as follows:

The above table reflects the committed cash payments under operating leases, rather than the expected charge to the income 
statement in the relevant periods. The effect on the income statement will differ to the above figures due to the amortisation 
of rent-free and discounted rent periods included in property leases signed in 2017. The expected charge in 2018 for operating 
leases is expected to be £44,000 higher than the committed cash payments shown above. From existing subleasing agreements 
under non-cancellable operating leases which end in less than one year, the Group received income of £45,000. 
The Group has guaranteed rent bonds issued by its banks on its behalf totalling £128,000 as at 31 December 2017 (2016: £122,000). 
These are not expected to result in any material financial loss. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued

24 Financial risk management
24.1 Risk management objectives and policies
The Group is exposed to various risks in relation to financial instruments. The Group’s financial assets and liabilities by category 
are summarised within note 24.8. The main types of risks are market risk (including foreign currency risk and interest rate risk), 
credit risk and liquidity risk. 
The Group’s risk management is coordinated at its headquarters, in close cooperation with the Board of Directors, and focuses 
on actively securing the Group’s short to medium-term cash flows. The Group does not actively engage in the trading of financial 
assets for speculative purposes. The most significant financial risks to which the Group is exposed are described below. 
24.2 Foreign currency risk management
The Group operates globally and undertakes certain transactions denominated in foreign currencies, predominantly in US dollars 
(USD), Euros (EUR) and Japanese Yen (JPY), exposing the Group to foreign currency risk. The Group’s risk management policy is 
to maintain natural hedges where possible, by matching foreign currency revenue and expenditure. The Group does not enter 
into forward exchange contracts to mitigate the exposure to foreign currency risk as the Group’s currency transactions are not 
considered significant enough to warrant this. 
Foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities which expose the Group to currency risk are disclosed below. 
The amounts shown are those not denominated in the local functional currency, translated into GBP at the closing rate.

24.3 Foreign currency sensitivity analysis
The following table illustrates the sensitivity of profit and equity in regards to the Group’s financial assets and financial liabilities 
and the USD/GBP, EUR/GBP and JPY/GBP exchange rates “all other things being equal”. It assumes a +/- 5% change in the GBP 
exchange rate against the relevant foreign currencies.
The sensitivity analysis includes only outstanding foreign currency denominated monetary items and adjusts their translation 
at the period end. A positive number indicates an increase in profit and equity.

Equity (37) 25 (162) (31) (148) (3)
Exposure to foreign currency exchange rates varies during the year, depending on the volume of transactions. Nonetheless, 
the analysis above is considered to be representative of the Group’s exposure to currency risk.
24.4 Interest rate sensitivity
The Group’s exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to the Group’s variable rate bank loan facility which is partially offset by 
cash held at variable rates. Interest is payable at LIBOR plus 3% on the £2.5 million outstanding at 31 December 2017 (2016: £3.25 million). 
The following table illustrates the sensitivity of the net profit of the Group for the year and equity to a reasonably possible change 
in interest rates of +/-0.5%. These changes are considered to be reasonably possible based on observation of current market 
conditions. The calculations are based on a change in the interest rate with effect from the beginning of the year and the financial 
instruments held at the reporting date that are sensitive to interest rate changes. All other variables are held constant. A positive 
number indicates an increase in profit or equity.

24.5 Credit risk analysis
Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty fails to discharge a contractual obligation resulting in financial loss to the Group. 
The Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk is limited to the carrying amount of financial assets recognised at the reporting 
date, as summarised in note 24.8, which are principally cash and cash equivalents and trade receivables.
Cash and cash equivalents are held at banks with good independent credit ratings in accordance with the Group Treasury policy. 
The Group continuously monitors defaults of customers and other counterparties, identified either individually or by the Group, 
and incorporates this information into its credit risk controls. Where available at reasonable cost, external credit ratings and/or reports 
on customers and other counterparties are obtained and used. The Group’s policy is to deal only with creditworthy counterparties.
The Group’s management considers that its financial assets that are not impaired or past due for each of the reporting dates under 
review are of good credit quality. All receivables are subject to regular review to ensure that they are recoverable and any issues 
identified as early as possible. In order to manage credit risk the Directors set limits for customers based on a combination of 
payment history and third-party credit references. Credit limits are reviewed by the credit controller on a regular basis in conjunction 
with debt ageing and collection history. In addition many of the Group’s customers, and approximately 80% by balance at any 
given time, are large utility companies and other blue-chip companies that would be considered a low credit risk.
The amount of exposure to any single counterparty or a group of counterparties having similar characteristics is subject to a limit, 
which is reassessed periodically by management. At 31 December 2017, one customer individually accounted for more than 14% 
of the gross trade receivables balance (31 December 2016: more than 10%).
None of the Group’s financial assets are secured by collateral or other credit enhancements.
Details of certain trade receivables at 31 December 2017 that have not been settled by the contractual due date but are not considered 
to be impaired are included in note 14.2.
24.6 Liquidity risk analysis
Liquidity risk is the risk arising from the Group not being able to meet its obligations as they fall due. The Group seeks to manage 
this risk by monitoring scheduled debt servicing payments for long-term financial liabilities, regularly reviewing forecast inflows 
and outflows due in day-to-day business and investing cash assets safely and profitably. The data used for analysing these 
cash flows is consistent with that used in the contractual maturity analysis below.
Cash flow forecasting is performed at the subsidiary level and aggregated by Group finance. Rolling cash flow forecasts are used 
by the Group to monitor liquidity requirements to ensure it has sufficient cash to meet operational needs, as well as maintaining 
sufficient headroom so that loan covenants are not breached. The Group policy throughout the year has been to remit surplus 
working capital balances at the subsidiary level to Group treasury and place on short-term deposit or interest bearing reserve 
accounts and to draw down on borrowing facilities and distribute funds locally when required. As disclosed in note 17, the Group 
has total bank loan facilities of £2.5 million, of which £2.5 million was drawn down at 31 December 2017 (2016: £3.25 million facility, 
£3.25 million drawn down).
The Group considers expected cash flows from financial assets, predominately cash and trade receivables, in assessing and 
managing liquidity risk. The Group’s cash and trade receivable resources at 31 December 2017 (see note 14) exceed the current 
cash outflow requirements.
As at 31 December 2017, the Group’s financial liabilities, including interest payments where applicable, have contractual maturities 
as summarised below:

24.7 Capital risk management
The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as a going concern while maximising 
the return to stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the long-term cost of capital. The capital structure 
of the Group consists of cash and cash equivalents and capital and reserves attributable to the owners of the Company, and the 
Group’s borrowing facilities.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may issue shares, take on debt, sell assets to raise cash, adjust 
the amount of dividends payable to shareholders or return capital to shareholders.
The capital structure is continually monitored by the Group. The Group’s strategy is to have a capital structure that allows investment 
in long-term profitable growth, takes into account prevailing trading conditions and seeks to improve balance sheet efficiency over 
time. The Group is not subject to externally imposed capital requirements.
The Group has bank facilities at 31 December 2017 of £2.5 million (31 December 2016: £3.25 million) all dominated in GBP.

On 6 March, Ubisense Group plc entered into agreements to carve out the third party geospatial services business of its Japanese 
subsidiary, Geoplan Company Limited. Under the terms of the agreement customer relationships, the Geoplan brand name, fixed 
assets including certain market specific products, stock and 13 employees will be transferred to a new company, with the new 
company being sold for a consideration of JPY 100 million (approximately £0.7 million). The assets being sold have an immaterial 
carrying value within the consolidated statement of financial position as at 31 December 2017.
The agreed completion date of the transaction is 30 March 2018.
Alongside this transaction, Ubisense has agreed, subject to contract completion, to acquire the 23% minority interest of Geoplan 
Company Limited. The acquisition of this minority interest will give the group 100% ownership of its remaining Japanese operations. 
Geoplan Company Limited will be renamed Ubisense Japan K.K.
These transactions are consistent with Ubisense’s strategy of refocusing the Group on growing revenues from its own IP whilst 
managing the reduction in third party geospatial services revenues.  70 Ubisense Group plc Annual Report 2017

NOTES TO THE COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1 Principal accounting policies
Basis of preparation
The financial statements of Ubisense Group plc have been prepared in compliance with United Kingdom accounting standards, 
including Financial Reporting Standard 102 (“FRS 102”) and the Companies Act 2006. A summary of the significant accounting 
policies which have been reviewed by the Board of Directors is set out below.
The financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention. 
The Company has taken advantage of the following disclosure exemptions in preparing these financial statements, as permitted 
by FRS 102, as it is a qualifying entity and its financial statements are included in the consolidated financial statements of 
Ubisense Group plc.
• The requirements of Section 4 Statement of Financial Position 4.12(a)(iv);
• The requirements of Section 7 Statement of Cash Flows;
• The requirements of Section 3 Financial Statement Presentation paragraph 3;
• The requirements of financial instruments paragraphs 11.41(b), 11.41(c), 11.41(e), 11.41(f), 11.42, 11.44, 11.47, 11.48(a)(iii), 11.48(iv), 11.48(b) 
and 11.48(c); and
• The requirements of Section 33 Related Party Disclosures paragraph 33.7.
The company has taken advantage of the exemption under FRS102 paragraph 1.12(b), from preparing a statement of cash flows, 
on the basis that it is a qualifying entity and the consolidated financial statements of Ubisense Group includes the Company’s 
cash flows.
Share-based payments
The Company issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees of its subsidiaries. Vesting conditions are 
continuing employment and can include, for senior employees, a diluted EPS performance target or share price target. Equity-settled 
share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant using an appropriate pricing model. The share-based payment 
is accounted for as a capital contribution to the subsidiaries. Investments in subsidiaries are increased by the aggregate amount 
of share-based payment with a corresponding increase in equity for the same amount. Information on share options which have 
been granted to Directors and employees are given in note 20 to the consolidated financial statements.
Investments in subsidiaries
Fixed asset investments are shown at cost less provision for impairment. 
Debtors
Short-term debtors are measured at transaction price, less impairment. Loans receivable are measured subsequently at amortised 
cost using the effective interest method less any impairment.
Creditors
Short-term trade creditors are measured at transaction price. Other financial liabilities, including bank loans, are measured initially 
at fair value, net of transaction costs, and are measured subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest rate.
Deferred taxation
Deferred tax is provided in full on timing differences that result in an obligation at the balance sheet date to pay more tax, or 
a right to pay less tax, at a future date, at rates expected to apply when they crystallise based on current tax rates and law. 
Timing differences arise from the inclusion of items of income and expenditure in taxation computations in periods different from 
those in which they are included in financial statements. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as 
more likely than not that they will be recovered. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.
Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation and uncertainty
The Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future. The resulting accounting estimates will, by definition, seldom 
equal the related actual results. The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the 
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are addressed below.
The Group is loss making and this is an indicator for potential impairment of the investments in the trading subsidiaries of 
Ubisense Group plc. In undertaking impairment reviews, management is required to make assumptions of the future cash flows 
generated from its subsidiaries. This includes consideration of both the current business pipeline and estimations beyond the 
existing pipeline. Financial statements

Capital contribution and impairment
The capital contributions relating to share-based payments arise because the Company has granted share options to the 
employees of its various subsidiaries.
Capital contributions made to investments impaired in prior periods were immediately impaired.
The carrying value of investments in subsidiaries relates to investments in Ubisense Limited and Ubisense Inc., which is the 
parent company of Geoplan Company Limited. The Group is loss making and this is an indicator for potential impairment of its 
investments. Management have completed impairment reviews through estimating the future discounted cashflows to be 
generated from these assets and concluded that no impairment is required as the cash flows exceeded the value of the investment. 
In reaching this conclusion, management have considered the sale of the third party geospatial services business of Geoplan 
Company Limited which is disclosed in note 9.
Further information about subsidiaries is provided in note 22 of the consolidated financial statements.
