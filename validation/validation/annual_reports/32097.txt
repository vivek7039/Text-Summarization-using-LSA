management and other stakeholders to better compare the performance of the Group between the 
current and prior period without the effects of one-off or non-operational items.
Underlying measures exclude certain one-off items such as those arising due to restructuring activities and 
recurring non-operational items, including certain intangible amortisation.
Exceptional items are explained on page 115 and Reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP measures are 
included on page 25.

CHAIRMAN’S 
STATEMENT
Our core objective is to grow 
shareholder value and we  
will do this by developing a business 
capable of delivering long term, 
sustainable and growing cash flows, 
achieved through a disciplined 
approach to deployment of capital 
and a rigorous focus on execution.
2017 has proved a challenging year for 
Northgate with a number of factors 
impacting the Group’s performance. 
During the year it became increasingly 
clear that, notwithstanding the competitive 
environment within which Northgate 
operates, there are significant opportunities 
for our business which need to be developed 
in a consistent and focused manner.
Performance
The Group’s underlying profit before tax was 
£75m which represented a 10% decline on 
the previous year’s £83m. The performance 
of our UK business was disappointing with 
underlying operating profits declining by 
£11.5m which represented a fall of 21% on 
the prior year. We have taken a number of 
actions to address this and these are set out 
in detail in the CEO’s report. Our Spanish 
and Irish businesses performed well and 
continue to make excellent progress with 
good growth in vehicles on hire (“VOH”) 
and with the potential for further growth 
in VOH, revenues and profits. VOH grew 
by 2,200 in Spain and Ireland; in the UK 
there was a decline of 2,900 which was 
particularly disappointing as we had 
anticipated a steadily improving pick up 
during the second half of the year. 
Cash generation was strong with free cash 
flow of £43m. This provides good scope  
to further expand our business, including  
our move into term hire, and also to return  
cash to our shareholders in the form of 
increasing dividends.
Dividend
The Group remains in a strong financial 
position, with healthy cash generation and 
a robust balance sheet. This underpins our 
progressive dividend policy and the Board’s 
continued confidence in the outlook for 
the Group means we are proposing a full 
year dividend of 17.3p, an increase of 8% 
compared to the 2016 full year dividend of 
16.0p. This means a final proposed dividend 
of 11.6p (2016 – 10.9p). 
This gives a full year dividend cover of 2.7x 
on underlying earnings, in line with our 
intention to keep cover in the range of  
3.75x to 2.5x. 
Board changes
During the year we appointed Kevin 
Bradshaw as our Group CEO. Kevin 
has a background in both B2B and B2C 
organisations and he has a strong track 
record of developing businesses through 
clear strategic direction with a focus on 
consistent execution. He previously led Avis 
UK and, more recently, was CEO of Wyevale 
Garden Centres, with both businesses 
enjoying strong profitable growth under  
his leadership.

The way forward
Our core objective is to grow shareholder 
value and we will do this by developing a 
business capable of delivering long term, 
sustainable and growing cash flows, 
achieved through a disciplined approach to 
deployment of capital and a rigorous focus 
on execution. Our touchstones will be cash 
flow and returns on investment.
There is significant potential for Northgate 
with opportunities to develop the business 
and grow revenues and profits. In several 
areas of our business we need to do better, 
with consistent and effective day to day 
execution. There is good demand for our 
product and services and we intend to 
harness this effectively through marketing 
clear customer propositions and ensuring we 
meet or exceed our customers’ expectations. 
There are also previously untapped market 
segments which we have the infrastructure 
and skill set to service and I am pleased to 
report that we are already starting to gain 
good traction in the term hire segment. 
Under Kevin’s leadership, we anticipate a 
significant uptick in pace, sharper focus on 
consistent execution and improved strategic 
direction. There is much to do at Northgate 
and significant opportunity to grow our 
businesses in the UK, Spain and Ireland.
Our people
I would like to record the Board’s thanks to 
all of our 2,900 team members throughout 
Northgate. They are the people who, day in 
and day out, make sure that our customers 
receive a superb service and we are most 
grateful to them. 
Outlook
Northgate is, fundamentally, a very good 
business with a superb group of people 
and an infrastructure capable of supporting 
significant growth. With strong leadership, 
clear strategic direction and a clear sense of 
purpose I believe that much can be achieved. 
The current year has started encouragingly, 
with some exciting prospects in the pipeline, 
and our team will be working hard to deliver 
an improved performance.

Q&A WITH  
THE CEO
Kevin Bradshaw
What are the three key things you  
have learned in your first five months 
with Northgate?
KB My first impressions on joining are that Northgate is a 
fundamentally good, well positioned business, with great 
people that have a real desire to serve our customers well 
and in turn deliver strong returns for our shareholders. 
There is however, work to be done and I am excited by the 
challenges that lie ahead. 
What is your vision for the Group  
over the medium term?
KB Over the first five months I have managed to spend 
time across our network with people working in all areas 
of the business. I believe that the potential for Northgate is 
very significant and that we are a business that is capable 
of delivering good long term growth in cash flows with 
returns well ahead of our cost of capital. The strategic review 
on pages 6 to 39 highlights four key growth priorities to 
deliver these returns. The first area that needs attention is, of 
course, the UK business and I have already started to address 
this with self-help actions and leadership changes. 
What have been the reasons for the 
reduction in vehicles on hire in the UK?
KB Competition has certainly intensified but our market 
research concludes that the rental market has grown by 
c.6% a year over the last three years. Reductions in vehicles 
on hire in our business have been broad-based across the 
range of customer sizes, industry sectors and geography. 
Some critical key weaknesses have persisted in the execution 
of our sales and marketing efforts and I have put in measures 
to address these going forward.
What are your key sustainability 
priorities over the medium term?
KB We constantly strive to reduce environmental impacts 
to ensure we are building a sustainable business. Over the 
medium term I will encourage further initiatives around 
energy usage and waste management to ensure we continue 
to progress.
Read more in our Corporate social responsibility report on page 34
How do you envisage Brexit  
impacting the Group?
KB It is currently unclear what, if any, impact Brexit will 
have on the Group. Economic growth will drive demand 
and on the other hand our flexible product lends itself well 
to periods of uncertainty. Under any scenario the Group 
has a secure funding base and robust balance sheet which 
underpins our confidence for the future.

WHY INVEST
As a new investor why should I invest in Northgate?
Financial profile
 | Our business is highly cash generative. 
After taking into account the impact 
of adjusting the fleet size, the Group 
generated £44m of underlying free cash 
flow in the year.
 | We have a progressive dividend policy with 
dividend growth of 8% in the year set 
within a cover range of 3.75x to 2.5x in the 
medium term.
 | We have a strong balance sheet at 61% 
geared and £260m of spare facility to 
enable future growth.
 | Underlying EPS has improved over the  
last five years from 29.2p in 2013 to 47.3p 
in 2017.
Risk management
We take a conservative view with respect to 
risk management. Our robust approach to 
risk management enables us to continually 
identify and assess risks to the business. 
Our business model enables us to respond 
to changes in demand and conserve 
cash through reducing vehicle purchases, 
disposing of liquid vehicle assets or ageing 
out our existing fleet.

STRATEGIC 
REPORT
The key characteristics of each major segment are outlined below:
CHARACTERISTICS TYPICAL COMPETITORS
Acquisition 
(new)
Long term commitment requiring availability of up-front capital or financing. Operators bear the full risk of operating 
the vehicle and funding running costs.
The purchaser takes the risk of the residual value of the vehicle.
Can be the cheapest headline cost, but overall holding cost can be higher if vehicles are not utilised or vehicle failure 
leads to a significant cost of business interruption.
Franchised dealers.
Contract hire
Long term contractual commitment (typically a minimum of 36 months).
Penalties for early return of vehicles and excess mileage usage.
Varying levels of operational support offered at additional cost.
Large companies often backed by financial 
institutions.
Flexible rental
No contractual or capital commitment coupled with operational flexibility and fleet management support.
Vehicles are usually supplied fully inclusive of maintenance and without penalty for excess mileage.
Some national companies but predominantly 
small regional operators.
Daily rental
Flexible, satisfying short term requirements at short notice, normally the highest headline cost as a result. A combination of large multinationals down to 
small local operators.
Acquisition 
(secondary 
market)
T ypically sold directly to owner managed businesses who may have capital constraints. Franchised dealers and some national retailers 
down to small local operators and individual 
traders.
Auction houses selling directly to the trade.

OUR BUSINESS 
MODEL
Our reason for 
being covers  
two main areas:
 | To help our customers operate their 
fleet in the most efficient way; and
 | To provide significant returns to our 
shareholders.
We achieve the first through managing 
our vehicles through their life cycle and 
the products that we offer. We achieve 
the second through honing our business 
model to generate returns through the 
economic cycle. 
Maintaining key relationships is vital 
for the business to exist and achieve 
its objectives. These relationships are 
covered further in our Corporate social 
responsibility report.

To help our customers

We negotiate directly

Purchases are balanced 
against sales to optimise 
the age, condition and 
utilisation of vehicles.
We bring to market a 
wide range of vehicles 
available through one of 
three disposal routes – 
retail, trade and auction – 
to cater for customers 
who prefer to own a 
proportion of their ﬂeet.
Our network of branches throughout the UK, Spain and 
Ireland ensure availability meets demand. We maintain 
our vehicles to a high standard through our national 
networks of workshops.

SUPPLIERS
We partner directly with LCV manufacturers and the 
vehicles that they supply are a key resource for our 
business. We have close working relationships with each 
manufacturer and engage with them regularly – 
both in annual pricing negotiations and throughout the 
calendar year.
EMPLOYEES
Our employees are key to the success of the business and 
therefore our relationships with our employees are vital.  
Maintaining high levels of customer service and managing 
our operations is the key long term value driver in 
our business.
COMMUNITIES & 
THE ENVIRONMENT
We always strive to be a good neighbour and give back to the 
communities that we operate. From employees sleeping outdoors to 
sponsoring vaccine programmes we actively encourage employees to 
engage with the communities that accommodate us.
We take our wider responsibility to the environment seriously and are 
constantly searching for ways to ensure our business is sustainable.
SHAREHOLDERS 
AND LENDERS
We regularly engage with 
the shareholder and lender 
community throughout the 
year but particularly around 
full year and half year results 
announcements.
Shareholders and lenders 
provide the capital we need 
in order to run our business.
CUSTOMERS
 We pride ourselves on 
delivering market leading 
levels of customers service. 
Our latest NPS scores were 
41% across the Group. 
We aim to grow this to 50%

OFFICER’S 
REVIEW
I have undertaken an initial 
strategic review of the Group and 
it is clear that there is scope for 
significant growth within both our 
current and adjacent markets.
Group
Since joining Northgate in January 2017 I 
have been impressed by the professionalism 
and hardworking attitude of all our team 
members. Northgate’s business model and 
market position is robust and we are well 
positioned to take advantage of significant 
growth opportunities that exist. 
I have undertaken an initial strategic review 
of the Group and it is clear that there is 
scope for significant growth within both our 
current and adjacent markets. 
Today, we operate in territories with eight 
million LCVs that are supplied to customers 
via three fulfilment models: ‘ownership’ 
where the vehicle is purchased; ‘contract 
hire’ where the vehicle is hired for a 
committed term, typically of several years 
and ‘rental’ where the vehicle is hired and 
can be returned at will.

Based on research conducted by OC&C using data

transactions reflect primary transactions only. 
Market defined as LCV only.
The LCV purchase, contract hire and rental 
markets together generate annual revenues 
of c.£16bn across our three territories. 
Today, we participate in c.£11bn of this 
spanning rental, contract hire and second 
hand LCV trading. 
Growth in the contract hire and rental 
markets has been particularly strong driven 
and is driven by three factors: 
 | First, by a cultural shift away from asset 
ownership, as customers feel less need to 
own vehicles outright; 
 | Second, through the attraction of a 
low initial deposit followed by certainty 
in ongoing cash flows afforded by 
contract hire and rental models versus 
a high initial cash outlay coupled with 
uncertainty around the residual value 
associated with outright purchase; and 
 | Third, by the attraction of lower ‘whole 
life costs’ as third party provision of 
vehicles and the management of them 
results in lower overall costs for the 
customer than direct ownership. 
We believe that these factors are driving 
a structural trend in the market that will 
underpin strong growth for the contract hire 
and rental sectors in the coming years.
Blending this market analysis with a review 
of our relative competitive advantage in 
each segment has identified four attractive 
growth opportunities in areas where we 
have the ability to win.

1.  Defend and grow share of flexible  
rental markets
We have prioritised defence and growth 
of our position in flexible rental. In a £1bn 
market with volumes growing at 6% per 
annum and with an overall volume share of 
31%, we see continued opportunity to build 
on our leadership position here and deliver 
further strong profitable growth. 
2. Gain share in fixed term markets
We see a significant opportunity to grow our 
share of the contract hire market. At £2bn 
in market revenue, with volumes growing at 
8% per annum and both EBIT margins and 
return on capital similar to that of flexible 
rental, we see an outstanding opportunity 
to grow from a position of low market share 
today. We see this as a natural adjacency 
requiring limited variations in our operating 
model to serve it and with substantial 
opportunities to cross sell within our existing 
customer base.
3.  Converting ownership model to 
fixed term rental
We see large untapped potential in 
converting customer fulfilment from 
‘ownership’ to ‘contract hire’ instead. 
With c.£12bn in sales from 1.2m annual 
transactions in new and second hand LCV 
trading in our territories, we believe that 
attractive EBIT margins are achievable from 
sales volumes that are converted to term 
hire. Each year, 450,000 of these sales 
transactions are financed at the point of sale 
and present a priority to target with a term 
hire alternative. We see significant tailwinds 
supporting this conversion as a result of the 
structural market trends identified.
4.  Consolidating a fragmented UK 
used LCV resale market
We see a substantial opportunity to 
consolidate the highly fragmented second 
hand LCV trading market in the UK. In a 
£5bn market, Northgate has just 2.5% 
market share through Van Monster. We 
believe Van Monster has significant potential 
and is currently under exploited. We see 
several opportunities to increase the supply 
of stock to Van Monster, and to drive 
significant digital and network expansion 
of the business. While this market currently 
operates on thinner EBIT margins, very high 
asset turn ensures that strong returns on 
capital are delivered.

UK
Underlying operating profit for the year was £43.9m 
compared to £55.4m in the prior year. This was mainly 
attributable to 6% lower average vehicles on hire. Closing 
vehicles on hire were 39,500, a reduction of 2,900 since 
April 2016.

Year ended 30 April 2017 100 (3,000) (2,900)
Year ended 30 April 2016 (1,300) (2,000) (3,300)
This marks a disappointing second half performance in the 
UK following growth in the first six months of the year. 
Whilst the first half peak reflected some seasonal business, 
we expected the recovery in the final quarter to be stronger 
than was experienced.
Some key weaknesses have persisted which have contributed 
to this performance, namely:
 | Leadership: aligning business priorities to the changing 
dynamics of the market;
 | Marketing: insufficient lead generation, digital innovation 
and customer data acquisition;
 | Sales: insufficient time in front of customers, price 
inflexibility and conversion of opportunities;
 | Talent: fragmented leadership and insufficient access to 
strong commercial talent; and 
 | IT: legacy systems are inflexible, not supporting required 
changes.
A number of self-help actions have already been taken to fix 
these weaknesses:
 | New leadership appointments in the UK executive team 
to Managing Director, Sales Director and Marketing 
Director roles;
 | Tactical changes in sales and marketing, introducing 
enhanced pricing flexibility and re-directing spend in lead 
generation through telesales and digital channels;
 | Formation of a small commercial centre in Reading 
in order to access a wider talent pool and work 
collaboratively; and
 | Replacement of core IT systems is underway.
These changes will start to have an impact in the new 
financial year and are crucial to the future success of the 
business; they will continue to form the foundation of the 
Group’s strategic priorities.
All investments made will be self-funded through the 
delivery of business wide efficiencies and improved agility to 
drive growth. 
Spain
Underlying operating profit for the year was £42.6m 
compared to £41.3m in the prior year. On a constant 
currency basis, operating profit decreased by £4.2m 
compared to the prior year. This included a £1.6m impact 
of depreciation rate changes, a £1.2m increase in bad debts 
due to trading difficulties of three large customers and a 
£0.7m increase in fleet insurance due to legislative changes. 
The remaining difference was due to managing a younger 
fleet and dealing with a higher level of transactional churn 
within flexible rental.

growth H1 H2 Total
Year ended 30 April 2017 500 1,500 2,000

The net growth in closing vehicles on hire of 2,000 vehicles 
includes a 1,900 reduction from the run out of legacy fixed 
term contracts. Of the underlying growth, 800 related to 
flexible contracts and 3,100 related to vehicles put on new 
fixed term contracts since the product was launched earlier 
in the year. 
The growth in flexible rental was held back by the ongoing 
uncertainties in the political arena as the Central Government 
budget approval was deferred. The successful launch of our 
fixed term offer is very encouraging and this momentum has 
been carried through into the new financial year. 
Ireland
Underlying operating profit for the year was £3.2m 
compared to £2.8m in the prior year. On a constant currency 
basis operating profit was £0.1m higher than the prior year.

The growth in average vehicles on hire of 11% did not drop 
through to the bottom line due to the challenge of operating 
a national fleet from our Dublin hub. Ireland has experienced 
significant growth in the last five years but this has been 
partly achieved in regional areas which are not currently 
supported by internal workshops and other operations. 
Investments will now be made in the infrastructure of the 
business to provide a platform for future profitable growth.
Fixed term rental
Since the launch of the new fixed term offer in the year 
3,500 vehicles have been put on hire as follows:

The fixed term offer was fully launched in Spain, following 
a successful trial in the first half of the year. Trials in the UK 
and Ireland in the second half were also successful and a full 
product launch will now take place.
Group Outlook
I have confidence in the measures that have been taken to 
arrest the decline in vehicles on hire in the UK. Our Spanish 
business continues to trade well and, consequently, I expect 
the Group to grow vehicles on hire over the course of this 
current financial year. 
On the basis of an initial strategic review, we have identified 
four clear growth priorities in markets that are attractive 
and where we believe we have the ability to win. The fixed 
term opportunity is particularly exciting and we will build on 
our good progress this year which saw over 4,100 vehicle 
contracts signed.
As we further develop the strategies and implementation 
plans for these priorities, I have significant confidence in the 
prospects for Northgate over the coming years.

On a statutory basis, operating profit was 
£81.5m (2016 – £90.6m) and profit before 
tax was £72.2m (2016 – £77.6m). Basic 
earnings per share were 45.7p (2016 – 
46.1p). Net cash generated from operations, 
including net capital expenditure on vehicles 
for hire, was £47.8m (2016 – £73.7m).
Group revenue increased by 7.9% to 
£667.4m or 2.7% at constant exchange rates. 
The weakened Sterling across the year 
increased profit before tax by £5.2m 
compared to the prior year.
The impact of previous changes to 
depreciation rates decreased underlying 
profit before tax by £5.7m compared to the 
prior year.
Excluding both of these impacts underlying 
profit before tax was £7.4m lower than the 
prior year.
The accounting requirements to adjust 
depreciation rates due to changes in 
expectations of residual values of used 
vehicles make it more difficult to identify the 
underlying profit trends in our business.  
The impact on operating profit since 
changes were first made in the year ended 
30 April 2013, including the estimated

Free cash flow was £42.9m (2016 – £62.9m) 
after net capital expenditure of £174.1m 
(2016 – £155.5m). If the impact of increasing 
or reducing the fleet size in the year is 
removed from net capital expenditure in 
each year, the underlying free cash flow of 
the Group was £44.0m (2016 – £48.4m).
Net cash generation was £21.0m (2016 –

The increased volume of vehicles sold was 
offset by a higher net book value per vehicle 
sold as a result of previous depreciation 
rate changes. The total impact was a £4.8m

The increase in hire revenue of 16.1% 
benefitted from weaker Sterling across 
the year. At constant exchange rates hire 
revenue grew by 1.2% as average vehicles 
on hire were 1.3% higher compared to the 
previous year. 
Weaker Sterling across the year benefitted 
operating profit by £5.5m. The impact of 
previous changes to depreciation rates 
decreased operating profit by £1.6m 
compared to the prior year.
An increased volume of vehicles sold was 
offset by the impact of depreciation rate 
changes and a higher net book value of 
selling younger vehicles, contributing £1.0m 
to the decrease in operating profit compared 
to the prior year. In Euros this equates to a 
PPU of €1,589 compared to €2,102 in the 
prior year. 
Corporate
Underlying corporate costs were £5.1m 
(2016 – £5.1m).
Interest
Net underlying finance charges for the year 
were £9.6m (2016 – £11.4m).
The net cash interest charge for the year was 
£9.0m (2016 – £10.1m) benefitting by £1.3m 
from lower levels of net borrowings, £0.6m 
in relation to the tax settlement in Spain 
partially offset by £0.1m of higher pricing 
and £0.7m of adverse movements in foreign 
exchange rates.
Non-cash interest reduced by £0.7m to 
£0.6m (2016 – £1.3m).
Taxation
The Group’s underlying and statutory 
effective tax rate was 16% (2016 – 21%). 
Earnings per share
Underlying EPS was 47.3p compared to 
49.0p in the prior year.
Underlying earnings for the purpose of 
calculating EPS were £63.0m (2016 – 
£65.4m). The weighted average number of 
shares for the purposes of calculating EPS 
was 133.2m, in line with the prior year.
Exceptional items
During the year £1.0m of exceptional net 
costs were incurred (2016 – £3.3m) of which 
£2.2m related to restructuring costs and a 
£1.2m credit related to the settlement of an 
historic tax case in Spain. 
Dividend and capital allocation
Subject to approval, the final dividend 
proposed of 11.6p per share (2016 – 10.9p) 
will be paid on 23 September 2017 to 
shareholders on the register as at close of 
business on 11 August 2017.
Including the interim dividend paid of 5.7p 
(2016 – 5.1p), the total dividend relating to 
the year would be 17.3p (2016 – 16.0p).  
The dividend is covered 2.7x by underlying 
earnings.
Our objective is to build shareholder value 
by generating returns above our cost of 
capital. We will allocate capital within our 
business in accordance with the framework 
outlined below, with our first priority being 
to allocate capital to support our growth 
ambitions:
1. Investment for growth in existing 
network
2. Investment in new sites
3. Provide regular returns to shareholders
4. Acquisitions
5. Return of surplus cash
We will continue to maintain our 
balance sheet within the target leverage 
range of 1.25 to 1.85 times net debt to 
EBITDA, although we are prepared to 
move temporarily outside of this range if 
circumstances warrant it. This is consistent 
with our objective of maintaining a balance 
sheet that is efficient in terms of providing 
long term returns to shareholders and 
safeguards the Group’s financial position 
through economic cycles.

The margin charged on bank debt is dependent upon the Group’s net debt to EBITDA ratio, 
ranging from a minimum of 1.50% to a maximum of 2.25%. The net debt to EBITDA ratio at 
30 April 2017 corresponds to a margin of 1.75%.
Interest rate swap contracts have been taken out which fix a proportion of bank debt at 
2.16% (2016 – 2.23%) giving an overall cost of bank borrowings (gross of cash balances) at 
30 April 2017 of 2.16% (2016 – 2.12%).  
The other loans consist of £11.5m of local borrowings in Spain and £0.5m of preference shares.
Free cash flow 42.9 62.9
Dividends (21.9) (20.1)
Net cash generated (outflow) 21.0 42.8
A total of £346.3m was invested in new vehicles compared to £296.2m in the prior year. The 
Group’s new vehicle capital expenditure was partially funded by £177.0m generated from the 
sale of used vehicles (2016 – £145.9m). Other net capital expenditure amounted to £4.8m 
(2016 – £5.2m).
All vehicles required for the Group’s operations are paid for in cash up-front. The cash flow 
generation of the Group in any year is therefore influenced by the capital expenditure to 
grow the business or cash generated by adjusting the fleet size downwards if vehicles on hire 
reduce.  If the impact of increasing or reducing the fleet size in the year is removed from net 
capital expenditure, the underlying free cash generation of the Group was as follows:

Liquidity and funding
The Group has sufficient funding facilities 
to meet its normal funding requirements 
in the medium term as discussed above.  
Covenants attached to those facilities as 
outlined above are not restrictive to the 
Group’s operations.  
Capital management
The Group’s objective is to maintain a 
balance sheet structure that is efficient in 
terms of providing long term returns to 
shareholders and safeguards the Group’s 
financial position through economic cycles.
Operating subsidiaries are financed by 
a combination of retained earnings and 
borrowings.
The Group can choose to adjust its capital 
structure by varying the amount of dividends 
paid to shareholders, by issuing new 
shares or by adjusting the level of capital 
expenditure.
Interest rate management
The Group’s bank facilities and other loan 
agreements incorporate variable interest 
rates. The Group seeks to manage the risks 
associated with fluctuating interest rates 
by having in place a number of financial 
instruments covering at least 50% of its 
borrowings at any time. The proportion of 
gross borrowings hedged into fixed rates 
was 97% at 30 April 2017 (2016 – 91%). 
Foreign exchange risk
The Group’s reporting currency is, and the 
majority of its revenue (62%) is generated 
in, Sterling. The Group’s principal currency 
translation exposure is to the Euro, as the 
results of operations, assets and liabilities 
of its Spanish and Irish businesses must 
be translated into Sterling to produce the 
Group’s consolidated financial statements.
The average and year end exchange rates 
used to translate the Group’s overseas 
operations were as follows:
2017
£ : €
2016
£ : €
Average 1.18 1.35
Year end 1.18 1.28
The Group manages its exposure to 
currency fluctuations on retranslation of the 
balance sheets of those subsidiaries whose 
functional currency is in Euro by maintaining 
a proportion of its borrowings in the same 
currency. The exchange differences arising 
on these borrowings have been recognised 
directly within equity along with the 
exchange differences on retranslation of 
the net assets of the Euro subsidiaries. At 
30 April 2017 70% of Euro net assets were 
hedged against Euro borrowings (2016 – 
78%).   
Going concern
Having considered the Group’s current 
trading, cash flow generation and debt 
maturity including severe but plausible 
stress testing scenarios, the Directors have 
concluded that it is appropriate to prepare 
the Group financial statements on a going 
concern basis. 
Paddy Gallagher  
Chief Financial Officer
Balance sheet
Net tangible assets at 30 April 2017 were 
£509.7m (2016 – £463.4m), equivalent to a 
net tangible asset value of 383p per share 
(2016 – 348p per share).  
Gearing at 30 April 2017 was 61%  
(2016 – 67%).
Return on capital employed was 10.5% 
(2016 – 12.2%).
Treasury
The function of Group Treasury is to mitigate 
financial risk, to ensure sufficient liquidity is 
available to meet foreseeable requirements, 
to secure finance at minimum cost and to 
invest cash assets securely and profitably.  
Treasury operations manage the Group’s 
funding, liquidity and exposure to interest 
rate risks within a framework of policies 
and guidelines authorised by the Board of 
Directors.
The Group uses derivative financial 
instruments for risk management purposes 
only. Consistent with Group policy, Group 
Treasury does not engage in speculative 
activity and it is our policy to avoid using 
more complex financial instruments.
Credit risk
The policy followed in managing credit risk 
permits only minimal exposures, with banks 
and other institutions meeting required 
standards as assessed normally by reference 
to major credit agencies. Our credit exposure 
is limited to banks which maintain an A 
rating. Individual aggregate credit exposures 
are also limited accordingly.

of hire revenue.
In order to grow the 
business we must deliver 
the highest levels of

MANAGING 
RISK
Our internal and external risk environments require 
a dynamic, proactive approach to risk. The Group’s 
risk appetite is approved by the Board and this 
culture is disseminated throughout the organisation. 
The Group takes a conservative view on risk overall. 
There is an ongoing process of risk identification, 
analysis and mitigation by the Board and throughout 
the Group with reporting back upwards.  
The Board can therefore confirm that 
there is an ongoing process for identifying, 
evaluating and managing the significant risks 
faced by the Group, that it has been in place 
for the year under review and up to the date 
of approval of this annual report and accords 
with corporate governance guidance and 
therefore the Board has performed a robust 
assessment of the principal risks facing  
the Group.
Review of risk management  
and internal control systems 
During the previous year the Board 
engaged a third party to perform a review 
of the Group’s processes and procedures 
to supplement and bring an alternative 
perspective from that of the Board. The 
findings of this review contained a number 
of recommendations. During this year work 
has continued on implementing these 
recommendations and embedding the good 
practice recommendations received so that 
they become business as usual as part of our 
risk management processes.
Risk appetite 
Risk is always high on the Board’s agenda 
and the focus on effective risk management 
cascades all the way through the 
organisation. The culture of the organisation 
ensures that all activities from day-to-day 
operations to high level strategic decisions 
are performed in line with this approach. 
Management’s assessment of our principal 
risks is based on impact, likelihood, change 
from the prior year and appetite. 
The governance of risk is undertaken in the 
context of the Group’s overall risk appetite. 
The Group considers risk appetite to ensure 
adequate resources are allocated to the 
correct risks. During the year the Audit and 
Risk Committee reviewed the Group’s risk 
appetite statement, which subdivides the 
Group’s six principal risks into 14 specific 
risks. The results were as follows:
Risk appetite Number of specific risks
Minimal 3
Low 8
Medium 3
High –
Total 14
This demonstrates that the Group takes a 
conservative view towards risk and attempts 
to minimise its exposure to undue risk.

COMMITTEE
GROUP 
INTERNAL AUDIT
BOTTOM UP TOP DOWN
There is a formal governance structure 
underpinning our approach to risk 
management. Key roles and responsibilities 
within the structure are as follows: 
Board 
The Board has overall responsibility for 
risk management and internal control 
and instilling the culture towards risk 
management throughout the Group. The 
Board manages this through the Audit and 
Risk Committee, who report to the Board. 
Audit and Risk Committee 
The Audit and Risk Committee reviews 
the Group’s risk appetite. The Committee 
sets the objectives, monitors and reviews 
the activities of Group Internal Audit and 
oversees the Group’s whistleblowing 
arrangements. The Committee monitors the 
Group’s risk management processes focusing 
on the effectiveness of internal controls and 
business continuity procedures, including 
cyber risk. 
Executive Committee 
The Executive Committee is chaired by 
the CEO. More details on the role of the 
Executive Committee is in the Introduction 
to governance on page 45. The regional 
executive teams report on risks to the 
Executive Committee, which forms the 
backdrop to the strategic review held in  
this forum.
Group Internal Audit 
Group Internal Audit are responsible for the 
monitoring of the Group’s risk management 
approach and provide a link between 
regional management and the Audit and 
Risk Committee. The Group Head of Internal 
Audit reports formally to and attends the 
meetings of the Audit and Risk Committee 
and has direct access to the Chairman of the 
Board and to all members of the Audit and 
Risk Committee. 
In addition to risk-based standardised site 
audits, Group Internal Audit facilitate the 
risk management process by meeting with 
risk owners to monitor risk, discuss new  
risks arising and to ensure that risks 
monitored and reported on are consistent 
across the Group.
Regional Executive Teams 
Regional Executive Teams are responsible for 
implementing risk management within the 
Group’s operations. Regional management 
identify, analyse, manage and report on  
the risks that the businesses face as part  
of a continuous dialogue with Group  
Internal Audit.
Identification of risks 
The Board and the Group’s management 
have a clearly defined responsibility for 
identifying the major business risks facing  
the Group and for developing systems to 
mitigate and manage those risks. The control 
of key risks is reviewed by the Board and  
the Regional Executive Teams at their  
monthly meetings.

MANAGING  
RISK
Principal risks and uncertainties
Evaluation is defined as Management’s assessment of whether the risk factor has:
 Increased  Decreased  Stayed the same since the prior year.
1
Economic 
environment
The demand for our products 
and services could be affected 
by a downturn in economic 
activity in the countries in which 
the Group operates.
2
 
Competition and 
hire rates
The markets in which 
the Group operates are 
fragmented and competitive 
meaning that price 
competition is high.
There is a risk that the Group 
fails to attract and retain 
customers on the basis of 
pricing. This could either 
be as a result of pricing too 
highly or not adequately 
communicating the value 
of service provided which 
underpins our pricing.  
 
3
Vehicle holding 
costs
The profitability of the Group 
is dependent upon minimising 
vehicle holding costs, which 
are affected by the pricing 
levels of new vehicles 
purchased and the disposal 
value of vehicles sold.
4
Employees and 
the working 
environment
Failure to attract, develop and 
retain individuals with the 
appropriate skills will inhibit 
the successful delivery of  
our strategy. 
Inadequate maintenance of 
our vehicles and a working 
environment where individuals 
do not receive appropriate 
training and support could 
place employees and 
customers’ employees at  
risk from failures in health  
and safety.
5
IT systems
The Group’s business involves 
a high number of operational 
and financial transactions 
across numerous sites which 
rely on the continuous 
operation of our IT systems. 
If IT systems are not invested 
in appropriately there is a 
risk that the operations of 
the business will become less 
efficient and this in turn could 
impact upon customer service 
delivery.
6
Access to capital
The Group requires capital to 
replace vehicles at the end of 
their rental life and for any 
growth in the fleet. The Group 
therefore requires continued 
access to adequate credit 
facilities and to remain in 
compliance with its financial 
covenants.
The high level of operational 
gearing in our business model 
means that changes in demand 
can lead to higher levels of 
variability in profits. 
An adverse change in 
macroeconomic conditions 
could also increase the risk of 
customer failure and therefore 
incidences of bad debts. 
Demand for our products and 
the cost of our supplies may be 
impacted by the  
UK’s decision to leave the EU.
If our pricing is perceived 
to be higher than our 
competition for the same 
level of service, then we will 
either lose market share or 
be forced to reduce prices to 
remain competitive.  Without 
any adjustment to the cost 
base, this will result in an 
erosion of returns.
An increase in holding costs, 
if not recovered through hire 
rate increases, would adversely 
affect profitability, shareholder 
returns and cash generation.
Failure to invest in our 
workforce and high levels  
of staff turnover will impact 
upon customer service and 
delivery of the Group’s 
strategic objectives. 
Our recruitment processes 
seek to attract individuals who 
will exemplify our core values. 
Each new joiner receives  
an introduction to the  
Group’s culture as well as  
our processes.
Failures in health and safety 
would put the reputation 
of the business at risk, 
both in terms of attracting 
and retaining talent and 
maintaining customer 
relationships. 
Should IT systems not be 
invested in adequately or 
fail, whether the cause is 
accidental or malicious, 
this could have an adverse 
impact on the recording 
and processing of financial 
information, efficiency of 
operations and customer 
service delivery.
Failure to maintain or  
extend access to credit facilities 
could impact on the Group’s 
ability to continue as a  
going concern.
RISK IMPACT BEFORE MITIGATION

Should there be a significant 
economic downturn the 
flexible nature of the Group’s 
business model allows any 
vehicles returned to be placed 
with different customers. 
Alternatively, utilisation can be 
maintained through purchasing 
fewer vehicles, increasing 
disposals or a combination of 
the two. Although this may 
affect short term profitability 
it generates cash and reduces 
debt. 
No individual customer 
contributes more than 5% 
of total revenue generated, 
and ongoing credit analysis is 
performed on new and existing 
customers to assess credit risk.
With regards to the UK’s 
decision to leave the EU the 
Group’s current hedging 
arrangements protect it from 
material foreign exchange risks 
and the Group has in place 
sufficient borrowing facilities 
to fund its activities with 
maturities up to five years. Any 
impact on demand or the cost 
of supplies is not yet known. 
Core pricing is based upon 
target levels of return with 
discount authority levels 
allowing flexibility to ensure 
that we remain competitive 
on pricing.
Further investment will be 
made in marketing to ensure 
that the value proposition 
underpinning pricing is well 
communicated and received 
(see Strategy section on  
page 10).
Pricing is negotiated with 
manufacturers on an annual 
basis in advance of purchases 
being made. Variable supply 
terms allow us flexibility to 
make purchases as required 
throughout the year. 
Whilst the Group is exposed 
to fluctuations in the used 
vehicle market, we have 
sought to optimise the sales 
route for each vehicle. Should 
the market experience a short 
term decline in residual values, 
we can age our existing  
fleet until such time as the 
market improves.
Personal development plans 
and tailored training are 
conducted for all employees. 
Salaries are benchmarked 
against the market and 
a range of incentives are 
provided to attract and retain 
staff. Succession plans are in 
place for executive positions. 
Regular communication and 
engagement with everyone 
across the business is vital to 
our success. 
The Group Health, Safety 
and Environment and  Group 
Internal Audit functions are 
responsible for delivering 
health and safety best practice 
and reporting any non-
compliance to the Board. 
The Group has an appropriate 
business continuity plan in 
the event of disruption arising 
from an IT systems failure. 
Before any material system 
changes are implemented 
a project plan is approved 
by the Board. A member of 
the executive team will then 
sponsor the project and an 
ongoing implementation 
review will be performed by 
external consultants. The 
objective is always to minimise 
the risk of business disruption 
that could result from changes.
The Group’s main facilities 
mature in 2020 and 2022  
and the Group believes 
that these facilities provide 
adequate resources for  
present requirements. 
The Group reviews its 
compliance with covenants on 
a monthly basis in conjunction 
with cash flow forecasts to 
ensure ongoing compliance. 
The impact of access to capital 
on the wider risk of going 
concern is considered on page 
24 and within the viability 
statement on page 33.

Viability statement 
The Directors have assessed the viability of the Group over 
a three year period to 30 April 2020, taking into account 
the Group’s current position and the potential impact of 
the principal risks documented in the Strategic report. 
Based upon this assessment the Directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the Company will be able to continue in 
operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the 
period to 30 April 2020.
The three year period was selected as this represents 
the normal holding period of our core vehicle assets and 
therefore represents the Company’s investment cycle. This 
period is aligned to how our business model runs through its 
cycle, how capital is employed in the business and therefore 
how returns on investment are reviewed. Our core banking 
facilities also mature in 2020.
The strategy and associated principal risks underpin the 
Group’s three year strategic planning process (the Plan), 
which is updated annually. This process takes into account 
the current and prospective macroeconomic conditions 
in the countries in which we operate and the competitive 
tension that exists within the markets that we trade in.  
The Plan also encompasses the projected cash flows, 
dividend cover and headroom against financial covenants 
under the Group’s existing facilities. The Plan makes certain 
assumptions about the normal level of capital recycling 
likely to occur and therefore considers whether additional 
financing will be required. Headroom against the Group’s 
existing facilities at 30 April 2017 was £260m as detailed 
on page 22. The facilities have maturity dates between May 
2017 and August 2022, which exceeds the period under 
review and provides sufficient headroom to fund the capital 
expenditure and working capital requirements during the 
planned period.
As explained in the Strategic Report, part of our core 
business provides customers with vehicles on a non-contract 
basis which allows them to flex their vehicle requirements as 
their business needs change. This is core to the proposition 
we offer, however, it does mean that there is less certainty 
over the future revenue streams of the Group over a 
longer period of time. The Directors have therefore made 
assumptions on future revenue generation in the context of 
current market conditions and prospects of the Group.
In making this statement, the Directors have considered 
the resilience of the Group, taking into account its current 
position and the principal risks facing the business. The 
Plan was stress tested for severe but reasonable scenarios 
and the effectiveness of any mitigating actions that would 
reasonably be taken. The Plan was specifically stress tested 
for reasonable downturns in vehicles on hire, hire rates, 
vehicle acquisition costs and residual values of vehicles. The 
outcome of this testing satisfied the Directors with respect 
to the ongoing liquidity and solvency of the Group over 
the period under review. In particular, should there be a 
significant downturn in demand for the Group’s business, 
vehicle utilisation can be maintained through purchasing 
fewer vehicles, increasing disposals, or a combination of the 
two, which would generate cash and reduce debt.

Relationships are vital to the Group 
in achieving our aims of delivering 
market leading levels of customer 
service and providing significant 
returns to our shareholders.
Outlined below are details of five key 
relationships and the steps we take to 
engage with these groups and what they 
provide in return in order to allow us to build 
a responsible and sustainable business.
We will not allow success to give way to 
complacency and will strive to do all we can 
to maintain and deepen these relationships 
in order to best serve our customers, 
provide returns to our shareholders and be a 
responsible corporate citizen.
1. Our customers
Our customers are vital to the ongoing 
success of the Group. As a Group we are 
dedicated to providing a market leading 
service to all of our customers. 
All elements of our strategy, as outlined on 
pages 10 to 11 contribute towards this.
We measure how strong our relationships 
with our customers are through our NPS 
scores. For 2017 Group NPS was 41% 
compared to 43% in the prior year. 
We will continue to work hard towards 
delivering exceptional customer service and 
the medium term aim is to achieve a score of 
50% in all three territories.
Our customers provide valuable insight on 
how we can improve what we do in order to 
build a long term, sustainable business.
2. Our shareholders and lenders
A description of the relationship we have 
with shareholders is contained within the 
Corporate governance report on pages 48 
to 50.
Our lenders provide us with the funding 
we need in order to meet the capital 
requirements of the Group and day-to-
day working capital requirements. Our 
borrowing rates are competitively priced and 
enable us to provide adequate returns to 
shareholders and lenders.
3. Our employees
Without our employees the Group would 
not be capable of operating. They enable 
the high levels of customer service to be 
delivered which is reflected in our improved 
NPS scores over recent years. Northgate is 
committed to equality, judging applications 
for employment neither by race, nationality, 
gender, age, disability, sexual orientation or 
political bias.
Our ethical standards are communicated 
to employees through the Group’s Code 
of business conduct, which covers bribery, 
competition, conflicts of interest, inside 
information, confidentiality, gifts and 
entertainment, discrimination, harassment 
and fair dealing with customers and 
suppliers. In addition, the Group’s 
whistleblowing policy and procedure  
enables every employee to have a voice  
and a means by which they may draw 
concerns to our attention.

Providing our employees with an environment where they can flourish will ensure that our 
business is as good as it can be. At its simplest level this means ensuring that everyone feels 
safe at work. Clear communication ensures that employee goals are aligned to the Group 
and regular training enables each individual to perform to the best of their ability and have 
the opportunity to progress their career within the Group. 
Safety
Our approach to safety is simple: to ensure 
that no harm comes to anyone engaged 
with Northgate.
Our ‘Safe and sound’ programme creates an 
environment of openness and awareness, 
where all colleagues feel empowered to 
raise concerns about working practices and 
conditions. Regular training is provided 
to employees, most of which is carried 
out internally by our Health, Safety & 
Environment team. 
The Health, Safety & Environment team 
carried out audit reviews to measure 
performance of safety and environment 
management processes at all locations 
across the Group during the year and where 
necessary identified improvements and 
subsequently monitored compliance with 
these recommendations.
Safety performance across the business is 
measured using an Accident frequency rate 
(AFR). This is calculated as the number of 
lost time incidents, multiplied by 100,000, 
divided by the number of hours worked. The 
results were as follows:
2017 2016 2015
UK 0.8 0.9 1.1
Spain 1.9 2.2 2.2
Ireland 1.0 1.1 1.4
Group 1.2 1.4 1.5
We aim to have as low an AFR as possible.  
AFRs are monitored against previous 
performance and if there were to be a 
significant decline in performance then a 
root cause analysis, over and above the 
continuous monitoring currently in place, 
would be performed.
Internal communications
The Group mixes face-to-face, digital and 
traditional communications channels in order 
to maximise the impact of communication 
with our employees. Examples include 
newsletters, staff conferences and use  
of Yammer.
Training
We use multiple training platforms for our 
people. These include launching Leadership 
and Operations Academies in the UK and 
the Northgate Campus online platform  
in Spain.

4. Our suppliers
Maintaining a positive working relationship 
with our suppliers is vital to ensure that we 
have the right vehicles in the right place at 
the right time to ensure customer needs 
are met. Vehicle pricing is negotiated on 
an annual basis and we maintain an active 
dialogue with suppliers throughout the  
year too.
Our strong manufacturer relationships 
provide a competitive advantage and 
generate value to the Group.
5. Our communities and  
the environment
The Group operates from 122 locations 
across the UK, Spain and Ireland. This 
impacts on the local communities who 
accommodate us and the environments we 
operate in.
Communities
One of the main ways we give back to 
our local communities is through actively 
encouraging our colleagues to engage 
with charities that are close to their hearts. 
All charitable activity is promoted and 
championed through ongoing internal 
communications.
UK and Ireland
Amongst the many charitable activities 
undertaken by employees, the business held 
a company wide Christmas jumper day in 
aid of Save the Children and members of 
one division spent a night sleeping outdoors 
in support of Byte Night in association with 
Action for Children. These are only some 
examples of the variety of worthwhile causes 
our people invest their time in.
Spain
Our Spanish business engaged with a 
number of community and charity initiatives 
over the year. This included continued 
sponsorship of Gavi – a vaccine alliance – 
and a cycling event in Madrid in support 
of childhood cancer. 300kg of food was 
collected for a local charity as part of a 
basketball exhibition event with the most 
prominent local basketball team in Seville.
The communities we operate in provide the 
core of our workforce, meaning that our 
employees understand the communities in 
which we are present.
Environment
The activities that we undertake also have 
a wider impact on the environment. The 
main measure that we use to assess our 
environmental impact is greenhouse  
gas emissions. 
Greenhouse gas emissions
This section incorporates the mandatory reporting of greenhouse gas emissions required 
by the Companies Act 2006 (Strategic Report and Directors’ Report) Regulations 2013 
(the Regulations).
Reporting and baseline year
The information presented covers the period from 1 May 2016 to 30 April 2017, with a 
comparison to the prior year. The base year for calculations is the year ended 30 April 2014.
Consolidation approach and organisational boundary
The emissions data presented has been derived using the operational control approach, 
required under the Companies Act 2006 (Strategic Report and Directors’ Reports) 
Regulations 2013. Each facility under operational control has been included within the 
figures. Northgate has used the principles of the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and 
Reporting Standard (revised edition), ISO 14064-1.
Methodology
Defra’s current conversion factors have been used in arriving at the information supplied 
below. All six greenhouse gases are reported as appropriate.

WASTE DIVERSION
Diverting waste from landfill has been a key environmental focus for our UK business 
over the past three years. A combination of encouragement and training in this area 
has led to significant engagement from our colleagues and we have become one of our 
waste management partner’s best performers in this area.
We recognise the need to support our 
customers in managing a sustainable 
business. We work with our suppliers to 
make a fleet available to our customers 
comprised entirely of modern vehicles, 
achieving the highest levels of exhaust 
emission standards.
A number of initiatives have been introduced 
during the year to reduce our greenhouse 
gas emissions. These include:
UK and Ireland
 | Widening the roll out of LED lighting 
following a successful trial in one 
geographical area;
 | Trialling heating controls to reduce 
energy usage; and
 | Continuing to increase diversion rates 
from landfill. 
Spain
 | A new e-contracting system reduces 
paper usage and cuts down journeys to 
exchange contracts; and
 | An increase in the number of electric and 
hybrid vehicles on the fleet contributing 
towards emissions reductions.
Our dedication to robust environmental 
principles, policies and procedures has 
meant that we have maintained ISO 14001 
accreditation in both the UK and Spain.

CHAIRMAN’S 
INTRODUCTION 
TO GOVERNANCE
Dear Shareholder,
At Northgate we recognise the vital role 
that governance plays in delivering the 
best outcomes for all stakeholders in the 
business. Our rigorous systems of risk 
management and internal control ensure 
that our businesses operate within the Board 
approved risk appetite levels set out in the 
Managing risk report on page 28.
Governance issues tackled during the year 
include changes to the Board and acting 
upon the recommendations from the 
previous external Board evaluation – all with 
a focus on positioning the Group to be in 
the strongest position it can be to provide 
fantastic service to our customers and long 
term sustainable value to our shareholders.
Board changes
During the year Kevin Bradshaw was 
appointed as Chief Executive Officer. 
Kevin brings with him a strong cross-
sector background and in-depth industry 
knowledge from his time spent with Avis. 
I am confident about the Group’s future 
prospects under Kevin’s leadership.
Katie Wood has also been appointed 
as Company Secretary during the year, 
following the retirement of David Henderson 
after 47 years’ service. Katie’s experience 
and ability to link the operational businesses 
with non-executive oversight have helped 
with the smooth functioning of the Board. 
Board evaluation
As an external Board evaluation was 
conducted last year, this year the Board 
has concentrated on acting upon the 
recommendations from that report and 
performed an internal assessment of 
effectiveness. One of the key areas for 
development has been the inclusion of site 
visits and the areas of focus for next year are 
further market and strategic analysis as Kevin 
Bradshaw presents his vision for the Group.
Compliance with the Code
As disclosed in last year’s Annual Report, 
Andrew Allner completed nine years’ service 
to the Group in September 2016, meaning 
that he could no longer be classed as 
independent by the Code or ABI. However, 
due to the continued benefit of Andrew’s 
wise counsel it was determined that he 
should remain on the Board for a further 
year, until September 2017. We are also 
proposing that Andrew be re-elected for a 
further year. 
This means that the Board did not comply 
with section B.1.2 of the Code. However, 
we feel that maintaining a Board with an 
appropriate mix of skills and experience 
serves our stakeholders well. 
There have been no significant changes  
to the UK Corporate Governance Code 
during the year and the Board considers that 
it has complied with the provisions of the 
Code throughout the year, other than as 
described above.
Good governance is a cornerstone of our 
business and the disciplines and practices 
that contribute to this are well understood 
by the Northgate team.
Andrew Page
Chairman
26 June 2017
At Northgate we recognise  
the vital role that governance 
plays in delivering the best

the business.

The business is managed by the Board of Directors, currently 
comprising two executive and five non-executive Directors, 
details of whom are shown on pages 42 and 43. The offices 
of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer are separate. 
An overview of the leadership of the Group, including the 
responsibilities and activities of each component is outlined 
on pages 45 to 47.
2. Effectiveness 
Information supplied 
The Chairman ensures that all Directors are appropriately 
briefed to enable them to discharge their duties. 
Management accounts are prepared and submitted to 
the Board on a monthly basis. Before each Board meeting 
appropriate documentation on all items to be discussed is 
circulated.
We recognise the vital role 
that good governance plays in 
delivering the best outcomes for 
all stakeholders in the business. 
UK Listed Companies are required by the FCA (the designated UK Listing

Appointed to Board 1 June 2016 and appointed Chairman of Audit & Risk Committee 1 October 2016.
All Directors in office at that time were present at the AGM 
held in September 2016.
The external auditor and the Head of Group Internal Audit 
attended all Audit and Risk Committee meetings. 
Andrew Allner completed nine years’ service as a non-
executive Director of the Company in September 2016 and 
therefore is no longer regarded as independent in terms of 
the Code or by the ABI. Bill Spencer, appointed to the Board 
as a non-executive Director on 1 June 2016, assumed the 
roles of Senior Independent Director and Chairman of the 
Audit and Risk Committee on 1 October 2016. This means 
that the Board was not compliant with section B.1.2 of 
the Code (more than half of the Directors, excluding the 
Chairman, should be independent) from September 2016 to 
the date of this report. However, we feel that maintaining a 
Board with an appropriate mix of skills and experience serves 
our stakeholders well. 
Board review
The internal evaluation established that the Board had built 
on the evaluation recommendations from the previous year. 
It highlighted areas for additional focus in FY2018, which 
included further market and strategic analysis. With the 
appointment of Kevin Bradshaw in January 2017 a refreshing 
of the Group’s strategy was undertaken and this will be a 
further focus of the Board throughout FY2018. In addition, 
a review against new strategic objectives will be regularly 
monitored.
The inclusion of site visits for Board meetings during the 
year had a positive impact on employee engagement 
and enhanced the Board’s first-hand experience of the 
Company’s operations; this will continue throughout 
FY2018.
Diversity 
The Board has considered the recommendations of the 
Davies Review into Women on Boards in the light of the 
provisions of both section B.2 of the Code, with which we 
are compliant, and of our existing policies and procedures. 
The Board recognises the benefits of diversity at all levels 
of the business and in order to reinforce the Board’s 
commitment to equality, the Board has endorsed an Equal 
Opportunities Policy, which may be found on our website at: 
 www.northgateplc.com
Whilst the overriding criteria for Board appointments will 
always be based on merit, so as to encourage an appropriate 
balance of skills, experience and knowledge on the Board 
at all times, for all future appointments we will only use 
executive search firms who have committed to the Voluntary 
Code of Conduct on gender diversity.

GOVERNANCE
CONTINUED
At the same time the Board recognises that, particularly 
given the nature of its business, the development of a pool 
of suitably qualified candidates may take time to achieve and 
therefore does not believe it is appropriate to set targets, 
however aspirational, at the present time. 
At 30 April 2017 29% of Board members, 19% of the senior 
management team and 31% of all employees were female.
Conflicts of interest 
Pursuant to those provisions of the Companies Act 2006 
relating to conflicts of interest and in accordance with the 
authority contained in the Company’s Articles of Association, 
the Board has put in place procedures to deal with the 
notification, authorisation, recording and monitoring of 
Directors’ conflicts of interest and these procedures have 
operated effectively throughout the year and to the date of 
signing of this report and accounts.
3. Accountability 
Although no system of internal controls can provide absolute 
assurance against material misstatement or loss, the Group’s 
system is designed to provide the Directors with reasonable 
assurance that, should any problems occur, these are 
identified on a timely basis and dealt with appropriately. 
Internal control 
Confirmation that the Board has performed an assessment 
of the risk management and internal control systems of the 
Group, as required by the Code provision C.2.3, is contained 
in the Managing risk report on pages 28 to 33. 
Whistleblowing hotline 
The Board has established a confidential telephone service, 
operated by an independent external organisation, which 
may be used by all staff to report any issues of concern 
relating to dishonesty or malpractice within the Group. All 
issues reported are investigated by senior management and 
Internal Audit as appropriate.
Information and communication 
Each reporting segment prepares monthly management 
accounts with a comparison against their business plan 
and prior year, with review by management of variance 
from targeted performance levels. These commentaries 
are consolidated and submitted to the Board. Year to date 
actuals are used to guide forecasts, which are updated 
regularly and communicated to the Board.
Planning 
Each reporting segment prepares a three year business plan 
on an annual basis. This is presented to and approved by 
the Board. Performance against these plans is reviewed on a 
monthly basis.
Assurance 
A description of the work of the Audit and Risk Committee is 
given on pages 51 to 53. Both the external auditor and Head 
of Internal Audit report directly to the Committee.
4. Remuneration 
Details of the Company’s remuneration policy and the 
remuneration of each Director are given on pages 54 to 73.
5. Relations with shareholders 
Throughout the year the Company maintains a regular 
dialogue with institutional investors and market analysts, 
providing them with such information on the Company’s 
progress and future plans as is permitted within the 
guidelines of the Listing Rules. In particular, twice a year,  
at the time of announcing the Company’s half and full  
year results, they are invited to briefings given by the CEO 
and CFO. 
The Company’s major institutional shareholders have been 
advised by the Chief Executive Officer that, in line with the 
provisions of the Code, the Senior Independent Director and 
other non-executives may attend these briefings and, in any 
event, would attend if requested to do so. 
All shareholders are given the opportunity to raise matters 
for discussion at the AGM, for which more than the 
recommended minimum 20 working days’ notice is given. 
Details of proxies lodged in respect of the AGM will 
be published on the Company’s website as soon as is 
practicable following the meeting. 
Significant interests in shares are detailed on page 74.
Compliance with the Code 
The Board considers that the Company complied with 
the provisions of the Code throughout the year, with the 
exception of provision B.1.2, as described in section 2 above.

Dear Shareholder,
I am delighted to present to you my first 
report as Chairman of the Audit and Risk 
Committee since joining the Board in June 
2016. The Committee has continued to 
follow a detailed program of work. We have 
been provided with good quality material to 
allow proper consideration to be given to the 
Committee’s responsibilities.
The Audit and Risk Committee (the 
Committee) has an important role in 
ensuring the integrity of the Group’s 
financial reporting and reviewing the 
effectiveness of the Group’s internal control 
systems and risk management.
The report which follows sets out details on 
the workings of the Committee, the work 
done during the year and the key issues 
considered in the preparation of the financial 
statements and the related information, 
judgements and assurance received.
The key accounting issue considered during 
the year continued to be determining 
appropriate depreciation rates for our 
vehicles. This is an area where significant 
judgement is required and the Committee is 
satisfied with the rigour applied to this issue.
The other area I would like to highlight and 
where I believe we have continued to make 
good progress is risk management. The 
Board’s risk appetite and approach towards 
risk is outlined in the Managing risk report 
on pages 28 to 33. We have implemented 
the recommendations put forward in the 
external review conducted in the prior 
year and have also reviewed the work of 
Group Internal Audit to ensure that this key 
function is operating effectively.
I hope you find this report useful and I would 
welcome any comments.

REPORT OF THE AUDIT 
AND RISK COMMITTEE
Role
The role of the Audit and Risk Committee is 
set out on page 46.
Membership
The members of the Committee, who are 
all non-executive Directors of the Company, 
are:
Date of appointment
B Spencer (Chairman) 1 June 2016
J Caseberry 10 December 2012
C Miles 27 November 2015
The Code requires that at least one member 
of the Committee should have recent and 
relevant financial experience: currently, 
the Chairman of the Committee fulfils this 
requirement. All members of the Committee 
are expected to be financially literate.
Meetings
The Committee is required to meet at least 
three times a year. Details of attendance at 
meetings held in the year ended 30 April 
2017 are given on page 49.
Due to the cyclical nature of its agenda, 
which is linked to events in the Group’s 
financial calendar, the Committee will 
generally meet four times a year. The other 
Directors, together with the Group Head of 
Internal Audit and the external auditor, are 
normally invited to attend all meetings.
Activity
Since May 2016, the Committee has:
 | Reviewed the financial statements for the 
years ended 30 April 2016 and 2017 and 
the half yearly report issued in December 
2016. As part of this review process, the 
Committee received reports from PwC. 
For the full year results this included 
making a recommendation to the 
Board as to whether the Annual Report 
and Accounts were fair, balanced and 
understandable;
 | Reviewed and agreed the scope of the 
audit work to be undertaken by PwC and 
agreed their fees;
 | Reviewed the effectiveness of the 
Group’s system of internal controls;
 | Received regular reports from the Head 
of Internal Audit;
 | Reviewed the progress made by 
management in implementing the control 
improvements recommended by Internal 
Audit;
 | Reviewed the Group’s whistleblowing 
procedures;
 | Reviewed the Group’s depreciation policy

Risk management
As part of the Committee’s role to oversee 
the Group’s approach to risk management 
the Committee has monitored the Group’s 
risk management processes and business 
continuity procedures.
This included reviewing the end to end 
processes of identifying and reporting risks 
and implementing improvements to the 
collection of data.  
The Committee monitored and reviewed 
the activities of the Group’s Internal Audit 
function including agreeing the scope 
of work to be performed.  An external 
review was commissioned in the year 
and recommendations regarding the 
methodology of work to be performed and 
reporting have since been implemented.

Significant issues considered 
in relation to the financial 
statements
During the year the Committee considered, 
discussed with the external auditor and 
concluded on what the significant risks 
and issues were in relation to the financial 
statements and how these would be 
addressed:
 | Determining appropriate 
depreciation rates for vehicles 
available for hire – in addition to 
a monthly review of adjustments to 
depreciation when vehicles are sold, 
the Committee reviewed formal 
papers prepared by management at 
each reporting date which included a 
qualitative assessment of the current 
and forecast trends in the used vehicle 
market. After due challenge and debate, 
the Committee were content with the 
assumptions and judgements made;
 | The recoverability of aged trade 
receivables – throughout the period, 
KPIs are provided. The Committee 
ensured that management dedicated 
sufficient resources to mitigate bad debt 
risk across the Group;
 | Provisions for uncertain tax positions 
– the Committee reviewed formal 
papers prepared by management at 
each reporting date which outlined the 
Group’s tax positions. The Committee 
challenged areas where significant 
judgement was taken in order to 
determine the level of provisions held in 
the balance sheet and was satisfied with 
the judgements made; and
 | Financial statements – the Committee 
considered the presentation of the 
Annual Report and Accounts, and 
in particular, the analysis between 
underlying and statutory disclosures. 
We were satisfied with management’s 
presentation.
External auditor
The Committee reviews and makes 
recommendations with regard to the 
appointment of the external auditor. 
In making this recommendation, the 
Committee considers auditor effectiveness 
and independence, partner rotation and any 
other factors which may impact upon the 
external auditor’s reappointment. PwC was 
first appointed in September 2015 and the 
Committee supports a proposed resolution 
at the AGM in September 2017 to re-appoint 
them for a further year.
The Board’s policy on non-audit services 
provided by the external auditor, developed 
and recommended by the Committee, is:
 | Certain audit related work such as the 
review of the half year announcement, 
being work that, in its capacity as 
auditor, it is best placed to carry out 
and will generally be asked to do so. 
Nevertheless, where appropriate, it will 
be asked for a fee quote; and
 | Tax compliance, tax advisory and 
other non-audit related and general 
consultancy work: this type of work 
will either be placed on the basis of 
the lowest fee quote or to consultants 
who are felt to be best able to provide 
the expertise and working relationship 
required. The external auditor is not 
invited to compete for this type of work.
Fees paid and payable to PwC in respect of 
the year under review are as shown in Note 
5 on page 99.
The Committee reviewed the effectiveness 
and independence of the external 
auditor, taking into account input from 
management, consideration of responses 
to questions from the Committee and the 
audit findings reported to the Committee. 
The Committee also conducted one-to-one 
meetings with the audit partner without 
management being present. Based on all of 
this information, the Committee concluded 
that the audit process was operating 
effectively. As a result of this the Committee 
has recommended to the Board the 
reappointment of PwC at the AGM.
Internal Audit
In fulfilling its duty to monitor the 
effectiveness of the Internal Audit function, 
the Committee has:
 | Reviewed the adequacy of the resources 
of the Internal Audit department for the 
UK, Spain and Ireland;
 | Ensured that the Head of Internal Audit 
has direct access to the Chairman of 
the Board and to all members of the 
Committee; and
 | Conducted a one-to-one meeting with 
the Head of Internal Audit without 
management present, approved  
the internal audit programme and 
reviewed quarterly reports by the Head 
of Internal Audit.
The Chairman of the Committee will 
be available at the AGM to answer any 
questions about the work of the Committee.

REMUNERATION 
REPORT
Chairman’s introduction
JILL CASEBERRY I CHAIRMAN OF THE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
Northgate is committed to a 
transparent and open dialogue with 
shareholders. The objective of  
this report is to communicate clearly 
the strong link between executive  
pay and performance.
Dear Shareholder,
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to 
introduce the Directors’ remuneration 
report for the year ended 30 April 2017. 
The report is divided into three sections, 
namely: (i) the annual statement; (ii) the 
remuneration policy (which details the 
Directors’ remuneration policy which we 
will be seeking shareholder approval for at 
the forthcoming AGM); and (iii) the annual 
remuneration report.
Performance of the Group
FY2017 was a challenging year for the 
Company, with increased competition in all 
territories. Spain and Ireland grew vehicles 
on hire and self-help measures have been 
initiated in the UK. Considerable insight of 
our growth opportunity has been gained 
giving us confidence going forward.
 | Underlying profit before tax £75.0m 
(2016 – £82.9m) 
 | Underlying basic earnings per share 47.3p 
(2016 – 49.0p);
 | Underlying free cash flow generation of 
£44.0m (2016 – £48.4m);
 | 8% increase in proposed full year 
dividend per share to 17.3p (2016 – 
16.0p).
Executive change
In January 2017, Bob Contreras left the 
business and Kevin Bradshaw was appointed 
as CEO. Kevin’s salary, benefits and variable 
remuneration opportunities are at the same 
level as the former CEO and no ‘buy-out’ 
payments were made.
The remuneration package will be reviewed 
in May 2018 following an assessment of 
his performance and a review of market 
conditions.
In accordance with Bob Contreras’ Service 
Agreement, he is entitled to a payment 
in lieu of 12 months notice, subject to 
mitigation. In line with our remuneration 
policy and good leaver status, Bob must 
exercise his deferred bonus shares within 
six months of leaving the business. His EPSP 
awards will remain subject to performance, 
vest pro-rata and on the original dates. 
Remuneration policy review
During the course of the last six months the 
Remuneration Committee (the Committee) 
undertook a full review of the policy, which 
will be presented for a binding vote at this 
year’s AGM. The objectives of this review 
were to ensure that the policy continues to 
align with the Group’s strategy, duly reflects 
investor best practise, and provides us with 
the ability to attract, motivate and retain 
high-calibre executive talent.
In developing the proposals for the revised 
policy, we have consulted with our major 
shareholders, the Investment Association, ISS 
and Glass Lewis Governance Services, as well 
as taking into account the climate of opinion 
on reward and pay for executive directors. 
Following the review the Committee 
concluded that a small number of minor 
changes should be proposed.
Northgateplc.com    stock code: NTG 25361.02     13-6-17   Proof Four
Key changes:
 | Bringing the CEO annual bonus target 
and threshold performance into line with 
that for other Directors;
 | Introduction of a two-year post vesting 
holding period for long term incentive 
awards granted from 2017;
 | Providing discretion for the Committee 
to determine that dividend equivalents 
will be paid on deferred bonus or 
performance share awards;
 | Increase of minimum shareholding level 
from 150% of salary to 200% of salary 
for both CEO and CFO; and
 | Executive Director’s contracts to provide 
for equal notice periods for the executive 
Director and Company. Normally the 
notice period will be six months. 
Full details of the proposed changes can be 
found on pages 56 to 64.
Overall reward structure
The Committee continues to believe that 
the total reward available to its executives 
should be competitive for a company of 
Northgate’s size, complexity and geography. 
In order to ensure strong alignment to the 
interests of shareholders, the policy provides 
a greater weighting to the variable elements 
of remuneration and for a significant 
proportion of the remuneration package to 
be paid in equity. 
Review of remuneration for  
2017 and basis for 2018
Base salary 
In line with the senior level UK workforce,  
no salary increases have been awarded  
to the CEO or CFO for the year ending  
30 April 2018.
Annual bonus
Annual bonus targets for the year ended 
30 April 2017 were based on profit before 
tax (75% of maximum opportunity) and 
key strategic targets (25% of maximum 
opportunity) with a ROCE underpin. As 
the profit before tax threshold was not 
met, bonus has not been awarded to 
Bob Contreras, Kevin Bradshaw or Paddy 
Gallagher. Full details of the bonus criteria 
and calculations can be found on page 67.
The maximum annual bonus opportunity 
and performance metrics for the coming 
year are the same as for the year just ended. 
Performance targets will be disclosed 
retrospectively in next year’s report. 
Upon review of the FY2016 bonus paid 
to Bob Contreras in July 2016 an error 
was identified. This error resulted in an 
overpayment of bonus in the sum of 
£41,000, split equally between shares and 
cash. Subsequently, using the clawback 
provisions of the bonus scheme all monies 
due have been repaid.
Executive Performance Share Plan 
(EPSP)
Vesting of the EPSP award granted on the 
27 June 2014 was based on performance 
over the three years ended 30 April 2017. 
This award was subject to EPS performance 
for 60% of the award and ROCE for the 
other 40%. The performance achieved has 
resulted in 61.8% vesting before pro-rating 
for period of service. Further detail regarding 
this award can be found on page 67.
For the coming year, EPSP award levels for 
the CEO and CFO remain unchanged from 
this year and EPS and TSR continue to be 
the target metrics. The balance between 
these metrics remains 60% on EPS and 
40% on TSR compared to the FTSE 250 
(excluding Investment Trusts). The EPS target 
is set at a level to encourage progressive 
and sustainable growth of earnings for 
shareholders. Since 2013 there has been a 
threshold of CPI + 3% p.a. and a stretch of 
CPI + 11% p.a., and these remain the targets 
for the coming year’s awards.
Committee changes
During the course of the year Andrew Allner 
stepped down from the Committee, as he is 
no longer independent, but he continues to 
offer wise counsel as he attends meetings  
by invitation. 
Other items
As previously reported, our depreciation 
rates were reduced on 1 May 2012 and 
1 May 2014 in the UK and 1 May 2014 
in Spain. Where appropriate, when 
setting performance targets in future, the 
Committee will take this into account. With 
regard to outstanding unvested EPSP awards 
the Committee has agreed that it will review 
the position at the end of the performance 
period, for each award, when the exact 
impact is known and make any adjustment 
it considers appropriate. Any adjustment will 
be fully explained in the annual report on 
remuneration for the relevant year. 
Conclusion
The Committee remains committed to a 
remuneration policy and implementation, 
which provides the appropriate opportunity 
for the executives to be fairly rewarded for 
their contribution to the business, aligned 
with the interest of all stakeholders. 
We value the support that shareholders have 
provided in the past, including the 99% vote 
given to approve our remuneration report 
at the 2016 AGM. Northgate is committed 
to a transparent and open dialogue with 
shareholders and we look forward to 
your continued support at our AGM in 
September.

REMUNERATION 
REPORT
Remuneration Policy Report
This part of the Directors’ remuneration report sets out  
the remuneration policy for the Company and has been  
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006,  
The Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups 
(Accounts and Reports) (Amendment) Regulations 2013, 
the UK Code on Corporate Governance and the UK Listing 
Rules. Our Directors’ remuneration policy was approved 
by shareholders at our AGM on 18 September 2014 and 
became effective from that date. The policy outlined below 
is a new policy for the three years from 2017 and will be put 
to a binding vote of shareholders at the AGM to be held on 
19 September 2017.
How the views of shareholders are taken 
into account
The Committee takes seriously the views of its shareholders. 
Shareholder feedback received in relation to the AGM each 
year, and any other meetings and communications with 
shareholders, is considered by the Committee as part of its 
annual review of remuneration policy.
When any material changes are proposed to be made to the 
remuneration policy, the Committee Chairman will inform 
major shareholders and will offer a meeting to discuss  
the changes.
If any shareholders raise concerns with regard to 
remuneration issues, we would endeavour to understand 
and respond to those concerns either by meetings or 
correspondence, as appropriate.
Details of votes cast for and against the resolution to 
approve last year’s remuneration report and principal matters 
discussed with shareholders during the year are provided in 
the annual remuneration report.
Consideration of employment conditions 
elsewhere in the Group
When setting remuneration policy for the executive Directors 
the Committee takes into account the overall approach to 
reward for and the pay and employment conditions of other 
employees in the Group and salary increases will ordinarily, 
in percentage terms, be in line with those of the wider 
workforce in the UK. The Committee is also provided with 
periodic updates on employee remuneration practices and 
trends across the Group which inform the Committee’s 
discussions on executive remuneration. The Company does 
not formally consult with employees on the Directors’ 
remuneration policy.
The remuneration policy for Directors
The Committee aims to ensure that executive Directors 
are fairly and competitively rewarded for their individual 
contributions by means of basic salary, benefits in kind and 
pension benefits. High levels of performance are recognised 
by annual bonuses and the motivation to achieve the 
maximum benefit for shareholders in the future is provided 
by the allocation of long term incentives. Only basic salary  
is pensionable. 
The Committee’s policy is to apply greater weighting  
to the variable elements of executive remuneration and  
by incentivising the longer term performance of the  
Company, to provide greater alignment with the interests  
of shareholders. 
It is also the Committee’s policy to pay a significant 
proportion of the potential remuneration package in equity, 
to ensure that executives have a strong ongoing alignment 
with shareholders through the Company’s share price 
performance. 
However, when setting the levels of short-term and long-
term variable remuneration, consideration is given to setting 
the right balance between equity and cash so as not to 
encourage unnecessary risk taking. 
The Committee will seek to ensure that the incentive 
structure will not raise ESG risks by inadvertently motivating 
irresponsible behaviour and will take account of ESG matters 
generally in determining overall remuneration policy  
and structure.

Key aspects of the remuneration policy for Directors
Purpose and link to strategy Operation Maximum opportunity
BASE SALARY
To recruit and reward executives of a 
suitable calibre for the role and duties 
required
Reviewed annually by the Committee, taking account of Company performance, 
individual performance, changes in responsibility and levels of increase for the 
broader UK population.
Reference is also made to remuneration levels within relevant FTSE and industry 
comparator companies.
The Committee considers the impact of any basic salary increase on the total 
remuneration package.
Salary increases for executive Directors will not normally exceed the general 
increase for the broader UK employee population but on occasions may need to 
recognise, for example, changes in the scale, scope, complexity or responsibility 
of the role, and/or specific retention issues, and to allow the base salary of 
newly appointed executives to increase in line with their experience and 
contribution.
Details of the outcome of the most recent salary review are provided in the 
annual remuneration report.
No change to policy from 2014 vote.
BENEFITS
To provide market competitive benefits to 
ensure the wellbeing of executives
The Company typically provides:
 | A car or cash allowance in lieu
 | Medical insurance
 | Death in service benefits
 | Critical illness insurance
 | Other ancillary benefits, including relocation expenses (as required)
Executive Directors are also entitled to 30 days’ leave per annum.
Reimbursement of all costs associated with reasonable expenses incurred for the 
proper performance of the role.
The value of benefits is based on the cost to the Company and is not 
pre-determined. It is a relatively small part of the overall value of the total 
remuneration package.
Proposed change from 2014 vote
Reimbursement of all costs associated with reasonable expenses incurred for the proper performance of the role.
PENSION
To provide market competitive retirement 
benefits
A Company contribution to a Group personal pension plan or provision of cash 
allowance in lieu at the request of the individual.
Up to 18% of salary.

ANNUAL BONUS
To encourage and reward delivery of the 
Company’s operational objectives and 
to provide alignment with shareholders 
through the deferred share element
The annual bonus is based on performance against one or more financial 
targets. A proportion (not exceeding 25%) may also be based on non-financial 
strategic KPIs.
Details of the performance measures and targets (where these are not 
considered commercially sensitive) set for the year under review is provided in 
the annual report on remuneration.
Up to 100% of salary, half of any bonus earned is paid in shares and any bonus 
earned in excess of 100% of salary will be paid entirely in shares, which are 
available to executive Directors after three years, ordinarily subject to continued 
employment. 
The Remuneration Committee has the discretion to determine the payment of 
dividend equivalents arising over the period between grant and the vesting date. 
These may be paid in cash or shares.
The Remuneration Committee has the discretion to adjust the final outcome 
upwards or downwards in the event that an exceptional event outside of the 
Directors’ control occurs, which, in the Committee’s opinion, materially affected 
the bonus out-turn.
Clawback provisions apply to all participants in the event of a restatement 
of the Group’s accounts, error in assessing performance criteria, poor risk 
management, misrepresentation or such other exceptional circumstances as the 
Committee determines.
Maximum: 150% of salary CEO; 100% of salary other executives.
Target: 50% of maximum. 
Threshold: 25% of maximum. 
For performance below threshold, no bonus is payable.
Proposed change from 2014 vote
Bringing the opportunity for the CEO at threshold and target performance into line with that for other Directors.

LONG-TERM INCENTIVES
To encourage and reward delivery of the 
Company’s strategic objectives and provide 
alignment with shareholders through the 
use of shares
Annual awards of performance shares (or nil cost options) to executive Directors.
Awards are granted subject to continued employment and satisfaction of 
challenging performance conditions measured over three years.
Between 2010 and 2014 awards were granted subject to both an EPS and a 
ROCE performance condition. In 2015, and subsequently, the awards have 
been granted subject to both EPS and TSR. Other measures and/or longer 
performance periods may be proposed in the future if the Committee feels that 
they would better support the Company’s medium or long term objectives. If 
the Committee considers that the changes are substantive it will consult with the 
Company’s major shareholders prior to making any changes.
Awards will vest, subject to performance, on the third anniversary of grant and 
will be subject to an additional two year holding period post vesting, during 
which time awarded shares may not be sold (other than for tax).
The terms of the EPSP rules provide the Committee with the discretion to grant 
and/or settle all or part of an EPSP award in cash. In practice this discretion 
would only be used in exceptional circumstances for executive Directors or to 
enable the Company to settle any tax or social security withholding which may 
apply.
The Remuneration Committee has the discretion to determine the payment of 
dividend equivalents arising over the period between grant and the vesting date. 
These may be paid in cash or shares.
Clawback provisions apply to all participants in the event of a restatement 
of the Group’s accounts, error in assessing performance criteria, poor risk 
management, misrepresentation or such other exceptional circumstances as the 
Committee determines.
The maximum grant limit in the plan rules is 150% of salary (face value of 
shares at grant) although exceptionally 250% may be used, e.g. in recruitment.
The normal grant policy is 150% of salary for each executive Director.
25% of the grant vests for threshold performance increasing in a straight line to 
100% for maximum performance.
If performance is below threshold for a measure, then the proportion of the 
award subject to that measure will lapse. 
Proposed change from 2014 vote
Introduction of a post vesting holding period for EPSP awards granted from 2017.
Providing the discretion for the Committee to determine that dividend equivalents will be paid on EPSP awards.
The ability to grant and/or settle all or part of an EPSP award in cash (to be used only in exceptional circumstances for executive Directors or to enable the Company to settle any tax or social security withholding 
which may apply).

ALL EMPLOYEE SHARE SCHEME
All employees including executive Directors 
are encouraged to become shareholders 
through the operation of an all employee 
HMRC approved SIP. The Board believes 
that encouraging wider share ownership by 
all staff will have longer term benefits for 
the Company and for shareholders
The SIP has standard terms under which all UK employees can participate. The 
rules for this plan were last approved by the shareholders at the 2011 AGM.
Employees can elect to contribute up to a maximum amount determined by the 
Company and within the statutory limits for SIPs per month from pre-tax salary 
which is used to buy shares in the Company. The Company may in addition 
make an award of free Matching shares at a ratio not exceeding the statutory 
limit for SIPs.
The Company may also make awards of free shares to all employees including 
executive Directors, on an equal basis. The maximum award would not exceed 
the maximum limit for SIPs.
No change to policy from 2014 vote.
NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FEES
To attract and retain a high-calibre 
Chairman and non-executive Directors by 
offering a market competitive fee level
The Chairman is paid a single fee for all his responsibilities. The non-executives 
are paid a basic fee. The Chairmen of the main Board Committees and the 
senior independent Director are paid an additional fee to reflect their extra 
responsibilities.
The level of these fees is reviewed every two to three years by the Committee 
and CEO for the Chairman and by the Chairman and executive Directors for the 
non-executive Directors within the overall limit set by the Articles of Association 
and with reference to market levels in comparably sized FTSE companies, time 
commitment and responsibilities of the non-executive Directors. Fees are paid 
in cash.
Reimbursement of all costs associated with reasonable expenses incurred for the 
proper performance of the role.
The maximum aggregate amount is currently £700,000 as provided in the

Choice of performance measures and 
approach to target setting
The annual bonus is based on performance against one or 
more financial measures and may also include an element 
of non-financial strategic KPIs if the Committee feels it 
appropriate, all based on the priorities for the business in the 
year ahead. The Committee will set stretching performance 
targets taking into account market and investor expectations, 
prevailing market conditions and the Company’s business 
plan for the year.
The Committee may also set an overarching financial hurdle, 
for example and depending on the actual metrics set, ROCE 
or budgeted operating profit of the Group (or another 
appropriate measure) for the year, which, if not achieved, 
would result in no bonus being awarded, regardless of 
performance against the set targets.
Awards under the EPSP will be based on performance 
against one or more financial measures. The measures since 
2015 have been EPS and TSR. The Committee has selected 
these measures to closely reflect the importance the Board 
places on profitability and balance sheet management. The 
Committee considers EPS and TSR are the most appropriate 
measures at the time of setting this executive Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy since they incentivise the executives 
to both improve the earnings profile of the Group and 
manage balance sheet efficiency (important for a capital 
intensive business), both of which should flow through to 
superior returns for shareholders. The Committee will review 
the choice of performance measures and set appropriately 
challenging targets prior to each award being made based 
on market conditions and the Company’s long term priorities 
and business plan at that time. The targets for outstanding 
awards are set out in the annual report on remuneration.
Annual bonus plan and share plan policy
The Committee will operate the DABP, EPSP and SIP 
according to the rules of each respective plan and consistent 
with normal market practice and the Listing Rules, including 
flexibility in a number of regards. Factors over which the 
Committee will retain flexibility include (albeit with quantum 
and performance targets restricted to the descriptions 
detailed above):
 | Who participates in the plans;
 | When to make awards and payments;
 | How to determine the size of an award, a payment, or 
when and how much of an award should vest;
 | How to deal with a change of control or restructuring of 
the Group;
 | Other than in the case of stated good leaver reasons 
whether a Director is a good/bad leaver for incentive plan 
purposes and whether and what proportion of awards 
vest at the time of leaving or at the original vesting date(s) 
as relevant;
 | How and whether an award may be adjusted in certain 
circumstances (e.g. for a rights issue, a corporate 
restructuring or for special dividends); and
 | What the weighting, measures and targets should be for 
the annual bonus plan and EPSP from year to year.
The Committee also retains the discretion within the policy 
to adjust targets and/or set different measures and alter 
weightings for the annual bonus plan and to adjust targets 
for the EPSP if events happen that cause it to determine that 
the conditions are unable to fulfil their original intended 
purpose provided that they are not in all the circumstances 
considered by the Committee to be materially less difficult 
to satisfy.
All historic awards that were granted under any current 
or previous share schemes operated by the Company but 
remain outstanding (detailed on page 70 of the annual 
report on remuneration), remain eligible to vest based on 
their original award terms.
It is proposed that the Committee be provided discretion to 
enable that dividend equivalents be paid on DABP and EPSP 
awards from date of grant to vesting. 
Share ownership requirements
It is proposed that executive Directors are required to 
accumulate, over a period of five years from the date of 
appointment, a holding of Ordinary shares of the Company 
equivalent in value to 200% of their basic annual salary, 
measured annually. It is intended that this should be 
achieved primarily through the exercise of share incentive 
awards and that Directors are not required to go into the 
market to purchase shares, although any shares so acquired 
would count towards meeting the guidelines. Executive 
Directors are required to retain all vested DABP and EPSP 
awards on vesting, subject to sales to meet tax obligations, 
and the Remuneration Committee’s discretion in exceptional 
circumstances until the ownership requirement is met. 
Differences in remuneration policy  
for executive Directors compared to  
other employees
The remuneration policy for the executive Directors is 
designed with regard to the policy for employees across the 
Group as a whole. For example, the Committee takes into 
account the general basic salary increase for the broader 
UK employee population when determining the annual 
salary review for the executive Directors. There are some 
differences in the structure of the remuneration policy for 
the executive Directors and other senior employees, which 
the Remuneration Committee believes are necessary to 
reflect the different levels of responsibility of employees 
across the Company. The key differences in remuneration

REMUNERATION 
REPORT
Remuneration Policy Report
policy between the executive Directors and employees across 
the Group are the increased emphasis on performance 
related pay and the inclusion of a significant share based 
long term incentive plan for executive Directors. Long 
term incentives are not provided outside of the most 
senior executives as they are reserved for those considered 
as having the greatest potential to influence Group 
performance.
In accordance with best practice it is proposed that the 
executive Directors are required to hold any awards under 
EPSP for two years following vesting.
External non-executive Director positions
Subject to Board approval, executive Directors will normally 
be permitted to take on one non-executive position with 
another company. In line with best practice it is proposed 
that the Director will normally be permitted to retain 
their fees in respect of such positions. Details of outside 
directorships held by the executive Directors, if any, and 
any fees that they received are provided in the Annual 
Remuneration Report.
Approach to recruitment and promotions
The remuneration package for a new Director would be set 
in accordance with the terms of the Company’s approved 
Remuneration Policy in force at the time of appointment. 
Currently, for an executive Director, this would facilitate 
awards of no more than 150% of salary per annum for each 
of the DABP and EPSP, although exceptionally an EPSP award 
of up to 250% may be made. 
The salary for a new executive, particularly one with no 
experience at listed company main board level, may be set 
below the normal market rate, with phased increases over 
the first few years as the executive gains experience in their 
new role. 
The Committee may offer additional cash and/or share-
based elements when it considers these to be in the best 
interests of the Company and its shareholders to take 
account of remuneration relinquished when leaving the 
former employer and would reflect (as far as possible) the 
nature and time horizons attaching to that remuneration and 
the impact of any performance conditions.
For an internal executive appointment, any variable pay 
element awarded in respect of the prior role will be 
allowed to pay out according to its terms. In addition, any 
other ongoing remuneration obligations existing prior to 
appointment may continue, if relevant. 
For external and internal executive appointments, the 
Committee may agree that the Company will meet certain 
relocation and other incidental expenses as appropriate.
For the appointment of a new Chairman or non-executive 
Director, the fee arrangement would be set in accordance 
with the approved remuneration policy in force at that time.
Service contracts and payments for  
loss of office
The Remuneration Committee reviews the contractual terms 
for new executive Directors to ensure that these reflect best 
practice. 
Service contracts normally continue until the Director’s 
agreed retirement date or such other date as the parties 
agree. The service contracts contain provision for early 
termination. Notice periods given by the employing 
company are limited to 12 months or less. In line with 
best practice it is proposed that equal notice periods will 
apply to the executive Directors and the Company and that 
these will normally be six months, although in exceptional 
circumstances a notice period may be agreed of up to a 
maximum of 12 months.
An executive Director’s service contract may be terminated 
without notice and without any further payment or 
compensation, except for sums accrued up to the date of 
termination, on the occurrence of certain events such as 
gross misconduct. If the employing company terminates the 
employment of an executive Director in other circumstances, 
compensation is limited to salary due for any unexpired 
notice period and any amount assessed by the Committee 
as representing the value of other contractual benefits 
(including pension) which would have been received 
during the period. In the event of a change of control of 
the Company there is no enhancement to contractual 
terms. Service contracts are available for inspection at the 
Company’s registered office.
In circumstances in which a departing Director may be 
entitled to pursue a legal claim, the Company may negotiate 
settlement terms and, with the approval of the Committee 
on the remuneration elements therein, enter into a 
settlement agreement accordingly.

In summary, the proposed contractual provisions are as follows:
Provision Detailed terms
Notice period Current executive Directors: six months from the executive and six months from the Company.
Any future executive Directors: normally a six months’ notice from both the Company and the 
Director (up to a maximum of 12 months in exceptional circumstances). 
Termination payment Base salary plus benefits (including pension), subject to mitigation and paid on a phased basis 
for notice period.
In addition, any statutory entitlements or sums to settle or compromise claims in connection 
with the termination would be paid as necessary. 
Remuneration 
entitlements
A pro rata bonus may also become payable for the period of active service along with vesting 
for outstanding share awards (in certain circumstances – see below). 
In all cases performance targets would apply.
Change of control There are no enhanced terms in relation to a change of control.
Any share based entitlements granted to an executive 
Director under the Company’s share plans will be determined 
based on the relevant plan rules. The default treatment 
is that any outstanding awards lapse on cessation of 
employment. However, in certain prescribed circumstances, 
such as death, ill health, redundancy, transfer of the 
employee’s employing business out of the Group or other 
circumstances at the discretion of the Committee (taking into 
account the individual’s performance and the reasons for 
their departure), ‘good leaver’ status can be applied. Under 
the EPSP, awards held by good leavers will usually be scaled 
back for the actual period of service and vest at the date 
of cessation although the Committee has the discretion to 
not scale back if it considers this is appropriate and also to 
determine that vesting should be at the usual time. DABP 
awards held by good leavers will usually vest on cessation 
or if the Committee determines at the usual vesting date. 
For share awards under the EPSP and held by good leavers, 
awards remain subject to the performance conditions. 
For all leavers, the Committee may also determine to 
make a payment in reimbursement of a reasonable level of 
outplacement and legal fees in connection with a settlement 
agreement as well as any statutory entitlement.
All non-executive Directors have letters of appointment with 
the Company for an initial period of three years, subject 
to annual reappointment at the AGM. The Chairman’s 
appointment may be terminated by the Company with one 
month’s notice. The appointment of the other non-executive 
Directors is terminable without notice. The appointment 
letters for the Chairman and non-executive Directors provide 
that no compensation is payable on termination, other than 
accrued fees and expenses.
Legacy arrangements
For the avoidance of doubt, in approving this remuneration 
policy, authority is given to the Company to honour any 
commitments entered into with current or former Directors 
(such as the payment of a pension or the vesting of share 
awards) that have been disclosed to shareholders in 
previous remuneration reports. Details of any payments 
to former Directors will be set out in the annual report on 
remuneration as they arise.

Annual Report on Remuneration
The Remuneration Committee
The members of the Committee are listed below. All are 
independent non-executive Directors, as defined in the 
UK Corporate Governance Code, with the exception of 
the Group Chairman, A Page, who was independent on 
appointment.
The members of the Committee during the last financial year

AJ Allner stepped down as a Committee member at the AGM 
in September 2016. He attended one meeting as a Committee 
member, the remainder he has attended by invitation. 
The CEO attends meetings by invitation and assists the 
Committee in its deliberations, except when issues relating 
to his remuneration are discussed. No Directors are involved 
in deciding their own remuneration. The Company Secretary 
acts as Secretary to the Committee. 
The Committee is advised by NBS, which was first appointed 
by the Committee in 2003. NBS advises the Committee 
on executive remuneration matters including topical 
remuneration issues which are of particular relevance to 
the Company, on incentive arrangements for the Directors 
and senior staff, on all employee share plans and on 
remuneration reporting and compliance matters. NBS liaises 
with the Committee Chairman and Company Secretary and 
considers how best it can work with the Company to meet 
the Committee’s needs.
The total fees paid to NBS in respect of its services to the 
Committee during the year were £32,708 (2016 – £29,947). 
The fees are predominantly charged on a ‘time spent’ basis.
NBS is a signatory to the Remuneration Consultants’ Code of 
Conduct. Neither NBS nor Aon plc overall provide any other 
services to the Company and the Committee is satisfied that 
the advice that it receives is objective and independent.
  The Committee’s terms of reference are available on the 
Company’s website. www.northgateplc.com
The Committee is responsible for making recommendations 
to the Board on the remuneration packages and terms and 
conditions of employment of the Chairman and the executive 
Directors of the Company as well as the Company Secretary.
The senior executives below Board level in the UK, Spain 
and Ireland, also have a significant influence on the ability of 
the Company to achieve its goals. Accordingly, in addition 
to setting the remuneration of the executive Directors, the 
Committee also reviews the remuneration for these senior 
employees to ensure that their rewards are competitive with 
the market and that they are appropriate relative to the 
Board and employees generally. The Committee also reviews 
remuneration policy generally throughout the Group.

This relates to the 2014 EPSP award, details of which are given on 
page 67 . The value of the options vesting in respect of FY2016 
shown in last year’s accounts of £505,000 was valued at the 
average closing share price over the last three months of that 
financial year of 385p per share. They have been restated using 
the actual share price on that date of vesting (9 July 2016) of 334p. 
The options vesting in respect of FY2017 are valued at the average 
closing price over the last three months of FY2017 of 543p.

The executive Directors are eligible for membership of a Group

In accordance with Bob Contreras’ Service Agreement and 
his agreement with the Company relating to the termination 
of his employment, following the Termination Date (11 
January 2017) Bob is entitled to receive a payment in lieu of 
his 12 month notice period. This payment is to be made in 
equal monthly instalments with any remuneration received 
during the 12 months following the Termination Date being 
offset against the monthly amount being paid to him by 
the Company, excluding the remuneration received by 
him from Speedy Hire Plc as a non-executive Director. His 
salary and benefits at Northgate as at the Termination Date 
equated to £499,320 per annum. The total amount paid 
in this financial year after he ceased to be a Director was 
therefore £195,746. Upon review an error in the calculation 
of the FY2016 bonus paid to Bob Contreras in July 2016 was 
identified. This error resulted in an overpayment of bonus in 
the sum of £41,000, split equally between shares and cash. 
Subsequently, using the clawback provisions of the  
bonus scheme all monies due have been repaid from the 
monthly installments of the pay in lieu of notice in May and 
June 2017.
Kevin Bradshaw was appointed to the Board on 11 January 
2017 at a basic salary of £408,000 per annum, which 
will be reviewed in May 2018 following an assessment 
of performance and a review of market conditions. His 
maximum annual bonus potential is 150% of basic salary 
and his maximum annual award level under the EPSP 
is 150% of salary. There was no buyout of incentive 
arrangements from his previous employer.
Annual bonus for the year ended 30 April 2017 (audited)
Deferred annual bonus plan
The bonus for the executive Directors in respect of the year under review was based as to 75% on Group PBT and 25% on 
strategic objectives, with a ROCE underpin below which no bonus would be payable, and a minimum PBT threshold. For the 
year ended 30 April 2017, the PBT threshold of £76.0m was not met and no bonus has been paid to any executive Directors. 
Vesting of EPSP awards 
The EPSP award granted on 27 June 2014 was based on performance over the three years ended 30 April 2017. As disclosed

in the salary, benefits and annual bonus for the CEO 
between the year under review and the previous financial 
year compared to that for the average UK employee. The 
Committee has chosen this comparator as it feels that it 
provides a more appropriate reflection of the earnings of 
the average worker than the movement in the Group’s total 
wage bill, which is distorted by movements in the number of 
employees and variations in wage practices in Spain.
Performance graph measured by TSR
As required by the Regulations, the graph below illustrates the 
performance of Northgate plc measured by Total Shareholder 
Return (share price growth plus dividends paid) against a 
‘broad equity market index’ over the last eight years. As the 
Company has been a constituent of the FTSE 250 index for 
the majority of that time, that index (excluding investment 
companies) is considered to be the most appropriate 
benchmark. The mid-market price of the Company’s Ordinary 
shares at 28 April 2017 was 535p (30 April 2016 – 403p). The 
range during the year was 323p to 645p.

The share price at 30 April 2017 was 535p.
DABP: Awards can be granted in two forms: (i) a Nil Cost 
Option over a number of shares (a ‘Deferred Award’) or 
(ii) a Nil Cost Option over a fixed value of shares (a ‘Linked 
Deferred Award’) granted in association with an HMRC 
Approved Option (an ’Approved Option’). The face value 
of Approved Options held at any one time may not exceed 
£30,000. The value of a Linked Deferred Award is capped at 
the original face value. Related Linked Deferred Awards and 
Approved Options must be exercised at the same time unless 
the Approved Option is ‘underwater’ and therefore lapses.
As an eligible leaver, Bob Contreras will be permitted to 
exercise all outstanding vested and unvested DABP awards 
for up to six months from his termination date, 11 January 
2017. Similarly, he will be permitted to exercise all vested but 
unexercised EPSP awards over the same period. Unvested 
EPSP awards will be considered for release, subject to the 
applicable performance conditions and pro rated for time,  
on the scheduled vesting dates.
SIP
The SIP, which is approved by HMRC under Schedule 8 
Finance Act 2000, was introduced in 2000 to provide 
employees at all levels with the opportunity to acquire shares 
in the Company on preferential terms. The Board believes 
that encouraging wider share ownership by all staff will have 
longer term benefits for the Company and for shareholders. 
The SIP operates under a trust deed, the Trustees being 
Capita IRG Trustees Limited (the Capita Trust).
To participate in the SIP, which operates on a yearly cycle, 
employees are required to make regular monthly savings 
(on which tax relief is obtained), by deduction from pay, for 
a year at the end of which these payments are used to buy 
shares in the Company (Partnership shares).
For each Partnership share acquired, the employee will 
receive one additional free share (Matching shares). Matching 
shares will normally be forfeited if, within three years of 
acquiring the Partnership shares, the employee either sells 
the Partnership shares or leaves the Group. After this three 
year period Partnership and Matching shares may be sold, 
although there are significant tax incentives to continue 
holding the shares in the scheme for a further two years. 
Those employees who are most committed to the Group will 
therefore receive the most benefit.
The sixteenth annual cycle ended in December 2016 and 
resulted in 509 employees acquiring 118,306 Partnership 
shares at 393.5p each and being allocated the same number 
of Matching shares. As at 30 April 2017 the Capita Trust 
held 1,386,214 Ordinary shares that have been allocated to 
employees from the first 16 cycles.
The seventeenth annual cycle started in January 2017 and 
currently some 600 employees are making contributions to 
the scheme at an annualised rate of £577,710.
During the year, an award of 155 free shares was made to all 
eligible employees with one year’s service. The total number 
of shares awarded was 223,355.
The executive Directors are entitled to participate in this 
scheme and to receive both Matching and Free shares.
Sourcing of shares
Shares to satisfy the requirements of the Group’s existing 
share schemes are currently sourced as follows:
DABP and MPSP
To date, awards under these two schemes have been 
satisfied through open market purchases by an employee 
benefit trust based in Guernsey (the Guernsey Trust). During 
the year 200,000 (2016 – 600,000) Ordinary shares were 
purchased by the Guernsey Trust and 305,507 (2016 – 
345,967) were used to satisfy the exercise of awards under 
the DABP and MPSP. At 30 April 2017 the Guernsey Trust 
held 708,221 (2016 – 1,899,747) Ordinary shares as a hedge 
against the Group’s obligations under these schemes.
The rules of both these schemes also allow new issue and 
treasury shares to be used to satisfy the vesting and exercise 
of awards, but to date the Board has chosen not to do so.
EPSP
Shares to satisfy the vesting of awards under the EPSP may 
be sourced either from new issue or through open market 
purchases. To date, all exercises have been satisfied by open 
market purchase.
SIP
Awards may be satisfied either by new issue or market 
purchase or by a combination of the two. The total number 
of shares required to satisfy the allocation made in January 
2017 was 236,612 (2016 – 230,532), of which 164,055 
were transferred from the Guernsey Trust, with the balance 
of 72,557 (2016 – 80,432) being shares already held by the 
Capita Trust from forfeiture during the year. The 223,355 
free shares referred to above were also sourced from the 
Guernsey Trust.
At 30 April 2017 the Capita Trust held 31,479 (2016 – 
17,186) Ordinary shares which had been forfeited as a result 
of early withdrawals post January 2017.
Overall plan limits and clawback
All the above schemes operate within the following limits: in 
any ten calendar year period, the Company may not issue (or 
grant rights to issue) more than:
a. 10% of the issued Ordinary share capital under all the 
share plans; and
b. 5% of the issued Ordinary share capital under the 
executive share plans (EPSP, DABP and MPSP).
The dilution position as at 30 April 2017 was 0.90% under 
the EPSP, MPSP and DABP and 1.34% under all schemes.
In line with current best practice guidelines, the Committee 
has introduced recovery provisions into the rules of all 
discretionary schemes, which can be invoked in the event of 
a number of situations including error, financial misstatement 
or gross misconduct and which apply to all awards made 
from 2010 onwards. 
The clawback mechanism was used in relation to Bob 
Contreras’ FY2016 bonus as detailed on page 67.

REMUNERATION 
REPORT
Annual Report on Remuneration
Directors’ shareholding and share interests
The executive Directors are required to build up a 
shareholding equivalent to 150% of salary, to be achieved 
primarily through the retention, after tax, of share options 
exercised under the long term incentive share plans, until 
such time as their share ownership target has been met. 
Directors are not required to go into the market to purchase 
shares, although any shares so acquired would count 
towards meeting the guidelines. It is proposed that the 
minimum shareholding increases to 200% of salary for the 
next and future financial years. This proposal is set out as an 
amendment to the remuneration policy.
The Chairman and non-executive Directors are not subject 
to a formal shareholding guideline. Details of the Directors’ 
interests in shares are shown in the table opposite:

Performance targets for the annual bonus and EPSP awards to be granted in 2017
For 2017, the annual bonus will be based on 75% PBT and a range of strategic and operational objectives for the remaining 
25%, with a ROCE underpin.
The Committee has chosen not to disclose, in advance, the performance targets for the annual bonus for the forthcoming 
year as these include items which the Committee considers commercially sensitive. Full retrospective disclosure of the targets 
and performance against them will be seen in next year’s annual report on remuneration.
The EPSP awards to be granted in 2017 will be subject to two separate performance conditions, with EPS accounting for 60% 
of the award and TSR compared to the FTSE 250 (Excluding Investment Trusts) Index of Companies for the remaining 40%. 
The performance conditions are as follows with intermediate vesting between the threshold and stretch targets:
Performance condition
Threshold target 
(25% vesting)
Stretch target
(100% vesting) End measurement point
EPS (60% of award) CPI +3% p.a. CPI +11% p.a.
Final year of the 
performance period
TSR (40% of award) Median Upper quartile
End of the three year 
performance period
In addition, no awards will vest unless the Committee is satisfied that the underlying financial and operational performance of 
the business has been satisfactory.
Award levels for 2017 will be 150% of salary for the EPSP for both the CEO and CFO. Annual bonus opportunity will be 150% 
of salary for the CEO and 100% of salary for the CFO.

REPORT OF  
THE DIRECTORS
The Directors present their report and the 
audited consolidated accounts for the year 
ended 30 April 2017.
Results
Details on financial performance and 
dividends can be found in the Strategic 
Report from pages 8 to 39.
Close company status 
So far as the Directors are aware the close 
company provisions of the Income and 
Corporation Taxes Act 1988 do not apply to 
the Company.
Capital structure 
Details of the issued share capital, together 
with details of any movements during the 
year, are shown in Note 23. The Company 
has one class of Ordinary share which carries 
no right to fixed income. Each share carries 
the right to one vote at general meetings of 
the Company. 
The cumulative Preference shares of 
50p each entitle the holder to receive a 
cumulative preferential dividend at the rate 
of 5% on the paid up capital and the right 
to a return of capital at either winding up 
or a repayment of capital. The cumulative 
Preference shares do not entitle the holders 
to any further or other participation in the 
profits or assets of the Company. 
The percentage of the issued nominal value 
of the Ordinary shares is 99.255% of the 
total issued nominal value of all share capital. 
There are no specific restrictions on the size 
of a holding nor on the transfer of shares, 
which are both governed by the general 
provisions of the Articles of Association 
(the Articles) and prevailing legislation. The 
Directors are not aware of any agreements 
between holders of the Company’s shares 
that may result in restrictions on the transfer 
of securities or on voting rights. 
Details of employee share schemes are set 
out in the Remuneration Report. Shares 
held by the Capita Trust are voted on the 
instructions of the employees on whose 
behalf they are held. Shares in the Guernsey 
Trust are voted at the discretion of the 
Trustees.
No person has any special rights of control 
over the Company’s share capital and all 
issued shares are fully paid. 
With regards to the appointment and 
replacement of Directors, the Company is 
governed by the Articles, the UK Corporate 
Governance Code, the Companies Act and 
related legislation. The Articles themselves 
may be amended by special resolution of the 
shareholders. The powers of Directors are 
set out in the Articles. 
The Directors are not aware of any 
agreements between the Company and 
its Directors or employees that provide 
for compensation for loss of office or 
employment that occurs because of a 
change of control.
Interests in shares
The following interests in the issued Ordinary share capital of the Company have been 
notified to the Company in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 5 of the Disclosure  
and Transparency Rules:

joined the Board in June 2016.
Resolutions to reappoint each of the 
Directors in office at the date of this report 
will be proposed at the AGM.
Termination provisions in respect of 
executive Directors’ contracts can be found 
in the Remuneration policy, starting on  
page 56.
Directors’ indemnities 
As permitted by the Company’s Articles 
of Association, qualifying third party 
indemnities for each Director of the 
Company were in place throughout their 
periods of office during the year and, for 
those currently in office, remained in force  
as at the date of signing of this report.

Employee consultation 
Employees are kept informed on matters 
affecting them as employees and on various 
issues affecting the performance of the 
Group through CEO briefing updates, 
announcements on the Group’s intranet, 
formal and informal meetings at local level 
and direct written communications. All 
employees are eligible to participate on an 
equal basis in the Group’s SIP, which has 
been running successfully since its inception 
in 2000.
Disabled employees 
Applications for employment by disabled 
persons are given full consideration, taking 
into account the aptitudes of the applicant 
concerned. Every effort is made to try to 
ensure that employees who become disabled 
whilst already employed are able to continue 
in employment by making reasonable 
adjustments in the workplace, arranging 
appropriate training or providing suitable 
alternative employment. It is Group policy 
that the training, career development and 
promotion of disabled persons should,  
as far as possible, be the same as that of 
other employees. 
The Group’s equal opportunity policy is 
available on the Company’s website:
 www.northgateplc.com
Political donations 
No political donations were made by any 
Group company in the year. 
Greenhouse gas emissions 
The disclosures concerning greenhouse 
gas emissions required by the Large and 
Medium-sized Companies and Groups 
(Accounts and Reports) Regulations are 
included in the CSR section of the Strategic 
Report on pages 34 to 39.
Remuneration report 
The Directors’ Remuneration report contains: 
 | A statement by Jill Caseberry, Chairman 
of the Company’s Remuneration 
Committee; 
 | The Directors’ remuneration policy; and
 | The Annual report on remuneration, 
which sets out payments made in the 
financial year ended 30 April 2017.
The statement by the Chairman and Annual 
report on remuneration will be put to 
an advisory shareholder vote by ordinary 
resolution. 
The policy part of the Report, which sets 
out the Company’s forward looking policy 
on Directors’ remuneration (including the 
approach to exit payments to Directors), 
is subject to a binding shareholder vote by 
ordinary resolution at least every three years. 
The vote on the policy document included in 
this report will be held in September 2017. 
This policy, if approved, will take effect 
from the end of the AGM and be in place 
for three financial years. If the Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy is not approved, the 
Company will, if and to the extent permitted 
by the Companies Act 2006, continue to 
make payments to Directors in accordance 
with existing contractual arrangements and 
will seek shareholder approval for a revised 
policy as soon as is practicable.
The Directors’ remuneration report can be 
found on pages 54 to 73.
Power to allot shares 
The present authority of the Directors to 
allot shares was granted at the AGM held 
in September 2016 and expires at the 
forthcoming AGM. A resolution to renew 
that authority for a period expiring at the 
conclusion of the AGM to be held in 2018 
will be proposed at the AGM. The authority 
will permit the Directors to allot up to an 
aggregate nominal amount of £22m of 
share capital which represents approximately 
33% of the present issued Ordinary share 
capital and is within the limits approved by 
the Investment Association and the National 
Association of Pension Funds. 
The Directors have no present intention 
of exercising such authority and no issue 
of shares which would effectively alter 
the control of the Company will be made 
without the prior approval of shareholders in 
a general meeting. 
A special resolution will be proposed to 
renew the authority of the Directors to 
allot Ordinary shares for cash other than to 
existing shareholders on a proportionate 
basis in accordance with the best practice 
guidance set out in the Statement of 
Principles issued by The Pre-Emption Group 
and which has been endorsed by the 
Investment Association. This authority will 
be limited to:
 | Firstly, an aggregate nominal amount of 
£3,330,000, representing approximately 
5% of the current issued Ordinary share 
capital (Resolution 14b); and 
 | Secondly, a further 5% of the 
Company’s share capital, provided 
that this additional power is only used 
in connection with acquisitions and 
specified capital investments which are 
announced contemporaneously with 
the issue or which have taken place in 
the preceding six month period and are 
disclosed in the announcement of the 
issue (Resolution 15).
The 2015 Statement of Principles defines 
a ‘specified capital investment’ as “one or 
more specific capital investment related uses 
for the proceeds of an issuance of equity 
securities, in respect of which sufficient 
information regarding the effect of the 
transaction on the listed company, the assets 
the subject of the transaction and (where 
appropriate) the profits attributable to them 
is made available to shareholders to enable 
them to reach an assessment of the potential 
return”. Items that are regarded as operating 
expenditure rather than capital expenditure 
will not typically be regarded as falling within 
the term ‘specified capital investment’.

REPORT OF  
THE DIRECTORS
CONTINUED
The Directors have no present intention of 
exercising this authority and confirm their 
intention to follow the provisions of The 
Pre-Emption Group’s Statement of Principles 
regarding cumulative use of such authorities 
within a rolling three year period. The 
Principles provide that companies should 
not issue shares for cash representing more 
than 7.5% of the Company’s issued share 
capital in any rolling three year period, other 
than to existing shareholders, without prior 
consultation with shareholders. This limit 
excludes any Ordinary shares issued pursuant 
to a general disapplication of pre-emption 
rights in connection with an acquisition or 
specified capital investment.
Disclosure of information under 
Listing Rule 9.8.4
Dividend waiver arrangements are in  
place for the employee trusts as shown on 
page 71.
Length of notice of  
general meetings 
The minimum notice period permitted by the 
Companies Act 2006 for general meetings 
of listed companies is 21 days, but the Act 
provides that companies may reduce this 
period to 14 days (other than for AGMs) 
provided that two conditions are met. The 
first condition is that the Company offers a 
facility for shareholders to vote by electronic 
means. This condition is met if the Company 
offers a facility, accessible to all shareholders, 
to appoint a proxy by means of a website. 
Please refer to Note 6 to the Notice of AGM 
on page 125 for details of the Company’s 
arrangements for electronic proxy 
appointment. The second condition is that 
there is an annual resolution of shareholders 
approving the reduction of the minimum 
notice period from 21 days to 14 days. 
A resolution to approve 14 days as the 
minimum period of notice for all general 
meetings of the Company other than AGMs 
will be proposed at the AGM. The approval 
will be effective until the Company’s next 
AGM, when it is intended that the approval 
be renewed.
It is the Board’s intention that this authority 
would not be used as a matter of routine 
but only when merited by the circumstances 
of the meeting and in the best interests of 
shareholders.
Authority for the Company to 
purchase its own shares 
There is no present intention to buy back 
any of the Company’s own shares and, 
if granted, the authority would only be 
exercised if to do so would result in an 
improvement in earnings per share for 
remaining shareholders.
The Directors propose to renew the general 
authority of the Company to make market 
purchases of its own shares to a total of 
13,300,000 Ordinary shares (representing 
approximately 10% of the issued Ordinary 
share capital) and within the price 
constraints set out in the special resolution 
to be proposed at the AGM. 
Financial instruments 
Details of the Group’s use of financial 
instruments are given in the Financial review 
on pages 18 to 25 and in Notes 21 and 29 to 
the accounts.
Auditor 
In the case of each of the persons who are 
Directors of the Company at the date when 
this report was approved:
 | So far as each of the Directors is aware, 
there is no relevant audit information of 
which the Company’s auditor is unaware; 
and 
 | Each of the Directors has taken all the 
steps that they ought to have taken as 
a Director to make himself aware of any 
relevant audit information (as defined) 
and to establish that the Company’s 
auditor is aware of that information.
This confirmation is given and should be

STATEMENT OF 
DIRECTORS’ 
RESPONSIBILITIES
The Directors are responsible for preparing 
the Annual Report, the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report and the financial 
statements in accordance with applicable 
law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to 
prepare financial statements for each 
financial year. Under that law the Directors 
have prepared the Group and Parent 
Company financial statements in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European 
Union. Under company law the Directors 
must not approve the financial statements 
unless they are satisfied that they give a 
true and fair view of the state of affairs of 
the Group and the Company and of the 
profit or loss of the Group for that period. 
In preparing these financial statements, the 
Directors are required to:
 | Select suitable accounting policies and 
then apply them consistently;
 | Make judgements and accounting 
estimates that are reasonable and 
prudent;
 | State whether applicable IFRS as 
adopted by the European Union have 
been followed, subject to any material 
departures disclosed and explained in the 
financial statements;
 | Prepare the financial statements on 
the going concern basis unless it is 
inappropriate to presume that the 
Company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping 
adequate accounting records that are 
sufficient to show and explain the 
Company’s transactions and disclose with 
reasonable accuracy at any time the financial 
position of the Company and the Group 
and enable them to ensure that the financial 
statements and the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report comply with the Companies Act 
2006 and, as regards the Group financial 
statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. 
They are also responsible for safeguarding 
the assets of the Company and the Group 
and hence for taking reasonable steps for 
the prevention and detection of fraud and 
other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the 
maintenance and integrity of the Company’s 
website. Legislation in the United Kingdom 
governing the preparation and dissemination 
of financial statements may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions. 
The Directors consider that the Annual 
report and accounts, taken as a whole, 
is fair, balanced and understandable and 
provides the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the Company’s 
performance, business model and strategy. 
Each of the Directors, whose names and 
functions are listed in ‘Board of Directors’ on 
pages 42 to 43, confirm that, to the best of 
their knowledge:
 | The Group financial statements, which 
have been prepared in accordance with 
IFRS as adopted by the EU, give a true 
and fair view of the assets, liabilities, 
financial position and profit of the Group; 
and
 | The Strategic report includes a fair review 
of the development and performance 
of the business and the position of the 
Group, together with a description of  
the principal risks and uncertainties that 
it faces.

Report on the financial statements
Our opinion
In our opinion:
 | Northgate plc’s Group financial statements and 
Parent Company financial statements (the “financial 
statements”) give a true and fair view of the state of 
the Group’s and of the Parent Company’s affairs as at 
30 April 2017 and of the Group’s profit and the Group’s 
and the Parent Company’s cash flows for the year then 
ended;
 | the Group financial statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”) as adopted by the 
European Union;
 | the Parent Company financial statements have been 
properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted 
by the European Union and as applied in accordance with 
the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and
 | the financial statements have been prepared in 
accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 
2006 and, as regards the Group financial statements, 
Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
What we have audited
The financial statements, included within the Annual Report 
and Accounts (the “Annual Report”), comprise:
 | the Balance sheets as at 30 April 2017;
 | the Consolidated income statement for the year then 
ended;
 | the Statements of comprehensive income for the year 
then ended;
 | the Cash flow statements for the year then ended;
 | the Statements of changes in equity for the year then 
ended; and
 | the notes to the financial statements, which include a 
summary of significant accounting policies and other 
explanatory information.

the European Union, and applicable law and, as regards the Parent Company financial statements, as applied in accordance 
with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
Our audit approach
Overview
  
  
Materiality
Audit scope
Areas
of focus
 
 | Overall Group materiality: £3.6m which represents 5% of profit before tax.
 | Northgate plc has two principal trading components in the UK and Spain, both of which 
are financially significant components for the Group audit.
 | In aggregate full scope audits of these components provided us with the evidence required 
to form an opinion on the financial statements. Collectively the scope of our work covered 
97% of revenue, 96% of total assets and 91% of profit before tax.
The key areas of focus for our audit, as set out below, are:
 | Determining appropriate depreciation rates for vehicles available for hire.
 | The recoverability of aged trade receivables.
 | Provisions for uncertain tax positions.
The scope of our audit and our areas of focus
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) (“ISAs (UK & Ireland)”).
We designed our audit by determining materiality and assessing the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements. 
In particular, we looked at where the Directors made subjective judgements, for example in respect of significant accounting 
estimates that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain. As in all of our audits 
we also addressed the risk of management override of internal controls, including evaluating whether there was evidence of 
bias by the directors that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud. 
The risks of material misstatement that had the greatest effect on our audit, including the allocation of our resources and 
effort, are identified as “areas of focus” in the table below. We have also set out how we tailored our audit to address these 
specific areas in order to provide an opinion on the financial statements as a whole, and any comments we make on the 
results of our procedures should be read in this context. This is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit. 
Northgateplc.com    stock code: NTG 25361.02     13-6-17   Proof Four
Area of focus How our audit addressed the area of focus
Determining appropriate depreciation rates  
for vehicles available for hire
The net book value of vehicle assets for hire at 30 April 2017 is £731.7m (2016: £684.5m) 
with a depreciation charge for the year of £149.7m (2016: £137.7m). IAS 16 ‘Property, Plant 
and Equipment’ requires that depreciation rates and estimated useful lives are reviewed 
regularly to ensure that the net book value of tangible fixed assets when they are sold is 
broadly equivalent to their market value.
This requires management to make an estimate of the sale proceeds at the time of disposal. 
Determining likely sales proceeds for future vehicle disposals is judgemental and requires 
a number of key estimates to be made, including the age, condition and mileage of each 
vehicle, the method of selling a vehicle and expected future market conditions, such as 
forecast levels of supply and demand.
Further explanation is included in the Group’s critical accounting judgements and key 
sources of estimation uncertainty in Note 3, the Audit Committee report on page 51 and 
Note 14.
We examined management’s assumptions of expected future market values of hire vehicles 
used in the calculation by comparison to external third party industry data for expected 
future market prices.
We considered the historical accuracy of expected future market values by comparison to 
actual values achieved.
We tested the assumption of the level of vehicle registrations to third party, publicly available 
data and recalculated the impact of a reduction in fleet age on disposal profits.
We performed detailed testing of the calculations supporting these judgements, including 
comparison to recent actual market prices achieved on disposal of similar vehicles.
From the work we performed we did not identify any material misstatements.
The recoverability of aged trade receivables
Trade receivables are stated in the balance sheet at their fair value less any provision for 
irrecoverable amounts. At 30 April 2017 net trade receivables were £53.7m (2016: £58.1m) 
after provisions of £13.9m (2016: £12.8m).
Determining an appropriate provision for potentially irrecoverable trade receivables requires 
judgement across the Group’s large and diverse customer base of the likely levels of recovery 
of these receivables along with the consideration of the overall economic environments in 
the UK, Ireland and Spain.
Further details are included in the Group’s critical accounting judgements and key sources  
of estimation uncertainty in Note 3, the Audit Committee report on pages 51 to 53 and 
Note 18.
We recalculated provisions to test whether they were calculated in accordance with Group 
policy.
We examined the levels of post year end cash collections against year end trade receivables 
and investigated individual overdue balances, by reference to recent history of recoveries and 
correspondence with customers.
To assess the reasonableness of provisions we tested the age profile of the trade receivables 
balance back to a sample of invoices raised. We considered the collectability of individual 
balances raised more than 90 days, by reference to recent history of recoveries and 
correspondence with customers.
We also performed look back testing to consider management’s historical accuracy of 
provisioning for trade receivables.
From the work we performed we did not identify any material misstatements.
Provisions for uncertain tax positions
We focused on this area due to the judgment required in assessing the need for provisions 
to cover the risk of challenge of certain of the Group’s tax positions, which have been taken 
as current tax deductions in the current and previous years.
Uncertain tax provisions at the year end totalled £14.3m (2016: £14.2m).
We evaluated and challenged management’s rationale for the level of provisions held. We 
considered the status of recent and current tax audits and enquiries, the out-turn of previous 
claims and the tax environment in each territory. We also considered any penalty regimes 
that could apply should any of the Group’s tax positions be challenged successfully.
From the work we performed we did not identify any material misstatements.

How we tailored the audit scope
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to 
give an opinion on the financial statements as a whole, taking into account the geographic 
structure of the Group, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which the 
Group operates. 
Northgate plc has two principal trading components in the UK and Spain, a smaller trading 
component in Ireland and a non-trading component in Malta, overseen by a Group function 
in the UK.
The subsidiary businesses in the UK and Spain were financially significant components for the 
Group audit. 
The UK audit team performed the audit of Northgate’s UK business and received an audit 
opinion from the PwC member firm in Spain on Northgate Spain. 
We ensured that appropriate further audit work was undertaken for Northgate plc as the 
Parent Company. This included audit work on, for example, centrally held tax provisions, 
accounting for financial hedging instruments, the consolidation of the Group’s results, the 
preparation of the financial statements, assessing the appropriate classification of exceptional 
items and work on certain disclosures within the Directors’ remuneration report.
We were in active dialogue throughout the year with the team responsible for the audit of 
Northgate Spain; this included consideration of how they planned and performed their work, 
visiting the business once during the year and attending the audit closing meeting, which was 
also attended by the Northgate Spain Finance Director. 
Materiality
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. We set certain 
quantitative thresholds for materiality. These, together with qualitative considerations, 
helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit 
procedures on the individual financial statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating 
the effect of misstatements, both individually and on the financial statements as a whole. 
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements 
as a whole as follows:
Overall Group materiality £3.6m (2016: £3.9m).
How we determined it 5% of profit before tax.
Rationale for benchmark 
applied
We believe a standard benchmark of 5% of profit before 
tax is an appropriate quantitative indicator of materiality, 
although of course an item could also be material 
for qualitative reasons. We selected profit before tax 
because management believes it best reflects the 
performance of Northgate plc.
Component materiality For each component in our audit scope, we allocated a 
materiality that is less than our overall Group materiality. 
The range of materiality allocated across components 
was £2.2m for Northgate Spain to £3.0m for Northgate 
UK. Certain components were audited to a local 
statutory audit materiality that was also less than our 
overall Group materiality.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified 
during our audit above £180,000 (2016: £200,000) as well as misstatements below that 
amount that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.
Going concern
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the Directors’ statement, set out on page 
24, in relation to going concern. We have nothing to report having performed our review. 
Under ISAs (UK & Ireland) we are required to report to you if we have anything material 
to add or to draw attention to in relation to the Directors’ statement about whether they 
considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial 
statements. We have nothing material to add or to draw attention to.

As noted in the Directors’ statement, the Directors have concluded that it is appropriate 
to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements. The going concern 
basis presumes that the Group and Parent Company have adequate resources to remain 
in operation, and that the Directors intend them to do so, for at least one year from the 
date the financial statements were signed. As part of our audit we have concluded that the 
Directors’ use of the going concern basis is appropriate. However, because not all future 
events or conditions can be predicted, these statements are not a guarantee as to the 
Group’s and Parent Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.

Consistency of other information and compliance  
with applicable requirements
Companies Act 2006 reporting

The Directors’ assessment of the prospects of the Group and of the principal 
risks that would threaten the solvency or liquidity of the Group
Under ISAs (UK & Ireland) we are required to report to you if we have 
anything material to add or to draw attention to in relation to:
 | the Directors’ confirmation on page 28 of the Annual Report, in 
accordance with provision C.2.1 of the Code, that they have carried out 
a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the Group, including 
those that would threaten its business model, future performance, 
solvency or liquidity.
We have 
nothing 
material 
to add or 
to draw

 | the disclosures in the Annual Report that describe those risks and 
explain how they are being managed or mitigated.
We have 
nothing 
material 
to add or 
to draw

 | the Directors’ explanation on page 33 of the Annual Report, in 
accordance with provision C.2.2 of the Code, as to how they have 
assessed the prospects of the Group, over what period they have 
done so and why they consider that period to be appropriate, and 
their statement as to whether they have a reasonable expectation that 
the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities 
as they fall due over the period of their assessment, including any 
related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or 
assumptions.
We have 
nothing 
material 
to add or 
to draw 
attention to.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the Directors’ statement 
that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing 
the Group and the Directors’ statement in relation to the longer-term 
viability of the group. Our review was substantially less in scope than an 
audit and only consisted of making enquiries and considering the Directors’ 
process supporting their statements; checking that the statements are 
in alignment with the relevant provisions of the Code; and considering 
whether the statements are consistent with the knowledge acquired by us 
in the course of performing our audit. We have nothing to report having 
performed our review.
Adequacy of accounting records and information and explanations received
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
 | we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or
 | adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent Company, or returns 
adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or
 | the Parent Company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report to be audited are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns.
 | We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.

disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made. We have no exceptions 
to report arising from this responsibility. 
Corporate governance statement
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, a 
corporate governance statement has not been prepared by the Parent Company. We have no

Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit
Our responsibilities and those of the Directors
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities set out on page 77, the Directors are 
responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they 
give a true and fair view.
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance 
with applicable law and ISAs (UK & Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the 
Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the Parent Company’s 
members as a body in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and 
for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for 
any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands 
it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
What an audit of financial statements involves
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial 
statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from 
material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: 
 | whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and the Parent Company’s 
circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; 
 | the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the Directors; and
 | the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
We primarily focus our work in these areas by assessing the Directors’ judgements against 
available evidence, forming our own judgements, and evaluating the disclosures in the 
financial statements.
We test and examine information, using sampling and other auditing techniques, to the 
extent we consider necessary to provide a reasonable basis for us to draw conclusions. We 
obtain audit evidence through testing the effectiveness of controls, substantive procedures or 
a combination of both. 
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report to 
identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and to identify any 
information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, 
the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware 
of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for 
our report. With respect to the Strategic Report, Report of the Directors and Corporate 
Governance Statement, we consider whether those reports include the disclosures required 
by applicable legal requirements.

NOTES TO  
THE ACCOUNTS
1 General information
Northgate plc is a company incorporated in England and 
Wales under the Companies Act 2006. The address of the 
registered office is given on page 128. The nature of the 
Group’s operations and its principal activities are set out in 
the Strategic report on pages 8 to 39.
The accounts are presented in UK Sterling because this is 
the currency of the primary economic environment in which 
the Group operates. Foreign operations are included in 
accordance with the policies set out in Note 2.
2 Principal accounting policies
Statement of compliance
The accounts have been prepared in accordance with IFRS, 
adopted by the EU and therefore the Group accounts comply 
with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.
Basis of preparation
The financial information has been prepared on the 
historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of certain 
financial instruments. The accounts have been prepared in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, 
Interpretations Committee (IFRS-IC) interpretations and the 
Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting 
under IFRS. 
 
Going concern
Having assessed the principal risks and the other matters 
discussed in connection with the viability statement on page 
33 the Directors considered it appropriate to adopt the 
going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial 
statements.
Changes in accounting policy
Annual improvements 2014, IFRS 14 (Regulatory deferral 
accounts), IFRS 11 (Joint arrangements), IAS 16 (Property, 
plant and equipment), IAS 41 (Agriculture), IAS 38 (Intangible 
assets), IAS 27 (Separate financial statements), IAS 1 
(Presentation of financial statements), IFRS 10 (Consolidated 
financial statements) and IAS 28 (Investments in associates) 
became effective or were amended during the year but 
had no impact on the financial statements. Various new 
accounting standards and amendments were endorsed 
during the year, none of which have had or are expected 
to have any significant impact on the Group. As a result of 
the clarification of an accounting standard, cash and cash 
equivalents and bank overdrafts are now shown gross, 
even where accounts have a right of offset within the same 
banking facility. The comparatives as at 30 April 2016 have 
been restated to increase cash and bank balances and bank 
overdrafts by £36,500,000. IFRS 9 (Financial instruments) 
and IFRS 15 (Revenue from contracts with customers) will be 
effective from 1 May 2018 but neither are expected to have 
a significant impact on the Group’s reported results.
Basis of consolidation
Subsidiary undertakings are entities controlled by the 
Company. Control exists when the Company is exposed, or 
has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the 
subsidiary and has the ability to affect those returns through 
its power over the subsidiary. The consolidated accounts 
include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiary 
undertakings made up to 30 April 2016 and 30 April 2017.
On acquisition, the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities 
of a subsidiary undertaking are measured at their fair 
values at the date of acquisition. Any excess of the cost of 
acquisition over the fair values of the identifiable net assets 
acquired is recognised as goodwill. Any deficiency of the cost 
of acquisition below the fair values of the identifiable net 
assets acquired (i.e. discount on acquisition) is credited to the 
income statement in the period of acquisition.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the accounts 
of subsidiary undertakings to bring the accounting policies 
used into line with those used by the Group. All intra-Group 
transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated 
on consolidation.
Revenue recognition
Group revenue is measured at the fair value of the 
consideration received or receivable in respect of the hire 
of vehicles, sale of used vehicles and the supply of related 
goods and services in the normal course of business, net of 
value added tax and discounts.
Revenue from vehicle hire is recognised evenly over the 
hire period. Revenue from sales of other related goods and 
services is recognised at the point at which the goods or 
services are provided.
Revenue from the sale of used vehicles is recognised at the 
point of sale, which is usually represented by the point at 
which the customer takes possession of the vehicle. Where 
cash is received in advance of customers collecting or taking 
delivery of vehicles, revenue is recognised subject to the bill 
and hold criteria of IAS 18 (Revenue) being met.
Goodwill
All business combinations are accounted for by applying the 
acquisition method. Goodwill represents amounts arising on 
acquisition of subsidiary undertakings and is the difference 
between the cost of the acquisition and the fair value of the 
net identifiable assets and liabilities acquired.
Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment 
losses identified through annual or other tests for 
impairment. Any impairment is recognised immediately in 
the income statement and is not subsequently reversed.
Intangible assets – arising on business 
combinations
Amortisation of intangible assets is charged to the income 
statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful 
lives of each intangible asset. Intangible assets are amortised 
from the date they are available for use. The estimated useful 
lives are as follows:
Customer relationships 5 to 13 years
Northgateplc.com    stock code: NTG 25361.02     13-6-17   Proof Four
Intangible assets – other
Other intangible assets that are acquired by the Group are 
stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment 
losses. Software assets are amortised on a straight-line basis 
over their estimated useful lives, which range from three to 
10 years.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost, less 
accumulated depreciation and any provision for impairment. 
Certain properties were revalued prior to the adoption 
of IFRS. These valuations were treated as deemed cost at 
the time of adopting IFRS for the first time. Depreciation 
is provided so as to write off the cost of assets to residual 
values on a straight-line basis over the assets’ useful 
estimated lives as follows:
Freehold buildings 50 years
Leasehold buildings 50 years or over the life of  
 the lease, whichever is  
 shorter 
Plant, equipment & fittings 3 to 10 years
Vehicles for hire 3 to 12 years
Motor vehicles 3 to 6 years
Vehicles for hire are depreciated on a straight-line basis 
using depreciation rates that reflect economic lives of 
between three and 12 years, averaging around six years. 
These depreciation rates have been determined with the 
anticipation that the net book values at the point the 
vehicles are transferred into inventories is in line with the 
open market values for those vehicles. Depreciation charges 
reflect adjustments made as a result of differences between 
expected and actual residual values of used vehicles, taking 
into account the further directly attributable costs to sell the 
vehicles.
Freehold land is not depreciated.
On the subsequent sale or retirement of properties revalued 
prior to the adoption of IFRS, the attributable revaluation 
surplus remaining in the revaluation reserve is transferred 
directly to retained earnings. The residual value, if not 
insignificant, is reassessed annually.
Investments in subsidiaries
Investments in subsidiaries are shown at cost less any 
provision for impairment.
Impairment
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying 
amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine 
whether there is any indication that those assets have 
suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, 
the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to 
determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any).
The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less 
selling costs and value in use. In assessing value in use, the 
estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present 
value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current 
market assessments of the time value of money and the risks 
specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash 
flows have not been adjusted.
An impairment loss is recognised in the income statement 
whenever the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its 
recoverable amount. Impairment losses recognised in 
respect of cash generating units are allocated first to reduce 
the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to cash 
generating units and then to reduce the carrying amount of 
other assets in the unit on a pro-rata basis.
Where an impairment loss has been recognised in an 
earlier period, the Group reassesses whether there are any 
indications that such impairment has decreased or no longer 
exists. If an impairment has decreased or no longer exists, an 
impairment reversal is recognised in the income statement to 
the extent required.
Non-current assets held for sale
Non-current assets are classified as held for sale when their 
carrying amount is to be recovered principally through a sale 
transaction and a sale is considered highly probable. They 
are stated at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less 
costs to sell.
Inventories
Used vehicles held for resale are valued at the lower of cost 
or net realisable value. Net realisable value represents the 
estimated selling price less costs to be incurred in marketing, 
selling and distribution.
Other inventories comprise spare parts and consumables and 
are valued at the lower of cost or net realisable value.
Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently 
payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the 
year and any amounts outstanding in relation to previous 
years. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the 
income statement because it excludes items of income or 
expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it 
further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable 
on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and 
liabilities in the accounts and the corresponding tax bases 
used in the computation of taxable profit and is accounted 
for using the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax 
liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary 
differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the 
extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available 
against which deductible temporary differences can be 
utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the 
temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial 
recognition (other than in a business combination) of other 
assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the 
tax profit nor the accounting profit.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at 
each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it 
is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be 
available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary 
differences arising on investments in subsidiaries except 
where the Group is able to control the reversal of the 
temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary 
difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

NOTES TO 
THE ACCOUNTS 
CONTINUED
2 Principal accounting policies continued
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected 
to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset 
is realised.
Current and deferred tax is charged or credited in the 
income statement, except when it relates to items charged 
or credited directly to equity, in which case the current or 
deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Financial instruments and hedge accounting
Financial assets and liabilities are recognised in the Group’s 
balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the 
contractual provision of the instrument.
Trade receivables are non-interest bearing and are initially 
stated at their fair value and subsequently at amortised cost 
less any appropriate provision for irrecoverable amounts. 
Trade payables are non-interest bearing and are stated 
initially at their fair value and subsequently at amortised cost.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its 
exposure to interest and foreign exchange rate risks arising 
from operational, financing and investment activities. In 
accordance with its treasury policy, the Group does not hold 
or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.
Derivative financial instruments are stated at fair value. Any 
gain or loss on remeasurement to fair value is recognised 
immediately in the income statement except where 
derivatives qualify for hedge accounting, where recognition 
of the resultant gain or loss depends on the nature of the 
items being hedged.
The fair value of interest rate derivatives is the estimated 
amount that the Group would receive or pay to terminate 
the derivative at the balance sheet date, taking into account 
current interest rates and the current creditworthiness of the 
derivative counterparties.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments 
that are designated and effective as hedges of future cash 
flows are recognised in other comprehensive income and the 
ineffective portion is recognised in the income statement. 
Amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive 
income and accumulated in equity are reclassified to profit 
or loss in the periods when the hedged item is recognised 
in profit or loss, in the same line of the income statement as 
the recognised hedged item.
However, when the forecast transaction that is hedged 
results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or a non-
financial liability, the gains and losses previously accumulated 
in equity are transferred from equity and included in the 
initial measurement of the cost of the non-financial asset or 
non-financial liability.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments 
that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in 
the income statement as they arise.
Hedge accounting for cash flow hedges is discontinued 
when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, 
exercised or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. At that 
time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument 
recognised in equity is retained in equity until the forecasted 
transaction occurs. If a hedged transaction is no longer 
expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised 
in equity is transferred to the income statement as a net 
profit or loss for the period.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments 
that are designated and effective as net investment hedges 
are recognised directly in equity and the ineffective portion 
is recognised in the income statement. Exchange differences 
arising on the net investment hedges are transferred to the 
translation reserve.
No derivative assets and liabilities are offset. Certain 
customer rebates, which will be settled in cash, are offset 
against the trade receivables balance until such time as these 
are settled.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash at bank and in 
hand and bank overdrafts. Cash at bank and in hand and 
bank overdrafts are shown gross irrespective of where 
accounts have a right of offset within the same banking 
facility. 
Bank loans, other loans, loan notes and issue 
costs
Bank loans, other loans and loan notes are stated initially at 
fair value – the amount of proceeds after deduction of issue 
costs – and then subsequently at amortised cost. Finance 
charges, including premiums payable on settlement or 
redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for in the 
income statement on an accruals basis.
Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies other than UK Sterling are 
recorded at the rate prevailing at the date of the transaction. 
At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities 
that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated 
at the rates prevailing at that date.
The net assets of overseas subsidiary undertakings are 
translated into UK Sterling at the rate of exchange ruling at 
the balance sheet date. The exchange difference arising on 
the retranslation of opening net assets is recognised directly 
in equity. The results of overseas subsidiary undertakings 
are translated into UK Sterling using average exchange 
rates for the financial period and variances compared with 
the exchange rate at the balance sheet date are recognised 
directly in equity. All other translation differences are taken 
to the income statement with the exception of exchange 
differences on foreign currency borrowings that provide 
a hedge against Group equity investments in foreign 
enterprises, which are recognised directly in equity, together 
with the exchange difference on the net investment in these 
enterprises.

Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisition 
of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of 
the foreign entity. They are denominated in the functional 
currency of the foreign entity and translated at the exchange 
rate prevailing at the balance sheet date, with any variances 
reflected directly in equity.
All foreign exchange differences reflected directly in equity 
are shown in the translation reserve component of equity.
Leasing 
As Lessee:
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the 
income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
As Lessor:
Motor vehicles and equipment hired to customers under 
operating leases are included within property, plant and 
equipment. Income from such leases is taken to the income 
statement evenly over the period of the operating lease 
agreement.
Retirement benefit costs
The Group operates defined contribution pension 
schemes. Contributions in respect of defined contribution 
arrangements are charged to the income statement in the 
period they fall due. Pension contributions in respect of 
one of these arrangements are held in trustee administered 
funds, independently of the Group’s finances.
The Group also operates Group personal pension plans. The 
costs of these plans are charged to the income statement as 
they fall due.
Employee share schemes and share based 
payments
The Group issues equity-settled payments to certain 
employees.
Equity-settled employee schemes, including employee share 
options and deferred annual bonuses, provide employees 
with the option to acquire shares of the Company. Employee 
share options and deferred annual bonuses are generally 
subject to performance or service conditions.
The fair value of equity-settled payments is measured at the 
date of grant and charged to the income statement over the 
period during which performance or service conditions are 
required to be met or immediately where no performance or 
service criteria exist. The fair value of equity-settled payments 
granted is measured using the Black–Scholes model. At 
the end of each reporting period, the Group revises its 
estimate of the number of options that are expected to vest 
based on the non-market vesting conditions and service 
conditions. It recognises the impact of the revision to the 
original estimates, if any, in the income statement, with a 
corresponding adjustment to equity.
The Group also operates a share incentive plan under which 
employees each have the option to purchase an amount of 
shares annually and receive an equivalent number of free 
shares. The Group recognises the free shares as an expense 
evenly throughout the period over which the employees 
must remain in the employ of the Group in order to receive 
the free shares.
Interest income and finance costs
Interest income and finance costs are recognised in the 
income statement using the effective interest rate method.
Exceptional items
Items are classified as exceptional gains or losses where 
they are considered by the Directors to be material or which 
individually or, if of a similar type, in aggregate, need to be 
disclosed by virtue of their size or incidence if the accounts 
are to be properly understood.
Dividends
Dividends on Ordinary shares are recognised in the period in 
which they are either paid or formally approved, whichever 
is earlier.
Provisions
A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the 
Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a 
result of a past event and it is probable that an outflow of 
economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. 
If the effect is material, provisions are determined by 
discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate 
that reflects current market assessments of the time value 
of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the 
liability.
Own shares
The Group makes open market purchases of its own shares 
in order to satisfy the requirements of the Group’s existing 
share schemes. Own shares are recognised at cost as a 
reduction in shareholder equity. The carrying values of own 
shares are compared to their market values at each reporting 
date and adjustments are made to write down the carrying 
value of own shares when, in the opinion of the Directors, 
there is a significant market value reduction.
3 Critical accounting judgements and key 
sources of estimation uncertainty
In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, 
which are described in Note 2, the Directors have made the 
following judgments that have the most significant effect on 
the amounts recognised in the accounts.
Depreciation
Vehicles for hire are depreciated on a straight-line basis using 
depreciation rates that reflect economic lives of between 
three and 12 years. These depreciation rates have been 
determined with the anticipation that the net book values at 
the point the vehicles are transferred into inventories is in line 
with the open market values for those vehicles, after taking 
account of costs required to sell the vehicles.
Under IAS 16 (Property, plant and equipment), the Group is 
required to review its depreciation rates and estimated useful 
lives regularly to ensure that the net book value of disposals 
of tangible assets are broadly equivalent to their market 
value.
Depreciation charges reflect adjustments made as a result 
of differences between expected and actual residual values 
of used vehicles, taking into account the further directly 
attributable costs to sell the vehicles.

3 Critical accounting judgements and key 
sources of estimation uncertainty continued
Provision for bad and doubtful debts
Trade receivables are stated in the balance sheet at 
their nominal value less any appropriate provision for 
irrecoverable amounts. In determining whether provision 
is required against any trade receivable, judgement is 
required in estimating the likely levels of recovery. In 
exercising this judgement, consideration is given to both 
the overall economic environment in which a debtor 
operates, as well as specific indicators that the recovery of 
the nominal balance may be in doubt, for example, days’ 
sales outstanding in excess of agreed credit terms or other 
qualitative information in respect of a customer. See note 29 
for further information.
Taxation
The Group carries out tax planning consistent with a group 
of its size and makes appropriate provision, based on best 
estimates, until tax computations are agreed with the tax 
authorities. Certain judgements have been made with 
respects to uncertain tax positions. These judgements 
primarily related to tax reliefs taken in the current and 
previous years in respect of the vehicle fleet. To the extent 
that tax estimates result in the recognition of deferred tax 
assets, those assets are only carried in the balance sheet to 
the extent that it is considered probable that taxable profit 
will be available against which the deductible temporary 
difference can be utilised.
4 Segmental reporting
Management has determined the operating segments based 
upon the information provided to the Board of Directors 
which is considered to be the chief operating decision 
maker. The Group is managed and reports internally on a 
basis consistent with its three main operating divisions, UK, 
Spain and Ireland. The principal activities of these divisions 
are set out in the Strategic report.

In addition to the amount charged to the income statement, a net deferred tax amount of £157,000 has been debited (2016 
– £285,000 credited) directly to equity (Note 22).
The underlying tax charge of £12,007,000 (2016 – £17,599,000) excludes exceptional tax credits of £95,000 (2016 – 
£668,000) as set out in Note 26, and tax credits on brand royalty charges and intangible amortisation of £591,000 (2016 – 
£778,000). There has been no recognition of deferred tax assets previously derecognised.
In July 2015 an announcement was made meaning that the applicable tax rate in the UK will reduce from 20% to 19% for 
the fiscal year starting 1 April 2017 and thereafter. This was substantively enacted on 1 April 2017 and therefore deferred 
tax balances arising in the UK have been revalued to 19%. In March 2016 it was announced that for the fiscal year starting 
1 April 2020 the rate would reduce to 17%. This change has not been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and 
deferred tax balances have therefore not been revalued to this rate. The Spanish corporation tax rate reduced to 25% on 1 
January 2016. Based on the expected timing of the reversal of temporary differences, the tax disclosures reflect deferred tax 
measured at 19% in the UK and 25% in Spain.
9 Dividends
An interim dividend of 5.7p per Ordinary share was paid in January 2017 (2016 – 5.1p). The Directors propose a final dividend 
for the year ended 30 April 2017 of 11.6p per Ordinary share (2016 – 10.9p) which is subject to approval at the Annual 
General Meeting and has not been included as a liability as at 30 April 2017. No dividends have been paid between 30 April 
2017 and the date of signing the Accounts.

12 Goodwill
£000
Carrying value:
At 1 May 2015, 1 May 2016 and 30 April 
2017 3,589
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, 
at acquisition, to the cash generating units (CGUs) that are 
expected to benefit from the business combination. The 
Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more 
frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be 
impaired.
The goodwill balance all relates to the UK. The recoverable 
amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use 
calculations. The key assumptions for the value in use 
calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth 
rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs 
during the year. The Directors estimate discount rates using 
pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the 
time value of money and the risks specific to the CGUs. The 
growth rates are based on industry growth rates forecasts. 
Changes in selling prices and direct costs are based on past 
practices and expectations of future changes in the market.
In addition to the annual test of impairment, and as required 
by IAS 36, there has also been an assessment as to whether 
there has been any indication that an impairment loss of 
other non-current assets recognised in an earlier year has 
decreased or no longer exists.
The impairment assessment was based on risk-adjusted cash 
flow forecasts derived from a business plan approved by 
the Directors in May 2017 using growth rates of 1% over a 
10 year period, including terminal values, using a discount 
rate of 8.6% for the UK CGU, 9.0% for the Spain CGU and 
8.2% for the Ireland CGU. The projected terminal value is 
calculated based on the Gordon Growth Model assuming 
cash flows are generated into perpetuity.

It was concluded that there were no indicators of additional 
impairment or reversal of impairment of other non-current 
assets previously charged for the UK CGU, Spain CGU and 
Ireland CGU.
In the prior year, the impairment assessment was based on 
risk-adjusted cash flow forecasts derived from a three year 
business plan approved by the Directors in May 2016 using 
growth rates of 1% over a 10 year period, including terminal 
values, using a discount rate of 8.9% for the UK CGU (which 
included Ireland) and 8.9% for the Spain CGU. The projected 
terminal value is calculated based on the Gordon Growth 
Model assuming cash flows are generated into perpetuity. 
It was concluded that there were no indicators of additional 
impairment or reversal of impairment previously charged for 
both the UK CGU and Spain CGU.
The value in use assessment is sensitive to changes in the 
key assumptions used, most notably the discount rate and 
growth rates. A sensitivity analysis has been performed on 
the UK CGU, Spain CGU and Ireland CGU. Based on this 
sensitivity analysis, no reasonably possible changes to the 
assumptions used for either the UK CGU, Spain CGU or 
Ireland CGU resulted in an additional impairment charge 
being required.

Bank loans and overdrafts
Bank loans and overdrafts are unsecured and bear interest 
at rates of 0.70% to 1.75% (2016 – 0.70% to 2.25%) above 
the relevant interest rate index, being LIBOR for Sterling 
denominated debt and EURIBOR for Euro denominated debt.
Loan notes
The Company has €100,000,000 of private placement loan 
notes which bear interest at 2.38%. These are unsecured 
and mature in August 2022.
Cumulative Preference shares
The cumulative Preference shares of 50p each entitle the 
holder to receive a cumulative preferential dividend at the 
rate of 5% on the paid up capital and the right to a return of 
capital at either winding up or a repayment of capital. The 
cumulative Preference shares do not entitle the holders to 
any further or other participation in the profits or assets of 
the Company. These shares have no voting rights other than 
in exceptional circumstances.
The total number of authorised cumulative Preference shares 
of 50p each is 1,300,000 (2016 – 1,300,000), of which 
1,000,000 (2016 – 1,000,000) were allotted and fully paid at 
the balance sheet date.
Confirming facilities
Spanish confirming facilities of £366,000 (2016 – £453,000) 
are unsecured and all fall due within one year. The Group 
pays no interest on confirming.

The Group calculates gearing to be net borrowings as a percentage of shareholders’ funds less goodwill and the net book 
value of intangible assets, where net borrowings comprise borrowings less cash and bank balances. At 30 April 2017, the 
gearing of the Group amounted to 60.8% (2016 – 66.9%) where net borrowings are £309,858,000 (2016 – £309,877,000) 
and shareholders’ funds less goodwill and the net book value of intangible assets are £509,719,000 (2016 – £463,382,000).
Financial instruments (see also Note 29)
Financial assets
The Group’s principal financial assets are cash and bank balances, and trade and other receivables.
The Group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables. The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net 
of allowances for doubtful receivables. An allowance for impairment is made where there is an identified loss event which, 
based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of the cash flows.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high 
credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of counterparties and 
customers. The Group has credit insurance policies in place to partially mitigate this risk.
Treasury policies and the management of risk
The function of Group Treasury is to mitigate financial risk, to ensure sufficient liquidity is available to meet foreseeable 
requirements, to secure finance at minimum cost and to invest cash assets securely and profitably. Treasury operations 
manage the Group’s funding, liquidity and exposure to interest rate risks within a framework of policies and guidelines 
authorised by the Board of Directors.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments for risk management purposes only. Consistent with Group policy, Group 
Treasury does not engage in speculative activity and it is policy to avoid using more complex financial instruments. Further 
details regarding derivative financial instruments are shown in Note 21.

THE ACCOUNTS

20 Borrowings continued
The policy followed in managing credit risk permits only 
minimal exposures, with banks and other institutions 
meeting required standards as assessed normally by 
reference to major credit rating agencies. Deals are 
authorised only with banks with which dealing mandates 
have been agreed and which maintain an A rating. Individual 
aggregate credit exposures are limited accordingly.
Financing and interest rate risk
The Group’s policy is to finance operating subsidiary 
undertakings by a combination of retained earnings and 
medium term bank loans and loan notes.
Cash at bank, and on deposit, yields interest based principally 
on interest rate indices applicable to periods of less than three 
months, those indices being LIBOR for Sterling denominated 
cash and EURIBOR for Euro denominated cash. The Group’s 
exposure to interest rate fluctuations on its borrowings 
is managed through the use of interest rate derivatives 
as detailed in Note 21. These derivatives are also used to 
manage the Group’s desired mix of fixed and floating rate 
debt. The policy is to fix or cap a substantial element of the 
interest cost on outstanding debt. At 30 April 2017 102.9% 
(2016 – 96.7%) of net borrowings were at fixed rates of 
interest comprising interest rate swaps of £75,000,000 and 
€190,000,000, loan notes of €100,000,000, £500,000 
of Preference shares and £366,000 of confirming facilities 
(30 April 2016 – interest rate swaps of £75,000,000 and 
€190,000,000, loan notes of €100,000,000, £500,000 of 
Preference shares and £453,000 of confirming facilities).
Foreign currency exchange risk
The Group maintains borrowings in the same currency as 
its cash requirements, with the exception of borrowings 
maintained in Euros as net investment hedges against its 
Euro denominated investments (Note 21).

Interest rate derivatives
The Group’s exposure to interest fluctuations on its borrowings is managed through the use of interest rate derivatives. These 
derivatives are also used to manage the Group’s desired mix of fixed and floating rate debt. The policy is to fix a substantial

Sterling interest rate swaps £75,000,000 1.17% 4.2 years
Euro interest rate swaps €190,000,000 0.06% 4.2 years
In October 2015 interest rate swaps totalling £105,000,000 and €206,500,000 were cancelled and interest rate swaps 
totalling £75,000,000 and €190,000,000 commenced. These had weighted average pay rates of 1.17% and 0.06% 
respectively and all had weighted average lives of 4.7 years.
All the Group’s interest rate swaps are designated as cash flow hedges and their fair value to the point of either maturity 
or termination, along with changes in fair value in the current year, has been deferred in equity. There was no hedge 
ineffectiveness during the year (2016 – £Nil).
Cross-currency derivatives
Market values have been used to determine the fair values of the cross-currency derivatives at the balance sheet date. The 
estimated fair values are as follows:

2016
£000
Euro/Sterling cross-currency swaps 213 – 
In April 2017 a cross-currency swap with a principal value of €25,000,000 commenced. The Group will have interest cash 
inflows in Sterling and interest cash outflows in Euro over the life of the contract. On the termination date of the contract, the 
Group will pay a principal amount in Euro and receive a principal amount in Sterling. The interest rate that the Group pays in 
Euro is 2.15% and the interest rate the Group receives in Sterling is 2.92%. The swap had a life of 0.5 years. The change in fair 
value has been deferred in equity.

Net investment hedges
The Group manages its exposure to currency fluctuations 
on retranslation of the balance sheets of those subsidiary 
undertakings whose functional currency is in Euros by 
maintaining a proportion of its borrowings in the same 
currency. The hedging objective is to reduce the risk of 
spot retranslation of the Euro subsidiaries from Euros to 
Sterling at each reporting date. Exchange differences arising 
on the borrowings and net investment hedges have been 
recognised directly within equity along with the exchange 
differences on retranslation of the net assets of the Euro 
subsidiaries.
The hedges are considered highly effective in the current and 
prior year.

In the current year, the net charge to equity of £157,000 (2016 – £285,000 credit) in respect of other temporary differences 
relates to derivative financial instruments which has been reflected in the hedging reserve (Note 25).
There are no deferred tax assets which are not recognised in the balance sheet.
Net deferred tax assets of £3,470,000 (2016 – £3,552,000) classified as other temporary differences relate to movements on 
fair values of foreign currency derivatives, other temporary differences in relation to tax payable in various tax jurisdictions in 
which the Group operates and other temporary differences within the UK.

The above shows the movements on the reserves classified as ‘Other reserves’ on the Group’s Statement of changes in equity. 
Movements on the own shares reserve, hedging reserve and translation reserve are shown in the Statements of changes in 
equity, which can be seen on page 91.
Further information on certain of these reserves is given 
below: 
Own shares
The own shares reserve represents shares held by employee 
trusts in order to meet commitments under the Group’s 
various share schemes (Note 28). At 30 April 2017 the 
Guernsey Trust held 708,221 (2016 – 1,899,747) 50p 
Ordinary shares and the Capita Trust held 31,479 (2016 – 
17,186) 50p Ordinary shares. The total number of shares held 
by these employee trusts represents 0.6% (2016 – 1.4%) of 
the allotted and fully paid share capital of the Group.
The results of the trusts are consolidated into the results of 
the Group in accordance with IFRS 10 (Consolidated Financial 
Statements).
Hedging reserve
The hedging reserve represents the cumulative amounts of 
changes in fair values of hedged interest rate derivatives that 
are deferred in equity, as explained in Note 2 and Note 21, 
less amounts transferred to the income statement and other 
components of equity.
Translation reserve
The translation reserve represents the aggregate of 
the cumulative exchange differences arising from the 
retranslation of the balance sheets of the Euro based 
subsidiary undertakings and the cumulative exchange 
differences arising from long term borrowings held as 
hedges and the foreign exchange element of fair value 
movements of hedged derivatives.
The management of the Group’s foreign exchange 
translation risks is detailed in Note 21.

29 Financial instruments
The following disclosures and analysis relate to the Group’s financial instruments.
Capital risk management
The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as going concerns while 
maximising the return to stakeholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance. The capital structure of 
the Group consists of debt, which includes the borrowings disclosed in Note 20, cash and cash equivalents and equity 
attributable to equity holders of the Parent, comprising issued share capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in 
Notes 23 to 25.
Foreign currency risk management
The Group undertakes certain transactions denominated in foreign currencies. Hence, exposures to exchange rate fluctuations 
arise. Exchange rate exposures are managed within approved policy parameters as discussed in Notes 20 and 21.
Foreign currency sensitivity analysis
During the year, the Group has been exposed to movements in the exchange rate between Euro and Sterling, where Sterling 
is the functional currency of the Group.
The following tables detail the Group’s sensitivity to a €0.20 (2016 – €0.15) increase and decrease in the Euro/Sterling 
exchange rate.
A €0.20 (2016 – €0.15) movement in the rate in either direction is management’s assessment of the reasonably possible 
change in foreign exchange rates in the near term. The sensitivity analysis includes only any outstanding foreign currency 
denominated monetary items and adjusts their translation at the period end for a €0.20 (2016 – €0.15) change in foreign 
currency rates.

Interest rate risk management
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk, as entities within the Group borrow funds at both fixed and floating interest rates. 
The risk is managed by the Group by maintaining an appropriate mix between fixed and floating rate borrowings and by the 
use of interest rate swap contracts. Hedging activities are reviewed regularly to align with interest rate views and defined risk 
appetite, ensuring optimal hedging strategies are applied.
The Group’s exposures to interest rates on financial assets and financial liabilities are detailed in the liquidity risk management 
section of this note.
Interest rate sensitivity analysis
The sensitivity analyses below have been determined on the exposure to interest rates for floating rate liabilities and related 
derivatives. For the floating rate liabilities, the analysis is prepared on the basis of both the average liability outstanding over 
the year and the average rate applicable for the year. In all instances it is assumed that any derivatives designated in hedging 
relationships are 100% effective.
A 1.0% (2016 – 1.0%) increase or decrease has been used in the analyses and represents management’s best estimate of a 
reasonably possible change in interest rates in the near term.

Interest rate swap contracts
Under interest rate swap contracts, the Group agrees to exchange the difference between fixed and floating rate interest 
amounts calculated on agreed notional principal amounts. Such contracts enable the Group to mitigate the risk of changing 
interest rates and the cash flow exposures on the issued variable rate debt held. The fair value of interest rate swaps at the 
reporting date is determined by discounting the future cash flows using the curves at the reporting date and the credit risk 
inherent in the contract and is disclosed below. The average interest rate is based on the outstanding balances at the end of 
the financial year.

Liquidity risk management
Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board of Directors, who have built an appropriate liquidity 
risk management framework for the management of the Group’s short, medium and long term funding and liquidity 
requirements. The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves, banking facilities and reserve borrowing 
facilities by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and 
financial liabilities. Included in Note 20 is a description of additional undrawn facilities that the Group has at its disposal to 
further reduce liquidity risk.
Liquidity and interest risk tables
The following tables detail the Group’s remaining contractual maturity for its non-derivative financial liabilities. The tables have 
been drawn up based on the undiscounted cash flows of financial liabilities based on the earliest date on which the Group can 
be required to pay. The tables include both interest and principal cash flows. All interest cash flows and the weighted average 
effective interest rate have been calculated using interest rate conditions prevailing at the balance sheet date.

Fair value of financial instruments
The Group is required to analyse financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, 
grouped into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which fair value is observable:
 | Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or 
liabilities;
 | Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are 
observable for the asset or liability either directly (i.e. prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and
 | Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability 
that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).
All the financial instruments below are categorised as Level 2.
The fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities are determined as follows:
 | Derivative financial instruments are measured at the present value of future cash flows estimated and discounted based on 
applicable yield curves derived from quoted interest rates; and
 | The fair value of other non-derivative financial assets and financial liabilities are determined in accordance with generally 
accepted pricing models based on discounted cash flow analysis.
The carrying amounts of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded at amortised cost in the financial statements 
approximate their fair values or, in the case of interest rate and cross currency swaps, are held at fair value.

Credit risk management
Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to  
the Group.
The Group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables. The trade receivables amounts presented in the  
balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables. An allowance for impairment is made where there is an 
identified loss event which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of the cash flows.

Before accepting any new customers, the Group will perform credit analysis to assess the credit risk on an individual basis. 
This enables the Group only to deal with creditworthy customers therefore reducing the risk of financial loss from defaults. Of 
the trade receivables balance at the end of the year, £936,000 (2016 – £802,000) is due from the Group’s largest customer. 
There are no customers who represent more than 5% of the total balance of trade receivables.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk as trade receivables consist of a large number of customers, spread 
across diverse industries and geographical areas in the UK, Spain and Ireland.
Included in the Group’s trade receivables balance are debtors with a carrying amount of £12,306,000 (2016 – £6,043,000) 
which are past due at the reporting date for which the Group has not provided as there has not been a significant change in 
credit quality and the amounts are still considered recoverable.

In determining the recoverability of a trade receivable the Group considers any change in the credit quality of the trade 
receivable from the date credit was initially granted up to the reporting date. The concentration of credit risk is limited due to 
the customer base being large and mainly unrelated. Accordingly, the Directors believe that there is no further credit provision 
required in excess of the allowance for doubtful receivables.
Included in the allowance for doubtful receivables are trade receivables with customers which have been placed under 
liquidation of £448,000 (2016 – £159,000).

The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates their fair value. The Company 
has no trade receivables and no intercompany receivables past due date.
30 Related party transactions
Transactions with subsidiary undertakings
Transactions between the Company and its subsidiary undertakings, which are related parties, are £3,067,000 (2016 – 
£3,447,000) interest payable and £6,204,000 (2016 – £5,282,000) royalty charges receivable. 
Balances with subsidiary undertakings at the balance sheet date are shown in Notes 18 and 19.
Remuneration of key management personnel
In the current and prior year, the Directors of Northgate plc are determined to be the key management personnel of the 
Group. There are other senior executives in the Group who are able to influence the Company in the achievement of its goals.
However, in the opinion of the Directors, only the Directors of the Company have significant authority for planning, directing 
and controlling the activities of the Group.
In respect of the compensation of key management personnel, the short term employee benefits, post-employment (pension) 
benefits, termination benefits and details of share options granted are set out in the Remuneration report on pages 54 to 
73. The fair value charged to the income statement in respect of equity-settled share based payment transactions with the 
Directors is £247,000 (2016 – £660,000). There are no other long term benefits accruing to key management personnel, 
other than as set out in the Remuneration report.

Notes
1. A member entitled to attend and vote at the Annual 
General Meeting (‘the Meeting’) may appoint another 
person(s) (who need not be a member of the Company) 
to exercise all or any of his rights to attend, speak and 
vote at the Meeting. A member can appoint more than 
one proxy in relation to the Meeting, provided that each 
proxy is appointed to exercise the rights attaching to 
different shares held by him.
2. A proxy does not need to be a member of the Company 
but must attend the Meeting to represent you. Your 
proxy could be the Chairman, another Director of the 
Company or another person who has agreed to attend to 
represent you. Your proxy must vote as you instruct and 
must attend the Meeting for your vote to be counted. 
Appointing a proxy does not preclude you from attending 
the Meeting and voting in person.
3. A proxy form which may be used to make this 
appointment and give proxy instructions accompanies 
this notice. Details of how to appoint a proxy are set 
out in the notes to the proxy form. As an alternative 
to completing a hard copy proxy form, proxies may be 
appointed by using the electronic proxy appointment 
service in accordance with the procedures set out in Note 
6 below. CREST members may appoint proxies using the 
CREST electronic proxy appointment service (see Note 7 
below). In each case the appointment must be received 
by the Company not less than 48 hours, excluding non 
business days, before the time of the Meeting.
4. A copy of this notice has been sent for information only 
to persons who have been nominated by a member to 
enjoy information rights under section 146 of the Act 
(‘a Nominated Person’). The rights to appoint a proxy 
cannot be exercised by a Nominated Person: they can 
only be exercised by the member. However, a Nominated 
Person may have a right under an agreement between 
him and the member by whom he was nominated to be 
appointed as a proxy for the Meeting or to have someone 
else so appointed. If a Nominated Person does not have 
such a right or does not wish to exercise it, he may have a 
right under such an agreement to give instructions to the 
member as to the exercise of voting rights.
5. To be entitled to attend and vote, whether in person or 
by proxy, at the Meeting, members must be registered 
in the register of members of the Company at close of 
business on Friday 15 September 2017 or, in the case of 
an adjourned meeting, at close of business on the day 
which is two days before the meeting (excluding days 
which are not working days). Changes to entries on the 
register after this time shall be disregarded in determining 
the rights of persons to attend or vote (and the number 
of votes they may cast) at the Meeting or adjourned 
meeting.
6. Shareholders wishing to appoint a proxy online should 
visit www.signalshares.com and follow the instructions 
on screen. If you have not already registered with The 
Share Portal you will need to identify yourself with your 
personal Investor Code (see Attendance Card). To be valid 
your proxy appointment(s) and instructions should reach 
Capita Registrars no later than 48 hours, excluding non 
business days, before the time set for the Meeting.
7. CREST members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies 
by utilising the CREST electronic proxy appointment 
service may do so by utilising the procedures described 
in the CREST Manual on the Euroclear website (www.
euroclear.com/CREST). CREST Personal Members or 
other CREST sponsored members and those members 
who have appointed a voting service provider(s), should 
refer to their CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s), 
who will be able to take the appropriate action on their 
behalf. In order for a proxy appointment made by means 
of CREST to be valid, the appropriate CREST message.(‘a 
CREST Proxy Instruction’) must be properly authenticated 
in accordance with Euroclear UK & Ireland Limited’s 
(EUI) specifications and must contain the information 
required for such instructions, as described in the 
CREST Manual. The message, regardless of whether it 
constitutes the appointment of a proxy or an amendment 
to the instruction given to a previously appointed proxy, 
must, in order to be valid, be transmitted so as to be 
received by the issuer’s agent (ID RA10) by the latest 
time(s) for receipt of proxy appointments specified in 
the Notice of Meeting. For this purpose, the time of 
receipt will be taken to be the time (as determined by 
the timestamp applied to the message by the CREST 
Applications Host) from which the issuer’s agent is able to 
retrieve the message by enquiry to CREST in the manner 
prescribed by CREST. The Company may treat as invalid 
a CREST Proxy Instruction in the circumstances set out in 
regulation 35(5)(a) of the Uncertificated  
Securities Regulations 2001.

8. A member of the Company which is a corporation may 
authorise a person or persons to act as its representative(s) 
at the Meeting. In accordance with the provisions of the 
Act, each such representative may exercise (on behalf 
of the corporation) the same powers as the corporation 
could exercise if it were an individual member of the 
Company, provided that they do not do so in relation to 
the same shares. It is no longer necessary to nominate a 
designated corporate representative.
9. Members satisfying the thresholds in section 527 of the 
Act can require the Company to publish a statement on 
its website setting out any matter relating to (a) the audit 
of the Company’s accounts (including the auditor’s report 
and the conduct of the audit) that are to be laid before 
the Meeting; or (b) any circumstances connected with an 
auditor of the Company ceasing to hold office since the 
last Annual General Meeting, that the members propose 
to raise at the Meeting. The Company cannot require the 
members requesting the publication to pay its expenses. 
Any statement placed on the website must also be sent 
to the Company’s auditor no later than the time it makes 
its statement available on the website. The business 
which may be dealt with at the Meeting includes any 
statement that the Company has been required to publish 
on its website.
10. The Company must cause to be answered at the Meeting 
any question relating to the business being dealt with 
at the Meeting which is put by a member attending the 
Meeting, except in certain circumstances, including if 
it would interfere unduly with the preparation for the 
Meeting or if it is undesirable in the interests of the 
Company or the good order of the Meeting that the 
question be answered or if to do so would involve the 
disclosure of confidential information.
11. As at 27 June 2017 (being the latest practicable date prior 
to the publication of this notice), the Company’s issued 
share capital consists of 133,232,518 Ordinary shares of 
50 pence each, carrying one vote each and 1,000,000 
preference shares of 50 pence each, which do not carry 
any rights to vote on the above resolutions. Therefore, 
the total voting rights in the Company are 133,232,518.
12. The contents of this notice of meeting, details of the 
total number of shares in respect of which members are 
entitled to exercise voting rights at the Meeting, the total 
voting rights that members are entitled to exercise at the 
Meeting and, if applicable, any members’ statements, 
members’ resolutions or members’ matters of business 
received by the Company after the date of this notice 
will be available on the Company’s website: www.
northgateplc.com/investors.php.
13. You may not use any electronic address provided in this 
notice of meeting to communicate with the Company for 
any purposes other than those expressly stated.
14. Under sections 338 and 338A of the Act, members 
meeting the threshold requirements in those sections 
(i) have the right to require the Company to give, to 
members of the Company entitled to receive notice of 
the Meeting, notice of a resolution which those members 
intend to move (and which may properly be moved) 
at the Meeting; and/or (ii) to include in the business to 
be dealt with at the Meeting any matter (other than a 
proposed resolution) which may properly be included in 
the business at the Meeting. A resolution may properly 
be moved, or a matter properly included in the business, 
unless (a) (in the case of a resolution only) it would, 
if passed, be ineffective (whether by reason of any 
inconsistency with any enactment or the Company’s 
constitution or otherwise); (b) it is defamatory of any 
person; or (c) it is frivolous or vexatious. A request made 
pursuant to this right may be in hard copy or electronic 
form, must identify the resolution of which notice is to be 
given or the matter to be included in the business, must 
be authenticated by the person(s) making it and must be 
received by the Company not later than 8 August 2017, 
being the date six clear weeks before the Meeting, and 
(in the case of a matter to be included in the business 
only) must be accompanied by a statement setting out 
the grounds for the request.
