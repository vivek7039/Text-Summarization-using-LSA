4imprint Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 OVERVIEW
Chairman’s Statement
The Group delivered another strong operational 
and financial performance in 2017.
Profit before tax was $40.7m, compared to 
$34.2m in 2016. This 19% increase reflects 
a much lower exceptional charge of $0.5m 
(2016: $2.9m) showing tangible benefit 
from the successful completion of our 
pension de-risking exercise. Basic earnings 
per share increased by 18% to 103.15c.
The Group ended the year in good 
financial health with a cash balance of 
$30.8m (2016: $21.7m), again reflecting 
the low fixed capital requirements 
and efficient working capital 
characteristics of our business model.
We have a distinct cultural identity within 
4imprint, based on exacting standards 
of customer service. The professionalism 
and talent of our US team members 
was demonstrated to great effect as 
they helped our customers and affected 
suppliers to recover in the aftermath of 
Hurricanes Harvey and Irma. I would like to 
thank each member of our dedicated team 
for their remarkable efforts during the year.
In several respects 2017 can be seen as 
a year of consolidation and the starting 
point of a transition for the Group. Our 
market position was strengthened, 
and our business model continued to 
generate profitable organic revenue 
growth. With our pension commitments 
much reduced, we have a firm and 
unencumbered financial base.
Turning to the future development of 
the Group, the Executive Team and the 
Board have considered, and subsequently 
evolved, our strategic framework. We 
have concluded that now is the right 
time to accelerate the awareness and 
strength of the 4imprint brand through 
a combination of different marketing 
techniques, including traditional broadcast 
media and the expansion of our advertising 
presence in digital media. This brand 
awareness component will complement 
our existing marketing engine, with the 
aim of delivering our new strategic goal of 
achieving $1bn in Group revenue by 2022.
We expect our business operations to 
remain highly cash generative. The cash 
demands from our legacy defined benefit 
pension obligations are now predictable, 
and small in the context of the financial 
strength of the Group. Accordingly, we 
have developed new balance sheet funding 
guidelines that will allow us to retain 
financial and operational flexibility through 
different economic cycles. A revised capital 
allocation approach has also been adopted. 
The first priority for our capital is clear: 
projects enhancing our ability to generate 
organic revenue growth. In addition, we 
have reconfirmed our commitment to both 
progressive regular dividends and to our 
remaining pension obligations. Finally, excess 
cash above these commitments is available 
for distribution to Shareholders.
In this context, the Board has 
recommended a non-recurring 
supplementary dividend of 60.00c per 
share. This will be paid in May 2018 in 
addition to, and at the same time as, 
the final dividend of 40.00c per share.
Our business operations are firmly 
established in attractive markets. The 
Group is financially strong and we 
have exciting plans for the future. 
Trading activity in the first few weeks 
of 2018 has been encouraging.

4imprint Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 STRATEGIC REPORT
Chief Executive’s Review
The 2017 financial results represent another year 
of healthy, profitable organic growth.
Performance in 2017
The North American business, which 
comprises 97% of Group revenue, 
continued to strengthen its position in 
the US and Canadian markets. Revenue 
growth over prior year was 12%, compared 
to estimated total industry growth of 
about 3%. Revenue growth in the second 
half of the year was 14%, compared to 
11% in the first half, in keeping with 
the phasing of marketing initiatives.
Reported revenue growth for the UK 
business was up 11% over prior year. In 
base currency the growth rate was 16%, 
outpacing that of the UK market and 
indicative of a strengthening customer file.
In total 1,185,000 orders – each customised 
and carrying an “on-time or free” 
guarantee – were processed in the year. 
Orders from new customers were up 5% 
over 2016, with more than 252,000 new 
customers acquired. Orders from existing 
customers were up 16%, as retention 
rates remained strong and consistent.
Our organic growth is driven through 
disciplined investment in innovative, data-
driven marketing. In 2017, online marketing 
spend continued to grow at a faster rate 
than the overall marketing budget, although 
our offline activities grew year-over-year 
as well. Our customer retention strategy 
was underpinned by our unique Blue Box™ 
marketing programme, which continues to 
evolve to support a growing customer file. 
Revenue per marketing dollar was $5.67 in 
2017 compared to $5.77 in 2016. This was 
in line with our expectations for the year, 
and was consistent with our targets for 
balancing revenue growth and profitability.
Kevin Lyons-Tarr
Chief Executive Officer
Underlying operating profit, excluding Head 
Office expenses, increased over prior year 
by 8%. Operating margin percentage at this 
level was 7.27% versus 7.57% in the prior 
year due principally to increased investment 
in marketing, which was 14% higher than 
2016. Gross margin percentage was slightly 
lower than prior year, but remains broadly 
stable. Selling costs and other overheads in 
the trading businesses rose at a rate lower 
than the increase in revenue, providing 
some gearing effect from the fixed or 
semi-fixed elements in these expenses.
Head Office costs fell by 22% compared 
to 2016. The primary cause of this year-
on-year change was not events in 2017, 
rather it reflects losses on forward currency 
contracts after the Brexit referendum 
which were booked in the prior year 
comparative. There has been no change of 
any substance in the structure and activities 
of the central function. Overall, the Group 
operating margin percentage for 2017 
was 6.79% compared to 6.87% in 2016.
For the tenth year in a row, the North 
American business was named a top 
medium sized workplace in the USA. The UK 
business is accredited by Investors in People. 
A strong and healthy culture is central to 
our success. Evidence of the importance of 
a strong culture was on full display during 
parts of the third and fourth quarter of 
2017, as our US team handled disruption 
caused by Hurricanes Harvey and Irma with 
determination and professionalism, caring 
for customers and working seamlessly with 
suppliers who were impacted by the storms. 
We are proud of their efforts every day.  07

Looking ahead
We have an attractive opportunity to achieve 
significant, profitable growth by expanding 
our presence in markets that remain 
fragmented and largely addressable through 
our direct marketing model. The continued 
evolution and diversification of our 
marketing portfolio should allow us to drive 
further sustained revenue growth much in 
the same way that the addition of online 
activities complemented our catalogue 
marketing activities many years ago.
The second half of 2017 saw our first 
investment into testing elements of 
a new component to our marketing 
strategy, designed to increase the 
overall awareness of the 4imprint 
brand amongst our target audience. 
This relatively small initial investment 
was aimed at providing important 
insights to help inform the direction of 
a broader evolution of our strategy that 
we will begin to implement in 2018. 
We expect the careful cultivation and 
development of this brand awareness 
component of our marketing portfolio 
to be a complementary driver of future 
growth in 2018 and beyond. We will employ 
a combination of different marketing 
techniques, including traditional broadcast 
media and the expansion of our advertising 
presence in digital media. A budget of 
around $7m has been allocated to this 
project in 2018. This new initiative will 
represent incremental investment; it will 
not be funded through re-allocation of 
resources away from our existing, proven 
marketing engine which continues to be 
an effective growth generator. Therefore 
we anticipate an investment phase during 
2018 as we apply our familiar and proven 
“test, read, adjust” approach to rolling out 
this new component of our strategy. As a 
result we expect that 2018 operating profit 
is likely to be flat against 2017, reflecting 
the longer investment period that this 
type of marketing typically requires.
This is an evolution of our previous financial 
strategy of organic revenue growth subject 
to maintaining broadly constant operating 
margin percentage; it does not represent a 
wholesale change in direction or philosophy. 
Rather, it is a measured investment back 
into the business to diversify our marketing 
programme in a way that fundamentally 
strengthens the business for the future. 
We fully expect profitability to remain 
healthy and the business to remain 
highly cash generative as the benefits 
are felt over the next several years.
As a measure of our confidence in the 
Group’s growth strategy we have set a 
new target of reaching $1bn of revenue 
by 2022. 2018 will be an exciting year for 
the Group as we evolve our established 
and effective marketing platform in 
pursuit of our strategic objective of market 
leadership driving organic growth.

KPIs
Organic revenue growth is the cornerstone of our 
strategic framework. Year-over-year revenue growth 
gives the clearest measure of progress towards our 
target of $1bn in Group revenue by 2022.
Revenue per marketing dollar provides a measure of 
the productivity of our marketing investment. We 
measure performance relative to in-year targets as 
opposed to historical trend in accordance with our 
strategic objectives for organic growth, profitability 
and cash generation.
Our balance sheet funding policy calls for the 
business to aim for a target cash balance at the end 
of each financial year. The net cash balance KPI 
shows the Group’s performance in managing its cash 
resources relative to its capital allocation priorities.
Underlying earnings per share growth over time gives 
a clear indication of the health of the business and is 
a key component in the delivery of Shareholder value.
Orders received statistics are collated on a daily, weekly 
and monthly basis to evaluate performance against the 
targets in our operational plan for both new and 
existing customers. Analysis of order patterns offers 
a clear and immediate measure of operational 
performance, particularly in a business characterised by 
relatively stable average order size and gross margins.
This KPI shows the profitability of the Group’s trading 
operations. In recent years our financial strategy has 
been to maintain a broadly constant operating margin. 
In 2018 marketing investment in brand awareness may 
impact operating margin in the near term; we believe 
this will strengthen our position in the market allowing 
recovery in operating margin in subsequent years.
This provides a measure of the Group’s efficiency in 
the use of its capital resources. We aim to maintain or 
improve this KPI via increased profitability, strong 
working capital management and productive capital 
investment, along with disciplined adherence to clear 
capital allocation principles. Our definition of ROACE 
excludes the net pension deficit from the calculation.
The DPS number provides a tangible measure of the 
delivery of Shareholder value. The supplementary 
dividend evidences the distribution to Shareholders 
of excess cash in accordance with our capital 
allocation principles.
The 24 month retention rate offers visibility as to the 
broad stability and strength of a growing customer 
file. It will vary year-to-year to some degree based on 
a variety of factors (e.g. timing of when a new 
customer is acquired in their first year, and timing of 
retention marketing), and as such performance should 
be viewed relative to an acceptable bandwidth.
Cash conversion measures the efficiency of the 
4imprint business model in the conversion of our 
operating profits into operating cash flow. A high 
percentage reflects good working capital 
management and disciplined capital investment.
Dealing with the Group’s legacy defined benefit 
pension liability has been the primary call on the 
Group’s capital in recent years. This KPI quantifies the 
substantial efforts made so far in de-risking the 
liability, and will chart future progress in moving 
towards our aim of full funding.
Our aim is to deliver consistent performance and

supplementary dividend proposed in 2017 and 
payable in 2018 will result in a beneficial movement 
in this KPI in 2018. 10

Where we do business
Our customers
We operate in two primary geographical markets:
Promotional products are purchased by a 
wide range of individuals within all types 
of businesses and organisations. These 
products have many uses: as an integral 
part of sales and marketing campaigns; 
for recruitment or recognition activities; 
to promote health and safety initiatives; 
and for any other method of making 
a connection between our customer’s 
organisation and the recipient of the item.
We define our customer as the individual 
placing the order, rather than the 
business or organisation for which the 
individual works or with which he/
she is associated. Our customer base 
is widely dispersed geographically, by 
size of business/organisation and across 
commercial, governmental, educational, 
charitable and religious segments.
Our target customer will typically be 
working at an organisation of 25 or more 
employees. No single customer comprises a 
material part of 4imprint’s overall revenue.
North America
The US and Canadian promotional 
products markets together are estimated 
to total around $25bn in annual revenue. 
We serve this market from a centralised 
base in Oshkosh, Wisconsin.
UK and Ireland
The UK and Irish promotional product 
market size is estimated at around 
$1.4bn per year. Our office serving 
these markets is in Manchester, UK.
The marketplace for promotional products 
is fragmented. Our largest market, the 
USA, is served by an estimated 23,000 
distributors, of whom more than 20,500 
have annual revenue of less than $2.5m. 
The distribution structure is similar in 
the Canadian and UK/Irish markets. 
4imprint is the largest direct marketer of 
promotional products in each market.
Market leadership driving organic 
revenue growth is the cornerstone of our 
strategic framework. We aim to establish 
4imprint as “the” recognised brand for 
promotional products, driving our continued 
ability to grow at a rate significantly higher 
than the overall growth rate of the industry.  11

Operating result
Group revenue in 2017 was $627.52m (2016: $558.22m), a year-over-year increase of 12%. 
Underlying operating profit before tax was $42.46m (2016: $38.35m), 11% higher than prior year.
A commentary on the year’s trading highlights is included in the Chief Executive’s Review on 
pages 6 to 7.
Foreign exchange
The primary US dollar exchange rates relevant to the Group’s 2017 results were as follows:
2017 2016
Period end Average Period end Average
Sterling 1.35 1.29 1.23 1.35
Canadian dollars 0.80 0.77 0.74 0.76
The Group reports in US dollars, its primary trading currency. It also transacts business in 
Canadian dollars, Sterling and Euros. The net impact on the 2017 income statement from trading 
currency movements was not material to the Group’s results.
Dividends, pension contributions and some Head Office costs are payable in Sterling, however 
the Group generates most of its free cash flow in US dollars. As such, the Group’s cash position 
is sensitive to foreign exchange movements between these two currencies. Sterling strengthened 
towards the end of 2017, closing at $1.35/£1.00, (2016: $1.23/£1.00). For illustrative purposes, 
every US$1m converted to Sterling was worth around £73,000 less at the 2017 closing rate 
compared to the 2016 closing rate.
Share option charges
The Group charged $0.55m (2016: $0.43m) in respect of IFRS 2, ‘Share-based Payments’. This 
charge contains an element from the 2015 Incentive Plan, approved at the 2015 AGM, and 
amounts relating to the 2016 UK SAYE and US ESPP plans. 
Current options and awards outstanding are 134,477 shares under the 2016 UK SAYE and US 
ESPP plans and 38,934 shares under the 2015 Incentive Plan. Awards under the 2015 Incentive 
Plan in respect of 2017 are anticipated to be made in late March 2018.
Exceptional items
A total of $0.46m (2016: $2.94m) was charged to exceptional items in the year, all relating to 
pension risk reduction activity. Since this exercise is now complete, it is not anticipated that there 
will be an exceptional charge in 2018.
Net finance expense
Net finance expense for the year was $0.12m (2016: expense of $0.03m), reflecting non-
utilisation fees on the US line of credit, plus interest on tax paid relating to prior years, offset 
partially by modest interest received on the investment of cash balances in short-term deposits.

4imprint Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Overview Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Additional Information Overview Strategic Report
Taxation
The tax charge for the year was $11.73m (2016: $9.67m), producing 
an effective tax rate of 29% (2016: 28%). The charge comprised 
current tax of $12.31m, representing tax payable in the USA, and a 
deferred tax credit of $0.58m. The increase in overall rate between 
years was due principally to: (i) increased taxable profits arising in the 
USA, which during 2017 remained a substantially higher tax 
jurisdiction; offset by (ii) a net credit of $0.48m arising on the 
revaluation of deferred tax balances at revised future US corporate 
tax rates.
The tax charge relating to underlying profit before tax was $12.17m 
(2016: $10.58m), an effective tax rate of 29% (2016: 28%).
Recent US Tax Reform legislation should have a beneficial effect on 
the Group’s future tax burden. The reduction in the US federal tax 
rate from 35% to 21% is expected to result in the Group’s effective 
tax rate percentage decreasing from its current level and settling in 
the low twenties from 2018 onwards.
Earnings per share
Underlying basic earnings per share was 108.02c (2016: 99.01c), an 
increase of 9%. This increase is lower than the 11% increase in 
underlying profit before tax, reflecting a higher effective tax rate. 
The weighted average number of shares in issue was substantially 
the same year-on-year.
Basic earnings per share was 103.15c (2016: 87.27c), an increase of 
18%. The primary factor causing the increase in basic earnings per 
share to be higher than the increase in underlying earnings per share 
was lower pension-related exceptional charges of $0.46m (2016: 
$2.94m).
Dividends
Dividends are determined in US dollars and paid in Sterling, 
converted at the exchange rate on the date that the dividend is 
determined.
The Board has proposed a final dividend of 40.00c (2016: 36.18c) 
which, together with the interim dividend of 18.10c, gives a total 
paid and proposed regular dividend relating to 2017 of 58.10c, an 
increase of 11% compared to prior year.
The final dividend has been converted to Sterling at an exchange rate 
of £1.00/$1.39 (2016: £1.00/$1.23 ). This results in a final dividend 
payable to Shareholders of 28.78p (2016: 29.52p), which, combined 
with the interim dividend paid of 13.80p, gives a total dividend for 
the year of 42.58p, an increase of 2% compared to prior year.
In addition to the interim and final dividends, the Board has also 
proposed a supplementary dividend of 60.00c (2016: $nil), which 
will be paid at the same time as the final dividend in May 2018. This 
supplementary dividend payment is non-recurring in nature and is in 
accordance with the Group’s newly adopted balance sheet funding 
and capital allocation policies which are described in more detail 
below.
The final and supplementary dividends, together amounting to 
100.00c per share, will be paid on 11 May 2018 to Shareholders on 
the register at the close of business on 3 April 2018.
Defined benefit pension plan
The Group sponsors a legacy defined benefit pension plan which is 
closed to new members and future accruals. This plan is the 
successor arrangement to the previous, much larger defined benefit 
scheme which was successfully de-risked and wound-up in 
December 2017. The new plan has equivalent benefits to the 
previous scheme, and currently has 85 pensioners and 323 deferred 
members.
At 30 December 2017, the deficit of the plan on an IAS 19 basis was 
$18.11m, compared to $19.29m at 31 December 2016. At the same 
date gross scheme liabilities under IAS 19 were $36.74m, and assets 
were $18.63m.
The change in deficit is analysed as follows:
$m
IAS 19 deficit at 1 January 2017 (19.29)
Company contributions to the scheme 3.67
Pension administration costs (0.29)
Pension costs – exceptional (0.38)
Pension finance charge (0.50)
Re-measurement gains due to changes in assumptions 0.43
Exchange loss (1.75)
IAS 19 deficit at 30 December 2017 (18.11)
An exchange loss of $1.75m was a significant component of the 
movement in net liability in the year. In Sterling, the net deficit 
decreased by £2.28m in the period to £13.40m.
A full actuarial valuation was performed in respect of the plan in 
September 2016. Following this valuation a new deficit recovery 
contribution schedule was agreed with the Trustee. Under this 
agreement, contributions of £2.25m per annum are payable by the 
Company. These contributions commenced on 1 July 2017. This 
amount rises by 3% per annum, with the first increase applicable in 
July 2018. The agreement is for a period of 5 years 7 months until 
31 January 2023, at which point the funding shortfall is expected to 
be eliminated. In addition, and consistent with previous practice, an 
annual allowance of £0.25m will be paid to the plan towards the 
costs of its administration and management.
Additionally, the Company is committed to funding agreed transfer 
values out of the plan, at a funding rate of 50% of the transfer 
value. 16

Cash flow
The Group had net cash of $30.77m at 30 December 2017, an

The Group delivered a characteristically strong cash flow 
performance in 2017. The business model has low fixed capital 
requirements and an efficient working capital profile. This was 
demonstrated in the underlying operating profit to cash conversion 
rate for the year of 99%.
$24.94m of free cash flow was generated in the period.
Balance sheet and Shareholders’ funds
Net assets at 30 December 2017 were $42.09m, compared to 
$29.33m at 31 December 2016. The balance sheet is summarised as

Pension deficit (18.11) (19.29)
Other assets/(liabilities) – net (0.44) (1.69)
Net assets 42.09 29.33
Shareholders’ funds increased by $12.76m, comprising: net profit in 
the period of $28.93m; $(0.56)m of exchange losses; net pension 
re-measurement gains of $0.94m; $(0.70)m of net share option 
related movements; and $(15.85)m equity dividends paid to 
Shareholders.
Balance sheet funding
The Board is committed to aligning the Group’s funding with its 
strategic priorities. This requires a stable, secure and flexible balance 
sheet through the cycle. The Group will therefore typically remain 
ungeared and hold a net cash position.
These funding guidelines aim to provide operational and financial 
flexibility:
— to facilitate continued investment in marketing, people and 
technology through different economic cycles, recognising that 
an economic downturn typically represents a market share 
opportunity for the business;
— to protect the ability of the business to act swiftly as growth 
opportunities arise in accordance with the Group’s capital 
allocation guidelines;
— to underpin a commitment to Shareholders through the 
maintenance of regular interim and final dividend payments; and
— to meet our pension contribution commitments as they fall due.
The quantum of the net cash position target at each year-end will be 
influenced broadly by reference to the investment requirements of 
the business, and the subsequent year’s anticipated full year ordinary 
dividend and pension payment obligations.
The Board will keep these guidelines under review and is prepared to 
be flexible if circumstances warrant.
Capital allocation
The Board’s capital allocation framework is designed to deliver 
increasing Shareholder value, driven by the execution of the Group’s 
growth strategy. The Group’s capital allocation priorities are:
Organic growth investments
— Either capital projects or those expensed in the income statement
— Market share opportunities in existing markets
Interim and final dividend payments
— Increasing broadly in line with earnings per share through the 
cycle
— Aim to at least maintain dividend per share in a downturn
Residual legacy pension funding
— In line with agreed deficit recovery funding schedule
— Further de-risking initiatives, if viable
Mergers & acquisitions
— Not a near term priority
— Opportunities that would support organic growth 
Other Shareholder distributions
— Quantified by reference to cash over and above balance sheet 
funding requirement
— Supplementary dividends most likely method; other methods may 
be considered
In keeping with these capital allocation priorities, and taking into 
account both the cash generative nature of business operations and 
the Group’s investment plans for 2018 and beyond, the Board has 
recommended a return to Shareholders of around $16.8m by way of 
a supplementary dividend of 60.00c per share, payable in May 2018.
Financial Review continued  17

Treasury policy
The financial requirements of the Group are managed through a 
centralised treasury policy. The Group operates cash pooling 
arrangements for its North American operations. Forward contracts 
are taken out to buy or sell currencies relating to specific receivables 
and payables as well as remittances from overseas subsidiaries. The 
Group holds the majority of its cash with its principal US and UK 
bankers. A facility with the principal US bank, JPMorgan Chase, N.A., 
is available to fund the short-term working capital requirements of 
the North American business.
The Group has $20.5m of working capital facilities with its principal 
US bank. The interest rate is US$ LIBOR plus 1.5%, and the facilities 
expire on 31 May 2019 ($20.0m US facility) and 31 August 2018 
($0.5m Canadian facility). In addition, an overdraft facility of £1.0m, 
with an interest rate of bank base rate plus 2.0%, is available from 
the Group’s principal UK bank, Lloyds Bank plc.
Critical accounting policies
Critical accounting policies are those that require significant 
judgments or estimates and potentially result in materially different 
results under different assumptions or conditions. It is considered 
that the only critical accounting policy is in respect of pensions.
Going concern
The Board reviews several factors when considering whether the 
financial statements should be prepared on a going concern basis:
— The Group’s business activities, together with management’s 
current view of circumstances likely to affect its future 
development, performance and financial position (summarised in 
the Strategic Report on pages 6 to 27).
— The financial position of the Group, its principal risks and 
uncertainties, its cash flows, net cash position, borrowing facilities 
and policies for managing financial risk, which are described in 
this Financial Review and Principal Risks & Uncertainties on pages 
14 to 23.
As a result of this review, the Board has a reasonable expectation 
that the Group has adequate resources to continue to operate for a 
period of at least twelve months from the date this report was 
approved. Accordingly, the Board continues to adopt the going 
concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
Long-term prospects and viability
In accordance with Provision C.2.2 of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code 2016, the Board has assessed the prospects and viability of the 
Group.
Assessment of prospects
The Group’s strategy, market position and business model, as set out 
on pages 8 to 13 of the Strategic Report, are central to an 
understanding of its prospects. These factors provide a framework 
for the rolling three year plan which is developed as part of the 
annual budget process and reviewed by the Board to assess the 
Group’s prospects. Established and reliable demand forecasting 
models are driven by customer acquisition and retention 
assumptions, which are flexed to account for known initiatives and 
anticipated market developments over the three year forecast period.
The three year timeframe for assessing both prospects and viability is 
considered to be appropriate due to the following factors:
— It is consistent with the Group’s rolling three year strategic 
planning process.
— It reflects reasonable expectations in terms of the reliability and 
accuracy of operational forecasting models.
— It acknowledges that the Group’s business model does not rely 
heavily on fixed capital, long-term contracts or fixed external 
financing arrangements.
— It recognises that projections looking out further than three years 
become significantly less meaningful in the context of the 
fast-moving nature of the business and its markets.
Confirmation of viability
The Board’s assessment of the Group’s prospects, as described 
above, has been made with reference to current market conditions 
and known risk factors. The principal risks and uncertainties facing 
the Group are outlined on pages 18 to 23. In light of the Group’s 
financial performance over recent years, the Board considers that the 
key factor which would prejudice the delivery of the Group’s stated 
financial objectives is a significant decline in demand, leading to 
lower or negative revenue growth and a lower return on marketing 
spend. Using the current three year rolling forecasts as a base case, 
alternative forecasts have been produced to model the effects on 
the Group’s liquidity and solvency of very severe but plausible 
combinations of the principal risks and uncertainties on demand 
levels in the business.
The basis for the key assumptions used in the viability model was an 
overall effect similar to, but more severe than, that experienced 
during the 2008/9 financial crisis. New customer acquisition and 
existing customer retention metrics were significantly degraded in 
the model, but expenditure in the areas of marketing, payroll and 
technology were maintained at 2017 levels or higher. Revenue and 
profitability are clearly affected in this scenario, but the business 
retains a robust financial position with the Group able to maintain its 
external dividend payments at current rates. 
The assumptions used in the viability model and the resultant 
sensitised financial forecasts have been reviewed and approved by 
the Board. The conclusion of this review is that the Group has 
significant financial flexibility, starting with a net cash position, but 
remaining cash positive even under severe economic stress and able 
to continue investing in marketing, people and technology, which 
are key differentiators in its strategy.
Based on this review of the Group’s prospects and viability, the 
Directors confirm that they have a reasonable expectation that the 
Group will continue to operate and to meet its liabilities as they fall 
due, for the next three years. 18

Principal Risks & Uncertainties
4imprint seeks to take a balanced approach 
to the risks and uncertainties that it faces.
There is an appetite for risk-taking that contributes to both the operational agility and innovative culture which 4imprint believes is necessary 
to meet its strategic objectives. That appetite is, however, tempered by risk identification, evaluation and management.
The Board has ultimate responsibility for the Group’s risk management process, although responsibility for reviewing specific risk controls 
may be delegated to the Audit Committee. The Executive Directors and operational management teams are responsible for the identification 
and evaluation of risks and the subsequent implementation of specific risk mitigation activities. It is important to note that business 
operations are conducted from centralised facilities in each territory, with short reporting lines. Consequently, the Executive Directors are 
close to day-to-day matters, facilitating early identification of, and response to, evolving risks.
Risk appetite, the risk management process, and associated mitigating activities are all essential elements of the Group’s strategic and 
operational planning processes.
4imprint’s business model means that it may be affected by a number of risks, not all of which are within its control. Outlined below are the 
current principal potential risks and uncertainties to the successful delivery of the Group’s strategic goals. The list is not exhaustive and other, 
as yet unidentified, factors may have an adverse effect.
Economic and market risks
Macroeconomic conditions
Description of risk
The business conducts most of its operations in North America and would be affected by a downturn in general economic conditions in this 
region. The promotional products market would likely soften in line with the general economy.
Potential impact
— Customer acquisition and retention could fall.
— The growth and profitability levels called for in the Group strategic plan may not be achieved.
— Cash generation could be reduced broadly corresponding to a reduction in profitability.
Mitigating activities
— Management monitors economic and market conditions to ensure that appropriate and timely adjustments are made to marketing and 
other budgets.
— The customer proposition in terms of promotions, price, value and quality of product can be adjusted to resonate with the prevailing 
economic climate.
Link to strategy
— Organic revenue growth
— Cash generation and profitability

Economic and market risks continued
Competition
Description of risk
The promotional products markets in which the business operates are intensely competitive and the rapid development of internet 
commerce, digital marketing and technological innovation may allow competitors to reach a broader audience. In addition, new or disruptive 
business models may be developed by existing competitors or new entrants.
Potential impact
— Aggressive competitive activity could result in pressure on prices, margin erosion and loss of market share. All of these factors could impair 
the growth of the business and therefore impact the financial results.
— The Group’s strategy based on achieving organic growth in fragmented markets may need to be reassessed.
Mitigating activities
— An open-minded culture and an appetite for technology are encouraged, with the aim of positioning the business at the forefront of 
innovation in the industry.
— Management monitors competitive activity in the marketplace.
— Price, satisfaction and service level guarantees are an integral part of the customer proposition. Customer surveys and market research are 
used to gauge customer satisfaction and perception, and the causes of any negative indications are investigated and addressed rapidly.

— Organic revenue growth
— Cash generation and profitability
Direction
 The competitive landscape to date has been relatively 
consistent in our main markets
Currency exchange
Description of risk
There is some exposure to currency exchange risk. Although the business trades predominantly in US dollars, it also transacts business in 
Canadian dollars, Sterling and Euros, leading to some currency risk on trading. In addition, Head Office costs, pension scheme commitments 
and dividends are payable in Sterling, consequently the business may be adversely impacted by movements in the Sterling/US dollar exchange 
rate when it repatriates cash to the UK.
Potential impact
— The financial results of trading operations, and therefore overall profitability, may be negatively affected.
— The financial condition and cash position of the Group may differ materially from expectations. In an extreme scenario, the Group’s 
strategic objectives around capital structure and regular dividend commitments could be disrupted.
Mitigating activities
— The Group reports its results in US dollars, minimising currency impact on reported revenue, operating profit and net assets since trading 
operations are concentrated largely in North America.
— The Group uses forward contracts to hedge anticipated cash receipts from its overseas operations, giving some certainty of amounts 
receivable in Sterling.

Operational risks
Business facility disruption
Description of risk
The business model means that operations are concentrated in centralised offices and distribution facilities. The performance of the business 
could be adversely affected if activities at one of these facilities were to be disrupted, for example, by fire, flood, loss of power or 
telecommunication failure.
Potential impact
— The inability to service customer orders over any extended period would result in significant revenue loss, deterioration of customer 
acquisition and retention metrics and diminished return on marketing investment.
Mitigating activities
— Back-up and business continuity procedures, including remote customer service capability, are in place to ensure that customer service 
disruption is minimised.
— Websites are cloud-based, and data is backed up immediately to off-site servers.
— Relationships are maintained with third party embroidery contractors to provide backup in the event of facility unavailability.
Link to strategy
— Market leadership
— Organic revenue growth
— Cash generation and profitability
Direction
 No significant change in the nature of these risks
Disruption to the product supply chain or delivery service
Description of risk
As a consequence of the Group’s drop-ship distribution model, trading operations could be interrupted if: (i) the activities of a key supplier 
were disrupted and it was not possible to source an alternative supplier in the short term; or (ii) the primary parcel delivery partner used by 
the business suffered significantly degraded service levels.
Potential impact
— Inability to fulfil customer orders would lead to lost revenue and a negative impact on customer acquisition and retention statistics.
— Reputation for excellent service may be damaged.
Mitigating activities
— A rigorous selection process is in place for key suppliers, with evaluation and monitoring of quality, production capability and capacity, 
ethical standards and financial stability.
— Wherever possible, relationships are maintained with suitable alternative suppliers for each product category.
— Secondary relationships are in place with alternative parcel carriers.
Link to strategy
— Market leadership
— Organic revenue growth

Direction
 Some risk in increasing supplier concentration, offset by 
further development of supplier compliance initiatives  21

Operational risks continued
Disturbance in established marketing techniques
Description of risk
The success of the business relies on its ability to attract new and retain existing customers through a variety of marketing techniques. These 
methods may become less effective as follows:
Offline: The flow of print catalogues and sample packages would be disrupted by the incapacity of the US Postal Service to make deliveries, 
for example, due to natural disasters or labour activism.
Online: Search engines are an important source for channelling customer activity to 4imprint’s websites. The efficiency of search engine 
marketing could be adversely affected if the search engines were to modify their algorithms or otherwise make substantial changes to their 
practices.
Potential impact
If sustained over anything more than a short time period, an externally driven decrease in the effectiveness of key marketing techniques 
would cause damage to the customer file as acquisition and retention fall. This would affect order flow and revenue in the short term and 
the productivity of the customer file over a longer period, impacting growth prospects.
Mitigating activities
— Offline: Developments in the US Postal Service are closely monitored through industry associations and lobbying groups. Alternative parcel 
carriers are continuously evaluated.
— Online: Management stays very close to new developments and emerging technologies in the online space. Efforts are focused on 
anticipating changes and ensuring compliance with both the requirements of providers and applicable laws. The Marketing team 
constantly tests and evaluates new marketing techniques and opportunities.

Operational risks continued
Reliance on key personnel
Description of risk
Performance depends on the business’s ability to continue to attract, motivate and retain key staff. These individuals possess sales and 
marketing, merchandising, supply chain, IT, financial and general management skills that are key to the continued successful operation of the 
business.
Potential impact
— The loss of key employees or inability to attract appropriate talent could adversely affect the Group’s ability to meet its strategic 
objectives, with a consequent negative impact on future results.
Mitigating activities
— The business is proactive in aiming to deliver a first class working environment. In addition, attractive employment terms and incentive 
plans are designed with a view to attracting and retaining key personnel.

Direction

appropriate talent
Technological risks
Failure or interruption of information technology systems and infrastructure
Description of risk
The business is highly dependent on the efficient functioning of its IT infrastructure. An interruption or degradation of services at a central 
office facility would affect critical order processing systems and thereby compromise the ability of the business to deliver on its customer 
service proposition.
Potential impact
— In the short term, orders would be lost and delivery deadlines missed, decreasing the efficiency of marketing investment and impacting 
customer acquisition and retention.
— Revenue and profitability are directly related to order flow and would be adversely affected as a consequence of a major IT failure.
— Depending on the severity of the incident, longer term reputational damage could result.
Mitigating activities
— There is significant ongoing investment in both the IT team supporting the business and the hardware and software system requirements 
for a stable and secure operating platform.
— Back-up and recovery processes are in place to minimise the impact of information technology interruption, including immediate 
replication of data at an alternative site.
— Cloud-based hosting for eCommerce and other back end functionality.

Technological risks continued
Failure to adapt to new technological innovations
Description of risk
The operating platforms of the business may not be able to respond and adapt to rapid changes in technology. If the development of 
websites and customer-facing applications for alternative devices and platforms is slow or ineffective, the business could lose competitive 
edge. In addition, the development of order processing, supplier-facing and data analytics technologies could fail to deliver the improvements 
in speed, ease and efficiency necessary to attract and retain a productive customer base.
Potential impact
— If the business fails to adapt to new technologies and therefore falls behind in the marketplace, it may fail to capture the number of new 
customers and retain existing customers at the rate required to deliver the growth rates called for in the Group’s strategic plan.
Mitigating activities
— Management has a keen awareness of the need to keep pace with the rapidly changing and continuously evolving technological 
landscape.
— An appetite for technological innovation is encouraged in the business. Sustained investment is made in the development of both 
outward-facing and back office systems.

Direction
 Innovation remains a priority
Security of customer data
Description of risk
Unauthorised access to and misappropriation of customer data could lead to reputational damage and loss of customer confidence.
Potential impact
— A significant security breach could lead to litigation and losses, with a costly rectification process. In addition, it might be damaging to the 
Group’s reputation and brand.
— An event of this nature might result in significant expense, impacting the Group’s ability to meet its strategic objectives.
Mitigating activities
— The business employs IT staff who are appropriately trained to mitigate IT security violations. In particular, emerging cyber risks are 
proactively monitored.
— Technical and physical controls are in place to mitigate unauthorised access to customer data, and there is an ongoing investment process 
in place to maintain and enhance the integrity and efficiency of the IT infrastructure and its security.

Our People and Culture
Our strategic objectives specifically identify 
investment in our people as a key driver of 
competitive advantage. We are committed to a 
culture that encourages the training, development, 
wellbeing and participation of every team member.
A great place  
to work
Business objectives are shared with 
team members via quarterly briefings, 
and everyone participates in a quarterly 
“gain share” bonus plan that is based 
on achievement of tangible, clearly 
communicated performance targets.
Training of new team members covers 
job-specific skills, other soft skills and a 
grounding in the 4imprint philosophy. 
Existing team members are regularly 
offered ongoing training opportunities 
in a variety of subjects, some directly 
business-related, and others aimed 
towards personal development, wellness 
initiatives and general education. In 
addition, the pursuit of external educational 
opportunities and professional qualifications 
is encouraged through our popular 
tuition reimbursement programme.
The welfare of our team members is also 
addressed through a competitive benefits 
package, including strong medical, dental 
and pension offerings. We run an employee 
wellness programme, including an on-
site medical clinic in the US operation. 
In addition, many workplace perks are 
available, and our team members organise 
fun events based around themes such 
as Customer Service Week, making the 
Great Places To Work list, and celebrating 
new orders received records.  25

A proactive approach to health and safety 
is an important aspect of the 4imprint 
workplace. Desk-based ergonomics and 
best practice protocols in the operation 
of machinery and material handling at 
our distribution centre are key areas of 
emphasis in promoting a safety culture. A 
Safety Committee meets on a regular basis 
to review any incidents or near misses, 
and to consider future improvements or 
changes in regulatory requirements.
We understand the importance and 
beneficial effect of diversity within our 
team, and we aim to foster a culture that 
recruits, develops and promotes team 
members regardless of background. 
We are committed to the principle of 
equal opportunity in employment, and 
no applicant or employee receives less 
favourable treatment on the grounds of 
nationality, age, gender, sexual orientation, 
religion, race, ethnicity or disability. We 
recognise our responsibility to disabled 
persons and endeavour to assist them to 
make their full contribution at work. Where 
team members become disabled, every 
practical effort is made to allow them to 
continue in their jobs or to allow them 
to retrain for suitable alternative work.
The Group employs over 950 people, 75% 
of whom are female. One third of the 
North American executive team and two 
thirds of the UK senior team are female. 
As at 30 December 2017 the Board had 
no female members, and one of six Board 
members (16%) is a non-UK national.
We are proud of the fact that 2017 was 
the tenth consecutive year that the North 
American operation has been included on 
the prestigious Great Places To Work list 
of the Best Medium Sized Workplaces in 
the USA. The UK-based business maintains 
its Investors in People accreditation. We 
are very proud of these accolades, which 
are emblematic of team members who 
go above and beyond every day to help 
each other, to provide our customers with 
remarkable service and to give back to 
their communities because they know and 
believe that it is the right thing to do.

Corporate & Social Responsibility Report
The Board believes that a strong and principled 
approach to corporate and social responsibility 
is fundamentally important to the present and 
future success of 4imprint.
Our intention is to make that impact positive 
from a social, economic and environmental 
perspective.
To set the tone, the Board has developed, 
approved and issued a social and ethical 
policy. The purpose of this policy is to set 
broad guidelines within which the Group 
should conduct its business operations in 
accordance with best practice and in 
compliance with relevant legislation such as 
the Modern Slavery Act. The policy 
addresses such issues as working hours, 
wages, discrimination, collective bargaining, 
health & safety and child labour.
These broad principles are reinforced in our 
“4imprint Supply Chain Code of Conduct”. 
This is based on the International Labour 
Organization’s “Declaration on Fundamental 
Principles and Rights at Work” and the Fair 
Labor Association’s (FLA) “Principles of Fair 
Labor and Responsible Sourcing”. The 
4imprint Supply Chain Code of Conduct was 
updated during 2017 to be fully aligned with 
the FLA’s Workplace Code of Conduct, 
including the new code element on Fair 
Compensation. 4imprint team members are 
actively involved in the FLA’s activities.
At the operational level, this means that 
4imprint’s goal is to work with suppliers who 
are diligent in managing their sourcing 
practices and selecting manufacturing 
facilities, who commit to ensuring safe 
working environments where employees are 
adequately compensated and who are able 
to develop the necessary manufacturing, 
design and quality capabilities. These ethical 
sourcing expectations are communicated 
and reviewed through our document 
“4imprint’s Expectations of Supplier Factory 
& Product Compliance”, signature of which 
reaffirms the supplier’s commitment to these 
principles within their own organisation and 
supply base. In addition, 4imprint 
representatives are actively involved in our 
US trade association, Promotional Product 
Association International, in particular with 
its leadership and training programme in 
supply chain management.
In support of our supply chain expectations, 
our product sourcing professionals schedule 
regular visits to both domestic supplier 
facilities and to the overseas factories where 
the base product is manufactured. In 
addition, we conduct a programme of 
independent audits of overseas 
manufacturing facilities in conjunction with 
our key suppliers. Our preference is to work 
with suppliers and manufacturers on areas 
of concern and to develop a corrective 
action plan, although ultimately business 
would be re-sourced if compliance is not 
achieved.
Underpinning all of our product supply 
efforts is our aim to match remarkable 
customer service with great products that 
meet functional, environmental and safety 
standards in each market of distribution. Our 
internal supply chain compliance team works 
to stay abreast of current and developing 
standards, as set by the regulatory bodies, 
and liaises with our supplier partners to 
manage and validate product testing and 
other quality assurance procedures.
Our culture encourages responsible practice 
at all levels of the organisation and presents 
clear guiding principles that drive ethical 
interactions with, and outcomes for, our key 
stakeholders.
4imprint is run in accordance with The 
Golden Rule – treat others as you would 
wish to be treated yourself. This mind-set 
is evident across the business: in our 
customer service proposition and 
guarantees; in our product sourcing 
initiatives; in the way that our team 
members interact with our customers, our 
supplier partners and with each other; in the 
way that we engage in our communities and 
in our respect for the environment.
We are pleased to remain a constituent 
company in the FTSE4Good Index Series, the 
global responsible investment index 
designed to identify companies that 
demonstrate strong environmental, social 
and governance (ESG) practices, measured 
against globally recognised standards.
Product and supply
Our suppliers are based in the US and 
Canada for the North American business, 
and in the UK and EU for the UK and Ireland 
business. Therefore, our supply base is 
essentially domestic, with our suppliers 
taking care of the importing/manufacture, 
inventory management and printing 
capabilities required to ship thousands of 
orders on a daily basis.
We are acutely aware, however, that our 
end-to-end supply chain is a long and 
complex one that extends far beyond our 
domestic supply partners to the 
manufacturers of the base product across 
the globe. As such, our business activities 
can have a significant impact at many levels.   27

Overview Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Additional Information Overview Strategic Report
Our UK business has its own charitable 
giving initiative, “Helping Hand”, which also 
aims to use the power of promotional 
products in the support of good causes.
Environment
The Board recognises its obligations to 
protect the environment and is committed 
both to achieving the required 
environmental standards across all the 
activities of the Group and to minimising its 
environmental impact. The management 
teams in both the North American and UK 
businesses assess and monitor the potential 
impact of operations on the environment. 
Sustainability, energy consumption and 
waste management are key areas of focus.
Printed marketing materials such as 
catalogues use paper sourced from 
sustainable forests, conforming to Forestry 
Stewardship Council (FSC) requirements.
In 2017 a major capital project was the 
installation of a LED lighting system at our 
distribution centre in Oshkosh. The new LED 
fixtures use 50% less energy than the 
fluorescent bulbs they replaced. LED is 
essentially maintenance-free and the fixtures 
will last at least five times longer than 
fluorescent. In addition, LED has a much 
smaller impact on the environment 
compared to fluorescent bulbs which are 
hazardous due to mercury and phosphor. 
We have received very positive feedback 
from our team members who appreciate the 
brighter working environment (equivalent to 
daylight) which makes it easier to colour 
match, helping with quality in our 
embroidery operation. Finally, we were able 
to repurpose the fluorescent fixtures that we 
removed by donating them to small 
businesses and workshops who were able to 
upgrade from even older, less efficient 
lighting solutions than the fluorescent bulbs 
we replaced.
During the year, a committee on 
sustainability was formed in the US business 
under the acronym SMART – (Sustainability. 
Making A Renewable Tomorrow). This 
initiative kicked off with a major upgrade in 
the recycling of waste materials across the 
business, taking advantage of advanced 
single stream recycling capability. The initial 
results of this have been very positive, and 
the SMART programme has been well 
received across the business, particularly in 
forums on our in-house social media 
platform. Further sustainability initiatives are 
planned for 2018 and beyond.
The Strategic Report was approved by the Board on 7 March 2018.

Community and charitable giving
Team members are given paid time off to be 
used specifically for volunteering for a local 
charity or non-profit organisation of their 
choice. 4imprint is actively involved in its 
local communities in many other ways, for 
example, in team sponsorships, student 
scholarships at local colleges, product 
donations for events such as fun runs, 5Ks 
and marathons, and encouragement of team 
members to participate on volunteer boards 
and committees.
Our North American business operates its 
“one by one
®
” charitable giving programme 
which reflects our culture and principles. 
Each business day we donate at least three 
$500 grants to non-profit organisations. 
These grants are to be used on promotional 
products to help spread the word, recruit 
volunteers or thank donors. In 2017, there 
were 3,641 applicants, with 828 grants 
awarded. The total value of “one by one
®
” 
grants awarded was more than $400,000. 
On top of this we made over 3,200 other 
donations of product to “one by one
®
” 
applicants, businesses, team members and 
customers in support of fundraising or 
charitable causes.

Statement on Corporate Governance
The disclosures required by company law in respect of the Takeover 
Directive in relation to the Group’s capital structure are included in 
the Directors’ Report on page 30.
During 2017, the Group has complied with the provisions of The UK 
Corporate Governance Code (2016) (the “Code”).
The Code is publicly available on the Financial Reporting Council’s 
website, www.frc.org.uk.
The Board
The Board is responsible to Shareholders for creating and sustaining 
Shareholder value through the management of the Group’s business. 
It is also responsible for ensuring that management maintains a 
system of control that provides assurance of effective and efficient 
operations, internal financial control and compliance with laws and 
regulations.
The Board is the decision-making body for all matters material to the 
Group’s finances, strategy and reputation.
The Board has a formal schedule of matters reserved for its decision 
and the schedule was reconsidered and approved by the Board at its 
meeting on 12 December 2017. The schedule includes: the approval 
of interim and annual financial statements; the acquisition and 
disposal of businesses; changes to the capital structure of the 
Company; the appointment or removal of Directors; and the 
financing of the Group’s businesses. Otherwise, the Board delegates 
day-to-day management of the Group to the Executive Directors.
Throughout the period ending 30 December 2017 and in accordance 
with provision C.2.1 of the Code, the Board has carried out a robust 
assessment of the principal risks and uncertainties facing the Group, 
including those that would threaten its business model, future 
performance, solvency or liquidity. This is described in the Principal 
Risks and Uncertainties section on pages 18 to 23.
The Board has assessed the future prospects of the Group in 
accordance with provision C.2.2 of the Code. Based on the results of 
this analysis, the Board has a reasonable expectation that the Group 
will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they 
fall due over the three year period of their assessment. Details of the 
assessment performed by the Board, including an assessment of 
those risks most likely to impact the Group’s future prospects and 
viability, have been set out on page 17.
In any circumstances where a Director has a concern, which cannot 
be resolved, about the running of the Company or a proposed 
action, any such concern is recorded in the minutes of Board 
meetings.
The Companies Act 2006 codifies the duty of the Directors to avoid 
a situation in which they have, or could have, an interest that 
conflicts, or may possibly conflict, with the interests of the Company. 
A Director will not be in breach of that duty if the relevant matter 
has been authorised in accordance with the Articles of Association 
by the other Directors. Each Director has confirmed that they are 
aware of the need to notify the Company of any potential conflict of 
interest. Mr. A.J. Scull has notified the Company that he is a Director 
and Company Secretary of the 4imprint Pension Trustee Company 
Limited and a Director and Company Secretary of 4imprint 2016 
Pension Trustee Company Limited, which administers the legacy 
defined benefit pension scheme.
Specific responsibilities have been delegated to Board Committees 
which have access to independent expert advice at the Group’s 
expense. The details of the Board Committees and their activities are 
set out on pages 34 to 40.
The Non-Executive Directors meet from time to time, without the 
Executive Directors being present.
All Directors have access to the advice and services of the Company 
Secretary.
At the period end the Board consisted of the Non-Executive 
Chairman, the Group Chief Executive Officer, the Group Chief 
Financial Officer, the Corporate Services Director and two 
Independent Non-Executive Directors. The role of the Non-Executive 
Directors includes assisting in the development of strategy, 
scrutinising the performance of management, monitoring the 
integrity of financial information and systems of risk management as 
well as determining the appointment, removal and remuneration of 
Executive Directors.
Key activities of the Board in 2017 included:
— review and approval of full year and half year results;
— review and approval of 2018 budget and the three year plan;
— review of dividend policy and approval of dividends to be paid in 
respect of 2017; 
— review of principal risks and uncertainties; 
— receipt and review of reports on regulatory matters, including, for 
example, health, safety and environmental issues;
— receipt of post-meeting reports from the Chairs of the 
Remuneration, Nomination and Audit Committees;
— site visits to the Oshkosh and Manchester operations; and
— strategic review and development of balance sheet funding and 
capital allocation guidelines.
The current Non-Executive Directors have letters of appointment for 
three years from 28 May 2016 for Mr. J.A. Warren, 11 June 2015 for 
Mr. C.J. Brady and 1 February 2016 for Mr. P.S. Moody, which are 
available for inspection by any person at the Company’s registered 
office during normal business hours and also at the AGM.
The Corporate Services Director also acts as the Company Secretary. 
This situation has been reconsidered by the Board at its meeting on 
12 December 2017 and approved by the Board. The Corporate 
Services Director took no part in that decision. The appointment and 
removal of the Company Secretary is a matter to be decided by the 
Board as a whole (excluding the Corporate Services Director).
The Board has at least six scheduled meetings per year and 
additional Board meetings are convened as and when required. In 
advance of each meeting, the Board receives minutes of the previous 
meeting, detailed financial information on the performance of the 
business and items for discussion. This enables the Directors to make 
informed decisions on the corporate and business issues under 
consideration. Additionally, the Company provides resources as 
appropriate, to enable Directors to update their skills and 
knowledge. Independent professional advice is available to the 
Directors as required, at the Company’s expense.  33

The Board evaluations and those of its Committees, which were 
undertaken during the five years ending 31 December 2016 were 
undertaken, internally, through a process conducted by the 
Non-Executive Directors, assisted by the Company Secretary. The 
questions asked during the process were based on matters set out in 
the Code and topics considered included the composition of the 
Board and its Committees, the effectiveness of Board and 
Committee Meetings, strategy, leadership and succession. The 
results of those evaluations highlighted the particular significance of 
strategic development and delivery, succession planning and 
strengthening of the senior management team in preparation for the 
continued growth of the business. Those issues have been addressed 
in 2017 and will be kept under review. Against that background, no 
internal or external evaluation was undertaken during 2017, but the 
programme of evaluation is scheduled to continue in 2018.

Board Committees
The Board has three permanent Committees being the Audit 
Committee, the Nomination Committee and the Remuneration

(11.80%). In addition, the Estate of Mr. K.J. Minton has advised that 
its holding is now below 3%.
The Board places a high value on its relations with its investors and 
consults with Shareholders in connection with specific issues where 
it considers it appropriate. The Group, principally through the Chief 
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has regular dialogue 
and meetings with institutional shareholders, fund managers and 
analysts. Subject always to the constraints regarding sensitive 
information, discussions cover a wide range of issues, including 
strategy, performance, management and governance.
The Board considers it important to understand the views of 
Shareholders, in particular, any issues which concern them. The 
Senior Independent Non-Executive Director is available to meet 
major Shareholders, if they so wish.
Restrictions on voting
No member shall be entitled to vote at any general meeting in 
respect of any shares held by that member if any call or other sum 
then payable by that member in respect of that share remains 
unpaid. Currently, all issued shares are fully paid.
Private Shareholders can keep up-to-date through updates provided 
on the 4imprint corporate website, investors.4imprint.com, and 
through the provision of the Annual and Interim Reports and 
Accounts. Shareholders are invited at any time to write to the 
Non-Executive Chairman or any other Director to express their views 
and the AGM provides an opportunity for Shareholders to address 
their questions to the Board in person.

Nomination Committee
I am pleased to present my report to Shareholders as Chairman of 
the Nomination Committee.
Responsibilities of the Nomination Committee
The responsibilities of the Nomination Committee include:  
(i) reviewing the structure, size and composition of the Board and 
making recommendations to the Board with regard to any 
adjustments that are necessary; (ii) identifying and nominating 
candidates for the approval of the Board to fill Board vacancies as 
and when they arise; and (iii) putting in place plans for succession at 
Board level.
The Company supports the Code provision that Boards should 
consider the benefits of diversity, including gender, when making 
appointments and is committed to ensuring diversity, not just at 
Board level, but also across the Company’s senior management, not 
least because it believes that the business benefits from the widest 
range of perspectives and backgrounds. The Company’s aim as 
regards the composition of the Board is that it should have a balance 
of experience, skills and knowledge to enable each Director and the 
Board as a whole to discharge their duties effectively. Whilst the 
Company agrees that it is appropriate that it should seek to have 
diversity on its Board, it does not consider that this can be best 
achieved by establishing specific quotas and targets and 
appointments will continue to be made based wholly on merit.
The Nomination Committee has terms of reference which were 
reconsidered and approved by the Board of the Company at its 
Board meeting on 12 December 2017. These terms of reference are 
available for inspection at the Company’s registered office during 
normal business hours.
Appointment and replacement of Directors
Directors may be appointed by the Company by ordinary resolution 
or by the Board. A Director appointed by the Board holds office only 
until the next AGM and is then eligible for election by the 
Shareholders.
At every AGM of the Company, all Directors put themselves forward 
for re-election. The office of Director shall be vacated if: (a) he or she 
resigns or offers to resign and the Board resolves to accept such 
offer; (b) he or she is, or has been, suffering from mental ill health; 
(c) he or she becomes bankrupt or compounds with creditors 
generally; (d) he or she is prohibited by law from being a Director;  
(e) he or she ceases to be a Director by virtue of the provisions of the 
Companies Act; or (f) he or she is removed from office pursuant to 
the Articles of Association.
Composition of the Nomination Committee
I chair the Nomination Committee and I am an Independent 
Non-Executive Director. The other member of the Committee during 
the period was Mr. J.A. Warren, the Senior Independent Non-
Executive Director. The Chairman of the Company is usually invited 
to attend formal meetings of the Committee. Executive Directors 
may be invited to attend meetings of the Nomination Committee, as 
may the Corporate Services Director in his capacity as Company 
Secretary.
Meetings of the Nomination Committee
The Nomination Committee meets as frequently as is required to 
fulfil its duties. When there are no specific decisions or 
recommendations to be made, the Chairman of the Committee 
consults the other member of the Committee as necessary. During 
the period ended 30 December 2017 there was one meeting of the 
Nomination Committee.

Audit Committee
I am pleased to present my report to Shareholders as Chairman of 
the Audit Committee.
Responsibilities of the Audit Committee
The Audit Committee is responsible for maintaining an appropriate 
relationship with the Group’s external auditors and for reviewing the 
Group’s internal financial controls and the audit process. It aids the 
Board in seeking to ensure that the financial and non-financial 
information supplied to Shareholders presents a fair, balanced and 
understandable assessment of the Group’s performance and 
position.
The Committee reviews the effectiveness, objectivity and 
independence of the external auditors, and also considers the scope 
of their work and fees paid for audit and non-audit services.
The Audit Committee has terms of reference which were 
reconsidered and approved by the Board at its meeting on 
12 December 2017. These terms of reference are available for 
inspection at the Company’s registered office during normal business 
hours. The Board considers that the Audit Committee members have 
an understanding of the following areas:
— the principles of, and developments in, financial reporting 
including the applicable accounting standards and statements of 
recommended practice;
— key aspects of the Group’s operations including corporate policies 
and the Group’s internal control environment;
— matters which may influence the presentation of the accounts;
— the principles of, and developments in, company law, sector-
specific laws and other relevant corporate legislation;
— the role of internal and external auditing and risk management; 
and
— the regulatory framework for the Group’s businesses.
Composition of the Audit Committee
I chair the Audit Committee and I am the Senior Independent 
Non-Executive Director. I am a chartered accountant and was Group 
Finance Director of United Biscuits (Holdings) Plc and WH Smith PLC. 
The Board is of the view that I have recent and relevant financial 
knowledge and experience derived in particular from current roles as 
Chairman of the Audit Committee at Bloomsbury Publishing Plc, 
Welsh Water and Greencore Group plc.
The other member of the Committee during the period was Mr. C.J. 
Brady, an Independent Non-Executive Director. The Chairman of the 
Company and the Chief Financial Officer are normally invited to 
attend meetings of the Audit Committee as are, from time to time, 
the Chief Executive Officer, the Corporate Services Director and the 
Group Financial Controller. The Corporate Services Director attends 
meetings of the Audit Committee in his capacity as Company 
Secretary.
How the Audit Committee discharges its responsibilities
The Committee has unrestricted access to Company documents and 
information, as well as to employees of the Company and the 
external auditors. Members of the Committee may, in pursuit of 
their duties, take independent professional advice on any matter, at 
the Company’s expense. The Audit Committee Chairman reports the 
outcome of Audit Committee meetings to the Board.
The Audit Committee meets at least twice each year and has an 
agenda linked to events in the Group’s financial calendar. The Audit 
Committee met twice during 2017.
In order to fulfil its terms of reference, the Audit Committee receives 
and reviews presentations and reports from the Group’s senior 
management and the external auditors.
During the period, the Audit Committee formally reviewed draft 
Interim and Annual Reports and associated interim and year end 
results announcements. These reviews considered:
— the accounting principles, policies and practices adopted in the 
Group’s accounts and proposed changes to them; and
— significant accounting issues and areas of judgment and 
complexity.
The Audit Committee is required to assist the Board to fulfil its 
responsibilities relating to the adequacy and effectiveness of the 
control environment and the Group’s compliance with the Corporate 
Governance Code. To fulfil these duties, the Audit Committee 
reviewed:
— the external auditors’ review of internal controls and audit 
highlights memoranda;
— any reports on the systems of internal controls and risk 
management; and
— any reports on identified frauds perpetrated against the Group.
The Audit Committee is responsible for the development, 
implementation and monitoring of the Group’s policy on external 
audit. The Group’s policy on external audit prohibits certain types of 
non-audit work from being performed by the auditor, particularly in 
cases where auditor objectivity and independence would be put at 
risk.
Before any significant non-audit work is commissioned, the nature 
and extent of such work is considered, initially by the Chief Financial 
Officer and the Corporate Services Director, to determine if such 
work would put at risk auditor objectivity and independence. This 
process includes discussion with the audit partner at 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP. The matter is then referred to the 
Audit Committee for approval, prior to commissioning. 
Details of fees paid to the auditors in respect of audit and non-audit 
services are shown in note 2 to the consolidated financial 
statements.
During 2017, the Group’s auditors provided no non-audit services to 
the Group.
To fulfil its responsibility regarding the independence of the external 
auditors, the Audit Committee reviewed:
— changes and rotation of external audit team members in the 
audit plan for the current year;
— a report from the external auditors describing their arrangements 
to identify, report and manage any conflicts of interest; and
— the nature and extent of non-audit services provided by the 
external auditors. 36
4imprint Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 GOVERNANCE
Statement on Corporate Governance continued
To assess the effectiveness of the external auditors, the Audit 
Committee reviewed:
— the relevant skills and experience of the audit partner and team 
and their knowledge of the business;
— planning and scope of the audit and identification of areas of 
audit risk;
— execution of the audit plan; and
— formal reports presented to the Audit Committee.
To fulfil its responsibility for oversight of the external audit process, 
the Audit Committee reviewed:
— the terms, areas of responsibility, associated duties and scope of 
the audit as set out in the external auditors’ engagement letter 
for the forthcoming year;
— the external auditors’ overall work plan for the forthcoming year;
— the external auditors’ fee proposal;
— the major issues that arose during the course of the audit and 
their resolution;
— key accounting and audit judgments;
— the levels of errors identified during the audit; and
— recommendations made by the external auditors in their 
management letters and the adequacy of management’s 
response.
Main activities of the Committee during the period ended 
30 December 2017
During the period ended 30 December 2017, the Audit Committee’s 
business has included the following items:
— consideration and approval of half year results;
— consideration and approval of full year results;
— principal judgmental accounting matters affecting the Group 
based on reports from both the Group’s management and the 
external auditors;
— review of external audit plans and reports;
— consideration of fraud and loss prevention measures in the 
Group;
— consideration and approval of risk assessments relating to the 
Group’s business; and
— specific investigations as required.
Financial reporting and significant financial judgments
The Committee assesses whether suitable accounting policies have 
been adopted and whether management has made appropriate 
estimates and judgments. The Committee reviews accounting papers 
prepared by management which provide details on the main 
financial reporting judgments.
The Committee also reviews reports by the external auditors on the 
half year and full year results which highlight any issues arising from 
the work undertaken in respect of the half year review and year end 
audit.
Specific areas of audit and accounting judgment reviewed by the 
Committee were:
Accounting for defined benefit pension scheme
The defined benefit pension scheme is material to the financial 
position of the Group. The amount shown in the balance sheet is 
sensitive to changes in key actuarial assumptions. The Committee 
reviewed the appropriateness and consistency of these assumptions 
and the auditors confirmed that the assumptions used were 
reasonable and within an acceptable range. Full disclosure of the 
pension scheme is provided in note 17 to the financial statements, 
which includes the key period end assumptions on page 75 and the 
sensitivities on page 76.
Supplier rebates
As in previous years, the business accrued rebates from key suppliers 
based on agreed fixed rates relating to the volumes of goods 
purchased in a calendar year. The Committee does not consider the 
Group’s rebates to be highly complex as: they are volume-related; 
agreement periods are coterminous with the Group’s accounting 
period; there are written agreements in place with suppliers; and 
historically rebates have been collected. However, FRC guidance has 
highlighted this as an area of focus, as the rebates are material to the 
results for the period.
The Committee has discussed any judgments made in accruing 
supplier rebates and the collectability of these amounts with 
management and the external auditors. The Committee is satisfied 
that the amounts of income accrued are appropriate.
Financial statements
The Committee considered, and was satisfied, with management’s 
presentation of the financial statements for the period ended 
30 December 2017 and, in particular, the presentation of certain 
items as exceptional items.
The auditors confirmed to the Committee that they were not aware 
of any material misstatements during the course of their work. The 
Committee is satisfied that the judgments made by management are 
reasonable and that appropriate disclosures have been included in 
the financial statements.
After reviewing the presentation from management and following 
discussions with the auditors, the Committee is satisfied that:
— the financial statements appropriately address the critical 
judgments and key estimates both in respect of the amounts 
reported and the related disclosures in the financial statements;
— the processes used for determining the value of the assets and 
liabilities have been appropriately reviewed, challenged and are 
sufficiently robust; and
— the Annual Report and Accounts taken as a whole are fair, 
balanced and understandable and provide the information 
necessary for Shareholders to assess the Group’s position and 
performance, business model and strategy and should be 
recommended to the Board as such.  37
4imprint Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Overview Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Additional Information
In arriving at the conclusion that the Annual Report and Accounts 
were fair, balanced and understandable the Committee considered:
— any feedback provided by Shareholders on the Group’s 2016 
Annual Report and Accounts and trading updates, and 
information received by the Board throughout the period;
— the processes underpinning the compilation of the Annual Report 
and the Group’s reporting governance framework; and
— the reviews and findings of the Group’s auditors.
Auditor independence
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, or its predecessor firms, has been the 
Company’s auditors since 1992. The Audit Committee considers that 
the relationship with the auditors is working well and remains 
satisfied with their effectiveness.
However, the Committee has noted the guidance from the Financial 
Reporting Council and changes in the EU to the regulatory 
framework and, accordingly, has commenced a tender process with 
a view to appointing new auditors for the 2019 financial period. 
There are no contractual obligations restricting the Company’s 
choice of external auditor.
The external auditors are required to rotate the audit partner 
responsible for the Group and subsidiary audits every five years. The 
current audit partner was first appointed in respect of the 2015 
financial period ended 2 January 2016.
Taking into consideration the external auditors’ knowledge of the 
Group and level of experience, the Audit Committee has 
recommended to the Board that the external auditors are 
reappointed for the period ending 29 December 2018.
Given the present structure of the Group, the Board does not 
currently consider the establishment of a separate internal audit 
function to be necessary. However, this matter is reviewed by the 
Board at least annually.
The Group has a “Whistleblowing” policy which contains 
arrangements for the Company Secretary to receive, in confidence, 
complaints on accounting, risk issues, internal controls, auditing 
issues and related matters for reporting to the Audit Committee as 
appropriate.
As necessary, the Audit Committee holds private meetings with the 
external auditors to review key issues within their spheres of interest 
and responsibility.
As Chairman of the Committee, I will be present at the 2018 Annual 
General Meeting to answer questions on this report, matters within 
the scope of the Audit Committee’s responsibilities and any 
significant matters brought to the Audit Committee’s attention by 
the external auditors.
Internal control
The control system of the Group is intended to manage rather than 
eliminate the risk of failure to meet the Group’s objectives and any 
such system can only provide reasonable and not absolute 
assurances against material misstatement or loss. The effectiveness 
of the control system including financial, operating, compliance and 
risk management is reviewed by the Board at least annually.
Additionally, through the management process outlined in the 
Statement on Corporate Governance on pages 32 and 33 the Group 
operates a continuous process of identifying, evaluating and 
managing the significant risks faced by each business and the Group 
as a whole. This process, which has been in place throughout 2017 
and up to the date of the approval of this Annual Report, complies 
with the FRC guidance and includes the following:
— a defined organisational structure with appropriate delegation of 
authority;
— formal authorisation procedures for all investments;
— clear responsibilities on the part of management for the 
maintenance of good financial controls and the production and 
review of detailed, accurate and timely financial management 
information;
— the control of financial risks through clear authorisation levels;
— identification of operational risks and the development of 
mitigation plans by the senior management;
— regular reviews of both forward looking business plans and 
historic performance; and
— regular reports to the Board from the Executive Directors.
The internal controls extend to the financial reporting process and 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. The basis of 
preparation of the consolidated financial statements is set out on 
page 60.
The internal control process will continue to be monitored and 
reviewed by the Board which will, where necessary, ensure 
improvements are implemented. During the period the Board has 
undertaken a review of the effectiveness of internal controls and 
systems. No material matters were identified.

Annual Statement by the Chairman of the  
Remuneration Committee
The Company’s strategy is to develop its position as the leading 
direct marketer of promotional products in the fragmented markets 
in which it operates.
Recent years have seen sustained growth in the business and in both 
the earnings per share and share price of the Company. The 
Remuneration Committee and the Board aim to ensure that the 
Company has the best possible management to continue that 
growth and the creation of further Shareholder value and to reward 
management accordingly.
The Committee’s view regarding remuneration is that it should: (i) be 
competitive when compared to that of organisations of similar size, 
complexity and type; (ii) be structured so that remuneration is linked 
to the long-term strategy of the Group, including growth in earnings 
per share and in the Shareholder value of the Company; (iii) be clear, 
easy to understand and motivating; (iv) not promote unacceptable 
behaviour or encourage unacceptable risk taking; and (v) be 
structured to avoid reward for failure.
2015 Incentive Plan
The 2015 Incentive Plan (the “Plan”) is designed to support the 
long-term strategy of the Group, in particular its increasing focus on 
the business in North America.
During 2017, further awards under the Plan were made to the Chief 
Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer and seven senior 
managers. The Plan is directly linked to the annual bonus of senior 
employees. The Remuneration Committee will assess senior 
employee performance against the criteria set each year to 
determine the level of achievement of performance and therefore 
the annual bonus to be paid in respect of such year. The 
performance targets for the 2017 period are set out below.
Under the provisions of the Plan, 50% of the annual bonus will be 
deferred into shares through the award of nil cost options or 
conditional share awards.
The awards will usually be made during the 42 day period following 
the announcement of the Company’s full year results.
The number of nil cost options or conditional share awards will be 
determined by dividing the amount of the annual bonus being 
deferred by the price of a share on 31 December of the year 
preceding that in which the awards are made. For example, for 
awards made in 2017, the share price used in the determination was 
that on 31 December 2016.
In respect of the period ended 30 December 2017, the Remuneration 
Committee has approved an annual bonus for those participating in 
the Plan equal to 50% of base salary in respect of the beneficiaries 
based in North America and 30% of base salary in respect of the 
beneficiary based in the UK. 50% of that annual bonus will be 
deferred under the terms of the Plan. Given a share price of £19.00 
on 31 December 2017, this is expected to result in the award of a 
total of 16,937 nil cost options or conditional share awards.
Other than in exceptional circumstances, any deferred awards will 
not vest earlier than three years from the date of the grant of the nil 
cost option or award of conditional shares and such vesting will be 
conditional on the beneficiary being in employment for that period. 
If, before that period has expired, a participant leaves employment as 
a good leaver or, in the event of a takeover or change of control, the 
award will vest in full (or, if the Board should so decide, on a time 
pro-rated basis).
The Plan contains “malus” provisions such that if, prior to the date 
on which an award vests, the annual bonus from which it was 
determined is found to be incorrect as a result of either a material 
misstatement in the audited accounts of the Group or the conduct 
of a beneficiary amounting to fraud or gross misconduct, then the 
Board may reduce, to nil, the number of shares awarded.
2017 performance targets
In respect of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial 
Officer, the performance targets for the period ended 30 December 
2017 were set using a combination of targets for both (i) revenue 
growth percentage and (ii) return on sales (operating margin) 
percentage. It was considered appropriate by the Remuneration 
Committee that these performance targets should be based on the 
results of the North American Direct Marketing business, since this 
represents 97% of Group revenue, and its financial performance is 
the dominant factor influencing the Group’s financial results.
The bonus percentage reward scenarios were based on a 
performance grid with (i) the vertical axis representing return on 
sales results ranging from a base of 7.3% and rising at 0.1% intervals 
to 8.0%, and (ii) the horizontal axis representing revenue growth 
percentages rising at 1% intervals from a base of 8% growth to a 
maximum of 17% growth. Examples of different scenarios under the 
grid are as follows:
— 8% revenue growth, at 7.3% return on sales: nil bonus (floor).
— 15% revenue growth, at 7.5% return on sales: 100% bonus, split 
half cash and half deferred shares (ceiling).
— 12% revenue growth, at 7.5% return on sales: 50% bonus, split 
half cash and half deferred shares (on-target performance).
The bonus percentages payable at different performance levels were 
chosen specifically in accordance with the Group’s 2017 financial 
strategy to maximise organic revenue growth whilst maintaining a 
broadly stable operating margin percentage. The maximum 
percentage of salary that could be awarded as bonus was 100%, 
and in each scenario the cash element of the bonus had to be 
self-financed in the operating result.
The actual performance of the North American Direct Marketing 
business in 2017 was 12.5% revenue growth at a 7.5% return on 
sales. According to the performance grid this resulted in a bonus 
payable to the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer and 
five US-based senior managers of 50% of base salary, split 50% in 
cash and 50% in deferred shares. The UK-based participant received 
a bonus of 30% of base salary, split 50% in cash and 50% in 
deferred shares.  39

2018 performance targets
The performance targets for 2018 have been agreed by the 
Committee based on the principles set out in the Plan. As for 2017, 
these targets consist of both revenue growth percentage and 
operating margin percentage ranges for the performance of the 
North American business. The exact targets are not disclosed for 
commercial reasons.
Board of Directors
Mr. K. Lyons-Tarr is Chief Executive Officer of the Group. In January 
2018 the Remuneration Committee awarded him a bonus of 50% of 
his annual salary, half of which will be paid in cash and half of which 
will be used for an award of conditional shares pursuant to the Plan. 
The number of shares to be awarded is 4,514.
Mr. D. J. E. Seekings is Chief Financial Officer of the Group. In 
January 2018 the Remuneration Committee awarded him a bonus of 
50% of his annual salary, half of which will be paid in cash and half 
of which is to be used for an award of conditional shares pursuant to 
the Plan. The number of shares to be awarded is 3,009.
Given its focus on the Directors and senior managers in North 
America, Mr. A.J. Scull, the remaining UK-based Executive Director, 
does not participate in the Plan. In January 2018 the Remuneration 
Committee awarded him a bonus of 25% of annual salary, payable 
in cash, for 2017.
The Committee reserves the right to make payments outside its 
approved policy but only in exceptional circumstances. The 
Committee would only use this right where it believes that this is in 
the best interests of the Company and when it would be 
disproportionate to seek specific approval from a general meeting. 
No such payments have been made during the period.
Remuneration is a topic upon which Shareholders have differing 
views, but I hope that the Group’s principles of clarity, relative 
simplicity and balance will help to explain what the Committee does 
and to enable Shareholders to understand the Remuneration Policy. 
In this context, I am pleased to note that at the 2017 Annual General 
Meeting the Remuneration Report was approved by 95.96% of 
Shareholders who voted (which excluded 1,230 votes withheld).

This report sets out the information required by the Companies Act 
2006, Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium sized Companies and 
Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 and the Listing

this report will be put to the AGM on 8 May 2018.
Remuneration governance
Remuneration Committee composition
The Remuneration Committee is a committee whose membership is 
comprised solely of Independent Non-Executive Directors, being 
Mr. C.J. Brady (Chairman of the Committee) and Mr. J.A. Warren. 
The Committee meets at least once a year and may invite other 
attendees as it sees fit.
The Committee remains mindful of the remuneration of all of the 
Group’s employees when reviewing changes in executive pay.
Remuneration Committee responsibilities
The principal duties of the Remuneration Committee are reflected in 
its terms of reference and include the following:
— to determine and recommend to the Board the overall 
remuneration policy of the Company;
— to determine and recommend to the Board the remuneration of 
the Executive Directors;
— to monitor and review the level and structure of remuneration for 
senior management;
— to determine the targets for any performance-related bonus and 
share incentive schemes operated for Executive Directors and 
senior management; and
— to review and approve any material termination payments.
The remuneration of Non-Executive Directors is determined by the 
Non-Executive Chairman of the Board and the Executive Directors.
The Remuneration of the Non-Executive Chairman of the Board is 
determined by the Board (excluding the Non-Executive Chairman).
Elements of remuneration
Remuneration for Executive Directors comprises both fixed and 
variable elements. The principal component of the fixed element is a 
salary, which is set at an appropriate level for the size and type of the 
Company to retain the quality of management it requires to further 
the Board’s objectives, but which is not excessive.
The variable element of remuneration is designed to incentivise and 
motivate management to meet annual performance targets and 
reward performance. The principal component of the variable 
element is an annual bonus, half of which is paid in cash and half of 
which is deferred into shares, through the award of nil cost options 
or conditional share awards granted in accordance with the terms of 
the 2015 Incentive Plan.
The targets for the annual bonus, which is capped at a maximum of 
100% of annual base salary, except in the case of the remaining 
UK-based Executive Director, where the maximum is 50%, are set by 
the Remuneration Committee each year and evolve with the growth 
objectives of the Group.
Remuneration Committee activities in the period ended 
30 December 2017
The Remuneration Committee met twice during the period ended 
30 December 2017 and the following matters were considered:
Salaries
Approving the salaries of the Executive Directors for 2017 and 
monitoring and reviewing the level and structure of salaries for 
senior management for 2017.
In the case of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial 
Officer, the increases in basic annual salary in 2017 were 3%.
At its meeting on 15 January 2018, the Remuneration Committee 
awarded a 2018 basic annual salary increase of 3% to the Chief 
Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer and the Corporate 
Services Director, this being in line with the increase in 2018 basic 
annual salary for all employees.
Bonuses
Approving the bonuses for the Executive Directors for 2017 and 
monitoring and reviewing the level of bonuses for senior 
management for 2017.
Approving the structure of the bonus criteria for Executive Directors

Remuneration Report received the following votes from 
Shareholders: For 95.96%; Against 4.04% and 1,230 votes withheld. 
 
Future remuneration policy
The Company has a well-established and clear remuneration policy 
which, in the view of the Committee, has made an important 
contribution to the success of the Company over a sustained period. 
The policy includes providing Executive Directors with remuneration 
packages which are: (i) competitive when compared to that of 
organisations of similar size, complexity and type; (ii) structured so 
that remuneration is linked to the long-term strategy of the Group, 
including growth in earnings per share and in the Shareholder value 
of the Company; (iii) clear, easy to understand and motivating; (iv) 
designed not to promote unacceptable behaviour or encourage 
unacceptable risk taking; and (v) structured to avoid reward for failure.  41

the new policy is approved.
Remuneration Policy for approval at the 2018 AGM
Principles of Remuneration Policy
4imprint Group plc (the “Company”) has a well-established and clear remuneration policy which, in the view of the Remuneration 
Committee (the “Committee”), has made an important contribution to the success of the Company over a sustained period. 
The guiding principles underlying the policy are:
(i) remuneration should be competitive when compared to that in organisations of similar size, complexity and type; 
(ii) packages should be structured so that remuneration is aligned to both the strategy of the Company and long-term growth in Shareholder 
value; 
(iii) each element of the remuneration package should be clear, easy to understand and motivating; 
(iv) the overall package should be designed to take account of the performance of the business, to respond to regulatory changes but not to 
promote undesirable behaviour or to encourage unacceptable risk taking; and 
(v) packages should be structured to avoid reward for failure.
This section describes the Remuneration Policy, which, subject to Shareholder approval at the 2018 Annual General Meeting, will take effect 
from 8 May 2018 and will be effective until the Annual General Meeting held in 2021, unless a further policy is proposed by the Company 
and approved by Shareholders in the meantime. 
Executive Director Remuneration
Fixed component: Base Salary
Purpose This is the basic element of pay, reflecting the individual’s role, position, location and responsibility within the 
Company. Base salary is set at an appropriate level in order to attract and retain the quality of management 
required to further the Board’s objectives.
Application Base salaries are considered against those paid in organisations of similar size, complexity and type in order to 
attract and retain the required quality of executives to deliver the Board’s strategy. While the Committee 
applies judgment rather than setting by reference to a fixed percentile position, its general approach when 
considered in conjunction with variable pay and long-term incentives is to constrain base salaries to levels it 
believes to be within an acceptable market range in the context of total remuneration. 
Opportunity While base salaries are reviewed each year, the Company’s policy is not automatically to award an inflationary 
increase. Adjustments reflect various factors, including: increases for other employees across the rest of the 
4imprint business; individual and Company performance; changes in responsibilities; and general market 
movements.
Performance measures Not applicable.
Recovery provisions No clawback or recovery provisions apply.
Fixed component: Pension
Purpose To provide a competitive level of retirement benefit in order to attract and retain executives of the required 
quality to meet the Board’s objectives.
Application All Executive Directors are eligible either (i) to participate in a Company-sponsored defined contribution 
pension plan, or (ii) to receive a salary supplement in lieu of pension contributions, (which is not taken into 
account as salary for calculation of annual bonus, or other benefits).
Opportunity The maximum entitlement is 15% of base salary.
Performance measures Not applicable.
Recovery provisions No clawback or recovery provisions apply. 42
4imprint Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 GOVERNANCE
Remuneration Report continued
Fixed component: Benefits in kind
Purpose To provide other benefits valued by the recipient to assist in attracting and retaining executives of the 
required quality to meet the Board’s objectives.
Application The benefits package is designed to be competitive and to reflect the circumstances and domicile of the 
individual Director. Benefits typically provided may include: (i) company car or car allowance paid in cash; (ii) 
private medical insurance for the executive and his/her family; (iii) life assurance of up to four times base 
salary; (iv) income protection insurance; and (v) access to independent professional advice when necessary. 
Opportunity No Executive Director received benefits in kind totalling more than 10% of base salary over the three previous 
financial years, and it is not anticipated that the value of benefits provided will exceed 10% of base salary for 
the duration of this Policy. The Committee reserves discretion to approve a higher level of benefits in what it 
determines are exceptional circumstances, (for example relocation expenses) when such higher level of 
benefit is judged by the Committee to be in the best interests of the Company and its Shareholders.
Performance measures Not applicable.
Recovery provisions No clawback or recovery provisions apply.
Variable component: Deferred Annual Bonus Scheme (“DABS”) plan
Purpose To provide a single, clear and understandable variable incentive remuneration framework designed to focus 
the Executive Directors on achieving demanding annual Company performance targets, at the same time 
incentivising delivery of sustained Shareholder value over the longer term. 
Application The plan is administered in accordance with the 2015 Incentive Plan, which was approved by Shareholders at 
the 2015 AGM. Awards in relation to each financial year’s performance are comprised of a cash amount 
(“cash amount”) which is divided into two equal components: 
— An annual cash component, comprising 50% of the cash amounts, which is typically paid after finalisation 
of the audit in March of the following year. This component is intended to focus attention specifically on 
annual performance targets.
— A deferred share component, comprising 50% of the cash amounts, which is awarded in the form of 
either a nil cost option or a conditional share award, usually after finalisation of the audit in March of the 
following year. The number of nil cost options or conditional share awards is fixed at the time the award is 
made, and is determined by dividing the amount of the deferred share component of the annual award by 
the price of a share on 31 December of the financial year to which the award relates. Ordinarily, deferred 
share awards will not vest earlier than three years from the date of grant and will normally be conditional 
on the participant remaining in the Company’s employment during that period. If, before that period has 
expired, a participant leaves employment as a good leaver or in the event of a takeover or change of 
control, the award will vest in full (or, if the Board should so decide, on a time pro-rata basis). This 
component addresses the longer term intention of the award, aligning the interests of both the Company 
and the recipient in maximising long-term growth in Shareholder value. 
Opportunity The maximum potential award relating to performance in a single financial year is 100% of base salary. Once 
approved by the Committee, this award amount is split and applied:
— 50% to the annual cash component.
— 50% to the deferred share component.
Performance measures Performance targets are set by the Committee each year. The targets are aligned with the annual budget 
approved by the Board, and may include elements of profitability, revenue growth, cash generation, 
improvement in financial performance over prior year and other specific corporate objectives designed to 
deliver the Board’s strategy and long-term growth in Shareholder value. The performance targets can evolve 
along with the strategic objectives of the Company, and the Committee retains the discretion to adjust or set 
different performance measures if events occur, (e.g. a change in strategy, material acquisition, divestment or 
change in prevailing market conditions) which cause it to determine that previous targets are no longer 
appropriate. Details of the performance targets attached to the awards made in respect of any particular year 
will be provided retrospectively in the Remuneration Report in the Annual Report and Accounts relating to 
that year. Once awarded, the deferred component of the annual award will not be subject to further 
performance conditions, other than continued employment with the Company.
Recovery provisions The awards are subject to a “malus” provision, such that if, prior to the date on which deferred shares vest, 
the annual award from which it was determined is found to be incorrect as a result of either a material 
misstatement in the audited accounts of the Group, or the conduct of a beneficiary amounting to fraud or 
gross misconduct, then the Board may reduce, to nil, the number of shares in the award.  43
4imprint Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Overview Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Additional Information
Variable component: Share plans available to all employees in which Executive Directors are able to participate
Purpose To encourage share ownership by employees allowing participation in the long-term success of the Company.
Application Periodic employee share option plans open to all employees are operated in the 4imprint Group. These take 
the form of HMRC approved SAYE schemes in the UK, and equivalent plans in the USA. Employees (including 
Executive Directors) may save an agreed monthly amount, and options are normally granted at a discount of 
up to 20% to current share price.
Opportunity Savings are capped at an agreed monthly contribution rate, and the option price is set at the outset of the 
plan.
Performance measures Not applicable.
Recovery provisions No clawback or recovery provisions apply.
Variable component: Share ownership
Purpose To encourage share ownership by the Executive Directors, thereby aligning long-term interests with those of 
Shareholders.
Application Executive Directors are expected to hold shares to the value of at least 100% of annual base salary. Executive 
Directors are expected to retain at least 50% of any vesting share awards (net of tax) in order to accumulate 
the recommended personal shareholding. All Executive Directors currently have shareholdings significantly in 
excess of 100% of their base salary using a share price average for 2017.
Performance measures Not applicable.
Recovery provisions Not applicable.
Executive Director Recruitment Remuneration
The Company’s recruitment remuneration policy aims to secure the appointment, retention and promotion of high-calibre executives to 
strengthen the Board and secure the appropriate skills to deliver the Company’s strategic objectives.
The following represents guidelines considered reasonable by the Committee:
— The starting point for the Committee will be to look at the general remuneration policy for Executive Directors as set out in this policy 
document and to structure a package in accordance with that policy;
— For external appointments, the Committee reserves the right to make payments outside this policy, but only in exceptional circumstances. 
The Committee would only use this right where it believes that to do so would be in the best interests of the Company and when it would 
be disproportionate to seek specific approval from a general meeting. Any use of this discretion would be disclosed to Shareholders in the 
Remuneration Report in the Annual Report and Accounts relating to the year of recruitment of the Executive Director;
— For external and internal appointments, the Committee may agree that the Company will meet certain relocation expenses and legal fees 
as it considers to be appropriate. Assistance will be subject to reasonable clawback for service of less than 24 months; 
— It is not envisaged that, ignoring any special recruitment arrangements which may prove to be necessary, any annual bonus or long-term 
incentive compensation arrangements will operate differently (including the maximum award levels) than for the predecessor of any newly 
appointed executive; and
— All awards for external appointments, whether under any long-term incentive plan, or otherwise, will take account of the nature, 
time-horizons and performance requirements for any remuneration relinquished by the individual when leaving a previous employer, and 
will be appropriately discounted to ensure that the Company does not, in the opinion of the Committee, over-pay. Any such awards 
would not be considered in calculating any other element of remuneration. 44
4imprint Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 GOVERNANCE
Non-Executive Director Remuneration
Fixed component: Fees
Purpose To attract and retain high quality and experienced Non-Executive Directors, with fees reflecting the time 
commitments and responsibilities of the roles.
Application The fees paid to the Non-Executive Directors aim to be competitive with other listed companies of equivalent 
size, complexity and type. Fee levels are periodically reviewed by the Board. 
Opportunity The Company does not adopt a quantitative approach to pay positioning and exercises judgment as to what 
it considers to be reasonable in all the circumstances as regards quantum. 
Performance measures Not applicable.
Recovery provisions Not applicable.

Percentage change in remuneration of Chief Executive Officer and employees
The table below shows the percentage change in remuneration of the Director undertaking the role of Chief Executive Officer and the 
Company’s employees as a whole between 2017 and 2016.

The average pay increases shown in the table above for all employees are distorted by new employees starting in the period being principally at junior staff levels. Existing employees 
typically received a 2 to 3% salary increase in 2017 and benefits were unchanged.
Relative importance of spend on pay
The table below shows the Group’s actual spend on pay relative to dividends:

Percentage 
change
Wages and salaries 43.86 40.23 9%
Dividends paid 15.85 12.14 31%
Dividends paid in 2017 reflect a one-off rebasing. This one-off adjustment was to take into account expected increases in future cash flows 
of the business following the reduction of contributions to the pension scheme after the pension buy-out. The consequence of the 
adjustment was to increase the 2016 final dividend, paid in May 2017, by 35%.
Reward scenarios
The chart below shows how the composition of the Executive Directors’ remuneration packages for 2018 may vary at different levels of 
performance under the policy set out in this report as a percentage of total remuneration opportunity.

Base remuneration comprises fixed elements of pay being base salary, benefits in kind and pension contributions or pay in lieu of pension 
contributions. The base salaries are those approved at the Remuneration Committee meeting in January 2018. Pension contributions or pay 
in lieu of pension contributions are a fixed percentage of base salary and benefits in kind are based on 2017 figures.
On target includes base remuneration plus the bonus payable if budget is met. This results in bonus of 50% of base salary for the Chief 
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, half of which is in the form of conditional share awards with a vesting period of three years 
from the award date, and a bonus of 25% of base salary, payable in cash, for the Corporate Services Director.
Maximum shows the maximum bonus payable if stretch targets set by the Remuneration Committee are met. In the case of the Chief 
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer this is 100% of base salary, again with half in the form of conditional share awards with a 
vesting period of three years from the award date. The Corporate Services Director’s bonus which is capped at 50% of base salary is payable 
in cash. The Corporate Services Director does not participate in the 2015 Incentive Plan. 46

Current service agreements
Mr. A.J. Scull (the “UK-based Executive Director”) has a rolling service contract which continues until terminated by the expiry of twelve 
months’ written notice from the Company to the Director. The service contract provides for participation in a discretionary bonus scheme, 
the provision of a car (or car allowance) and pay in lieu of pension entitlements. The contractual termination payment in such circumstances 
would comprise up to twelve months’ payments, equivalent to the notice period, in respect of salary, car allowance, pay in lieu of pension 
entitlements and contributions to healthcare and income protection schemes.
Mr. K. Lyons-Tarr and Mr. D.J.E. Seekings (the “US-based Executive Directors”) have rolling employment agreements with 4imprint, Inc. which 
continue until terminated by the expiry of twelve months’ written notice from that Company to the Director. The employment agreements 
for the US-based Executive Directors provide for participation in a discretionary bonus scheme and entitlement to benefits generally available 
to employees of 4imprint, Inc. from time to time including, for example, retirement, disability, group accident, life and health insurance 
programmes. The contractual termination payment in such circumstances would comprise up to twelve months’ payments, equivalent to the 
notice period in respect of salary and other non-discretionary components.
Any commitment made to the Executive Directors by the Company under their service contracts or otherwise which is consistent with the 
approved remuneration policy in force at the time that commitment was made will be honoured, even where it is not consistent with the 
policy prevailing at the time such commitment is fulfilled.

Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities
in respect of the Financial Statements
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and 
the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and 
regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements 
for each financial year. Under that law the Directors have prepared 
the Group and Parent Company financial statements in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”) as adopted 
by the European Union. Under company law the Directors must not 
approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they 
give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and the 
Company and of the profit or loss of the Group and the Company 
for that period. In preparing these financial statements, the Directors 
are required to:
— select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently;
— make judgments and accounting estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent;
— state whether applicable IFRSs as adopted by the European Union 
have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed 
and explained in the financial statements; and
— prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will 
continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the Company and the Group and enable them 
to ensure that the financial statements and the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report comply with the Companies Act 2006 and, as 
regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS 
Regulation. 
The Directors are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the 
Company and the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for 
the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of 
the Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom 
governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements 
may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
The Directors consider that the Annual Report and Accounts, taken 
as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the 
information necessary for Shareholders to assess the Company’s 
performance, business model and strategy.
Each of the Directors, whose names and functions are listed in the 
Board of Directors on pages 28 and 29 confirm that, to the best of 
their knowledge:
— the Company financial statements, which have been prepared in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, give a 
true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and 
profit of the Company; and
— the Group financial statements, which have been prepared in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, give a 
true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and 
profit of the Group; and
— the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report contained on pages 6 
to 31 include a fair review of the development and performance 
of the business and the position of the Group, together with a 
description of the principal risks and uncertainties that it faces.
In the case of each Director in office at the date the Directors’ Report 
is approved:
— so far as the Director is aware, there is no relevant audit 
information of which the Group and Company’s auditors are 
unaware; and
— they have taken all the steps that they ought to have taken as a 
Director in order to make themselves aware of any relevant audit 
information and to establish that the Group and Company’s 
auditors are aware of that information.

4imprint Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Independent Auditors’ Report 
to the members of 4imprint Group plc
Report on the audit of the financial statements
Opinion
In our opinion, 4imprint Group plc’s Group financial statements and Company financial statements (the “financial statements”):
— give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the Company’s affairs as at 30 December 2017 and of the Group’s profit and 
the Group’s and the Company’s cash flows for the 52 week period (the “period”) then ended;
— have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and, as regards the Company’s financial 
statements, as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and
— have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group financial statements, 
Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
We have audited the financial statements, included within the Annual Report and Accounts (the “Annual Report”), which comprise: the 
Group and Company Balance Sheets as at 30 December 2017; the Group Income Statement for the 52 weeks ended 30 December 2017; the 
Group Statement of Comprehensive Income for the 52 weeks ended 30 December 2017; the Group and Company Cash Flow Statements for 
the 52 weeks ended 30 December 2017, the Group Statement of Changes in Shareholders’ Equity for the 52 weeks ended 30 December 
2017, and the Statement of Changes in Company Shareholders’ Equity for the 52 weeks ended 30 December 2017; and the notes to the 
Group and Company financial statements, which include a description of the significant accounting policies.
Our opinion is consistent with our reporting to the Audit Committee.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (“ISAs (UK)”) and applicable law. Our responsibilities 
under ISAs (UK) are further described in the Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. We 
believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Independence
We remained independent of the Group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements 
in the UK, which includes the FRC’s Ethical Standard, as applicable to listed public interest entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical 
responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.
To the best of our knowledge and belief, we declare that non-audit services prohibited by the FRC’s Ethical Standard were not provided to 
the Group or the Company.
We have not provided any non-audit services to the Group or the Company in the period from 1 January 2017 to 30 December 2017.
Our audit approach
Overview
— Overall Group materiality: $2,000,000 (2016: $1,850,000), based on 5% of profit before tax and exceptional items.
— Overall Company materiality: £739,000 (2016: £550,000), based on the lower of component and statutory 
materiality (statutory materiality based on 1% of total assets).
— We conducted audit work over 4imprint Group plc (the Parent Company of the Group), 4imprint, Inc. and 4imprint 
Direct Limited which accounted for 100% of revenue and profit before tax and exceptional items.
— Accounting for defined benefit pension scheme liabilities (Group and Company).
— Accounting for supplier arrangements (Group).
The scope of our audit
As part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements. In 
particular, we looked at where the Directors made subjective judgements, for example in respect of significant accounting estimates that 
involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain. 
We gained an understanding of the legal and regulatory framework applicable to the Group and the industry in which it operates, and 
considered the risk of acts by the Group which were contrary to applicable laws and regulations, including fraud. We designed audit 
procedures at Group and significant component level to respond to the risk, recognising that the risk of not detecting a material 
misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting one resulting from error, as fraud may involve deliberate concealment by, 
for example, forgery or intentional misrepresentations, or through collusion. We focused on laws and regulations that could give rise to a 
material misstatement in the Group and Company financial statements, including, but not limited to, the Companies Act 2006, the Listing 
Rules, UK tax legislation and USA tax legislation. Our tests included, but were not limited to, review of the financial statement disclosures to 
underlying supporting documentation, review of correspondence with the regulators and enquiries of management. There are inherent 
limitations in the audit procedures described above and the further removed non-compliance with laws and regulations is from the events 
and transactions reflected in the financial statements, the less likely we would become aware of it.

matters  51
4imprint Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Overview Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Additional Information
We did not identify any key audit matters relating to irregularities, including fraud. As in all of our audits we also addressed the risk of 
management override of internal controls, including testing journals and evaluating whether there was evidence of bias by the Directors that 
represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud. 
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in the auditors’ professional judgement, were of most significance in the audit of the financial 
statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) 
identified by the auditors, including those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the allocation of resources in the audit; 
and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters, and any comments we make on the results of our procedures thereon, 
were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not 
provide a separate opinion on these matters. This is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit.

Accounting for defined benefit pension scheme liabilities
Group and Company
Refer to page 36 of the Statement on Corporate Governance, page 
63 of the accounting policies, note 17 to the Group Financial 
Statements and note G to the Company’s Financial Statements.
The Group operates a defined benefit pension scheme which is 
closed to future accrual and entrants and had a deficit of $18.1m 
(2016: $19.3m) as at 30 December 2017. The Group engages 
independent actuarial specialists to calculate the valuation of 
scheme liabilities.
The valuation of pension scheme liabilities is impacted by the 
actuarial assumptions adopted by the Directors which are subjective 
and require estimation and judgement to be applied in their 
determination. If alternative assumptions had been adopted and 
applied these could have materially impacted the valuation of the 
pension scheme liabilities as at 30 December 2017. We focussed our 
work on the assumptions to which the valuation was most sensitive, 
namely the discount rate, inflation rate and mortality assumptions. 
We compared the discount rate, inflation rate and mortality 
assumptions to externally derived data, as well as our own 
independently formed assessments, in relation to these key inputs in 
order to assess whether the assumptions used were reasonable. We 
noted that all assumptions applied were in line with our 
independently formed assessments, within an acceptable range.
We also assessed whether the disclosures reflect the risks inherent in 
the accounting for the pension scheme and determined that the 
disclosures were sufficient and reflected the period end position of 
the pension scheme. 52

Accounting for supplier arrangements
Group
Refer to page 36 of the Statement on Corporate Governance and 
page 61 of the accounting policies.
The Group, primarily through 4imprint, Inc., receives significant 
rebates from its suppliers. These relate to volume based rebates on 
purchases made from key product suppliers throughout the financial 
period.
The rebates received are determined by formal signed agreements 
with suppliers and depend on the level of spend within the financial 
period. All supplier agreements are coterminous with the Group’s 
year end. The percentage of purchases paid as a rebate from certain 
suppliers increases based on predetermined thresholds within 
supplier agreements.
We have focussed on this area because the quantum of income 
recorded under these arrangements is material in relation to the 
result in the period. Furthermore, given the number of different 
rebate contracts the Group has entered into and the range of 
different rebate rates used, including stepped rebates, in the 
calculations there is an inherent risk of error in the calculation of 
these amounts.
We obtained a sample of supplier agreements and inspected them 
to assess whether all rebates received, and receivable, by the Group 
have been accounted for in the correct financial period and in 
accordance with specific terms agreed with suppliers. From 
inspection of these agreements we determined that the terms and 
conditions, including the financial periods over which rebate income 
could be earned, had been appropriately reflected in the calculations 
of rebates receivable.
We confirmed directly with a sample of suppliers the rebate income 
which had been earned in the period, and also recalculated supplier 
rebate income and receivables based upon spend with suppliers in 
the period taking account of agreed rebate rates per signed 
agreements. We did not identify any material differences between 
either confirmed rebate income or our expectation and the amounts 
recognised.
We compared actual receipts from suppliers in the period to 
amounts recorded as receivable at the prior period end in order to 
assess the historical accuracy of the estimation process. We 
determined that the level of current year receipts supported the 
assumptions around collectability of prior period rebates receivable, 
and therefore the estimation process was reasonable in this regard.
We tested purchase transactions around the period end to confirm 
whether purchases upon which rebate income and receivables are 
based had been recorded in the correct accounting period and we 
noted no material exceptions from this testing.
We tested a sample of cash and credit notes received subsequent to 
the year end and considered the recoverability of the remaining 
balance. This testing included a look back test to confirm the cash 
and credit notes received during 2017 in relation to the 2016 
amount receivable. We noted no evidence to suggest material 
doubts over collectability.
How we tailored the audit scope
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements as a 
whole, taking into account the structure of the Group and the Company, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which 
they operate.
Materiality
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality. These, together 
with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures on 
the individual financial statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating the effect of misstatements, both individually and in aggregate 
on the financial statements as a whole. 
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:
Group financial statements Company financial statements
Overall materiality $2,000,000 (2016: $1,850,000). £739,000 (2016: £550,000).
How we determined it 5% of profit before tax and exceptional items. Based on the lower of component and 
statutory materiality (statutory materiality 
based on 1% of total assets).
Rationale for benchmark applied We note that profit before tax and exceptional 
items is the key measure used both by the 
Board and, we believe, externally by 
Shareholders in evaluating the performance of 
the Group. It also represents a consistent 
measure of the performance year on year by 
removing the impact of non-recurring items.
We believe that calculating statutory 
materiality based on 1% of total assets is 
appropriate as total assets is a typical primary 
measure for users of the financial statements 
of holding companies, and is a generally 
accepted auditing benchmark.

4imprint Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Overview Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Additional Information
For each component in the scope of our Group audit, we allocated a materiality that is less than our overall Group materiality. The range of 
materiality allocated across components was between $100,000 and $1,800,000. Certain components were audited to a local statutory 
audit materiality that was also less than our overall Group materiality.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above $100,000 (Group audit) 
(2016: $90,000) and $50,000 (Company audit) (2016: $34,000) as well as misstatements below those amounts that, in our view, warranted 
reporting for qualitative reasons.
Going concern
In accordance with ISAs (UK) we report as follows:
Reporting obligation Outcome
We are required to report if we have anything material to add or draw attention to in 
respect of the Directors’ statement in the financial statements about whether the Directors 
considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the 
financial statements and the Directors’ identification of any material uncertainties to the 
Group’s and the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern over a period of at least 
twelve months from the date of approval of the financial statements.
We have nothing material to add or to draw 
attention to. However, because not all future 
events or conditions can be predicted, this 
statement is not a guarantee as to the Group’s 
and Company’s ability to continue as a going 
concern.
We are required to report if the Directors’ statement relating to going concern in accordance 
with Listing Rule 9.8.6R(3) is materially inconsistent with our knowledge obtained in the audit.
We have nothing to report.
Reporting on other information 
The other information comprises all of the information in the Annual Report other than the financial statements and our auditors’ report thereon. 
The Directors are responsible for the other information. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, 
accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion or, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in this report, any form of assurance thereon. 
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether 
the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to 
be materially misstated. If we identify an apparent material inconsistency or material misstatement, we are required to perform procedures to 
conclude whether there is a material misstatement of the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other information. If, based 
on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that 
fact. We have nothing to report based on these responsibilities.
With respect to the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report, we also considered whether the disclosures required by the UK Companies Act 
2006 have been included. 
Based on the responsibilities described above and our work undertaken in the course of the audit, the Companies Act 2006, (CA06), ISAs 
(UK) and the Listing Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) require us also to report certain opinions and matters as described below 
(required by ISAs (UK) unless otherwise stated).
Strategic Report and Directors’ Report
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit, the information given in the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report 
for the period ended 30 December 2017 is consistent with the financial statements and has been prepared in accordance with applicable 
legal requirements. (CA06)
In light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and Company and their environment obtained in the course of the audit, we did 
not identify any material misstatements in the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report. (CA06)
The Directors’ assessment of the prospects of the Group and of the principal risks that would threaten the solvency or liquidity 
of the Group
We have nothing material to add or draw attention to regarding:
— The Directors’ confirmation on page 32 of the Annual Report that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing 
the Group, including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity.
— The disclosures in the Annual Report that describe those risks and explain how they are being managed or mitigated.
— The Directors’ explanation on page 32 of the Annual Report as to how they have assessed the prospects of the Group, over what period 
they have done so and why they consider that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have a reasonable 
expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their assessment, 
including any related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.
We have nothing to report having performed a review of the Directors’ statement that they have carried out a robust assessment of the 
principal risks facing the Group and statement in relation to the longer-term viability of the Group. Our review was substantially less in scope 
than an audit and only consisted of making inquiries and considering the Directors’ process supporting their statements; checking that the 
statements are in alignment with the relevant provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code (the “Code”); and considering whether the 
statements are consistent with the knowledge and understanding of the Group and Company and their environment obtained in the course 
of the audit. (Listing Rules) 54
4imprint Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Other Code Provisions
We have nothing to report in respect of our responsibility to report when: 
— The statement given by the Directors, on page 49, that they consider the Annual Report taken as a whole to be fair, balanced and 
understandable, and provides the information necessary for the members to assess the Group’s and Company’s position and 
performance, business model and strategy is materially inconsistent with our knowledge of the Group and Company obtained in the 
course of performing our audit.
— The section of the Annual Report on pages 35 to 37 describing the work of the Audit Committee does not appropriately address matters 
communicated by us to the Audit Committee.
— The Directors’ statement relating to the Company’s compliance with the Code does not properly disclose a departure from a relevant 
provision of the Code specified, under the Listing Rules, for review by the auditors.
Directors’ Remuneration
In our opinion, the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies 
Act 2006. (CA06)
Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit
Responsibilities of the Directors for the financial statements
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial 
statements in accordance with the applicable framework and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. The Directors are also 
responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the Directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s and the Company’s ability to continue as a 
going concern, disclosing as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the 
Directors either intend to liquidate the Group or the Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, 
but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. 
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be 
expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. 
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the FRC’s website at:  
www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditors’ report.
Use of this report
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the Company’s members as a body in accordance with Chapter 3 of 
Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any 
other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our 
prior consent in writing.
Other required reporting
Companies Act 2006 exception reporting
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
— we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or
— adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from 
branches not visited by us; or
— certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
— the Company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement with the 
accounting records and returns. 
We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility. 
Appointment
Following the recommendation of the Audit Committee, we were appointed by the Directors on 16 June 1992 to audit the financial 
statements for the year ended 2 January 1993 and subsequent financial periods. The period of total uninterrupted engagement is 25 years, 
covering the years ended 2 January 1993 to 30 December 2017.

4imprint Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Notes to the Group Financial Statements
General information
4imprint Group plc, registered number 177991, is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in the UK and listed on the London 
Stock Exchange. Its registered office is 7/8 Market Place, London W1W 8AG. 
The Group presents the consolidated financial statements in US dollars and numbers are shown in US dollars thousands. A substantial 
portion of the Group’s revenue and earnings are denominated in US dollars and the Board is of the opinion that a US dollar presentation 
gives a more meaningful view of the Group’s financial performance and position.
Accounting policies
The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below. These policies have been 
consistently applied to all the periods presented. Accounting standards effective for the first time in the period have had no impact on the 
Group’s financial statements.
Basis of preparation
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention in accordance with IFRS (International Financial Reporting 
Standards) as adopted by the EU, IFRS IC interpretations and those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting 
under IFRS. The standards used are those published by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and endorsed by the EU at the 
time of preparing these financial statements (March 2018). 
After making enquiries, the Directors have reasonable expectations that the Group has adequate resources to continue to operate for a 
period of at least twelve months from the date these financial statements were approved. Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going 
concern basis in preparing the consolidated financial statements. 
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries for the period. Subsidiaries are all 
entities (including structured entities) over which the Group has control. The Group controls an entity when the Group is exposed to, or has 
rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power to direct the 
activities of the entity. The financial statements of subsidiaries, as amended to conform to Group accounting policies, are included in the 
consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
The purchase method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group. The cost of an acquisition is measured 
as the fair value of the consideration paid. Identifiable assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are 
measured initially at their fair value at the acquisition date. The excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s share of identifiable net 
assets is recorded as goodwill. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the period are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective 
date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate. In addition, comparatives are also restated to reclassify disposed 
businesses, or those that meet the criteria of IFRS 5 to be classified as held for sale and as discontinued operations. 
All subsidiaries have the same year end date as the Group.
Use of assumptions and estimates
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect 
the application of policies and reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. The estimates and associated assumptions are 
based on historical experiences and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which 
form the basis of making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual 
results may differ from these estimates. The key estimates are in respect of the present value of the pension scheme obligations. The 
assumptions used are disclosed in note 17.
Critical accounting policies
Critical accounting policies are those that require significant judgments or estimates and potentially result in materially different results under 
different assumptions or conditions. Management considers the following to be the only critical accounting policy:
Pensions
As disclosed in note 17, the Group sponsors a defined benefit pension scheme closed to new members and future accruals. Period end 
recognition of the liabilities under this scheme and the return on assets held to fund these liabilities require a number of significant actuarial 
assumptions to be made including inflation rate, discount rate and mortality rates. Small changes in assumptions can have a significant 
impact on the expense recorded in the income statement and on the pension liability in the balance sheet. Sensitivities to changes in these 
assumptions are disclosed in note 17.  61
4imprint Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Overview Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Additional Information
Other accounting policies
Revenue
Revenue from sales of promotional goods, delivery receipts and other activities is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or 
receivable for goods and services provided in the normal course of business net of discounts, returns and sales-related taxes. Revenues are 
recognised upon the transfer of risks and rewards to customers.
Supplier rebates
Amounts due under rebate agreements are recognised based upon volumes of products purchased during the period to which the rebates 
relate at the relevant rebate rates, per supplier agreements. Amounts are credited to the cost of purchase of goods for resale and any accrued 
income is included in other receivables. Provision is made against such receivables to the extent it is considered that the amounts are 
not recoverable.
Segmental reporting
The reporting requirements of IFRS 8 require operating segments to be identified on the basis of internal reports about components of the 
Group that are regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker to allocate resources to the segments and to assess their 
performance. The chief operating decision maker has been identified by the Directors as the Board and, accordingly, the segmental reporting 
included in the financial statements aligns with those reported monthly to the Board.
Leases
Where the Group has substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership under a lease, the lease will be classified as a finance lease. All 
other leases are classified as operating leases.
Finance leases
Assets acquired through finance leases are capitalised as property, plant and equipment, at the lower of the fair value of the leased asset and 
the present value of the minimum lease payments. These assets are depreciated over the lease term or the estimated useful life, whichever is 
shorter. The resulting lease obligations are included in liabilities, net of finance charges. Interest costs on finance leases are charged directly to 
the income statement.
Operating leases
Assets leased under operating leases are not recorded on the balance sheet. Rental payments are charged directly to the income statement 
on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
Share-based payments
All share options are measured at fair value at the date of grant allowing for any non-market and service conditions and the impact of any 
non-vesting conditions (for example requirements for the employee to save). The fair value is charged to the income statement over the 
vesting period of the share option schemes on a straight-line basis. The value of the charge is adjusted each year to reflect the expected 
number of options that will become exercisable. All options cancelled are fully expensed to the income statement upon cancellation.
Exceptional items
Income or costs which are both material and non-recurring, whose significance is sufficient to warrant separate disclosure in the financial 
statements, are referred to as exceptional items. The Directors consider that the separate disclosure of these items assists in understanding 
the Group’s financial performance.
Taxation
The tax expense for the period comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the income statement, except to the extent that it 
relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity in which case the tax is recognised in other comprehensive 
income or directly in equity, respectively.
The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date in the 
countries where the Group’s subsidiaries operate and generate taxable income. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax 
returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation and establishes provisions where appropriate 
on the basis of amounts estimated to be paid to tax authorities.
Deferred tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and 
their carrying amounts in the Group’s financial statements. However, deferred income tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial 
recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction, other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither 
accounting nor taxable profit or loss. Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantially 
enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income 
tax liability is settled.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the 
temporary differences can be utilised. 62
4imprint Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Other accounting policies continued
Dividends
Final equity dividends are recognised in the Group’s financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the 
Shareholders. Interim equity dividends are recognised when paid.
Foreign currency
The functional and presentation currency of the Company is Sterling, however the Group’s financial statements are presented in US dollars.
Transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of the Company or subsidiary concerned are recorded at the exchange rate 
prevailing at the date of the transaction. At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are 
translated at the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date. Translation differences on monetary items are taken to the 
income statement.
On consolidation the balance sheets of Sterling enterprises are translated into US dollars at the exchange rate ruling at the balance sheet date 
and income statements are translated at average rates for the period under review. One-off material transactions are translated at the spot 
rate on the transaction date. The resulting exchange differences are taken to the cumulative translation differences reserve and are reported 
in the statement of comprehensive income. 
On disposal of an operation any cumulative exchange differences held in Shareholders’ equity are recycled to the income statement.
Derivative instruments
The Group uses derivative forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge highly probable cash flows.
Derivatives are recognised initially at fair value and are remeasured at fair value at each reporting date. The treatment of the gain or loss on 
re-measurement depends on the nature of the item being hedged.
Hedges of the fair value of recognised assets and liabilities are designated as fair value hedges. Hedges of highly probable forecast 
transactions are designated as cash flow hedges.
Changes in the fair value of fair value hedging instruments are recognised in the income statement. Changes in the fair value of the hedged 
items are also recognised in the income statement.
The effective portion of changes in cash flow hedges are deferred in a hedging reserve, where material, and then charged to the income 
statement when the forecast sale or purchase occurs or if the forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur. Any ineffective portion of 
the cash flow hedge is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment losses. No depreciation is provided on 
freehold land. For all other property, plant and equipment, depreciation is calculated to write-off their cost less residual value by equal annual 
instalments over the period of their estimated useful lives, which are reviewed on a regular basis. Leasehold assets are depreciated over the 
shorter of the term of the lease or their estimated useful lives.
Cost comprises the purchase price plus costs directly incurred in bringing the asset into use.
The principal useful lives currently fall within the following ranges:
Freehold and long leasehold buildings 50 years
Short leasehold buildings Life of lease

Intangible assets
Acquired software licences and external expenditure on developing websites and other computer systems are capitalised, held at historic cost 
and amortised from the invoice date on a straight-line basis over its useful economic life (currently three to five years). Internal costs and 
non-development costs are expensed to operating expenses as incurred. 
An expense is recognised in operating expenses for catalogues and other related marketing expenses when the business has access to them.
Impairment of assets
All property, plant and equipment and intangible assets are reviewed for impairment in accordance with IAS 36 ‘Impairment of Assets’ if 
there is an indication that the carrying value of the asset may have been impaired. Where an impairment review is required, the carrying 
value of the assets is measured against their value in use based on future estimated cash flows, discounted by the appropriate cost of capital, 
resulting from the use of those assets. Assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there is a separately identifiable cash flow (cash 
generating unit). An impairment loss is recognised for the amount at which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The 
recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
Inventories
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost, net of provisions for slow moving and discontinued items, and net realisable value using the first 
in first out basis. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less applicable variable selling expenses. 
Items in transit where the Group holds the risks and rewards are included in inventories.
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less 
provision for impairment. A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will 
not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of receivables. The amount of the provision is recognised in the income 
statement. Trade receivables are discounted when the time value of money is considered material.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held on call with banks and other short-term highly liquid investments with 
original maturities of three months or less. Bank overdrafts are shown within borrowings in current liabilities on the balance sheet. In the cash 
flow statement cash and cash equivalents are shown net of bank overdrafts. Cash deposits with an original maturity in excess of three 
months are classified as other financial assets.
Trade payables
Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost. Trade and other payables are discounted 
when the time value of money is considered material.
Pensions
The Group operates defined contribution plans for the majority of its UK and US employees. The regular contributions are charged to the 
income statement as they are incurred.
The Group sponsors a defined benefit scheme, which is closed to new members and future accruals. The Group accounts for the defined 
benefit scheme under IAS 19 ‘Employee Benefits’. The deficit of the defined benefit pension scheme is recognised in full on the balance sheet 
and represents the difference between the fair value of the plan assets and the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the balance 
sheet date. A full actuarial valuation is carried out at least every three years and the defined benefit obligation is updated on an annual basis, 
by independent actuaries, using the projected unit credit method.
Pension charges recognised in the income statement consists of administration costs of the scheme, exceptional costs of risk reduction 
exercises incurred by the scheme and a finance cost based on the interest on net pension scheme liabilities calculated in accordance with 
IAS 19.
Differences between the actual and expected return on assets, experience gains and losses and changes in actuarial assumptions are 
included directly in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Borrowings
Borrowings are measured initially at fair value net of transaction costs incurred and subsequently carried at amortised costs using the 
effective interest rate method. Arrangement fees are amortised over the life of the borrowing. Borrowings are discounted when the time 
value of money is considered material. 64

Other accounting policies continued
Provision for future lease costs
Provisions for future lease costs and dilapidations are made when there is a legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events and it is 
probable that expenditure will be incurred and a reliable estimate can be made of that cost. If the effect of the time value of money is 
material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments 
of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. Where discounting is used, the increase in the provision 
due to the passage of time is recognised as an interest expense.
Own shares held by employee share trusts
Own shares acquired, to meet future obligations under employee share options, are held in independent trusts. These are funded by the 
Company and purchases of shares by the trusts are charged directly to equity. 
Administration expenses of the trusts are charged to the Company’s income statement as incurred.
IFRS standards effective in future financial statements
The IASB and IFRS IC have issued new or amended standards and interpretations which are effective for accounting periods as noted below. 
The impact of these standards is noted below.
The impact of IFRS 15, if applied to the 2017 full year results, would have been to reduce revenue by $0.7m and operating profit by $0.2m. 
However, on implementation in the 2018 financial statements, the 2017 results will not be restated, instead there will be a net opening 
adjustment to reduce equity by $1.3m (2016:$1.1m).
IFRS 16 will result in an increase to both assets and liabilities in the balance sheet, but have no material impact upon operating profit or profit 
before tax, based upon current lease commitments of the Group. If IFRS 16 had been in place at the end of 2017 both the assets and 
liabilities would have increased by around $3.5m. 
Management does not believe the impact of adopting the other new or amended standards and interpretations, including IFRS 9, will have a 
material impact on the results or net assets of the Group.

are expected to reverse before 2020 and 17% in respect of UK deferred tax items expected to reverse thereafter. 
The US federal tax rate was reduced to 21% from 1 January 2018. US deferred tax items have been recalculated at the 21% rate.
The amount of current tax recognised directly in Shareholders’ equity in 2017 was $nil (2016: $nil).

The basic weighted average number of shares excludes shares held in the 4imprint Group plc employee share trusts. The effect of this is to 
reduce the average by 43,104 (2016: 4,900).
The basic earnings per share is calculated based on the profit for the financial period divided by the basic weighted average number 
of shares.
For diluted earnings per share, the basic weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all potential 
dilutive ordinary shares. The potential dilutive ordinary shares relate to those share options granted to employees where the exercise price is 
less than the average market price of the Company’s ordinary shares and are likely to vest at the balance sheet date.
The underlying basic earnings per share is calculated before the after-tax effect of share option charges, exceptional items and defined 
benefit pension charges and is included because the Directors consider this gives a measure of the underlying performance of the business. 70

Deferred tax assets have been recognised where it is considered that there will be sufficient taxable profit available in future against which 
the deductible temporary timing differences can be utilised.
No provision has been made for deferred tax assets relating to losses carried forward in holding companies of $29.0m (2016: $31.0m). These 
losses have no expiry date and may be available for offset against future profits in these companies.

Administration costs paid by the scheme 291 311
Pension finance charge 503 521
Exceptional items – buy-out costs paid by scheme 378 1,320

$’000
Present value of funded obligations (36,739) (34,357)
Fair value of scheme assets 18,633 15,067
Net liability recognised in the balance sheet (18,106) (19,290)
The funds of the scheme are held in trust and administered by a corporate Trustee to meet pension liabilities for around 408 past employees 
of the Group. The level of retirement benefit is principally based on salary earned in the best three consecutive tax years in the ten years prior 
to leaving active service and is linked to changes in inflation both pre and post retirement.
The scheme is subject to the funding legislation outlined in the Pensions Act 2004 which came into force on 30 December 2005. This, 
together with documents issued by the Pensions Regulator, and Guidance Notes adopted by the Financial Reporting Council, set out the 
framework for funding defined benefit occupational pension plans in the UK.
The Trustee of the scheme is required to act in the best interest of the scheme’s beneficiaries. The appointment of trustees is determined by 
the scheme’s trust documentation. It is policy that one third of all trustees should be nominated by the members.
The scheme typically exposes the Company to actuarial risks such as investment risk, interest rate risk, mortality risk and longevity risk. A 
decrease in corporate bond yields, a rise in inflation or an increase in life expectancy would result in an increase to scheme liabilities. This 
would detrimentally impact the balance sheet position, potentially require an increase in future cash contributions from the Company and 
may give rise to increased charges in future income statements. Caps on inflationary increases are in place to protect the scheme against 
extreme inflation. Assets are held in a global absolute return fund, which is a multi-asset fund designed to provide positive returns in all 
market conditions and in a liability-driven investment fund designed to provide some hedge against movement in the liabilities due to interest 
rate fluctuation and inflation. The funds use derivatives to reduce risk.
A full actuarial valuation was undertaken as at 30 September 2016 in accordance with the scheme funding requirements of the Pensions Act 
2004. This actuarial valuation showed a deficit of £14.9m. A recovery plan has been signed under which the Company agreed a schedule of 
contributions with the Trustee. The recovery plan period is 5 years 7 months and under the plan contributions of £2.25m per annum are 
payable by the Company. These contributions commenced on 1 July 2017. This amount rises annually by 3%. In addition an annual allowance 
of £0.25m is payable towards costs of administration of the scheme.
For the purposes of IAS 19, numbers from the actuarial valuation as at 30 September 2016, which was carried out by a qualified independent 
actuary, have been updated on an approximate basis to 30 December 2017. There have been no changes in the valuation methodology 
adopted for this period’s disclosures compared to the previous period’s disclosures.

The principal assumptions applied by the actuaries, as determined by the Directors, at each period end were:
2017 2016
Rate of increase in pensions in payment 3.05% 3.20%
Rate of increase in deferred pensions 2.05% 2.10%

– CPI 2.05% 2.20%
The mortality assumptions adopted at 30 December 2017 have been updated to reflect the most recent version of the tables used in the last 
triennial valuation. The assumptions imply the following life expectancies at age 65:
2017 2016
Male currently age 40 23.3 yrs 23.6 yrs

The major categories of scheme assets as a percentage of total scheme assets are as follows:
2017 2016
$’000 % $’000 %
Global absolute returns funds 6,475 34.8 5,749 38.2
Liability-driven investments 11,597 62.2 7,597 50.4
Cash 561 3.0 1,721 11.4
The scheme holds no 4imprint Group plc shares or any property occupied by the Group.
It is the policy of the Trustee and the Company to review the investment strategy from time to time and at the time of each funding 
valuation. The Trustee investment objectives and the processes undertaken to measure and manage the risks inherent in the scheme 
investment strategy are documented in the scheme’s Statement of Investment Principles.
The assets were held in a quoted global absolute returns fund, designed to give positive investment returns in all market conditions, and 
a liability-driven investment fund designed to provide some hedge against movements in the liabilities due to interest rate fluctuation 
and inflation.
The sensitivities on the key actuarial assumptions at the end of the period were:
Change in assumption Change in defined benefit obligation
Discount rate Decrease of 0.25% 4.8%
Rate of inflation Increase of 0.25% 2.0%
Rate of mortality Increase in life expectancy of one year 3.7%
The sensitivities shown above are approximate. Each sensitivity considers each change in isolation and is calculated using the same 
methodology as used for the calculation of the defined benefit obligation at the end of the period. The inflation sensitivity includes 
the impact of changes to the assumptions for revaluation and pension increases. In practice it is unlikely that the changes would occur 
in isolation. 
The weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation at 30 December 2017 is 20 years.

20 Financial risk management
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks including currency risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and capital risk.
Currency risk
The Group operates internationally and is exposed to various currency movements. Risk arises predominantly from the remittance of overseas 
earnings in US dollars. In addition, Group subsidiaries may make both sales and purchases in a currency other than their functional currency 
and have foreign currency trade receivables and trade payables in relation to these transactions. 
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to partly hedge foreign currency cash flows arising from sales and purchases of goods, as 
well as remittances from its overseas subsidiaries. The Group does not hedge the currency exposure of profits and assets of its overseas 
subsidiaries or other financial transactions.
At 30 December 2017 the Group had no forward currency contracts.
The movement in the exchange rates compared to prior period increased profit after tax by $0.21m and decreased net assets by $0.57m. 
Closing rate was US$1.35 (2016: US$1.23) and the average rate used to translate profits was US$1.29 (2016: US$1.35).
A strengthening in the Sterling exchange rate by 10% (the approximate range of movement of the exchange rate during the year) would 
reduce profit in the period by $0.45m and net assets at period end by $1.69m. 78
4imprint Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
20 Financial risk management continued
Credit risk
Credit risk arises from deposits with banks and financial institutions, as well as credit exposure to trade receivable balances due 
from customers.
The risk associated with banks and financial institutions is managed on a Group basis and all banking relationships must be approved by the 
Chief Financial Officer or the Board based on the credit rating of the bank. 
The Group holds cash balances on deposit with its principal US and UK banks.
Financial instruments
The table below sets out the Group’s financial instruments by category:
2017

2016

Financial assets at amortised cost
Trade and other receivables (excluding prepayments) 42,704 37,118
Cash and cash equivalents 30,767 21,683
Financial liabilities at amortised cost
Trade and other payables (excluding non-financial liabilities) (47,675) (40,363)
Trade receivables are amounts due from customers for goods sold in the ordinary course of business. Other receivables are non-derivative 
financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. If collection of the amounts is expected in one 
year or less, they are classified as current assets. If not, they are presented as non-current assets. 
Cash was held with the following banks at the period end:

Other 17 13
30,767 21,683
There is no concentration of credit risk with respect to trade receivables as the Group has a large number of customers. 
Credit risk arising from customers is delegated to the senior management of each business to a maximum level per customer above which it 
is referred to the Chief Financial Officer for approval. External credit agency assessment reports are referred to as part of this process. 
Liquidity risk
Group borrowing requirements are managed centrally and the majority of borrowing arrangements are currently with the Group’s principal 
US bank and terms are agreed which are considered appropriate for the funding requirement of the Group at that time. 
Operating working capital is managed to levels agreed with the Group and cash forecasts are reviewed regularly by management. 
The Group monitors its levels of cash and indebtedness to ensure adequate liquid funds are available to meet the foreseeable requirements of 
the Group. The Group does not actively monitor a gearing ratio, but seeks to maintain an appropriate level of financial flexibility. Details of 
borrowing facilities are given in note 16.
At 30 December 2017 the net cash position (note 14) of the Group was $30.77m (2016: $21.68m).
Capital risk management
The objective for managing debt and equity capital is to safeguard the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, in order to provide 
returns for Shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders.
In 2017 the Company has provided returns to Shareholders in the form of dividends, details of which are included in note 8. Shares were 
purchased by an employee benefit trust, to cover the SAYE options maturing within the next two years.

Details of share schemes are disclosed in note 22.
2015 Incentive Plan
Under the 2015 Incentive Plan (the “Plan”) 50% of the annual bonus of the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and six senior 
managers will be deferred into shares as awards of nil cost options or conditional shares, based on the share price at 31 December of the 
relevant year. The awards will be made in a 42 day period following the announcement of the Group’s full year results and the options will 
normally not be exercisable until three years from the date of the award, conditional upon the person still being in the employment of a 
Group company. It is expected that 16,937 options or conditional shares, with a total fair value of $435,000, will be awarded in respect of 
the 2017 bonus.
22 Share-based payments
Share options may be granted to senior management and, in addition, SAYE or equivalent schemes exist for all UK and US employees. The 
exercise price for SAYE options is equal to the market rate, less any discount up to the limit imposed by the local tax authority at the 
pricing date.
The fair value of the options is determined using the Black-Scholes model for SAYE and ESPP and is spread over the vesting period of the 
options. The significant inputs into the model are an expected life of between 2.2 and 3 years for the SAYE and ESPP options, the volatility 
measured at the standard deviation of expected share price returns is based on statistical analysis of daily share prices over the last five years 
and the risk-free rate is based on zero coupon government bond yields.

In respect of the 2015 Incentive Plan the fair value of the awards of options or conditional shares made in 2016 and 2017 are based on the 
share price at 31 December 2015 and 31 December 2016 respectively. The option life is from date of first notification of the Plan at the end 
of March 2015 until expected exercise in March 2019 for the 2016 awards and from January 2016 to March 2020 for the 2017 awards. The 
fair value of the expected awards of 16,937 options or conditional shares in respect of 2017 is based on the share price at 31 December 2017 
and the option life is from January 2017 to March 2021.

Notes to the Company’s Financial Statements
General information
4imprint Group plc, registered number 177991, is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in the UK and listed on the London 
Stock Exchange. Its registered office is 7/8 Market Place, London W1W 8AG. The Company’s financial statements are presented in Sterling. 
Numbers are shown in pounds thousands.
Basis of preparation
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU, IFRS IC 
interpretations and those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. The standards used are those 
published by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and endorsed by the EU at the time of preparing these statements 
(March 2018).
After making enquiries, the Directors have reasonable expectations that the Company has adequate resources to continue to operate for a 
period of not less than twelve months from the date these financial statements were approved. Accordingly they continue to adopt the going 
concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
Use of assumptions and estimates
The preparation of the financial statements requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the application 
of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on 
historical experiences and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the 
basis of making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may 
differ from these estimates.
Critical accounting policies
Critical accounting policies are those that require significant judgment or estimates and potentially result in materially different results under 
different assumptions or conditions. Management considers the following to be the only critical accounting policy of the Company.
Pensions
As disclosed in note 17 on pages 74 to 76, the Company sponsors a closed defined benefit scheme. Year end recognition of the liabilities 
under this scheme and the return on assets held to fund these liabilities require a number of significant actuarial assumptions to be made 
including inflation, discount rate and mortality rates. Small changes in assumptions can have a significant impact on the expense recorded in 
the income statement and on the pension liability in the balance sheet.
Accounting policies
The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these financial statements are the same as those adopted in the consolidated 
financial statements on pages 61 to 64 except for the investments policy noted below. These policies have been consistently applied to all the 
periods presented.
Investments
Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost. Impairment reviews are carried out if there is some indication that the carrying value of the 
investments may have been impaired. Where, in the opinion of the Directors, an impairment of the investment has arisen, provisions are 
made in accordance with IAS 36 ‘Impairment of Assets’. 86
