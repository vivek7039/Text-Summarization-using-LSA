in three distinct segments 
 
Our industry-leading Strategic Marketing 
businesses have strong capabilities across three 
specialist high-growth areas: Digital, Data and 
Insight. Our Marketing Activation businesses, 
which deliver marketing communications through 
a combination of print and in-store marketing 
services complement this offering, whilst our 
market-leading Books business represents an 
additional source of profit and cash generation  
as we continue to grow.

connecting clients with different 
partners throughout the Group.
The strong performance of Strategic 
Marketing has offset the pressure 
on our Marketing Activation 
businesses, which have contended 
with overcapacity, poor margins and 
additional issues in the key sectors 
of retail and grocery, for a number 
of years. The Books division has 
also been affected by low margins 
and the loss of a major publishing 
contract. We have previously 
outlined a strategic review for both 
of these segments to improve 
efficiencies and reduce costs. This 
process is ongoing and updates  
will be provided in due course.
Governance
The CEO, Matt Armitage, and 
the CFO, Brad Gray, have worked 
tirelessly to tackle the issues in our 
Marketing Activation and Books 
segments. Their diligence and 
calmness under pressure meant  
that short-term considerations  
have not caused us to deviate  
from our strategic priorities. We  
are grateful for their leadership,  
and our goal is for the Group to be 
in a position for them to be able to 
focus on developing our successful 
businesses.
The Board takes its role in corporate 
governance of the Group very 
seriously, implementing rigorous 
and robust systems to ensure we 
meet the high standards demanded 
by our investors and the regulators.
We also take very seriously the 
forthcoming regulatory changes 
that will affect our Data businesses 
in particular: to that end, we have 
appointed John Richmond as 
Data Protection Officer for the 
Group. John will oversee the 
implementation of the General 
Data Protection Regulation (‘GDPR’) 
compliance and lead our collective 
efforts to reduce risk brought about 
by these legal changes.
As for Brexit, the future economic 
effects remain unclear. Although the 
vast majority of our revenues come 
from the UK and US, we continue to 
keep close scrutiny on political and 
fiscal events.
We have taken steps to create 
a culture of knowledge sharing. 
Transfers between roles and 
businesses will continue to be 
offered to employees into the 
new financial year. The long-term 
effect will be individual career 
opportunities and also greater 
J Schwan, founder and CEO of 
Solstice, is increasingly taking 
a leadership role in the mobile 
services sector.
We believe these changes create 
a greater opportunity for the 
businesses to work with each other, 
offering a diverse range of expert 
services to our clients. We hope 
that this will lead to longer-term 
relationships with clients. There 
have already been some exciting 
new contracts, not least within 
our mobile services companies. 
Solstice and The App Business 
(‘TAB’) continue to collaborate and 
thrive through sharing resource and 
working practices, a model we’re 
encouraging businesses across the 
Group to adopt.
Over 200 clients buy services from 
more than one of our companies. 
This is a great credit to the senior 
leaders of the individual businesses, 
who recognise the importance of 
collaboration between our 
companies.
We have completed the first stage 
of a Board evaluation, which is 
carried out every other year. This 
review of our strategy and practices 
allows us to prioritise our efforts for 
growth. We have agreed that our 
number one task is to achieve a 
more stable balance sheet, allowing 
us to consider future acquisitions 
and international expansion from  
a stronger foundation.
Meanwhile, I would like to pay 
tribute to the commitment of 
employees across the Group during 
an uncertain period. I believe that 
their dedication to driving our  
high-quality businesses puts us  
in an excellent position for growth.
We remain committed to each 
individual’ s health and safety, 
whether that is in our offices, 
factories or workshops, in the UK 
and overseas. We constantly review 
systems across all our facilities in the 
belief that everyone has a right to 
risk-free working conditions.
Finally, Ben Gordon has decided to 
stand down from the Board at the 
conclusion of the Annual General 
Meeting on 30 November 2017. 
Ben has been a Director for more 
than four years and his extensive 
experience, particularly in the retail 
and books sectors, has made a 
major contribution to the Board’ s 
debates. On behalf of the Board, 
I would like to thank Ben for his 
valuable contribution during his 
time as a Director.
Outlook
On behalf of the Board, I am sorry 
about the share price difficulties 
arising during the last 18 months. 
However, we are clear about the 
best way forward. We will continue 
to monitor changing economic 
conditions and amend our strategy 
accordingly.
All other things being equal, I 
consider us to be well placed to 
achieve solid growth and deliver 
outstanding service to our clients, 
allowing us to deliver increased 
shareholder value in the next 
financial year. I look forward to 
working with the Board and all our 
businesses to make that happen.

CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
I consider us to be well placed to 
achieve solid growth and deliver 
outstanding service to our clients, 
allowing us to deliver increased 
shareholder value in the next  
financial year.
Positive  
outlook
It has been a challenging year 
at St Ives, but we end it looking 
forward with optimism based on 
a much-improved performance 
in the second half of the year, as 
mentioned in our trading statement 
in August 2017. Full-year results were 
in line with market expectations and 
we now hope to have put a difficult 
period behind us.
In particular, profitability of the 
Digital businesses within Strategic 
Marketing is driving the Group 
forward, with growth running ahead 
of expectations. There have been 
several changes of leadership 
within the segment, as well as a 
restructuring of our Digital and  
Data businesses. A new 
management team within Digital 
now oversees Amaze, Realise 
and Branded3. In Data, Damian 
Coverdale’ s remit has grown to 
include Occam, Amaze One and 
Bench, alongside Response One.  CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT OUR FIGURES

CASE STUDY
Unilever and Amaze are working together to tell 
Unilever’s powerful sustainability story. Every year, 
more than 23 million people from 92 countries  
visit the packaged goods giant’s global network  
of websites. Unilever’s sustainability content  
needs to be accessible to everyone, everywhere  
– from consumers to investors, and nutritionists  
to journalists.
The company’s Sustainable Living Report was 
supported by a growing volume of online content, 
but the user experience had become fractured. 
Content was deeply buried, making it difficult to 
navigate and engage with relevant information. 
A new, streamlined digital sustainability section was 
required for Unilever.com. It required consistent 
navigation and signposting to make complex 
information easy to access, understand and share.  
It also had to be rolled out across 47 international 
sites in 28 languages.
Amaze explored digital data insights across the 
network to understand visitors and their journeys, 
and inform a strategy. This involved:
• conducting a twelve month, on-site survey  
across all of Unilever’s websites;
• reviewing Unilever.com against industry best 
practice to identify improvement areas; and
• developing personae based on insights to test 
and improve target audience understanding.
In addition to creating a simpler and more coherent 
navigation system that adapts as the user travels 
deeper into the sustainability content, Amaze has 
introduced new components that help to create a 
richer visual design, with better signposting for the 
reader, and improved content findability. 
Other innovations include a one-page creative 
summary of the Sustainable Living Report, 
interactive content, shareable modules and  
shorter case studies showcasing Unilever’s  
work on the ground.
The sustainable living section of Unilever.com saw 
a 56% increase in views year-on-year and a healthy 
uplift in reading time. Most tellingly of all, 43% of 
consumers confirmed they would be more likely  
to buy a Unilever product after visiting the site.

STRATEGIC REPORT  
OUR BUSINESS MODEL AND STRATEGY
Leading through 
a collaborative 
approach
St Ives is an international 
Marketing Services Group. We 
operate not as a single entity 
but as a group of market-leading 
businesses, each with its own 
unique value proposition. Our 
companies offer complementary 
services and collaborate closely 
with each other when this adds 
value to clients.
We have built strong capabilities in 
our Strategic Marketing businesses 
and specifically in the high-growth 
segments of Digital, Data and 
Insight. Our complementary 
Marketing Activation capability 
delivers our clients’ marketing 
communications through a 
combination of print and in-store 
marketing services.
Our strategic focus is to invest in 
and further develop our Strategic 
Marketing businesses. Where 
there is specific client demand, 
we will evaluate opening offices 
in new territories. Our longer-
term goal is to expand our 
footprint of Strategic Marketing 
businesses. Our Marketing 
Activation businesses and our 
longstanding and market-leading 
Books production and distribution 
business represent an additional 
source of cash generation as we 
pursue this growth strategy.
We encourage our businesses to 
be innovative and forward thinking 
so that they are able to evolve and 
adapt to the changing business 
environment whilst delivering 
complex and sophisticated 
solutions. This helps to deliver 
enduring client relationships out 
of which the Group can build 
long-term market strength and 
shareholder value. 
We place great emphasis on 
nurturing the right corporate 
culture. We deliberately operate 
a flat corporate structure that 
gives autonomy to individual 
management teams whilst 
encouraging and facilitating 
collaboration within the Group. 
This is enhanced by having a 
Managing Director responsible for 
more than one subsidiary business, 
such as in our Data segment.
A fundamental aspect of our 
business model is that all our 
companies operate as separate 
brands and businesses. This gives 
them freedom to develop their 
own intellectual property and to 
become leading players within 
their markets. The Group’s role 
is to support the businesses with 
investment to accelerate growth 
and to facilitate collaboration so 
that our combined offering creates 
maximum synergy, scalability and 
value for our clients. CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT OUR FIGURES

GROWTH DRIVERS
Our strategy for growth is 
centred around three key 
priorities 06 St Ives plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
action to reduce the cost base 
of both segments to reflect 
the new market realities. 
Despite these issues and their 
impact on the results, we are 
pleased to report encouraging 
underlying progress within our 
core Strategic Marketing segment. 
This segment lies at the centre 
of our long-term growth strategy 
and now represents some 42% 
of Group revenues and 75% of 
Adjusted operating profit. In 
particular, we have seen important 
progress in our pursuit of organic 
growth here, through a number 
of significant new wins coupled 
with increasing collaboration 
between our various businesses 
and further internationalisation.
STRATEGIC REPORT  
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S PERFORMANCE REVIEW
Performance 
highlights
Group revenue of £393.2 million  
was 7% higher than the comparable 
period in the previous year, 
bolstered by our Strategic 
Marketing segment, which 
delivered growth of 13%. Excluding 
the effects of acquisition and 
currency movements, organic 
growth across the Group was 5%. 
Revenue within our Books segment 
was 12% ahead of the previous year 
while revenue within our Marketing 
Activation segment was broadly in 
line with the previous year.
The Group’s statutory loss  
before tax of £44.1 million  
(2016 – loss of £5.7 million) 
includes Adjusting Items of  
£68.2 million (2016 – £36.1 million), 
of which £66.1 million relates  
to non-cash items in the current 
period. The non-cash Adjusting 
Items include amortisation  
of acquired intangibles of  
£10.0 million, an impairment 
charge of £33.1 million, mainly  
in the Marketing Activation and  
Books segments, and contingent 
consideration expense of  
£23.0 million. Other Adjusting 
Items include costs related to  
the St Ives Defined Benefits 
Pension Scheme of £1.9 million 
and restructuring costs of  
£3.0 million offset by gain on 
disposal of properties of  
£2.8 million.
The Group’s Adjusted profit  
before tax declined to  
£24.1 million (2016 – £30.4 million) 
and Adjusted basic earnings per 
share decreased by 24% to  
13.39 pence (2016 – 17.61 pence).
The year saw further growth 
in our Strategic Marketing 
segment despite a number 
of project cancellations and 
deferrals in the last quarter of 
the previous financial year, which 
impacted revenue growth and 
operating margin during the first 
half of the 2017 financial year. 
However, we are encouraged 
by the progress that has been 
made in the second half of the 
year to replace the cancelled 
work and return the segment 
to its previous levels of organic 
growth and operating margin. 
Balance Sheet
Net debt as at 28 July 2017  
was £54.6 million, down from the 
£80.8 million as at 29 July 2016, 
representing a net debt  
Introduction
Overall, it has been a challenging 
year for the Group, which is 
reflected in the reported results 
for the period, albeit with a 
much improved performance 
during the second half. Our 
focus has been on addressing 
the issues of the past whilst 
taking decisive action to improve 
efficiency of our two legacy 
segments and further strengthen 
the Group’s balance sheet. 
The principal challenges remain  
in our legacy Marketing Activation 
and Books segments where, 
despite their strong market 
positions, increased competition 
continues to exert downward 
pressure on margins. In response, 
the Board has taken immediate  
 
We continue to make good progress 
with our collaboration agenda with  
over 200 of our clients currently working 
with more than one business across  
the Group.
Encouraging 
progress in Strategic 
Marketing
to Adjusted EBITDA ratio of  
1.6 times (29 July 2016 – 2.0 times). 
Further reducing the Group’s 
indebtedness remains a priority  
for the Board.
Dividend
The Board has reviewed St Ives’ 
near-term dividend policy to 
reflect the impact of the issues 
experienced in the Group’s 
legacy businesses and the costs 
involved in the ongoing cost-
reduction initiatives. In doing so 
it has balanced the importance 
of dividends to shareholders, 
the importance of investing in 
the further organic growth of the 
Group’s core Strategic Marketing 
segment, and the strengthening 
of the balance sheet. Against 
that background, the Board has 
proposed a final dividend of  
1.30 pence per share, giving a  
full-year dividend of 1.95 pence 
per share, a decrease of 75% 
against last year’s full-year dividend 
of 7.80 pence. The Board will  
re-evaluate the longer-term 
dividend policy in due course. 
If approved by shareholders,  
the final dividend of 1.30 pence 
will be paid on 18 December 2017 
to the shareholders on the register 
at 24 November 2017, with  
an ex-dividend date of  
23 November 2017.
Strategic priorities
The Board remains confident in 
our long-term strategy for further 
growth, which is built around 
the Group’s Strategic Marketing 
segment and remains centred 
around three key priorities:
Collaboration
We continue to make good 
progress with our collaboration 
agenda with over 200 of our clients 
currently working with more than 
one business across the Group; a 
39% increase compared with the 
150 reported in the last financial 
year. These include major brands 
such as Standard Life, Paddy 
Power and Expedia. 
In addition, we continue to see an 
increase in demand for integrated 
solutions from clients within our 
Strategic Marketing segment, 
which, while aligning to our 
collaboration agenda, has led us 
to review and evolve our operating 
model within the segment. This 
has also resulted in us bringing a 
number of our Digital and Data 
businesses closer together. CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT OUR FIGURES
07 St Ives plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
ensure that the cost base reflects 
the future level of volumes we  
now expect.
Overall, we remain confident in 
the long-term growth strategy 
currently being pursued in 
Strategic Marketing, and in the 
quality of our businesses within 
that segment, as illustrated by 
the major international clients 
and contracts they continue to 
attract. However, we recognise the 
need to address, decisively, the 
effect that the legacy businesses 
are having on the Group’s overall 
performance and on our ability to 
generate value for shareholders. 
This, together with further 
strengthening of our balance 
sheet, remains a top priority for  
the Board looking forward. 
Matt Armitage
Chief Executive
2 October 2017
Internationalisation
Many of our businesses now 
deliver international solutions for 
clients. Most notably, 39% of our 
Strategic Marketing revenue now 
comes from clients based outside 
the UK (2016 – 37%), with nine 
businesses within this segment 
currently servicing clients on an 
international basis. 
Our strategy for developing our 
overseas footprint remains client-
driven with new office openings 
only taking place in territories 
where we can identify lucrative 
client-led opportunities. We 
will continue to be disciplined 
in our implementation of this 
strategy, targeting opportunities 
in large markets or in those 
with the potential for significant 
and sustainable growth, where 
offices are capable of generating 
appropriate returns within a 
reasonable period of time. 
Acquisition
Given the recent challenges 
across the Group, we are currently 
prioritising organic over acquisitive 
growth, including leveraging  
the investments we have made  
in existing propositions and  
in new offices.
In the longer-term, the acquisition 
of further complementary 
marketing services businesses that 
add value to our existing portfolio 
and operate in our chosen growth 
areas of Digital, Data and Insight 
services will continue to be an 
important element of the growth 
strategy of our core Strategic 
Marketing segment.
Outlook
 
Trading across our Strategic 
Marketing segment has recovered 
and we have been encouraged 
by new projects being won 
from existing and new clients. 
Our pipeline for the first half of 
the new financial year is very 
encouraging and we are excited 
by the opportunities that the 
increased collaboration between 
our businesses is generating.
While trading conditions within 
our Marketing Activation segment 
continue to be very challenging, 
we have taken decisive action to 
increase efficiency and reduce 
costs, and remain focussed on 
diversifying into other sectors. 
Similarly, within our Books business 
we have taken further steps to  
 
Tesco turned to mobile services 
provider The App Business 
(‘TAB’) to respond to an 
ever-increasing demand for 
convenience among London-
based grocery shoppers. The 
answer was Tesco Now, a service 
with no minimum basket order, 
delivering groceries quickly and 
on demand. 
Tesco had already conducted 
experiments to collect shopper 
data, providing early insight 
for a discovery phase run by 
TAB’s strategy team. Research, 
focussed workshops and in-depth 
shopper interviews clarified 
customer expectation, objectives, 
and predicted order time and 
location.
Service priorities were set for 
the app, empowering the joint 
team to make leaner, faster 
decisions. With Tesco being such 
a strong brand, it was essential 
for the app to behave and feel 
like an integrated channel. TAB’s 
designers developed a sleek user 
interface that maintained the 
familiar Tesco brand experience 
on mobile.
In parallel, Tesco created a 
sophisticated middleware 
layer, optimising data for fast, 
efficient delivery to mobile. 
This was a prerequisite for a 
speedy, modern, intuitive mobile 
experience, and also allowed 
Tesco Now to integrate with 
back-end systems.
Communication and scheduling 
were critical. TAB and Tesco 
worked side by side to build 
their respective components 
via a modular architecture. 
This delivered acute flexibility, 
ensuring Tesco Now can grow, 
evolve and be maintained 
efficiently in the future.
Working alongside Tesco’s 
experts, TAB’s test engineers 
conducted extensive usability 
and exploratory trials. TAB 
took an innovative approach, 
automating the core end-to-end 
journeys that customers make 
through the app. Short, quick 
feedback loops embedded in  
the app will continue to provide 
data on emerging pain points and 
highlight areas of improvement 
for future releases. 
TAB and Tesco’s mutual focus and 
dedication have been a decisive 
factor in the pilot project’s 
success to date, with further  
roll-out planned.

CASE STUDY 08 St Ives plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Our Strategic Marketing  
segment represents 42% of Group 
revenue for the year (2016 – 39%) 
and 75% of Group Adjusted  
operating profit.
We have seen further, very 
encouraging progress within the 
Strategic Marketing segment, 
which remains core to the Group’s 
long-term growth strategy.
One of our key priorities was 
to replace the work lost in the 
last quarter of the previous 
financial year, which resulted in 
a challenging first half for the 
segment. However, following 
several significant new client wins 
and contract renewals during 
the period, including long-term 
agreements to be the digital 
partner of Rockwell Automation, 
SoftBank, and DuPont Pioneer 
we are pleased to have delivered 
a significant improvement in the 
performance of the segment in the 
second half of the financial year.
As a result of an increase in client 
demand for more integrated 
solutions, we have continued to 
drive our collaboration agenda 
and to evolve our operating 
model accordingly. We continue 
to focus on the disciplines of 
Digital, Data and Insight, albeit 
the strict distinctions between 
these disciplines are becoming 
less relevant as more integrated 
solutions are provided to clients.
During the year, we announced 
a number of senior management 
changes within our Digital and 
Data businesses. Three Digital 
businesses (Amaze, Realise 
and Branded3) are now under 
the responsibility of a single 
management team, while we  
have also announced that  
our Data businesses (Occam, 
Response One, Bench and  
Amaze One) will be managed  
by a single team. These changes 
will ensure that we offer a coherent 
proposition combined with the 
breadth and scale of services to 
support our clients’ expanding 
digital and data requirements.
Over the period, our Data 
businesses have worked more 
closely together than ever, both 
with each other and also with 
our Digital businesses, where 
numerous joint propositions have 
been developed. We see further 
opportunities for collaboration 
between our Digital and Data 
businesses as data continues 
to be the driving force behind 
successful digital marketing and 
transformation activities. The 
short-term priority within our 
Data businesses is to ensure that 
our offering is fully compliant 
with and able to benefit from 
the new General Data Protection 
Regulation (‘GDPR’) which will 
apply from May 2018.
Synergies between Solstice, 
our Chicago-based mobile and 
emerging technology business, 
and The App Business (‘TAB’),  
our similar UK business, continue 
to result in both businesses sharing 
resources, working practices, 
growth frameworks and data. 
The two are working together to 
develop innovative connected 
digital experiences using voice, 
virtual reality and Internet of 
Things technology for clients. 
New wins in the financial year 
have included projects for clients 
including Bosch and Electrolux. 
Within our research consultancy, 
Incite, we have seen growth of 
both our UK and US businesses 
through a significant number of 
new client wins in the technology, 
FMCG, finance and pharma 
sectors, while client spend and 
sentiment in Asia also improved 
in the second half of the financial 
year. We continue to support 
our overseas offices in order to 
provide an international offering 
to clients – a growing number of 
Incite’s clients are serviced by more 
than one Incite office – and to 
drive long-term growth, although 
this continues to affect short-term 
profitability. 
Our healthcare consultancy, Hive, 
has gained several major new 
clients during the period including 
Roche, Leo Pharma, Lundbeck, 
Ipsen, and Almirall. The business 
has also expanded its offering and 
client base in the US, delivering 
significant growth (albeit from  
a low base) through a number  
of client wins, including Pfizer.  
We see the US and further 
international expansion as a 
significant contributor to future 
growth for this business.

Trading conditions within this 
segment continue to be very

the grocery retail market. While 
our expertise in grocery retail 
remains an important strength, 
diversification of the client base

Our market-leading Books 
segment represents 19%  
(2016 – 19%) of Group revenue 
for the year and 9% of Group 
Adjusted operating profit. 
Revenue was 12% higher than the 
prior year at £76.5 million  
(2016 – £68.6 million). 
Trading during the first half of 
the year was generally positive, 
particularly during the pre-
Christmas period, with sales of 
printed books in the UK up 5%  
on 2016 (as reported by Nielsen).
As announced in February  
2017, we were informed by 
HarperCollins that our contract  
for the production of monochrome  
books in the UK would not be 
renewed. The contract ended 
on 30 June 2017. As a result 
of the non-renewal, significant 
restructuring and cost reduction 
initiatives have been implemented.
We continue to adapt to suit 
the evolving needs of clients, 
leveraging our well-invested digital 
print technology to provide a 
broader product range, greater 
capacity to support fast lead times 
and lower stockholding, with a 
continued focus on extending 
supply chain solutions to reduce 
the overall cost of the books’ 
supply chain.
the market remains extremely price 
competitive in all areas. As a result, 
over the period the management 
team has been focussed on 
protecting margins through  
driving efficiency improvements 
and cost reductions. 
Moving forward, our priority is on 
strategic growth opportunities 
in markets that value service and 
innovation, and which further 
reduce the segment’s over-reliance 
on grocery retail. This will include 
delivering a wider portfolio of 
goods and services that cover 
the whole of the marketing 
operations sphere of brands and 
retailers. We will also continue to 
focus on margin protection while 
differentiating our competitive 
offering through targeted 
investment in new service lines 
and further additional cross-sales 
initiatives.

STRATEGY IN ACTION
Collaboration
Collaboration remains a key 
strategic pillar of St Ives’ 
overall strategy for growth. 
By supporting partnerships 
and joint working practices 
between our businesses, 
the Group allows them to 
organically build and share 
new skills and expertise,  
while avoiding the need to 
enforce change.
The number of clients now 
working with more than one 
business across the Group is 
209, compared to 150 in the 
previous year.
In particular, we have made 
great strides in collaboration 
among our Digital 
businesses. Appointing 
a new Digital board to 
oversee Realise, Amaze and 
Branded3 has also provoked 
new partnerships. Similarly, 
the promotion of Response 
One Managing Director 
Damian Coverdale to now 
include responsibility for 
Amaze One, Bench and 
Occam is a driver of growth 
in those companies, but is 
also helping to foster new 
collaborations between  
Data and Digital teams.

Following the successful roll-
out of the website, which Pizza 
Hut described as its “digital 
flagship restaurant”, Amaze was 
tasked with transforming the 
brand’s Customer Relationship 
Management (‘CRM’). Quick wins 
such as increasing visit frequency, 
average order value and boosting 
appeal to millennials were the 
goal of the new strategy.
Amaze engaged Amaze One 
to improve Pizza Hut’s existing 
CRM communications, but 
time was tight. With deadlines 
pressing, embedding an Amaze 
One team member within Pizza 
Hut’s campaign team proved vital 
not only to the success of the 
campaigns, but to the success  
of the relationship.
Once in place, the Amaze One 
team member got up to speed 
with the way of working fast. He 
worked with the Pizza Hut team 
to optimise campaign set ups, 
selections and delivery; enhancing 
targeting and segmentation 
and making other improvement 
recommendations. Pizza Hut were 
delighted with his contribution 
– and one project was up and 
running within a day, providing 
valuable specialist support  
for Amaze.
One key area of collaboration was 
in workshops involving the client 
team, Amaze and Amaze One. 
The purpose was to understand 
the current and planned data 
landscape, and unlock the 
insight needed to formulate 
recommendations for immediate 
and potential improvements to 
the CRM programme. 
Amaze and Amaze One are now 
using the workshop outcomes 
to develop recommendations to 
support communications planning 
activities, develop early life 
customer journeys and identify 
potential CRM quick wins. 
The collaboration between the 
St Ives businesses has so far 
proved extremely successful. 
Having defined top line customer 
journeys, they are now developing 
these further, focusing on 
messaging, creative, General Data 
Protection Regulation (‘GDPR’) 
compliance and more.

STRATEGY IN ACTION CONTINUED
Collaboration continued
Our Digital businesses operate 
in a connected society, with the 
positive outcome of fostering a 
culture of collaboration in these 
forward-thinking organisations. 
The Group’s strategic pillar of 
collaboration is firmly embedded 
in its Digital businesses. This is  
now regarded as a core foundation 
for success in a market demanding 
pace, agility and innovation.
“We collaborate, firstly, in the 
interests of our clients but, just as 
importantly, in the interests of our 
people. It’s a central premise from 
which we derive our solutions  
and our ideas,” says Fiona 
Proudler, Managing Director  
of Amaze and Realise.
Since the closer alignment of 
Amaze, Realise and Branded3, 
there has been an accelerated 
move towards greater 
collaboration. 
“Clients want results. They are 
single-minded in this,” Proudler 
continues. “Our role is to generate 
results by bringing together the 
experts that exist across our 
businesses and getting them to 
collaborate on the problem. Where 
they sit on a group structure chart 
is not important to the client. It’s a 
sense of shared vision and values, 
and a commitment to deliver  
that matter.”
Not every project or brief requires 
this approach, but increasingly the 
answer does lie in a blend of skills 
from a number of different teams 
and locations.
Proudler cites Standard Life 
Investments as a good example. 
Having worked with Realise for 
more than a decade, the global 
asset management company 
required specialist search 
marketing services. Realise  
brought in Branded3 for this 
expertise, but retained the 
overall relationship and oversight 
of service delivery. Meanwhile, 
Zoetis Pharmaceuticals appointed 
Realise to deliver on its 
transformation agenda, but also 
needed skills in data intelligence, 
strategy and search engine 
optimisation, which Amaze and 
Branded3 could deliver. 
“Lexus is another impressive 
example on a large scale,” adds 
Proudler. “We’ve brought together 
multiple teams from different 
disciplines to build its new 
European web platform: strategy, 
user experience, content, technical 
support, data intelligence and 
more. It’s a great chance for the 
Group businesses to develop new 
workstreams together to deliver 
the best solution for our client.”
Collaboration is a top priority for 
many business leaders today. It 
can have tangible benefits for staff 
retention and motivation.
“We want our people to thrive at 
work. For them to do so, we need 
to provide new stimuli. Working 
with experts in other areas – 
and, more importantly, from 
our Group businesses – creates 
increasing opportunities to learn 
and develop, to see new ways of 
thinking and operating, and to hear 
about different experiences and 
approaches,” Proudler explains.
With today’s clients wanting a 
more integrated set of services 
aligned around their end 
consumers’ needs, the reach of 
the wider Group becomes an even 
greater asset. Clients want data-led 
decision-making, so the Digital 
businesses’ collective ability to 
partner with the Data businesses 
– led by CEO Damian Coverdale 
– is now a real strength within the 
Group. The result is end-to-end 
customer experiences that look 
good, are built to last and deliver 
real value.
FIONA PROUDLER
Managing Director of Amaze and Realise
An example of Data and Digital 
collaboration is Amaze One, 
a joint venture between Amaze 
and Response One. “Amaze One 
combines the best of both worlds 
– a data-driven business rooted 
in digital creativity and audience 
understanding,” Proudler states.
In an increasingly global world, 
international partnerships within 
the Group – such as client 
projects in the US – are firmly on 
Proudler’s radar. She concludes: 
“International collaboration 
creates a global capability and 
reach that we were not previously 
able to offer clients, offering 
ever more powerful solutions by 
working with our talent in the US 
and further afield. St Ives’ key 
differentiator is having strong 
individual businesses, able to 
seamlessly and quickly extend 
specialist services to other Group 
companies. That will only increase 
over time.” CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT OUR FIGURES
13 St Ives plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Data within St Ives – which 
includes Response One, Bench, 
Amaze One and Occam – has 
contributed major client wins in 
the financial year, allowing  
the businesses to enter this 
period on a firm footing.
Central to the success are two 
key factors: the appointment of 
Damian Coverdale as CEO to 
oversee all four businesses and 
drive a combined strategy, and 
closer collaboration between  
the Data businesses.
Coverdale added his new remit 
to his existing role as Managing 
Director of Response One in 2017. 
He says: “I play an active role in 
setting the strategy of the Data 
group and identifying investments 
that will deliver maximum 
return. My short-term focus 
is on structuring the business 
to capitalise on the significant 
capabilities we now house under 
one roof.” 
That means devising effective 
solutions for clients, founded 
on a deep understanding of 
data, analytics, technology and 
creativity. “We offer a diverse 
range of services from complex 
marketing technology solutions 
through to innovative planning 
and creative, but the thin red line 
that connects us is the intelligent 
application of data,” he adds.  
“It’s common for working groups 
to seed ideas and knowledge 
across the Data businesses. We’re 
stronger as a combined business.” 
Mixed-discipline, cross-business 
teams are deployed. For example, 
Azzurri Group, which owns brands 
including Ask and Zizzi, works with 
Occam, Response One, Bench and 
Amaze One. 
Meanwhile, collaboration with 
the Group’s Digital companies 
is gathering pace. Senior 
representatives from Data and 
Digital meet quarterly to identify 
collaboration opportunities.
Coverdale continues: “With 
Amaze One the relationship 
between Data and Digital has 
never been stronger. This is 
manifested in client activity 
such as TSB and Azzurri. We’re 
creating a unified business with 
a single vision, a combined 
proposition and operating model. 
Collaboration is a necessity, not  
an opportunity.” 
Now the General Data Protection 
Regulation (‘GDPR’) is on the 
horizon, all Data agencies  
must deliver well thought-out,  
innovative and compliant 
propositions, as well as bulletproof 
data management processes, 
technology and strategic  
customer communications.
With an eye on the future, 
Coverdale concludes: “We are 
in the unique position of having 
combined data, technology, 
compliance, creative and planning 
expertise delivering against all 
core client issues. We’ve invested 
in automated machine learning 
solutions to drive real-time 
predictive content and targeting, 
and we’re upskilling our team 
to harness new technology. 
Businesses can’t ignore changing 
legislation and consumers’ 
expectations around how their 
data is managed and used. 
Change is critical.”

STRATEGY IN ACTION CONTINUED
Acquisition
Following a flurry of activity 
in previous years, the focus 
during the year has been on 
continuing to bed in newer 
companies such as Solstice 
and The App Business. The 
strategy of further acquisitions 
remains, however, where these 
opportunities make strategic 
sense to add strength, depth 
and scale to the Group’s 
offering.
Organic growth will continue 
to be fundamental to future 
performance across our 
segments. This is built on 
a strategy of broadening 
projects to involve wider 
teams and new services 
within individual businesses, 
but also introducing clients 
to the expertise of partner 
companies across the Group. 
Meanwhile, a drive to build 
more retained, long-term 
relationships is under way.

A key growth driver for both 
Solstice and The App Business 
(‘TAB’) is the synergies between 
the two operations and 
their ability to work together 
seamlessly. Jointly, the businesses 
count more than 450 mobility 
experts in their ranks across  
three continents.
Rob Evans, co-founder of TAB, 
explains: “We have a deep 
collaboration with Solstice. Both 
organisations are remarkably 
well aligned in terms of skills, 
culture, ambition and delivery 
model. The cross-fertilisation of 
knowledge in working practices, 
new technologies, partnership 
arrangements with technology 
providers and organisational 
structure have contributed 
significantly to growth in both 
companies over the past year.”
J Schwan, CEO and founder 
of Solstice, adds: “We blend 
resources with TAB so utilisation 
improves considerably for 
both businesses. People have 
transferred temporarily and 
permanently. They gain travel, 
career and life experience while 
delivering a project, and there are 
tangible business benefits too.”
Work for Electrolux exemplifies 
this collaborative approach.  
The global white goods business 
had a strong desire to begin 
connecting its products to provide 
next-generation services, and 
sought a digital innovation partner.
Electrolux had a mobile 
application for its latest air 
conditioner, and together with 
Solstice, determined that voice 
control was a compelling platform 
for users – specifically on/off 
functionality and temperature. 
Solstice recommended using 
Amazon Alexa and Google Home 
voice platforms and partnered 
with TAB to bring together voice 
development experts. 
The team and Electrolux created 
a roadmap for voice experiences, 
starting with a first-of-its-kind 
Amazon Alexa Smart Home Skill 
for the Frigidaire Gallery Cool 
Connect Smart Window Air 
Conditioner. 
Phase two consisted of building 
a companion Google Assistant 
Action for use on Google Home 
for the same air conditioner. 
Electrolux customers can now ask 
Alexa or Google Home to turn 
their air conditioner on, increase 
the temperature, set fan speeds 
and change modes.

STRATEGY IN ACTION CONTINUED
Acquisition continued
When St Ives acquired Solstice 
in 2015, the Chicago-based 
business was firmly established as 
a mobile specialist. Fast-forward 
two years and the company has 
harnessed the full spectrum of 
digital innovation services to 
great effect.
Founder and CEO J Schwan 
speaks of a “positive” 
financial year just gone, with 
significant revenue growth. This 
performance has been consistent 
across Solstice’s three pillars: 
reimagining digital customer 
interaction; digital product and 
service innovation for clients; and 
streamlining digital operations.
Schwan explains: “Dropping 
the mobile specialism is a big 
change for us. To solve more 
pressing strategic problems, we 
couldn’t constrain ourselves to 
one channel. Every organisation 
is rethinking what it gives its 
customers; be that a consumer-
facing company considering 
experiences around the Internet  
of Things, or a business-to-
business firm automating 
low-value tasks to free up staff 
for higher-value roles. We’ve 
broadened our focus to digital 
innovation and it’s paying off.”
The change has been a catalyst to 
larger, multichannel engagements, 
allowing Solstice to continue to 
invest in meeting the challenges 
of new consumer and technology 
trends. “We’re engineers, not 
scientists,” continues Schwan. 
“We take platforms built by tech 
companies and adapt them to 
bring new capabilities to market.”
He cites a push into conversational 
user experience tools and 
artificial intelligence as two 
prime examples of expanding 
Solstice’s services. “These are not 
novelty projects, but significant 
investments by large companies 
to leverage artificial intelligence 
(‘AI’) as an additional way to 
service customers while reducing 
internal costs. Customers want  
to be able to interact with brands 
 in a more natural way through  
their devices: voice, chat,  
text, messaging.”
Solstice is also leading the way  
in helping vast organisations deal 
with legacy systems which can 
trap untapped value in databases. 
Schwan says: “We’re solving the 
problem with Pivotal, a software 
partner, to help businesses 
modernise development 
capabilities. This is a high-growth 
area for us, too. We’re working on 
the whole stack, which is another 
compelling reason for using 
Solstice to solve big problems.”
J SCHWAN
Founder and CEO of Solstice
One key operational change 
has been the promotion of Kelly 
Manthey to Chief Strategy Officer, 
allowing Schwan to spend time 
devising ways for the business 
to collaborate with others across 
the Group. “We’ve been working 
much more closely with other 
Group businesses during the last 
year. St Ives is very supportive 
and has provided the investment 
needed for the growth we’re 
achieving; we couldn’t have done 
that alone,” he concludes.

In a market flooded with new 
entrants, mobile services provider 
The App Business (‘TAB’) is  
finding there’s no substitute  
for experience.
Seven years after launching,  
and following its acquisition by  
St Ives in early 2016, the company 
boasts a market-leading range 
of capabilities. It’s this breadth 
of expertise that has led to 
some major client engagements 
– Transport for London, Tesco, 
Kingfisher and Unilever to  
name just a few – and growth  
of more than 20% across the 
previous year.
Co-founder Rob Evans believes 
that the journey from start-up to 
established business continues 
to help TAB stand out from the 
crowd. He explains: “We’ve been 
specialising in mobile strategy, 
design and development for 
seven years. We built a world-
class mobile capability of our 
own from the ground up. The 
experience of doing that allows us 
to be more of a strategic partner 
than just a delivery partner for  
our clients.
“As mobile becomes central to  
all organisations’ future 
prosperity, they can’t risk 
outsourcing all the work and 
knowledge to a third party. They 
need to build some capability 
of their own, and the unique 
experience of doing this for 
ourselves is both attractive  
and impossible to copy.”
Evans’ co-founder Daniel 
Joseph further illustrates the 
differentiation enjoyed by TAB: 
“Our competitors are either large 
consultancies that have acquired 
ROB EVANS AND DANIEL JOSEPH
Co-founders of The App Business
and mashed together services, or 
smaller companies that don’t have 
our scale and experience. Our 
model is unique.”
The founders believe mobility 
is now fundamental to all 
organisations, from developing 
and overseeing customer 
relationships, to managing and 
motivating staff. Increasingly, this 
is allowing TAB to build longer-
term relationships with clients as 
they seek to change for a mobile 
future. Evans adds: “We’re being 
asked to build digital capability 
alongside innovative products, 
which leads to more interesting 
consultative work and a solid 
income base for us.”
Many sectors have a need for 
TAB’s services, but Joseph 
believes two in particular will be 
a focus for the current financial 
year. He says: “Financial 
services is investing heavily in 
technology. Many companies 
feel behind the curve, with new 
banks like Monzo taking share. 
We recently won two large 
clients in the sector, and we 
believe that a combination of 
the Group’s deep expertise and 
existing relationships, combined 
with our specialist financial 
services mobile experience, 
provides a huge opportunity. 
We’re similarly excited about 
leveraging retail and automotive 
relationships across the Group.”

Internationalisation
The Group’s horizons continue 
to expand. Strategic Marketing 
revenues from international 
client work rose to 39% in 
the most recently completed 
financial year, increasing 
from 37% in the previous 
year’s results. St Ives now 
boasts a truly international 
footprint, with offices in New 
York, Chicago, San Francisco, 
Buenos Aires, Singapore and 
Shanghai, supplementing our 
London headquarters and 
other locations across the UK.
This multi-territory presence 
means we are able to operate 
in-market with a dedicated 
local team, through a ‘boots 
on the ground’ approach  
co-ordinated from a 
centralised hub. This will 
give us a firm foundation for 
continued overseas growth 
as well as the ability to open 
new offices when client 
opportunities arise.
Wildlife Reserves Singapore 
(‘WRS’), an organisation dedicated 
to the management of world-
leading zoological institutions, 
was seeking to find ways to 
increase visitor numbers. WRS’ 
four main attractions welcome 
more than 4.5 million people  
per year, but the cost of 
maintaining and developing  
the reserves meant a revenue 
boost was required.
Digital engagement was one of 
the key pillars being explored 
to increase engagement and 
footfall. However, there was 
an issue around the lack of 
availability of insight detailing the 
current customer journey or the 
experience of tourists and local 
people who interacted with WRS.
 
Incite was engaged to help 
WRS understand more about 
people’s journeys when they 
visited an attraction. The 
consultancy devised ethnographic 
‘walkalongs’, in which they 
accompanied both local residents 
and tourists from countries 
including China, Indonesia, 
Philippines, India, Malaysia and 
Australia. This allowed the Incite 
team to fully immerse in the guest 
journey and discover people’s 
requirements, while considering 
what was missing from the visitor 
experience. 
The ethnographic study 
unveiled cultural and 
behavioural differences, and 
was supplemented with group 
discussions to capture pre- and 
post-visit nuances. Incite was able 
to determine visitor personae 
along with clear opportunities to 
enhance the experience. The work 
was followed by a workshop to 
devise creative ideas.
Thanks to Incite’s strategy, WRS 
has identified opportunities across 
stakeholder teams including 
marketing, digital, retail, sales, 
education, and research and 
development.

Travel Counsellors, a global 
network of more than 1,600 
independent travel experts, 
provide a uniquely personal travel 
service. In a technology-enabled 
world, they face the challenge 
of delivering personalised 
communications with all the 
benefits of marketing technology 
and automation, without 
sacrificing the personal feel  
of human interaction.
Response One was appointed 
to help Travel Counsellors with 
this challenge. The data experts 
proposed a new strategy that 
promised: a single customer view, 
providing the client’s marketing 
team with greater data visibility; 
analytics, allowing campaigns 
to be created based on deep 
customer insight; a Customer 
Relationship Management (‘CRM’)
platform for running personalised, 
triggered campaigns; and CRM 
consultancy, including a redesign 
of the customer journey and the 
development of concepts into 
powerful marketing campaigns.
Response One spent many hours 
building its understanding of 
Travel Counsellors, its challenges 
and its data, working as a true 
partner. This allowed the project 
team to be fluid, reacting to 
new challenges and ideas from 
the client. For example, the 
Preference Centre, which began 
as a small project on the side, 
developed into a cornerstone 
of the new marketing strategy. 
Response One managed the 
design and build of the online 
form, allowing customers to 
specify their travel preferences. 
Data is now fed into the CRM 
platform, where it influences 
campaigns and prompts 
information on individuals’ 
requirements to the brand’s 
customer advisers.
Following a successful launch in 
the UK, Response One and Travel 
Counsellors are now rolling out 
the service to Australia, Ireland, 
The Netherlands, South Africa and 
United Arab Emirates, tailoring 
the systems and strategy to  
each market.

The Group prepares Adjusted 
results, which, in management’s 
view reflect how the business 
is managed and show the 
performance in a manner 
consistent with the previous 
year. Adjusted results exclude 
items such as costs related 
to restructuring activities, 
acquisitions made in prior periods, 
disposal of sites, impairment 
charges, movement in deferred 
consideration and St Ives Defined 
Benefits Pension Scheme charges. 
The Group’s statutory loss  
before tax of £44.1 million  
(2016 – £5.7 million) includes 
Adjusting Items of £68.2 million 
(2016 – £36.1 million), of which 
£66.1 million relates to non-cash 
items in the current period. 
Net debt reduced 
by £26 million
STRATEGIC REPORT  
FINANCIAL REVIEW
The analysis of Adjusting Items is 
set out in table B above.
A non-cash impairment charge  
of £2.9 million was recorded  
in the Books segment against  
non-current assets and  
inventories due to the loss  
of the HarperCollins contract. 
Impairment charges of  
£29.9 million were recorded 
against the goodwill and non-
current assets of businesses within 
the Marketing Activation segment. 
This reflects the continued decline 
in operating profits and expected 
future growth rates resulting from 
lower promotional activity levels 
within the grocery retail sector.  
In addition, an impairment charge 
of £0.3 million was recorded 
against intangible assets of the 
Data businesses for obsolete 
software. The Group recorded a 
total non-cash impairment charge 
of £33.1 million during the period. 
Further details can be found in 
note 7 on page 93.
Other non-cash Adjusting Items 
include contingent consideration 
required to be treated as 
remuneration of £15.6 million, an 
increase in deferred consideration 
of £7.4 million and amortisation 
of acquired intangibles of 
£10.0 million.
Revenue from our Strategic Marketing 
segment increased by 13% as a result 
of both strong organic and acquisitive 
growth.
Overview 
During a challenging year, the 
Group delivered revenue growth 
of 7%. Due to continued margin 
pressures within the legacy 
Marketing Activation and Books 
segments, the Group’s Adjusted 
operating profit fell from  
£33.3 million to £27.1 million. 
However, over this period the 
Board has worked to strengthen 
the Group’s balance sheet by 
cutting the proposed dividend 
by 75% compared to the prior 
year, and selling three surplus 
properties.
The Group’s statutory results are 
set out in table A above.

Revenue
The 7% (£25.6 million) increase in 
revenue included organic constant 
currency growth of 4%; acquisition 
growth of 2% and a 1% positive 
currency translation impact. Over 
the course of the full year, revenue 
grew by 5% in the first half and 
9% in the second half. Organic 
revenue growth at constant 
currency was 0.2% in the first half 
and particularly strong growth 
of 7% in the second half, within 
the Group’s Strategic Marketing 
segment. 
Revenue generated from the 
Group’s overseas business 
increased from £53.7 million to 
£66.5 million over the financial 
year, representing 17% of Group 
revenues (2016 – 15%).
Revenue from our Strategic 
Marketing segment increased from 
£144.1 million to £163.0 million 
with organic growth contributing 
5%; acquisition growth of 4% 
and currency translation of 4%. 
Compared to the comparative 
period last year, first half organic 
revenue growth was subdued at 
3% as the impact of the cancelled 
work in fourth quarter of FY16 
took longer to replace than 
anticipated. Conversely, second 
half organic growth compared to  CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT OUR FIGURES
21 St Ives plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
the comparative period was 13%  
as new clients and projects started 
to generate additional revenue. 
Revenue from the Marketing 
Activation segment decreased 
marginally from £154.8 million to 
£153.7 million, primarily as a result 
of reduced client spend within the 
retail grocery market. The revenue 
impact was mitigated somewhat 
by the segment’s strategy of 
diversification into new areas such 
as food and leisure, while the UK 
general election also provided a 
one-off boost to revenue.
Revenue from the Books segment, 
in contrast to recent years, proved 
to be resilient during the financial 
year, increasing by 12% from  
£68.6 million to £76.5 million. 
However, following the conclusion 
of our print and distribution 
contract with HarperCollins in  
June 2017, we expect the non-
renewal to result in a reduction  
of approximately £11 million in 
Group revenue, and £3.5 million  
in Group Adjusted operating 
profit, in the financial year ending  
3 August 2018.
Adjusted gross profit 
margin and underlying 
profitability
The Adjusted operating profit 
decreased from £33.3 million  
(9% of revenue) to £27.1 million 
(7% of revenue).
Adjusted operating profit in the 
Strategic Marketing segment has 
increased from £19.4 million to 
£20.2 million with an operating 
margin of 12% (2016 – 13%). This 
includes a full year contribution 
from The App Business (‘TAB’).  
The first half contributed  
£6.2 million with a margin of 8% 
compared to the second half 
of £14.0 million at a margin of 
16%. The first half margin was 
detrimentally impacted by our 
decision to broadly maintain our 
skilled workforce, following project 
cancellations and deferrals in the 
fourth quarter of the prior year,  
in anticipation of new client  
and contract wins. Second half 
margin improved as these  
new clients and contracts  
delivered revenue without the 
requirement to substantially 
increase manpower costs. 
Adjusted operating profit in the 
Marketing Activation segment 
decreased from £8.1 million to 
£4.3 million with an operating 
margin of 3% (2016 – 5%). Despite 
the actions taken to consolidate 
sites to aid further restructuring 
and client diversification, margin 
has continued to be adversely 
impacted as the grocery retailers 
reduced their print spend. 
Adjusted operating profit in the 
Books segment decreased from 
£5.8 million to £2.6 million with  
an operating margin of 3%  
(2016 – 9%). Reduced run 
lengths and an increase in orders 
continued to impact margin.  
The loss of the HarperCollins 
contract from 1 July 2017 has 
resulted in a number of headcount 
reductions and redundancy  
costs of £2.9 million which are  
recorded as Adjusting Items.  
The restructuring was completed 
at the end of July 2017. 
Acquisitions
Although no acquisitions were 
made during the year, Solstice and 
TAB remain within their earn-out 
periods. Solstice’s final earn-out 
period is the calendar year ending 
31 December 2017 with TAB’s 
final period being 1 May 2017 
to 30 April 2018. TAB’s second 
deferred consideration, which was 
dependent on incremental EBITDA, 
has been agreed. Subsequent to 
the year end, a cash payment of 
£2.2 million and the issue of a loan 
note of £1.6 million were made to 
settle the deferred consideration. 
The loan note is exercisable six 
months after issue. The Group 
exercised its option to pay all of 
the deferred consideration in cash 
or loan notes rather than by the 
issuing of shares.
The Group has reassessed the 
likely extent of any further deferred 
consideration payments to the 
previous shareholders of Solstice 
and TAB. The amount of deferred 
consideration payable, based upon 
their budgets and latest forecasts, 
is set out in table C above.
The expected timings of the 
cash element of the deferred 
consideration payments are 
detailed in table D above.

Tax
The total tax credit was £0.7 million 
(2016 – charge of £2.4 million).  
A number of Adjusting Items 
are not deductible for taxation 
purposes.
The Group’s effective tax rate on 
the Adjusted profit before tax was 
20.7% (2016 – 20.8%) compared to 
the standard rate of tax of 24.0%
(2016 – 22.7%) for the Group.  
The Adjusted tax charge was  
£ 5.0 million (2016 – £6.3 million).
A net income tax of £0.6 million 
(2016 – £4.3 million) was paid in 
the UK, which included payments 
of £3.3 million in respect of 2016 
and 2017 financial periods, partially 
offset by refunds of £2.7 million in 
respect of prior periods. 
Dividend
The Board is recommending  
a final dividend of 1.30 pence per 
ordinary share (2016 – 5.45 pence)  
giving a total dividend of  
1.95 pence (2016 – 7.80 pence). 
The dividend is covered 6.9 times 
by Adjusted earnings and will be 
paid on 18 December 2017 to 
shareholders on the register  
at 24 November 2017, with  
an ex-dividend date of  
23 November 2017. 
Pensions
The Group closed its Defined 
Benefits Pension Scheme (the 
‘Scheme’) to new members in 
2002 and ceased future accrual 
within the Scheme in 2008. 
The Group accounts for post-
retirement benefits in accordance 
with IAS 19 Employee Benefits. 
The Consolidated Balance Sheet 
reflects the net deficit on the 
Scheme at 28 July 2017 based  
on the market value of the assets 
at that date and the valuation  
of liabilities using AA non-gilt 
bond yields.
On an IAS 19 basis, the net  
deficit on the Scheme reduced to  
£16.0 million (2016 – £26.4 million) 
before the related deferred tax 
asset. The value of the plan  
assets increased to £354.5 million  
(2016 – £344.1 million). 
Approximately 65% of the  
plan assets are invested in return 
seeking assets providing a  
higher level of return over the 
longer period. Plan liabilities 
remained in line with the  
prior year at £370.5 million  
(2016 – £370.5 million). In 
calculating the amount of plan 
liabilities, an increase in the rate of 
inflation was offset by an increase 
in the discount rate and a fall in the 
rate of increase in life expectancy. 
The Scheme’s actuarial valuation 
reviews determine any cash deficit 
payments by the Group. The 
Scheme’s triennial valuation was as 
at April 2016 and the Group  
has reached agreement with  
the Scheme Trustee for future 
funding levels. The Group will 
make deficit funding contributions 
of £2.6 million per annum  
and a contribution of  
£0.4 million per annum  
(2016 – £0.4 million) towards the 
costs of administration. The total 
increased contribution level to  
£3.0 million will apply from  
April 2016 and, as the funding level 
was maintained at £2.4 million until 
an agreement was reached, the 
contribution in the year to  
3 August 2018 will be £3.8 million 
and thereafter will revert to  
£3.0 million per annum.
The charge for the year for the 
Group’s defined contribution 
schemes was £3.8 million  
(2016 – £3.9 million). 22 St Ives plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Cash flow
Cash generated from  
operations was £30.7 million  
(2016 – £23.7 million).
Total capital expenditure was  
as per table E below.
The Group disposed of three 
surplus properties during the year 
generating cash of £11.9 million 
(£11.7 million, net of all costs). 
Two of the properties together 
generated net income of  
£1.0 million per annum and the 
third property was previously 
occupied by part of SP , our  
point of sale business.
Debt
The Group’s revolving credit 
facility, which expires on 23 March 
2019, remains at £95.0 million and 
was supplemented by a term loan 
of £30.0 million. Subsequent to the 
year end, the Group reduced its 
term loan by £5.5 million to  
£24.5 million.
Net debt decreased during  
the year from £80.8 million to  
£54.6 million. At 28 July 2017,  
St Ives had drawn £80.2 million  
on its bank credit facility, leaving 
an unutilised commitment of  
£44.8 million. The Group had  
cash and cash equivalents of  
£25.7 million. 
At 28 July 2017, the ratio of  
net debt to EBITDA before 
Adjusting Items was 1.61 times  
(2016 – 1.96 times) as shown in  
table F below.

TEAMING UP TO DRIVE MEMORABLE 
CUSTOMER EXPERIENCES FOR JAGUAR 
LAND ROVER
Jaguar Land Rover 
Find out more about Occam:  
www.occam-dm.com
Jaguar Land Rover (‘JLR’) 
needed a better understanding 
of its data to improve Customer 
Relationship Management 
(‘CRM’) and offer premium 
customer experiences. This 
meant integrating a new 
Systems Applications and 
Products (‘SAP’) system,  
so JLR asked St Ives data and 
technology experts at Occam  
to take the wheel.
A broad data selection 
approach across customer 
and prospecting segments 
hadn’t worked for JLR. A more 
nuanced strategy was needed 
to communicate key benefits 
around new product releases. 
Occam was tasked to develop 
the SAP system integration 
that would maximise the 
company’s use of data, creating 
the premium, always-on CRM 
experience its customers 
expected.
Occam enlisted St Ives’ sister 
businesses Amaze One and 
Response One to turn 20 
existing data systems into ‘one 
version of the truth’, shaping 
JLR’s data into a single customer 
view. This consolidated 
approach makes understanding 
and engaging customers easier 
to implement.
The SAP implementation drove 
the launch of the Range Rover 
Velar. The new platform allowed 
the partner agencies and JLR 
to operate core CRM principles 
required in data profiling and 
targeting to avoid audience 
cannibalisation, which was a  
real risk.
Meanwhile, by formulating a 
targeting landscape of the Velar’s 
exact positioning in the range, 
as well as a focus on relevant 
customer journeys, the agencies 
provided clear direction to JLR 
such as engagement profiling 
and post-campaign analysis. 
More customers were converted 
from consideration to purchase 
among key target segments 
thanks to deep dives into the 
subtleties of audience profiling, 
boosting engagement and sales.
JLR’s CRM management and 
the definition of CRM strategy 
has changed for the better 
thanks to the SAP system. For 
the first time, JLR is working 
from a single customer view, 
creating real-time simplicity, 
efficiency and engagement, 
from campaigns to invoicing. 
This approach helped to define 
the strategic direction of vehicle 
launches in 2017, setting a 
template for future activity.

Risk management
Reviewing risk across the Group
STRATEGIC REPORT  
PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES
The Board is responsible for carrying 
out a robust assessment of the principal 
risks facing the Group, including those 
threatening its ability to achieve its 
business model, strategic objectives, 
solvency and liquidity. On behalf of the 
Board, the Audit Committee reviews 
the effectiveness of the Group’s risk 
management processes.
The Group’s risk management 
framework is discussed on  
page 34. A Group Risk Register 
is reviewed and debated by the 
Board and Audit Committee 
twice-yearly, abetted by a further 
open discussion on business risks 
at the Board’s annual strategy 
day. The Group Risk Register 
includes risks that are specific to 
St Ives plc, the holding company, 
such as corporate financing, and 
risks escalated from the risk 
registers of individual subsidiaries 
where they might have a 
material effect on the Group 
as a whole. Risks at subsidiary 
level are further considered by 
the Executive Directors during 
quarterly presentations by 
each operating business. The 
presentations include an update 
on the forecast, current market 
conditions, strategic direction and 
a SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, 
opportunities and threats) analysis 
provided annually.
The longer-term viability of the 
Group has been assessed by the 
Board over a three-year period 
during the year. Details of this 
review are on page 63.
Risk appetite
The Board has reviewed its risk 
appetite in different areas of the 
business during the year. Risk 
appetite relates to the degree  
of risk the Group is willing to take 
or accept to achieve its strategic 
objectives. It is a key consideration 
in decision-making across the 
Group and helps to define the 
mitigating activities required to 
manage risks.
The Board seeks to minimise health, 
safety, liquidity and reputational 
risks and thereby has a particularly 
low risk appetite in these areas. 
Rigorous health and safety policies 
Risk rating key
 HIGH
 MEDIUM
 LOW
Risk level change key
and procedures are in place and 
monitored by the Group Health 
Safety and Environmental Advisor. 
For liquidity risk, the Group has 
detailed procedures for monitoring 
headroom in its bank facility and 
the associated leverage and 
interest cover covenants. The 
investments in material foreign 
subsidiaries are hedged by drawing 
on the Group’s bank facility in the 
same foreign currency. In other 
aspects, such as the securing of 
longer-term contracts in parts of 
the Group to facilitate growth and 
scalability, the Board takes a more 
balanced approach on risk taking. 
This degree of appetite is aided 
by the level of experience gained 
by the Group within its operating 
segments and the Group’s 
controls and processes such as its 
delegated authorities. Thus, the 
Board has accepted a managed 
risk profile, whilst attempting to 
mitigate risks effectively, as it seeks 
to deliver its strategic goals. 
The risk appetite of the Group 
across its principal risks was not 
altered materially during the 
year after consideration by the 
Board. The Board will continue to 
assess its risk appetite annually in 
light of changes to the economic 
environment, strategic progress and 
the performance of the businesses.
Principal Risks and 
Uncertainties
The table opposite details the 
Group’s principal risks and the 
key mitigating activities in place 
to address them. It is recognised 
that the Group is exposed to 
risks wider than those listed. The 
risks disclosed are ones believed 
to have the greatest impact on 
the business at this point in time 
and which have been debated at 
recent Board or Audit Committee 
meetings.
A risk rating from low to high has 
been incorporated for both the 
inherent risks and the residual risks 
by considering both the impact 
and the likelihood of each risk.  
The inherent risk rating is 
measured before taking into 
account mitigating actions 
whereas residual risk ratings 
are after these mitigations have 
been factored in. The changes in 
the risk ratings from the Board’s 
assessment in the prior year have 
been highlighted as well as any 
new key risks that have been 
added to the register during  
the year.
Where applicable the relevant 
growth drivers from the Group’s 
business model (see page 5)  
have been attributed to each 
principal risk.

Acquisition strategy
Acquisitions may not 
fit in to the Group’s 
strategic direction 
and may fail to deliver 
growth and successful 
integration as a result.
  
As businesses are 
acquired as part of 
the Group’s strategic 
objectives to grow its 
Strategic Marketing 
segment, it is fundamental 
to identify businesses  
that will enhance the 
Group’s capabilities. 
No acquisitions were made 
during the course of the year.  
As a result, and whilst 
acquisitions remain a strategic 
objective in the medium term, 
the inherent risk rating is lower 
than in the prior year. 
Stringent selection criteria 
followed for pursuing 
acquisitions that fit within 
the Group’s strategy and 
culture. Detailed due diligence 
undertaken using external 
advisers. Board strategic 
reviews held annually to monitor 
progress against the business 
model and to, as necessary, 
refresh and adapt the Group’s 
strategy for delivering growth. 
Meetings held with senior 
management of the subsidiaries 
to determine cross-selling 
opportunities.
Organic growth
Organic growth, 
including overseas 
expansion, may 
not be pursued in 
the right sectors or 
territories.
 
Investing in the wrong 
sectors or territories 
could result in significant 
incremental costs to  
the Group.
Organic growth is a key 
strategic objective for the 
business and the risk factors 
involved are considered to be 
consistent with the prior year 
in view of those territories that 
have been targeted.
Regular discussion of strategy  
at Board meetings and 
meetings of representatives 
from the businesses to develop 
the Group’s proposition, growth 
opportunities and collaborative 
behaviour. Detailed budgets 
and three-year plans submitted 
to the Board for review.
Scalability
Strategic Marketing 
businesses may not 
have sufficient scale 
within their sectors 
to secure substantial 
customer contracts.
 
Achieving scalability is 
important within Digital, 
Data and Insight in order 
to pursue a high-growth 
strategy. Whilst included 
as a risk, achieving  
greater scalability  
is also an opportunity  
for the Group.
This risk has been added  
as a key risk to the Group during  
the year following discussion 
by the Board on driving further 
organic growth.
Whilst the residual risk has  
also been assessed as medium, 
the Board is encouraged by  
the progress made within  
Digital during the second  
half of the year in achieving 
greater scalability and with  
the current trajectory.
Collaboration by businesses 
such as working on joint pitches. 
Organic growth of businesses 
through recruitment drives 
and opening of new offices. 
Bringing businesses closer 
together under a single senior 
management team (such as 
in Data) to achieve a greater 
combined scalable offering. 
Investment in high-growth 
Strategic Marketing businesses 
and greater focus on securing 
longer-term contracts.
Legacy businesses
Issues arising within 
Marketing Activation 
and Books may 
distract or inhibit the 
Board’s focus on its 
strategic objectives.
 
This could, in the short 
term, impact the growth 
within the Strategic 
Marketing segment if the 
Board encounters issues 
that emerge in other parts 
of the Group.
This risk rating has been 
increased following the further 
decline in Marketing Activation 
led by the grocery sector and 
the loss of the HarperCollins 
contract in Books. Cost 
mitigation has been undertaken.
Consolidation of businesses 
and management within the 
Marketing Activation segment 
has created greater synergies 
with a senior management 
team across the segment 
that oversees each of the 
subsidiaries. Diversification 
away from the grocery retail.

Economy
Challenging economic 
conditions may inhibit 
growth and create 
uncertainty.
 
Uncertainty in the 
economy largely 
associated with Brexit, 
could result in marketing 
campaigns or projects 
being cancelled or 
deferred at short notice. 
Whilst the Group does 
have long-term contracts 
with clients, the level of 
spend is predominantly 
at the client’s discretion 
rather than being derived 
from guaranteed sales 
volumes.
This risk rating was increased 
during the prior year due to the 
degree of uncertainty in the 
economy, partly impacted  
by Brexit. The Board’s view is 
that the risk remains the same.
Diversification into markets 
that are capable of delivering 
profit growth with an increasing 
range of marketing companies. 
Diversification through growth 
in the US and opportunities 
pursued to open overseas 
offices, where client demand 
warrants it. Investment in a 
wider range of services offered 
to clients. A continual review of 
the Group’s cost base. Secure 
more long-term relationships 
and contracts. Seek to increase 
market share by investing in 
sophisticated and targeted 
sales lead generation. A 
regular review of performance 
of all businesses against their 
budgets and implementation  
of timely remedial action,  
where needed.
Clients
Competitive pressure 
that may result in the 
loss of a key client.
 
The Group has a variety 
of key clients in each of its 
three business segments. 
Long-term relationships 
have been fostered with 
many of these clients over 
a number of years.
Whilst the financial impact of 
these key contracts has not 
increased, the likelihood of the 
risk, and hence the risk rating, 
has risen due to a greater 
appetite seen for clients to carry 
out full tenders, particularly in 
the Marketing Activation and 
Books segments.
Encourage collaborative 
behaviour across the Group’s 
businesses and create a 
commitment to cross-selling 
that will distinguish the Group’s 
marketing offering from its 
competitors’. Achieve or exceed 
service level agreements with 
clients. Broaden our capabilities, 
providing marketing solutions 
in support of our clients’ 
marketing strategies. Avoid 
over-reliance on any single 
client. Implement bespoke 
propositions for securing the 
renewal of key client contracts, 
providing Group support where 
appropriate. Conduct client 
satisfaction surveys.
Employees
A failure to attract, 
develop and retain 
employees with the 
necessary talent for 
our businesses.
  
Retaining staff is a key 
priority for the Group  
as it continues to invest  
in new and existing  
service-orientated 
businesses.
This risk rating is consistent with 
the prior year.
Implement appraisals and fulfil 
training needs where identified. 
Develop a collaborative culture 
across the Group’s businesses. 
Operate discretionary share-
based incentive schemes, 
and other benefits. Pay part 
of consideration in shares to 
vendor directors of acquired 
businesses, with ‘lock-in’ 
obligations.

Financing
The Group’s ability 
to trade may be 
compromised by lack 
of cash funds.
 
Being able to finance 
working capital and  
carry out operations  
is fundamental to  
the Group.
This inherent risk is consistent 
with prior years. The bank 
facility runs up to 23 March 
2019; further details are 
provided on page 104.
Following the January 2017 
trading update, the residual  
risk rating was increased from 
low to medium at the half year.  
The risk has since been further 
mitigated by the disposal  
of two freehold properties  
for net proceeds totalling  
£9.8 million, resulting in the 
leverage covenant reducing  
to 1.6 at the year end  
(see page 112).
Conduct ‘going concern’ 
reviews and longer-term viability 
assessments twice yearly. 
Continually monitor the Group’s 
performance against its banking 
covenants. Undertake monthly 
reviews of working capital, cash 
forecasts and headroom on 
banking covenants. Periodically 
review the Group’s financial KPIs 
with its bankers.
Pension Scheme
The volatility of the  
St Ives Defined 
Benefits Pension 
Scheme (the 
‘Scheme’) deficit.
The volatility of the 
Scheme’s deficit is 
impacted by the inflation 
rate, changes in the 
discount rate derived from 
gilt yields and changes 
in actuarial assumptions, 
such as mortality.
This risk rating associated with 
the Scheme’s deficit remains 
high. The deficit had increased 
in recent years primarily due to 
low interest rates.
As at 28 July 2017, the deficit 
has reduced due to a higher 
level of return on the  
Scheme’s assets.
Agree deficit recovery plan with 
the Pension Scheme Trustee. 
Regularly engage the Trustee 
Directors in discussions on the 
Group’s performance. Manage 
possible Section 75 debts 
arising from business disposals 
and closures. Contribute to 
discussions on the Scheme’s 
investment strategy. Proactively 
seek to limit the growth in the 
pension liability.
Reputational
Exposure to 
reputational or 
financial damage 
due to accident, 
unethical trading, 
non-compliance 
with legislation 
or regulation or 
disputes.
Health and safety is  
a pre-eminent priority 
for the Board and is 
discussed at each  
Board meeting.
Other reputational risks 
need to be carefully 
managed as part of the 
Group’s governance 
procedures.
This risk rating is consistent 
with the prior year, reflecting 
the Board’s assessment of the 
associated risk impact.
Ingrain robust health and safety 
culture throughout the Group, 
supported by rigorous health 
and safety and environmental 
policies. Monitor compliance, 
measure performance and 
investigate major incidents. 
Monitor changes in legislation 
and regulations, take legal 
advice and provide training 
where necessary. Place a strong 
emphasis on compliance 
with local taxation rules by 
embedding the Group’s 
processes and procedures. 
Apply the Group’s policies 
on Ethical Trading, Share 
Dealing, Equal Opportunities, 
Dignity at Work and Whistle-
blowing. Have in place 
business continuity plans and 
a procedure for dealing with 
‘leaks’ of inside information.
Data security
Exposure to 
reputational or 
financial damage due 
to corruption or theft 
of company owned or 
client-owned data or 
data breaches arising.
This includes the risk of 
loss of data, sabotage or 
disruption to the business, 
fraud, reputation damage, 
and possible fines.
This risk was added as a key risk 
for the Group in the prior year 
due to, in part, the new General 
Data Protection Regulation 
(‘GDPR’) coming into effect  
in May 2018.
IT functions in place around 
the Group with responsibility to 
protect data (e.g. encryption, 
firewalls, restricted access). 
Periodic reviews by Internal 
Audit, utilising in-house IT 
as well as specialist external 
consultants. Cyber security and 
IT questionnaires completed 
periodically by subsidiaries to 
highlight areas of potential risk,

actions performed in order to 
address this risk. The appointment

STRATEGIC REPORT  
CORPORATE AND SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY
The App Business Limited 
(‘TAB’), St Ives’ UK-based mobile 
solutions company, is passionate 
about promoting its employees’ 
wellbeing and accelerating their 
career progression.
Recently, the business has 
focussed on addressing mental 
health awareness, collaborating 
with mental health charity, Mind, 
in order to provide training 
to TAB’s HR team and line 
managers. Half-day sessions, 
facilitated by trained therapists, 
gave attendees advice on how 
to support an employee or 
colleague who may be struggling 
with mental health, along 
with useful tips on emotional 
intelligence and resilience in  
the workplace.
Additionally, TAB is partnering 
with CALM – the Campaign 
Against Living Miserably – to 
raise £15,000 in support of the 
charity’s national Healthy Mind 
campaign. CALM is dedicated to 
fighting depression and suicide 
amongst men. Fundraising 
activities to date include weekly 
social events for staff, film nights 
and sporting events, including 
sponsored participation in Virgin 
Sport’s British 10k run and the 
organisation of an intercompany 
football tournament in London. 
Working at the cutting edge 
of technology, nurturing and 
developing the careers of its 
employees is critical to TAB’s 
continued growth. With this 
in mind, TAB has recently 
experimented with updating its 
approach to career development. 
One such trial includes the ‘Career 
Zoom Out’ – a programme that 
encourages every employee to use 
the Kata model to set and drive 
incremental steps to achieving 
their goals with line managers and 
mentors. Brett Thornton, Strategy 
Lead at TAB, commented: “The 
‘Career Zoom Out’ pushed me  
to think holistically about my  
long-term aspirations, and how I 
can achieve them at TAB. The Kata 
framework provided an easy way 
to design and run small personal 
development experiments, which 
are already paying dividends for 
me and for TAB.”
Two further initiatives also 
support employees’ ongoing 
skills development. The first is 
‘TAB Talks’, which invites leading 
external speakers in technology 
and product design to share their 
experience and latest thinking.  
The second initiative supports 
on-the-job learning, with bite-sized 
‘Lunch and Learn’ talks by staff. 
These have included an Internet  
of Things workshop and a guide  
to iOS programming for  
non-technical staff.
The business believes it is 
important to highlight and 
celebrate the thought and 
consideration that TAB employees 
put into their products every  
day. To do this, TAB has  
rolled out ‘Product Stories’ –  
a multidisciplinary initiative that 
sees the whole business come 
together in order to ‘zoom’ 
Sustainable and  
responsible business
into the powerful details 
and subtleties that turn a 
new product from good to 
great. ‘Product Stories’ cover 
everything from custom 
iconography and motion design, 
through to system architecture 
and low-level optimisation. 
TAB’s Strategic Marketing Lead, 
Emily Maginess, commented: 
“‘Product Stories’ surface and 
celebrate the craft and care that 
goes into the smallest detail. 
These are details that users may 
never notice explicitly – but they 
affect how users feel, and unlock 
value, build trust and create 
delight in the mobile experience. 
It’s been a mind-blowing 
reminder of the technical skill 
level and experience across 
every discipline of TAB, and 
continues to deepen my sense of 
understanding and pride in the 
exceptional work we deliver.”
TAB continues to explore 
innovative ways to increase 
the business’s corporate social 
responsibility and is committed 
to the welfare and ongoing 
development of its people.

religion or belief. Employees who 
become disabled during their 
working life will be retained in 
employment wherever possible and 
will be given help with necessary 
rehabilitation and retraining. 
Wherever practicable, the Group will 
modify procedures or equipment 
so that full use can be made of 
an individual’ s ability. The Group 
promotes staff wellbeing. Initiatives 
across the Group range from mental 
health training, as discussed on page 
28, to in-house yoga classes.
What we are doing
The Group seeks to pay 
its employees competitive 
remuneration packages and 
incentives. We operate a Dignity at 
Work Policy to ensure that the Group 
provides a working environment free 
from harassment and bullying, and 
where employees do not behave in  
a manner which may be offensive  
to others.
By gender, the Group’ s employees 
are made up of 2,184 males  
and 1,036 females (68% and 32%  
of employees respectively)  
(2016 – 2,217 and 1,029, 68% and 
32%); and its senior management  
is made up of 66 males and 32 
females (67% and 33% of senior 
management respectively)  
(2016 – 60 and 31, 66% and 34%). 
The Board is currently made up of six 
males (86%) and one female (14%).
Employees are regularly consulted 
by local managers and kept 
informed of matters affecting them 
and the overall development of 
the Group. This is supplemented 
by regular emails and other 
communications from the Chief 
Executive on how the Group is 
performing, plans for the future  
and how individuals can contribute 
to achieving the Group’ s aims. 
Details of the Group’ s pension 
schemes are set out in note 27  
to the financial statements. 
How we are performing
We measure: gender split, overall, 
within senior management and at 
Board level; voluntary employee 
turnover; sickness absence 
and absence from work due to 
accidents or work-related illness. 
Each subsidiary applies appraisal 
systems relevant to their business 
and identifies training needs and 
wellbeing initiatives, as they arise.
Charitable donations
In addition to focusing on one or two 
themes, such as mental health, or 
projects each year, the Group favours 
making donations to a broad range 
of charities. Donations are usually 
made in cash but may include the 
provision of time and materials to 
provide added-value services for 
charities. 
What we are doing
The Group supports charities in 
three ways: by setting and then 
donating an annual budget to 
charities serving communities in 
which the Group operates or to 
which employees or clients have a 
particular affinity; matching the total 
contribution made by the Chairman 
from foregoing a proportion of his 
fees and supporting fundraising 
events for charities nominated  
by employees.
How we are performing
During the year the Group made 
donations of varying sums to a wide 
spectrum of charities including: 
Dementia UK, Mind (a mental health 
charity); Prostate Cancer UK; the 
UNCF (an American organisation 
that funds and promotes minority 
education); Crisis UK (the UK’ s 
national charity for homeless 
people); the Back Up Trust (which 
supports people with spinal cord 
injury); the Children’ s Sleep Charity 
and the Lurie Children’ s Hospital  
in Chicago.
Shareholder relations
The Board attaches considerable 
importance to maintaining good 
relationships with shareholders. 
Effective two-way communication 
with institutional shareholders and 
analysts is established through 
regular presentations involving 
the Chief Executive and the Chief 
Financial Officer.
What we are doing
The Board receives an investor 
relations report at each of its regular 
meetings. The Chief Executive and 
the Chief Financial Officer conduct 
bi-annual analysts’ briefings and, 
where appropriate, meet with the 
Company’ s major shareholders 
to further explain the Group’ s 
investment proposition. A number  
of major shareholders have  
accepted the opportunity to  
meet Non-Executive Directors. 
The Group operates a Supplier 
Performance Management 
programme to highlight any areas  
of concern with key suppliers and  
to allow the supplier the opportunity 
to improve their scoring. The 
Group’ s policies and procedures 
are underpinned by a robust audit 
programme, which considers the  
risk and scale of each supplier. Visits  
to suppliers’ production facilities  
are also carried out periodically  
to provide further reassurance.
We are committed to ensuring 
that there is no slavery or human 
trafficking within our supply chains 
and we expect our suppliers to 
adhere to the Modern Slavery Act 
2015 (‘MSA’). We have undertaken 
steps, as far as is reasonable 
and practicable, to ensure the 
requirements of the MSA are 
implemented within our supply 
chain. Our MSA statement can  
be found on our website at  
www.st-ives.co.uk. 
Payment terms granted to clients 
are negotiated according to the 
amount of risk and the financial 
strength of the client concerned. 
It is the Group’ s practice to agree 
payment terms with all suppliers, 
which will be adhered to, provided 
that they perform in accordance with 
the agreed terms. It is a disciplinary 
offence for any employee to breach 
the Group’ s Anti-corruption and 
Bribery Policy.
How we are performing
The average creditor days 
outstanding at 28 July 2017  
for the Group was 79 days  
(2016 – 86 days). The Company 
Secretary maintains a Bribery Risk 
Register which is refreshed annually 
and then reviewed by the Board 
together with a report from the Head 
of Internal Audit and the Company 
Secretary on how the Group’ s Anti-
corruption and Bribery Policy has 
been applied during the year. The 
Internal Audit function will follow  
up on any high-risk areas identified 
from this exercise. 
Our people
All our employees are central to the 
Group’ s success. As at 28 July 2017, 
we employed 3,220 people including 
2,936 full-time and 284 part-time 
employees. The Group is an equal 
opportunities employer and no job 
applicant or employee receives 
less favourable treatment on the 
grounds of age, disability, sex, sexual 
orientation, marital or civil partner 
status, race, colour, nationality, 
Our relationships with 
stakeholders
The Board recognises that, in 
managing the Group’ s activities, 
it has responsibilities to a broad 
range of stakeholders including our 
clients and suppliers, our people, the 
community and our shareholders.  
It also understands the importance 
of corporate social responsibility and 
aims to ensure this is reflected in our 
business practices.
In this report we outline how we 
seek to meet the responsibilities 
mentioned above and measure the 
Group’ s performance, now and in 
the future. The Group has had no 
human rights issues that need to be 
disclosed for an understanding of 
the development, performance or 
position of the Group’ s corporate 
and social responsibility.
Clients and suppliers
In its dealings with clients and 
suppliers, the Group adheres  
to an Ethical Trading Policy. 
What we are doing
All subsidiaries report on how they 
manage their relationships with key 
clients. Their CEO or Managing 
Director, as the case may be, has 
signed up to the Group’ s Anti-
corruption and Bribery Policy which, 
together with the Ethical Trading 
Policy, is publicised to all employees. 
The Group has circulated a new 
Sustainability Policy which was 
introduced during the year.
The Group is committed to building 
strong working relationships with 
its suppliers, ensuring that they 
are aligned on quality, delivery, 
innovation, risk and compliance. 
The Group operates a rigorous 
onboarding process. For 
principal suppliers, this involves 
the completion of an in-depth 
questionnaire covering financials, 
conflicts of interest, insurance and 
other relevant information. They 
are also required to adhere to our 
security standards, quality standards, 
environmental standards, and 
Anti-corruption and Bribery Policy. 
Suppliers are required to 
substantiate their insurances and 
accreditations where applicable, 
and the Group is focussed on 
a continuous programme of 
procurement governance. T o 
facilitate this the Group has invested 
in a suitable e-sourcing platform. 30 St Ives plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
our CO
2
e intensity measure (which 
is grams of CO
2
e per £ of revenue). 
The CO
2
e emissions performance of 
each reporting segment – Strategic 
Marketing, Marketing Activation and 
Books – are also disclosed.
The most significant finding is the 
improvement in the Group’ s intensity 
ratio, which has fallen year-on-year 
by 15% from 40.0  CO
2
e/£ revenue to 
33.9 CO
2
e/£ revenue. This has been 
driven by two simultaneous factors: 
the total revenues for the Group 
have increased by 7% from 2016 to 
2017, and in the same period the 
total carbon emissions for the Group 
has fallen from 14.7 thousand tonnes 
of CO
2
 emissions to 13.3, a reduction 
of 9%. The Group is producing less 
emissions per £ of revenue than  
in 2016.
The most significant driver of change 
in the Group’ s energy profile can be 
found in electricity, which comprises 
79% of the carbon dioxide emitted 
by the Group. This has fallen to 
10,511 tonnes of CO
2
 in 2017 from 
11,636 in 2016, a reduction of 10%. 
This single change is responsible for 
the vast majority of the reduction in 
the Group’ s CO
2
 emissions. There 
has also been a reduction in vehicle 
emissions: the 2017 figure was 1,059 
tonnes of CO
2
 (a reduction of 12% 
from 1,208 in 2016) and in natural 
gas emissions, the 2017 figure was 
660 tonnes of CO
2
 (a reduction of 5% 
from 693 in 2016). These reductions 
in emissions are being driven by 
a combination of technological 
change in the Group’ s manufacturing 
sites (reducing emissions), and 
a portfolio-level diversification 
away from manufacturing towards 
consultancy (driving revenues).
At a segmental level, Books’ 
electricity usage constitutes 60% of 
the Group’ s total electricity (when 
measured in energy usage), with 
almost all of this being driven by the 
site in Bungay. The Bungay site has 
increased electricity consumption 
(in kWh) by 8% year-on-year to 
21,040,999 kWh in 2017. This 
increase is broadly in line with the 
revenue increase in Books during 
the year. The Group’ s electricity 
consumption has increased by 6% to 
29,898,070 kWh in 2017. The impact 
of increased electricity consumption 
has been reduced by a significant 
change to the DEFRA electricity 
conversion factors (from kWh 
to CO
2
). 
The improvements in energy 
efficiency (measured in kWh/£ 
revenue) seen at Books demonstrate 
that the overall improvement to the 
energy intensity ratio observed in 
2017 is not being driven solely by 
How we are performing
The Company’ s top 20 shareholders, 
hold approximately 72% (2016 
– 68%) of the Company’ s issued 
share capital. Those which have an 
obligation to notify the Company of

The Annual General Meeting 
is regarded as an opportunity 
to communicate directly with 
shareholders and the chairs 
of the Audit, Nomination and 
Remuneration Committees will  
each be available at the meeting  
to answer shareholders’ questions. 
Environment
St Ives is committed to continuous 
improvement in its environmental 
performance and accepts that 
its responsibilities with regard to 
environmental protection rank 
equally in importance with other  
key business objectives. The Board 
is responsible for setting the Group’ s 
Environmental Policy and publishes 
an Environmental Statement  
each year on its website at:  
www.st-ives.co.uk.
What we are doing
We continually monitor and work 
to reduce the Group’ s carbon 
emissions, waste sent to landfill  
and water consumption.
What we report
We report our CO
2
e emissions in 
line with the requirements of the 
Companies Act 2006 (Strategic 
Report and Directors’ Report) 
Regulations 2013. In doing so 
we have adopted the following 
methodology:
a) An operational boundary 
approach has been applied on 
Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions 
in the UK using DEFRA’ s Standard 
Set conversion factors for 2017.
b) Where actual energy consumption 
data cannot be obtained we have 
estimated emissions, pro-rata, 
based on the data recorded by 
similar sites in the Group. Using 
this methodology, the estimated 
emissions from these sites equate 
to 0.4% of the Group’ s total 
emissions.
c) Scope 3 emissions are not 
reported on as they are outside 
our operational control. The  
Board will, however, keep this 
under review.

action taken as a result are also 
considered; and
• Group initiatives for improving 
Health and Safety performance.
The Group operates a bespoke on-
line Health and Safety Management 
System for:
• reporting accidents and near miss 
incidents;
• hosting a Health and Safety 
document library; and
• applying standards of 
accreditation to contractors  
who apply for consent to work  
at our sites.
A driver safety awareness 
programme is in place throughout 
the Group which is an important 
part of managing T actical Solutions’ 
motor vehicles which are driven by 
its field marketing staff.
How we are performing
The total number of RIDDOR 
reportable accidents at the Group’ s 
sites for the year ended 28 July 
2017 was four (2016 – three). Of the 
four RIDDOR reportable accidents, 
three resulted in at least seven 
days’ absence each, with the fourth 
injury being classified as a major 
injury with zero days lost (which 
was a fracture to a small bone in an 
employee’ s hand at Clays Limited). 
The total number of days’ lost 
from all accidents at work was 201 
days (2016 – 472). This represents 
a 57% improvement on last year. 
All accidents resulted in a review 
of the causes and action was taken 
in order to reduce the likelihood 
of any further accidents arising. 
The number of ‘near miss’ events 
recorded during the year was 1,095 
(2016 – 1,410). 
The Group continues to strive 
for improvement in its safety 
performance and is focussed 
on a safety culture shift, via the 
deployment of behavioural-based 
safety techniques, whilst maintaining 
compliance with all statutory 
requirements.
A copy of the Group’ s Health and 
Safety Policy and performance  
data for 2016/2017 will be made 
available on the Group’ s website 
from 31 October 2017.

changes in the DEFRA conversion 
factors, but also by the Group’ s 
operational behaviour.
The Strategic Marketing segment 
shows a year-on-year increase in 
emissions. This is due to inclusion  
of The App Business’ data this  
year. All of the businesses in the 
Group’ s portfolio are included in  
this year’ s report. 
T wo further charts display that the 
Group’ s waste sent to landfill and 
water consumption continues to 
fall. This is attributable to a better 
and more accurate data capture 
of the waste to landfill and the fact 
that the Group no longer reports on 
the water consumption within the 
Strategic Marketing segment as the 
volumes had reached a position  
of immateriality. 
The Group’ s Environmental Policy 
and further information about the 
Group’ s environmental performance 
during 2016/2017 can be viewed on 
its website from 31 October 2017.
Health and safety 
The Board regards the health and 
safety of the Group’ s employees 
while they are at work as a  
pre-eminent duty.
What we are doing
The Board ensures that 
responsibilities for Health and Safety 
are properly assigned, accepted and 
fulfilled within the organisation.  
A Statement of the Board’ s approach 
to Health and Safety is publicised 
at all of the Group’ s sites and each 
subsidiary company’ s CEO or 
Managing Director, as appropriate, 
has formally acknowledged their 
role in ensuring that managers 
and employees at each site are 
adequately conversant with their 
legal duties under health and  
safety legislation.
The first item on the agenda for each 
parent Board meeting is to receive a 
report on Health and Safety-related 
KPIs, selected to measure and 
manage the Group’ s Health and 
Safety performance, which are  
as follows:
• monthly and cumulative statistics 
on near misses, all accidents, all 
lost time accidents, total days lost, 
reportable accidents; the Group’ s 
Accident Frequency Rate, the 
Group’ s Injury Incidence Rate and 
a report on employment liability 
insurance claims;
• the circumstances of any lost 
time accidents and reportable 
accidents and management 
St Ives’ digital marketing, 
technology and commerce 
consultancy, Amaze, 
demonstrates an excellent 
example of the Group’s proactive 
approach to its employees and to 
the community that surrounds it. 
The business has established 
partnerships with local schools 
in order to reimagine how the 
industry and education work 
together, and to narrow the 
digital skills gap between them. 
One of these initiatives is  
‘girl.Code’, which encourages  
girls at schools in Manchester  
and the local area to study 
computer science.
The initiative was implemented 
at two schools during the past 
year, which involved Amaze 
running four technical in-house 
learning experiences at each 
establishment, giving students an 
insight into opportunities offered 
by the sector and a career in 
computer science.
The project was a great success. 
In total, 50 out of 70 girls 
involved chose to take up 
computer science; three times 
the amount of students who 
were originally considering the 
subject. Alongside ‘girl.Code’, 
Amaze offers students at its 
partnering schools the chance to 
attend technical presentations, 
consider live briefs and apply for 
placement opportunities, in order 
to build greater experience of the 
technology sector. 
Amaze partnered with The 
Manchester College to 
create ’Computer Science and 
Developing Digital Solutions – 
Certified by Amaze’, a unique 
course that is directly relevant to 
the digital sector. It gives students 
the opportunity to enhance 
their technical knowledge and 
work on live briefs. The agency 
decides on the technologies 
for students enrolled on the 
course and provides a tailored 
masterclass every two months. 
The course is a recognised BTEC 
National Extended Diploma, and 
with content chosen by Amaze, 
students become equipped with 
the most up-to-date and relevant 
skills for a career in the industry. 
Helen Watson, Head of HR at 
Amaze, said the new programme 
“provides a challenging and highly 
rewarding course for students 
who have what it takes to be 
among the next generation of 
digital talent.”
Amaze provides students 
with the opportunity to widen 
their range of practical design 
skills and increase their hands-
on experience required for 
becoming a digital innovator 
within the business, via an 
internal training programme 
called ‘the Academy’. It offers a 
fast-track and discipline-specific 
syllabus to equip graduates with 
skills they can use immediately. 
The syllabus includes modules 
on a wide range of subjects 
such as content management 
systems, e-commerce platforms 
and transactional systems. A 
number of graduates from the 
2017 Academy programme have 
achieved permanent positions 
within Amaze and are greatly 
contributing towards  
the business.

Dear Shareholder
The Board invests a significant amount of time on maintaining high standards of governance, in recognition of the value that sound corporate 
governance can add to the success and sustainability of the Group’s business. I am pleased, therefore, to introduce our Corporate Governance 
Report for the 52 weeks ended 28 July 2017 (‘the period’), which includes individual reports from the Chair of each of the Audit Committee, 
Nomination Committee and Remuneration Committee on pages 38 to 61.
BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND ITS MEMBERSHIP
The Board’s membership throughout the period and the Directors’ attendance at pre-arranged meetings of the Board is set out in the table  
on page 34.
The Board meets at regular intervals and is responsible to the shareholders for overall Group strategy, acquisitions and divestments, major capital 
projects, risk and financial matters. Senior executives within the Group make regular presentations to the Board to apprise the Directors on their 
markets and how they serve them, growth opportunities and future challenges and how they propose to address them. All Directors receive 
agendas and papers in advance of each meeting. Following the meeting, detailed minutes are recorded and actions followed up.
The Board is satisfied that it has an effective and appropriate balance of skills and experience and that, throughout the period, each of the 
Company’s Non-Executive Directors was independent in character and free from any business or other relationship which could materially interfere 
with the exercise of his or her judgement. In reaching this opinion, the Board has carefully considered potential conflicts of interest and the balance 
between applying good practice and what it believes is in the shareholders’ best interests. The Non-Executive Directors have a clear understanding 
of their roles and responsibilities, which are appropriately documented. The Non-Executive Directors met during the period, without any Group 
executive being present. Mike Butterworth fulfilled the role of Senior Independent Director.
The roles of Chairman and Chief Executive are separate and distinct, and an appropriate division of responsibilities between the two has been set 
out in writing and approved by the Board. The Chairman has responsibility for the management of the Board and related matters whilst the Chief 
Executive has responsibility for executive leadership of the Group, and for strategy implementation and performance.
The Company’s articles of association set out detailed provisions for the retirement of Directors and their re-appointment or appointment at the 
forthcoming Annual General Meeting (‘AGM’). Although not required under the UK Corporate Governance Code (April 2016) (‘the Code’), all of the 
Directors have voluntarily agreed to retire at the 2017 AGM and seek re-election, except for Ben Gordon who gave notice of his intention to resign 
as Non-Executive Director of the Company with effect from the conclusion of the forthcoming AGM.
BOARD ACTIVITY
During the period, the Board carried out a review of matters reserved to it for decision. The Executive Directors meet regularly with the 
Chief Executive Officers and Managing Directors of the subsidiaries within the Group’s business segments to discuss performance, major 
customers, sales growth (including cross selling opportunities), risks, knowledge sharing, people issues and procurement initiatives.
All Directors have full and timely access to all relevant information needed to enable them to properly discharge their responsibilities and have 
unrestricted access to other executives within the business to discuss any matter of concern to them. A procedure exists for Directors to seek 
independent professional advice in the furtherance of their duties and to be reimbursed their reasonable legal fees. Each Director also has  
access to the advice and services of the Company Secretary.
The areas of focus for the Board during the period were: Health and Safety performance; trading performance; the Group’s strategic options and 
risk; and governance and Board performance. The Board also held an annual strategic review away-day at which, inter alia, presentations were 
received from the senior executives of five of the Group’s Strategic Marketing businesses.
BOARD PERFORMANCE
The Board confirms, following a performance review, that all of the Directors standing for re-election continue to perform effectively and 
demonstrate commitment to their roles.
The Board engaged The People Stuff, a third party consultancy, to facilitate a formal evaluation of the effectiveness of the Board. As part of 
the process, The People Stuff attended and observed a Board meeting and conducted one-to-one interviews with the Directors and Company 
Secretary. Recommendations following the evaluation will be implemented during 2017/2018 and included:
• improving the review around strategy and risks at Board meetings to achieve greater alignment; and
• restructuring the Board meeting agenda to incorporate all important areas covered in meetings.
The Chairman has arranged one-to-one interviews with each Director to discuss the findings of the evaluation of the effectiveness of the Board.
An evaluation of the Chairman was also carried out by the Non-Executive Directors, led by the Senior Independent Director.
On appointment, each Director receives an induction appropriate to their previous experience and their knowledge of the markets in which  
the Group operates.  34 St Ives plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE  
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT CONTINUED
BOARD COMMITTEES
The Board is supported by Audit, Nomination and Remuneration Committees. The Company Secretary acts as Secretary to all the Committees  
and each Committee has written terms of reference available on the Group’s website (www.st-ives.co.uk). 
The Audit Committee Report on pages 38 to 40 discusses the principal activities conducted by the Committee during the period, the significant 
matters which were considered and how the Committee addressed these issues.
A report on the work of the Nomination Committee is set out on page 41.
A statement from the Chair of the Remuneration Committee and the Directors’ Remuneration Report can be found on pages 42 to 61.
A third party consultancy, The People Stuff, as referred to on page 33, also carried out evaluations of the effectiveness of the Board’s Committees 
during the period and the outcome in each case was that they continued to run well and were effectively chaired and supported. This supplemented 
internal questionnaires sent to the Committees’ members during the period to assess Committee effectiveness. 
The membership of each Committee throughout the period under review is set out in the aforementioned reports.
BOARD AND COMMITTEE ATTENDANCE
In the opinion of the Board, the Board and its Committees each met sufficiently frequently to properly discharge the responsibilities set out in their 
respective terms of reference. 
Details of Directors’ attendance at Board and Committee meetings based on their maximum possible attendance during the period are as follows:

*This table only shows details of attendance at meetings in the pre-arranged annual meeting calendar. Other ad-hoc meetings were held during the period.
Throughout the period at least three Independent Non-Executive Directors served on each of the Audit, Nomination and Remuneration Committees.
INTERNAL CONTROL AND RISK MANAGEMENT
The Group has in place a corporate reporting and risk management framework in compliance with Principle C3 of the Code after having due regard 
to the Financial Reporting Council Guidance.
The Board is responsible for the Group’s system of internal control, including financial, operational and compliance controls and risk management, 
and for reviewing its effectiveness. A workable and realistic system can only be designed to manage and mitigate, rather than eliminate, the risk of 
failure to achieve business objectives, safeguard the Group’s assets against material loss and fairly report the Group’s performance and position in 
line with relevant legislation, regulation and best practice. Therefore, the system can only provide a reasonable and not absolute assurance against 
material misstatement or loss.
As part of the annual budget process, each subsidiary is required to submit an analysis of strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats  
to the Board. Once consolidated by the Group’s finance function, the Board’s Executive Directors review this detail with senior managers of the 
subsidiaries, and if necessary, findings from this analysis will be elevated to Board level discussion for further consideration. The Company puts in 
place a series of forecasting mechanisms in order to receive information from the businesses across the Group and to forecast as efficiently and 
effectively as possible. 
Risks within the business relating to strategic, market, operational, financial, legislative, regulatory, contractual and reputational matters are referred 
to the Board as necessary and the Directors consider themselves collectively responsible for ensuring that these risks are suitably managed.
The Group recognises that taking and managing risks is inherent in any business and in delivering its strategy. On pages 24 to 27 we set out 
the principal risks and uncertainties that have been identified from the reporting and risk management framework; their possible impact on the 
business; and what mitigating actions the Board has approved.
The Board carries out reviews twice per annum, both from a top-down and bottom-up perspective, and considers the impact that these principal 
risks might have on the business and on the Group’s ability to meet its strategic objectives. 35
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT OUR FIGURES
St Ives plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
The process by which the Board exercises control is by holding (a) nine scheduled Board meetings per annum; (b) an annual Board strategy  
away day; (c) regular meetings of senior management within each of the Strategic Marketing, Marketing Activation and Books segments which 
are chaired by an Executive Director; and (d) regular management meetings of each operation within these segments. Risk is reported on and 
monitored with senior management and any new areas of significant risk to the businesses are then raised at the next meeting of the Board if 
considered appropriate.
The Group’s Internal Audit function consists of two qualified accountants who, as necessary, draw on additional resource from professional services 
firms. The work planned for the Internal Audit team to undertake is linked closely to the risk management framework, with the internal audit plan 
designed to give assurance around key risk areas.
The Internal Audit function independently reviews the risk identification procedures implemented by management. Internal Audit reviews 
subsidiary risk registers and ensures they are updated by the heads of finance in each business. Verification of mitigation actions takes place on a 
cyclical basis as part of the annual audit cycle.
During the period the Internal Audit function performed work on the Group’s internal controls; reviewing the control environment and conducting 
testing of key controls. Controls testing of procurement, accounts payable, payroll, accounts receivable and credit control cycles took place at 
selected sites, including work at the Group’s Shared Services Centre which provides centralised accounts payable, credit control and general 
ledger services to a number of the Group’s companies. High risk issues identified within audit reports, together with corrective actions were 
considered in detail at the meetings of the Audit Committee. 
Annual internal control questionnaires, supplemented by a half year questionnaire, are completed by all the Group’s businesses and reviewed by 
the Head of Internal Audit and the Company Secretary. Any inconsistencies with the Group’s established corporate governance regimes which are 
identified are disclosed to the Audit Committee.
COMPLIANCE STATEMENT
The Company is required to comply with the Code to the extent that it applies to ‘small-cap’ companies or, in the case of its provisions, explain  
the reasons for non-compliance. The Code can be read in full on the Financial Reporting Council’s website (www.frc.org.uk).
In the opinion of the Board, the Company has, throughout the period ended 28 July 2017, been in compliance with the Code. 
This Corporate Governance Report, together with the reports on pages 38 to 61, describes how the Board has applied the key areas contained  
in the Code and, where appropriate, where it has adopted elements of corporate governance good practice.

AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT
The Audit Committee’s key role is to gain assurance around processes that support financial reporting, including internal control,  
risk management and legal and regulatory compliance, together with financial reporting itself.
2 October 2017
Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to present a report on the role of the Audit Committee and its activities during the period ended 28 July 2017.
CURRENT MEMBERSHIP
I chair the Committee and bring recent and relevant financial experience to it, having served as Chief Financial Officer of a FTSE250 company for 
eight years until December 2012. Throughout the period under review and the current financial year to date, the other members of the Committee 
were Ben Gordon, Helen Stevenson and Nigel Pocklington. The Audit Committee as a whole has competence relevant to the sector in which the 
Company operates.
In addition to the Committee members, the Chairman, the Executive Directors of the Board, the Head of Internal Audit and the external audit 
partner are invited to attend each meeting. The Committee members do, however, meet separately at least once a year with the external auditors 
and the Head of Internal Audit and I am in frequent contact with both the external audit partner and the Head of Internal Audit.
ROLE OF THE COMMITTEE
The Committee carries out the functions required by DTR 7.1.3R of the UKLA Disclosure and Transparency Rules. The principal responsibilities  
of the Committee are set out in the Committee’s terms of reference, which are available from the Group’s website (www.st-ives.co.uk).
MAIN ACTIVITIES OF THE COMMITTEE IN 2016/2017
The Committee held three scheduled meetings in the period at which it:
• agreed an internal audit plan;
• considered reports from the Group’ s Head of Internal Audit;
• monitored the quality of work performed by the Internal Audit function;
• considered the appropriateness of the Group’ s risk management process, including the results of an internal controls questionnaire, completed  
by management within the Group’ s operating sites;
• considered the re-appointment of the external auditors, their reports to the Committee, their fees and their independence, including an assessment  
of the appropriateness to conduct any non-audit work;
• ensured the integrity of the financial reporting process was upheld;
• reviewed the Group’ s trading updates and Half Year Report prior to release;
• considered significant accounting and reporting issues pertinent to the preparation of the Half Year Report and the Annual Report and Accounts;
• analysed the effectiveness of the external audit by reviewing replies to questionnaires completed by management and Audit Committee members;
• conducted a review of the Committee’ s effectiveness;
• received the Group’ s updated bribery risk register and considered the effectiveness of recommendations by Internal Audit; 
• approved an updated Group policy on the provision of non-audit services, in alignment with new EU rules; 
• updated the Committee’ s terms of reference; 
• assisted the Board with the review of the Company’ s Business Risk Register; 
• considered an assessment of the Group’ s longer-term viability; and
• received a report setting out the Going Concern review undertaken by management.
The Committee was satisfied with the effectiveness of the internal controls within the Group during the period with the exception of certain 
accounting controls in its Books business, Clays Limited (‘Clays’), which related to the quality and review of reconciliations covering inventory 
and certain accruals. This issue was isolated to Clays and did not impact other businesses in the Group as our subsidiaries operate on a largely 
autonomous basis. Remedies have been introduced to improve the controls environment at Clays. These include further reviews of detailed 
reconciliations, resource changes and greater segregation of duties due to more processes being performed by the Group’s Shared Services Centre.
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
During the period, the Financial Reporting Council (‘the FRC’) reviewed the Company’s Annual Report and Accounts 2016. No significant matters 
were noted, but a number of minor points were raised around the requirement for additional disclosure of certain items in the financial statements, 
which have been incorporated in this Annual Report. The Committee also undertook a review and assessment of the Annual Report and Accounts 
2017 (the ‘Annual Report’) in order to determine whether, in its opinion, the Annual Report for the period, taken as a whole is fair, balanced and 
understandable and provides shareholders with the information they need to assess the Group’s position, performance, business model and 
strategy. To provide additional support to the Board in making this assessment, the Committee approved and monitored a detailed review and 
verification process of the Annual Report undertaken by management and provided confirmation to the Board that this process was both followed 
and effective. In this respect, the Committee:
• received reports on the requirements of Provision C.1.1. of the Code, which were updated as an ongoing part of the year end process;

SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL MATTERS
The Committee has assessed whether suitable accounting policies have been adopted and whether management has made appropriate estimates 
and judgements in respect of significant financial matters. The Committee considered accounting papers which provided details on the main 
financial reporting judgements and classifications, which were addressed as follows:
Significant matters considered How the Committee addressed these issues
The assessment of the carrying value
of goodwill (£108.7 million), property, plant  
and equipment (£26.2 million) and intangible  
assets (£42.8 million)
The Committee received reports in relation to the assessment of the carrying value of the 
goodwill for each cash generating unit (‘CGU’). The Committee considered key judgements 
including the discount rate, terminal growth rates and the future cash flow forecast of each 
CGU to which goodwill and investments are allocated, based upon the projected financial 
plans approved by the Board. The conclusion of the review and the key assumptions are 
disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. 
The Committee considered reports on the carrying value of acquired intangible assets 
where there were indicators of impairment such as loss of clients, maintenance of proprietary 
techniques and trademarks. The Committee also reviewed disclosures where a reasonably 
possible change indicated a material impairment. 
During the period, the Committee reviewed the impairment assessment of goodwill for 
Tactical Solutions UK Ltd and SP Group Ltd that was carried out by management, and 
concluded that an impairment charge of £3.5 million and £21.1 million respectively was 
required. An impairment charge of £2.8 million was recorded against the property, plant 
and equipment of SP Group Ltd due to a continued decline in operating profits, as a result 
of lower promotional activity levels within the grocery retail sector. Following the loss of the 
HarperCollins contract, an impairment charge of £2.9 million was made against the plant, 
equipment and inventories in the Books segment. An impairment charge of £0.3 million was 
made against intangible assets of the Data businesses for obsolete software. Subsequent to 
the period end, the Group was informed by Sainsbury’s that it would not renew its contract for 
the provision of marketing materials. As a result an impairment charge of £2.5 million has been 
recorded against the goodwill of Service Graphics in the 2016/2017 financial period.
The above charges have been recorded as Adjusting Items in the Consolidated Income 
Statement (note 7). 
The classification of Adjusting Items  
(£68.2 million)
The Board uses Adjusted results as the measure of the on-going financial performance of the 
Group’s businesses and excludes such items that are considered to distort the comparison 
of the trading performance of the Group and across its businesses. The Audit Committee 
assessed the classification of these Adjusting Items according to their nature and value, in 
line with ESMA Guidance (‘APMs’). The Committee reviewed reports outlining the accounting 
policy on the classification of Adjusting Items and satisfied itself with the treatment applied. 
The accounting policy on Adjusting Items can be found in note 7 to the consolidated  
financial statements.
The valuation of the St Ives Defined Benefits 
Pension Scheme (£16.0 million)
The valuation of the St Ives Defined Benefits Pension Scheme (the ‘Scheme’) is judgemental 
mainly due to underlying assumptions used to determine the Scheme’s liability. This includes 
assumptions such as the discount rate, inflation and life expectancy of the Scheme members 
at the balance sheet date. The Committee reviewed reports from management outlining 
the assumptions used, and agreed with those assumptions as outlined in note 27. The 
assumptions presented to the Audit Committee by management are underpinned by actuarial 
advice. The Audit Committee considered the suitability of the actuary. 
The key judgements relating to the 
assumptions used in accounting for deferred/
contingent consideration relating to prior year 
acquisitions (£22.9 million)
Estimated deferred/contingent consideration is dependent upon the level of EBITDA 
achieved by the respective businesses. The judgements largely relate to the assumptions used 
to derive the future EBITDA of the businesses, which is based on the forecasts approved by 
the Board. The Committee reviewed and assessed future forecasts and the value of deferred/
contingent consideration as disclosed in note 11.
GOING CONCERN
The Committee received a report setting out the Going Concern review undertaken by management that forms the basis of the Board’s going 
concern conclusion on pages 62 to 63.
VIABILITY 
An overview of the viability process undertaken was provided to the Audit Committee and reviewed for completeness. The viability evaluation was 
then provided to the Board to assist in its assessment of the Company’s longer-term viability in order to make the statement found on page 63. 40 St Ives plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE  
AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT CONTINUED
EXTERNAL AUDITORS
The external auditor’s appointment is reviewed regularly and, in accordance with the Auditing Practices Board standards, the Lead Audit Partner  
is rotated at least once every five years. As such, a new Lead Audit Partner for the external audit was appointed in 2016/2017.
A full tender process was last conducted by the Company in 2009 which resulted in Deloitte LLP (‘Deloitte’) being re-appointed. In line with the new 
EU rules on external audit, another tender will take place by 2019 and the external auditor will be rotated by the end of the 2019/2020 financial year. 
The Board continues to monitor any legal or regulatory changes proposed or made in the UK which affect small cap companies. 
The Committee’s policy for determining the level of fees for non-audit services that the external auditor can provide, which was updated during the 
period to reflect the new FRC EU PIE rules, is as follows:
a) certain types of engagement shall not be undertaken by the external auditor, including services related to the internal audit function and tax;
b) relevant ethical guidance shall be taken into account regarding any proposal to request the Group’s external auditors to perform non-audit services;
c) cumulative non-audit fees from 2019/2020 onwards are capped at 70% of the average of the audit fees for the Group for the preceding  
three year period; 
d) subject to (e) below, the Board shall appoint whoever, in its opinion, will provide the most cost effective and timely service for undertaking  
a particular project; and
e) the Chief Financial Officer is to consult with the Chairman of the Audit Committee in advance of any non-audit work in excess of £25,000  
per project that the external auditor may be invited to perform for the Group, so that an agreed view might be taken on whether to put the 
project out to tender.
The Committee has satisfied itself that this policy has been appropriately applied. The split between audit and non-audit fees for the period is 
disclosed in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements. The non-audit fees were £140,000 for the period (for services relating to corporate 
restructuring) and were not considered by the Committee to compromise the objectivity and independence of Deloitte. The Committee agreed  
to select Deloitte to provide these services due to their inherent knowledge of the Group.
The Committee also considered the robustness of Deloitte’s safeguards and procedures to counter threats or perceived threats to their  
objectivity, the application of their independence policies and their adherence to the Ethical Standards published by the Auditing Practices  
Board. In all these respects the Committee was satisfied with Deloitte’s objectivity and independence. The Committee is satisfied that there  
are no relationships between the Company and Deloitte, its employees or its affiliates that may reasonably be thought to impair the auditors’ 
objectivity and independence. Private meetings are held with Deloitte to ensure that no restrictions are placed on the scope of their audit and  
to offer the external auditor opportunities to discuss any items the auditors did not wish to raise with the executives being present.
A review of the effectiveness of the external audit for the 2015/2016 year end was performed during the period which involved the completion of 
two questionnaires containing assertions of ‘best practice’ – one by each member of the Audit Committee containing ten assertions – and another 
completed by the management of each subsidiary containing 15 assertions. The areas covered included: the audit team expertise and experience; 
the audit planning process; audit execution; communication; adding value; responsiveness; reporting; timeliness; and focus. Participants were 
requested to score each assertion between one and four to indicate their level of agreement or disagreement. The results were then reviewed by 
the Audit Committee and Chief Financial Officer and discussed with the external auditors. The completed questionnaires showed in aggregate that 
the external audit had achieved a clear majority of the assertions in each area of focus. Areas of improvement that had been noted were addressed 
at the Audit Committee meeting during the period and continue to be implemented throughout the current external audit.
In the absence of any adverse findings as to the objectivity and independence and effectiveness of Deloitte, the Committee has recommended  
to the Board that Deloitte be re-appointed for 2017/2018.

NOMINATION COMMITTEE REPORT
The Nomination Committee’s key role is to lead the process for Board appointments and make recommendations to the Board.
2 October 2017
Dear Shareholder
On behalf of the Nomination Committee, I am pleased to report to you on the work it undertook during the period ended 28 July 2017.
CURRENT MEMBERSHIP
The Board has decided that a Nomination Committee, consisting of all the serving Board Directors, is workable given the size of the Board and, 
indeed, desirable. All Directors are given a voice in deciding on the method for reaching a shortlist, nominating and deciding on the selection  
of new members of the Board. It is important to a small board such as ours that the process of selection is right to suit the particular circumstances 
and that any decision made to nominate a new member of the Board is unanimous. Directors interview all candidates for appointments to Executive 
Director and Non-Executive Director positions.
The Board is aware of the increasing focus on the composition of boards and the emphasis on diversity. The Board agrees that diversity within 
the boardroom is important to the success of the business and the Committee seeks to reflect this view. The Board however does not feel it is 
appropriate to set numerical targets for diversity in the boardroom or, in particular, to set a percentage of women it aspires to having on the Board. 
The Group’s policy on affording equal opportunities to all employees and suitable applicants extends to the Board. Anyone appointed to the Board 
will, however, be selected on merit against objective criteria, taking into account the skills, expertise, and experience of the candidates.
When we look outside the Group to recruit we make clear that we are keen to consider candidates from all parts of the community in terms of 
gender, ethnicity, nationality, disability, age, sex, sexual orientation, marital or civil partner status, race, colour, religion or belief. We intend to 
continue with this policy.
Our disclosure on diversity generally can be found on page 29 within the Strategic Report.
ROLE OF THE COMMITTEE
The principal role of the Committee is to consider and recommend to the Board candidates who are appropriate for appointment as Executive  
or Non-Executive Directors so as to maintain an appropriate balance of skills and experience represented on the Board and ensure that the Board  
is refreshed as appropriate.
MAIN ACTIVITIES OF THE COMMITTEE IN 2016/2017
During the period the Committee’s main tasks were to consider the composition of the Board and Board level succession planning.
In considering the composition of the Board, the Committee has recognised the continued focus on the growth of its Strategic Marketing 
companies, as part of the Group’s strategy. 
The makeup of the business will continue to develop through organic growth, investment in the acquired businesses and, in the longer term,  
future acquisitions. 
During the period, the Board considered its ongoing succession planning and continues to assess the suitability of the makeup of the Board,  
in light of the Group’s overall strategy. 
 
The Committee discharged its other principal duties by:
• ensuring that an appropriate review of Board, Committee and Director effectiveness was undertaken during the period;
• considering whether the Non-Executive Directors were sufficiently independent for corporate governance purposes;
• deciding on which Directors should retire at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting; and
• approving the division of responsibilities between the Chairman and the Chief Executive.

LETTER FROM CHAIR OF REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
I am pleased to present our Directors’ 
Remuneration Report for the year ended 
28 July 2017.
Helen Stevenson
Chair of the Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee’s key role is to set the broad policy for remunerating the Executive Directors and recommend a 
remuneration policy which supports the creation of value for shareholders and the delivery of the Group’s strategic priorities. The 
Committee is mindful of the intense scrutiny around executive remuneration and seeks to adopt best practice where appropriate taking 
into account its position in the small cap sector. 
2 October 2017
Dear Shareholder
On behalf of the Remuneration Committee (‘the Committee’), I am pleased to present the Directors’ Remuneration Report for the year ended  
28 July 2017 covering the remuneration of Executive and Non-Executive Directors.
This report is split into three parts: this Annual Statement, a Policy Report and an Annual Report on Remuneration. As this is the third year of 
operating our existing remuneration policy, we shall be asking our shareholders to approve a revised policy at the forthcoming Annual General 
Meeting (‘AGM’), in addition to the usual advisory vote on the Annual Report on Remuneration. The background to, and the reasons for, the 
proposed amendments are set out opposite.
REVIEW OF REMUNERATION POLICY
Our current remuneration policy was approved by shareholders at the 2014 AGM, receiving 99.5% support. In line with the relevant reporting 
requirements, and as foreshadowed in last year’s report, the three-year term of the policy will shortly expire and therefore the Committee has 
taken the opportunity to review our remuneration arrangements to ensure they remain fit for purpose. 
PERFORMANCE AND REMUNERATION FOR 2016/2017
• 2016/2017 annual bonus pay-out of 0%
• 2014 LTIP award vesting 0%
IMPLEMENTATION FOR 2017/2018
• 0% salary increase
• bonus of up to 100% salary, based 75% on Adjusted PBT  
and 25% on strategic/personal objectives
• LTIP vesting 70% on Absolute TSR and 30% on growth in 
underlying Adjusted operating profit of Strategic Marketing
• LTIP grants at 90% of salary
• LTIP vesting underpinned by Committee discretion
• LTIP holding period of two years post vesting 
SUMMARY FOR EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
At a glance: 43
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT OUR FIGURES
St Ives plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
The Committee concluded that the current remuneration structure continues to be largely appropriate, but is proposing a number of changes to 
performance measurement for future short-term and long-term incentives to aid simplicity, enhance motivational effectiveness and better support 
our strategy. In finalising these proposals, the Committee consulted with, and has taken on board feedback from, institutional shareholders 
holding over 50% of the Company’s issued share capital and also shared its proposal with two investor representative bodies, the Investment 
Association and the ISS.
SUMMARY OF PROPOSED CHANGES FOR 2017/2018
Annual bonus
No changes are proposed to the existing policy and 2017/2018 bonuses will continue to be based 75% on financial performance and 25% on 
strategic/personal objectives. It is intended that the financial element for 2017/2018 bonuses will be based on Adjusted PBT (in place of Adjusted 
EPS) to ensure we are able to set robust profit targets which are transparent and motivational during a period when the number of shares 
outstanding could vary due to the potential issuance of shares to fund acquisition related earn-out payments. There is no intention to change the 
degree of stretch in the targets by using PBT instead of EPS. Additionally, the Committee would note that this is intended as a temporary change 
and expects to revert to EPS over the longer-term. Strategic/personal objectives are aligned with priorities already communicated to shareholders 
including the strengthening of the balance sheet and profitable growth from our Strategic Marketing segment. As always, we will review again the 
performance measures in advance of the next financial year to ensure these remain relevant to the business. Any bonus earned over 50% of salary 
will continue to be deferred in Company shares for two years and be subject to malus provisions. 
LTIP
The Committee proposes to: 
• Introduce a two year holding period following LTIP vesting, in line with emerging best practice in remuneration policies, for 2017/2018 grants 
onwards to Executive Directors. In total, this results in a five year combined vesting and holding period. 
• Add flexibility to vary the performance measures for future cycles. The majority of the LTIP will continue to be linked to financial and/or  
TSR performance. 
LTIP grants in recent years vest after three years based 50% on three-year relative TSR, 25% on Adjusted EPS and 25% on the percentage of 
Group Adjusted operating profit arising from the Strategic Marketing businesses. For 2017/2018 awards, having taken on board feedback from 
shareholders during our recent consultation, the Committee intends to link vesting 70% to Absolute TSR and 30% to growth in Adjusted operating 
profit from Strategic Marketing, with overall vesting underpinned by Committee discretion. This change in measures is intended to simplify the 
plan and support the Group’s strategy, whilst recognising the preference expressed by a majority of shareholders to use at least two performance 
measures. While the Committee considered Relative TSR, it felt that, on balance, Absolute TSR would be more motivational, simpler and provides 
direct shareholder alignment given the lower share price. LTIP vesting is underpinned by Committee discretion such that for any shares to vest, 
the Committee must be satisfied with the underlying performance of the business. In making this assessment the Committee will take into account 
factors such as the strength of the balance sheet, quality of earnings, etc.
LTIP awards are subject to a malus provision and clawback for a period of two years after vesting. 
Other elements
Our policy in relation to other areas of remuneration will remain unchanged, and will operate consistently with previous years.
PERFORMANCE AND REWARD FOR 2016/2017
The Group’s overall results for the year were impacted by challenges faced in our legacy businesses; however, further progress was made in the 
strategy to grow our Strategic Marketing segment with organic growth having been achieved. There exists further opportunity for our businesses 
to work closer together through collaboration following the senior management changes made within Digital and Data.
Targets for Executive Directors’ 2016/2017 bonuses were based 75% on Adjusted EPS and 25% on strategic/personal objectives. Neither the EPS 
condition nor the stretching strategic/personal objectives were achieved which warranted no bonus for either Executive Director. A summary  
of actual performance against the targets set is included on page 55. 
The Annual Report on Remuneration also gives details of LTIP awards granted in November 2014. The Company’s 2016/2017 Adjusted basic EPS 
performance, which acts both as a primary performance condition and as an underpin to the Relative Total Shareholder Return element, did not 
meet the relevant targets and the awards will therefore lapse. Further details are provided on page 55. 44 St Ives plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE  
LETTER FROM CHAIR OF REMUNERATION COMMITTEE CONTINUED
IMPLEMENTATION OF REMUNERATION POLICY FOR 2017/2018
Executive Director salaries remain the same for 2017/2018. 
The annual bonus will operate on a similar basis as in 2016/2017. Maximum bonus opportunities remain at 100% of salary, with any amount earned 
over 50% of salary continuing to be deferred in shares for two years and subject to malus provisions. As outlined above, 75% of the bonus will be 
based on Adjusted PBT, with the remaining 25% based on the achievement of key strategic/personal objectives. 
As with the 2015/2016 financial year, LTIP grant sizes will be reduced from 100% of salary to 90% in light of the lower share price. Vesting will be 
subject to stretching targets, underpinned by Committee discretion. 
Further details of the implementation of our Remuneration Policy for 2017/2018 are provided on page 58.
We continue to value any feedback from shareholders and hope to receive your support at the forthcoming AGM.

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT
This Directors’ Remuneration Report has been prepared in accordance with The Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts 
and Reports) (Amendment) Regulations 2013. The Report is also in accordance with the requirements of the Listing Rules and the relevant 
recommendations contained within the UK Corporate Governance Code (April 2016) (‘the Code’) relating to Directors’ remuneration and takes 
into account the views of our major shareholders. The legislation requires the auditors to report to the Company’s members on certain disclosures 
contained in this report and to state whether in their opinion that part of the report has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies 
Act 2006. The sections, between pages 45 and 61, which are subject to audit, have been highlighted.
POLICY REPORT
Directors’ Remuneration Policy
This section of the report sets out the Remuneration Policy for Executive and Non-Executive Directors, which shareholders will be asked to 
approve at the Annual General Meeting (‘AGM’) on 30 November 2017. The Committee intends that the policy will come into effect from the date 
of the AGM and is intended to apply for a period of three years.
Overview of Remuneration Policy
The Committee’s policy for the remuneration of the Company’s Executive Directors is that it should be structured so as to attract and retain 
executives of a high calibre with the skills and experience necessary to develop the Company successfully. It aims to recommend strategies which 
support the creation of long-term value for shareholders and reflect and support the delivery of the Company’s strategic priorities while taking due 
account of market best practice.
When determining levels of remuneration, the Committee periodically reviews the remuneration practices adopted by appropriate comparator 
companies both in the market generally and in the same business sector as the Company.
The Committee believes that a significant portion of the remuneration package of senior executives should be linked to performance, while 
ensuring that an appropriate balance is struck between (i) fixed and variable pay, (ii) short-term and long-term variable pay and (iii) the delivery 
of rewards in cash and shares. The Committee will regularly review the Company’s remuneration policies to ensure that these polices neither 
encourage nor reward inappropriate operational risk-taking that may be to the detriment of shareholders’ interests and that these remuneration 
policies are, therefore, compatible with the Company’s general risk policies and systems.
The table below sets out the key aspects of the Company’s remuneration policy for Executive Directors that is intended to operate during the 
current financial year and in future years. A description of how the Company intends to implement the policy for the 2017/2018 financial year is set 
out in the Annual Report on Remuneration on page 58.
Revised Executive Director Remuneration Policy Table
As described earlier in this report, the Committee undertook a review of the Company’s remuneration policy in 2017 and is proposing some minor 
changes to the Policy to introduce a two year holding period on vested LTIP shares and add flexibility to vary the performance measures for future 
LTIP cycles. These changes have been introduced to reflect the changing nature of the Group in line with its strategic objectives, with the proviso 
that the majority of any LTIP award will continue to be linked to financial and/or TSR performance. The Policy for other elements of remuneration 
remains unchanged. 
Basic salary
Purpose and link to strategy To provide competitive fixed remuneration that will attract and retain key employees of a high calibre and 
which will reflect their experience and position in the Company.
Operation Normally reviewed annually with increases effective from 1 August; salaries are paid monthly.
In setting salaries, the Committee takes into account the following: 
• capability of the individual;
• any changes in responsibility;
• increases awarded across the workforce;
• external economic factors such as inflation; and
• benchmarking for similar roles in comparable organisations.
Maximum potential value Executive Directors’ salaries effective 1 August 2017 are unchanged, as follows:
Chief Executive: £400,000 p.a.; and
Chief Financial Officer: £230,000 p.a.
No monetary maximum has been set, although increases are generally in line with the range (in percentage 
of salary terms) awarded across the Group. 
In accordance with normal practice at all levels in all parts of the Group, increases above this level (in 
percentage of salary terms) may be made in certain circumstances such as where there is a change in 
responsibility or a significant increase in the scale of the role or size and complexity of the Group.
Performance metrics Not applicable. 46 St Ives plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Benefits
Purpose and link to strategy To provide market competitive, yet cost effective, benefits to attract and retain high calibre executives.
Operation Benefits generally include provision of a car, or cash in lieu of car and fuel allowance, and private medical 
and life assurance cover.
The Committee may introduce other ancillary benefits which are on similar terms to those offered to the 
wider workforce or required in order to remain market competitive.
Overseas recruitment or an international assignment may require the benefits package to be more tailored 
and may include, for example, relocation costs, tax equalisation arrangements, etc., as necessary.
Maximum potential value The maximum annual car and fuel allowance is £15,520.
The maximum overall cost of total benefit provision (including but not limited to annual car and fuel 
allowance) may vary each year subject to changes in the Company’s insurance premiums or changes to the 
terms of the benefits provided. 
The values for the year under review, expressed as a cost to the Company of providing the benefits, are 
described in the Directors’ single figure table on page 54.
Performance metrics Not applicable.
Pension
Purpose and link to strategy To provide market competitive, yet cost-effective benefits.
Operation Only basic salary is pensionable.
A Company contribution to a defined contribution pension scheme, a personal pension or provision of a  
cash payment in lieu of a pension contribution (or combination of such) may be provided at the discretion  
of the Committee.
Maximum potential value Up to 15% of salary.
Performance metrics Not applicable.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT OUR FIGURES
St Ives plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Annual bonus
Purpose and link to strategy Incentivises achievement of annual objectives which support the short-term performance goals  
of the Company.
Operation At the start of each year the Committee determines the choice of annual bonus measures and targets  
to ensure they reflect the KPIs of the business at that time.
Payments under the annual bonus plan are subject to:
• compulsory payment of any bonus earned over 50% of salary (on an after tax basis) in the Company’s 
shares under the Company Deferred Bonus Shares (‘DBS’) arrangement which are subject to a holding 
period of two years; and
• the element of the annual bonus paid in shares is subject to malus provisions in the event of a material 
misstatement of the Company’s financial position.
Deferred shares will generally be forfeited if a Director leaves the Group (unless in certain good leaver 
situations or if the Committee determines otherwise).
Dividends and/or dividend equivalents are payable on the deferred bonus shares during the two year  
holding period.
Maximum potential value 100% of basic salary.
Performance metrics Performance is measured over one financial year.
Bonus awards are subject to achievement against a sliding scale of challenging financial targets and may  
also be subject to challenging strategic/personal objectives. 
The majority of any bonus will be earned for achieving challenging financial targets aligned with the 
Company’s key performance indicators (e.g. Adjusted PBT or EPS). A minority may be subject to achieving 
pre-set strategic/personal objectives which reflect the key priorities of the role at the time.
Bonuses become payable once a threshold level of performance is achieved against the target(s) which 
triggers a bonus payment of up to 25% of salary, rising to 100% of salary for meeting (or exceeding) the 
maximum target(s) set. Measurement of financial metrics is made on the basis of audited figures. Where 
strategic/personal targets are set it may not always be practicable to set these using a sliding scale.

weightings to apply for the year ended 3 August 2018. 48 St Ives plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Long-term incentives
Purpose and link to strategy Incentivises executives to achieve superior financial growth and returns to shareholders over the longer-term.
Provides alignment with shareholders through awards of shares.
Promotes retention of key individuals.
Operation The Long-Term Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’) was approved by shareholders in 2010.
Awards can be in the form of an option, a conditional award or a forfeitable award.
Eligibility to receive awards is at the discretion of the Committee each year.
An LTIP award may be made shortly after an appointment (subject to the Company not being in a prohibited 
period) subject to the permitted maximum.
Awards are normally made on an annual basis and vest three years from grant subject to continued 
employment and the satisfaction of challenging three-year performance targets. 
A two year holding period following LTIP vesting applies to grants from 2017/2018 onwards to  
Executive Directors. In total, this results in a five year combined vesting and holding period. 
The Committee reviews the quantum of awards annually and monitors the continuing suitability of the 
performance measures. 
Participants benefit from the value of dividends paid over the vesting period to the extent that awards vest. 
This benefit is delivered in the form of cash or additional shares at the time that awards are exercised.
All Awards granted after November 2013 are subject to a malus provision and clawback for two years after 
vesting, in the event of a material misstatement of the Company’s financial position.
Maximum potential value Awards with a face value of up to 125% of basic salary (or 200% if the Committee believes there are 
exceptional circumstances) can be made on an annual basis.
The Company operates within a 10% in ten years ABI (new share issue) dilution limit.
Performance metrics Performance is measured over a three-year period.
Performance measures, weightings and targets are determined by the Committee in advance of grant to 
support Company strategy and provide shareholder alignment. The majority of LTIP awards will continue  
to be linked to financial and/or TSR performance.
Under each measure, threshold performance will result in 25% of maximum vesting for that element  
(0% vests below this), increasing pro-rata to 100% for maximum performance.
Where TSR performance conditions are set, performance against the condition is monitored independently  
on the Committee’s behalf and where financial targets are set performance against the condition is tested 
based on numbers derived from the audited financial statements.
LTIP vesting is underpinned by Committee discretion such that for any shares to vest, the Committee must be 
satisfied with the underlying performance of the business. In making this assessment the Committee will take 
into account factors such as the strength of the balance sheet, quality of earnings, etc.
Page 59 of the Annual Report on Remuneration provides details of the performance measures, targets and 
weightings to apply for the year ended 3 August 2018.

Operation The Committee operates shareholding guidelines of 200% of salary for the Chief Executive and 150% of salary 
for other Executive Directors. 
The net of tax number of deferred bonus shares or vested shares under the Company’s LTIP will normally be 
required to be retained until the guideline is met. 
The Committee may take account of progress towards this target when determining LTIP awards.
Maximum potential value Not applicable.
Performance metrics Not applicable.
Notes to the Policy Table
1. While the remuneration policy for Executive Directors is designed having had regard to the policy for employees across the Group as a whole, there are some differences in the structure for senior 
employees which the Committee believes to be necessary to reflect the different levels of responsibility within the Company. The following key differences exist between the Company’s policy for 
the remuneration of Executive Directors and its approach to the payment of employees generally:
• there is an increased emphasis on performance related pay and, in particular, for share-based incentives at the Executive Director level;
• eligibility to participate in and the maximum opportunity in relation to an annual bonus vary, based on individual role and local practice;
• participation in the LTIP is limited to the Executive Directors and certain selected senior managers; and
• benefits offered to other employees vary by subsidiary to take account of relevant market conditions and local practice.
2. The choice of the performance metrics and range of targets applicable to the annual bonus plan for Executive Directors reflect the Committee’s belief that any incentive compensation should  
be appropriately challenging and tied to both the delivery of robust performance relating to the Group’s financial KPIs and, where appropriate, specific individual objectives. Performance metrics 
applicable to the LTIP are selected to support Company strategy and provide shareholder alignment. Awards to be made in 2017/2018 will vest based on stretching targets relating to Absolute 
TSR and growth in Adjusted operating profit from Strategic Marketing, which will simplify the plan, support portfolio reshaping and provide direct shareholder alignment. Targets applying to the 
annual bonus and LTIP are reviewed annually, based on a number of internal and external reference points. Performance targets are set to be stretching but achievable, with regard to the particular 
strategic priorities and economic environment in a given year.
3. The share ownership guideline levels are detailed above. The shares that an Executive Director may count towards the shareholding guideline include: those held in the name of the Director; 
those held in the name of the Director’s spouse, partner or children; any shares held in a family trust for the benefit of the Director and/or his/her spouse, partner or children; and any shares held in 
a personal pension plan on behalf of the Director. The Committee may, in its absolute discretion, approve the holding of shares by alternate means (e.g. shares held under a deferred share bonus 
award) and, if permitted, on such terms determined by the Committee, acting fairly and reasonably.
4. For the avoidance of doubt, in approving this Directors’ remuneration policy, authority is given to the Company to honour any commitments entered into with current or former Directors  
(such as the payment of a pension or the vesting/exercise of past share awards) that have been disclosed to and approved by shareholders in previous remuneration reports. Details of any 
payments to former Directors will be set out in the Annual Report on Remuneration as they arise.
5. The Committee operates the annual bonus, LTIP and Sharesave plans, in accordance with their rules, HMRC guidance and, where relevant, the Listing Rules. To ensure these incentive plans 
operate in an efficient manner, the Committee retains a number of standard market practice discretions which include:
• determining the eligibility to participate in the plans;
• determining the timing of grant of awards and any payments;
• the size of awards and payments, although with quantum restricted to those detailed in the table above and the respective plan rules;
• the determination of whether the performance conditions have been met and the resulting vesting/pay out; 
• dealing with a change of control (for example, the timing of testing performance targets) or restructuring of the Group;
• determining a good or bad leaver for incentive plan purposes, based on the rules of each plan and the appropriate treatment chosen;
• adjustments required in certain capital events such as rights issues, corporate restructuring, events and special dividends; and
• the annual review of performance conditions for the annual bonus plan and LTIP .
 In some circumstances, such as a material acquisition/divestment of a Group business, or a change in Accounting Standards and Interpretations, which mean the original performance conditions 
are no longer appropriate, the Committee can adjust the targets, set different measures and alter weightings as necessary, to ensure the conditions achieve their original purpose and are not 
materially less difficult to satisfy. 50 St Ives plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Reward Scenarios
The chart below shows how the composition of each of the Executive Director’s remuneration packages varies at different levels of performance 
under the policy set out above, as a percentage of total remuneration opportunity and as a total value:
Fixed pay comprises the 2017/2018 basic salary and expected pension contributions, and a value for benefits (using the value for the year ended 
28 July 2017 value as a proxy). Incentive opportunities reflect implementation for 2017/2018. The assumptions used in the above at the ‘on-target’ 
performance level are: (i) half of maximum bonus is earned; and (ii) 25% of the LTIP award vests which is the level of vesting if each target achieves 
its minimum threshold. The maximum performance level assumes the full bonus is earned and the LTIP award vests in full. No share price growth 
is included at the point of vesting under any scenario for the LTIP to ensure the above provides a simplistic overview of the current value of 
remuneration payable under the different performance scenarios.
Approach to recruitment and promotions
Basic salary levels will be set on appointment after having had due regard to the Company’s general remuneration policy but adjusted, as 
appropriate, to reflect the experience and calibre of the individual and the market rates for similar roles in comparable organisations. If it is 
considered appropriate to appoint a new Director on a below market salary (e.g. in the event of an internal promotion), they may be the subject  
of a series of increases to a desired salary positioning over an appropriate time frame, subject to performance in post.
Should it be appropriate to recruit an executive from overseas or for the individual to relocate, then reasonable expenses and payments may be paid 
in relation to such a relocation which would then be subject to disclosure in due course. Benefits and pension arrangements would generally be in line 
with those offered to current executives but it may be necessary to tailor these to reflect for example, local market norms, local legislation, etc.
The annual bonus maximum will be in line with current Executive Directors (i.e. 100% of basic salary), pro-rated for the period of service. Depending 
on the timing of the appointment the Committee may use different performance measures, targets and weightings to that of the current executives 
for the first year of service.
An LTIP award may be made shortly after an appointment (subject to the Company not being in a prohibited period) subject to the permitted 
maximum. The total maximum variable remuneration that may be awarded in respect of recruitment is 300% of salary (excluding buy-out awards 
referred to below).
The Committee may offer additional cash and/or share-based elements to replace deferred or incentive pay forfeited by an executive leaving a 
previous employer. The Committee would seek to ensure, where possible, that these awards replicate the potential value forfeited/lost in joining 
the Company, and in terms of time horizons, vesting periods, expected values and potential impact of performance conditions, these factors are 
recognised in determining the quantum of such compensation. This award would be facilitated under the existing incentive plans where possible, 
but also using Rule 9.4.2. of the Listing Rules if necessary.
For an internal Executive Director appointment, any variable pay element awarded in respect of the prior role may be allowed to pay out according 
to its terms, adjusted as relevant to take into account the appointment.

Service contracts and loss of office payments
Summaries of the Executive Directors’ contracts are disclosed below. These contracts are held at the registered office and are available for 
inspection in accordance with Provision B.3.2 of the Code.
      Date of contract Notice period
Executive
Matt Armitage      10 July 2014 12 months
Brad Gray      10 July 2014 12 months
It is the Company’s policy that Executive Directors should serve under rolling service contracts of 12 months’ duration or less and that there 
should be no special provisions for compensation in the event of termination (neither in the normal course nor following a change in control of 
the Company) and that any compensation payments made should take account of the Director’s duty to mitigate his loss. The Executive Directors’ 
current service contracts all comply with this policy.
The Remuneration Committee reviews the contractual terms for new Executive Directors to ensure these reflect best practice.
In summary, the contractual provisions are as follows:
Provision detailed terms
Notice period:  Up to 12 months
Termination payment:  Limited to a maximum of basic salary and benefits, paid monthly and subject to mitigation
Change of control:  No Executive Director’s contract contains additional provisions in respect of a change of control
The service contract for any new appointment would be made on similar terms to those described above.
In a leaver event, the following payments may also be made to departing Executive Directors:
1. Any share-based entitlements granted to an Executive Director under a Company share plan will be determined based on the relevant plan 
rules. In certain prescribed circumstances, however, such as death, ill-health, disability, retirement or other circumstances at the discretion of the 
Committee, a ‘good leaver’ status may be applied. Under the LTIP, for good leavers, future awards will normally be tested for performance over 
the full performance period and be reduced pro-rata to reflect the proportion of the performance period actually served, rounded-up to the 
next complete financial year, with Remuneration Committee discretion to determine that awards vest at an earlier date and/or to disapply time 
pro-rating. Vested LTIP awards which are subject to an additional holding period will typically be retained and released at the end of the holding 
period, with Committee discretion to treat otherwise. Under the DBS, in certain prescribed circumstances, awards will be retained in connection 
with a leaver event (such as death or permanent disability or any other reason permitted by the Remuneration Committee);
2. A pro-rata bonus may be payable for the period of active service in certain prescribed good leaver circumstances and in other circumstances at 
the discretion of the Committee and subject to the achievement of the relevant performance targets;
3. At the discretion of the Remuneration Committee, a contribution to reasonable outplacement costs in the event of termination of employment 
due to redundancy. The Committee also retains the ability to reimburse reasonable legal costs incurred in connection with a termination of 
employment; and
4. Any payment for statutory entitlements or to settle or compromise claims in connection with a termination of any existing or future Executive 
Director as necessary.
External Non-Executive appointments
Executive Directors may not accept an appointment outside the Company without prior permission of the Board. The extent to which any fees are 
retained by the individual or are remitted to the Company will be considered on a case-by-case basis. No Executive Director currently holds an 
external non-executive appointment.  52 St Ives plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Chairman and Non-Executive Directors
The following sets out the fee policy for the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors:
Purpose and link to strategy To attract and retain high calibre individuals without prejudice to the application of independent views. 
Operation Non-Executive Directors’ remuneration is decided by the Executive Directors and the Chairman; the 
Chairman’s fee is set separately by the Committee.
Fees are set periodically by taking account of the time required to fulfil the role and fees payable at similar 
sized companies. Any increases in fees also take account of any increases payable to Executive Directors and 
to the general workforce.
Non-Executive Directors may not participate in the Group’s cash or share-based incentive arrangements.
Non-Executive Directors also receive reimbursement of travel and office related expenses.
Maximum potential value For 2017/2018, the fees comprise a base fee of £42,500 p.a. plus additional fees of £5,000 p.a. for the  
Senior Independent Director position and £7,500 p.a. for chairing the Remuneration and Audit Committees. 
The Chairman’s fee is set at £130,000 p.a. 
These fees may be revised periodically in line with the Company’s policy. Given the periodic nature of the 
review any increases (as a % of total fees) may be greater than that awarded to the wider workforce in any 
particular year. 
The maximum aggregate fees are set in accordance with the Company’s articles of association.
Performance metrics Not applicable.
The policy on Non-Executive Directors’ letters of appointment is that they shall be for an initial period of no more than three years. The letters 
of appointment are kept at the registered office and are available for inspection in accordance with Provision B.3.2 of the Code. The letters of 
appointment are summarised as follows:
     Date of letter of appointment Notice period
Non-Executive
Mike Butterworth      14 July 2010 3 months
Ben Gordon      4 July 2013 3 months
Nigel Pocklington      25 May 2016 3 months
Helen Stevenson      3 April 2012 3 months
Richard Stillwell      26 April 2011 6 months
No other remuneration is payable to a Non-Executive Director on termination of an appointment.
Consideration of shareholder views
The Remuneration Committee considers shareholder feedback received in relation to the AGM each year at a meeting immediately following  
the meeting. This feedback, plus any additional feedback received from time to time, is then considered as part of an annual review of  
remuneration policy.
In addition, the Committee seeks to proactively engage directly with major shareholders and their representative bodies and takes seriously their 
views. In the event that the Committee wishes to make material changes to the remuneration policy, appropriate dialogue will take place with the 
Company’s major shareholders in advance. 
This year the Committee undertook a full review of the remuneration policy ahead of its expiration at the 2017 AGM. Having developed a number  
of proposed changes, shareholders representing over 50% of St Ives’ issued share capital, along with key institutional investors, were invited to 
provide and discuss feedback on the proposals. The comments received during this stage of the consultation helped the Committee to make 
changes – including complementing Absolute TSR with an additional measure in the LTIP , which it was agreed would be in the best interests of 
the Company and help to further focus executives on delivering St Ives’ strategy over the next few years. A two year holding period following LTIP 
vesting has also been introduced, in line with emerging best practice in remuneration policies, for 2017/2018 grants onwards to Executive Directors. 
In total, this results in a five year combined vesting and holding period. 
Details of votes cast for and against the resolution to approve last year’s remuneration report are set out in the Annual Report on Remuneration  
on page 54.

Consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the Group
Whilst the Company does not formally consult with employees on matters of executive remuneration, it does consider the general basic salary 
increase for the broader UK employee population when determining the annual salary review for the Executive Directors. The Committee is also 
made aware of employment conditions within the wider group, including a general overview of variable pay plan outcomes. The Committee also 
considers environmental, social and governance issues, and risk when reviewing executive pay quantum and structure.
ANNUAL REPORT ON REMUNERATION
The following section provides details of how St Ives’ remuneration policy was implemented during 2016/2017.
Membership of the Committee
Mike Butterworth, Ben Gordon, Nigel Pocklington and Helen Stevenson, all independent Non-Executive Directors, served on the Committee 
throughout the year. Helen Stevenson chaired the Committee throughout the year. The number of meetings held, attendances and a description  
of the principal matters considered by the Committee in carrying out its duties during the year are described on pages 34 and 53.
During the year under review, the Committee, where appropriate, sought advice and assistance from the Company Secretary and members of the 
Board, including the Chairman of the Board and the Chief Executive in connection with carrying out its duties. None of these persons took part in 
decisions relating specifically to their own remuneration.
Role of the Committee
The Committee is responsible for determining and agreeing with the Board the overall remuneration policy and its implementation, including 
setting the individual remuneration packages and contractual arrangements for the Executive Directors, senior management and the Chairman  
of the Board, which support the creation of value for shareholders and the delivery of the Group’s strategic priorities.
The Committee is mindful of the intense scrutiny around executive remuneration and seeks to keep abreast of and adopt best practice where 
appropriate taking into account its position in the small cap sector. 
When undertaking its duties, the Committee also ensures that due account is taken of pay and employment conditions throughout the Group by 
keeping abreast of matters such as (i) the general level of salary increases (if any) applied throughout the Group; (ii) the levels of bonuses paid (and 
bonus opportunity offered) to the workforce as a whole; and (iii) any widespread changes that are proposed to Group-wide employment conditions.
The full terms of reference for the Committee are available on the Company’s website (www.st-ives.co.uk).
Committee’s advisers
During the year, the Committee retained Kepler Associates, a brand of Mercer which is part of the MMC group of companies (‘Kepler’), as 
independent advisers to the Committee. Kepler were selected following a formal tender process conducted in 2015. Kepler is a signatory to  
the Code of Conduct for Remuneration Consultants in the UK, details of which can be found on the Remuneration Consulting Group’s website  
at www.remunerationconsultantsgroup.com. 
During the year, one of MMC’s other companies, Marsh, acted as St Ives’ commercial insurance brokers. The fees paid to Kepler in relation to advice 
provided to the Committee for 2016/2017 were £49,675, on a time and materials basis. 
The Committee has reviewed the advice provided by Kepler during the year and is satisfied that it has been objective and independent. The terms 
of engagement between the Company and Kepler are available from the Company Secretary upon request.
Summary of activities
During the year the Committee approved:
• outcomes of bonuses for the Executive Directors in respect of 2015/2016;
• the Directors’ Remuneration Report for 2015/2016;
• the Executive Directors’ salaries and pension provision for 2017/2018; 
• the Chairman’s fees for 2017/2018; and
• the grant of awards on 16 November 2016 under the Company’s 2010 LTIP to certain senior managers and the performance conditions attached  
to their vesting.
Additionally, the Committee performed a consultation with the Company’s major shareholders on minor changes to the Remuneration Policy 
wording and on the performance conditions applying to short-term and long-term incentives for the forthcoming year. Following this consultation, 
the Committee then also:
• approved the structure of the Executive Directors’ bonus scheme for 2017/2018; and 
• held preliminary discussions on the performance targets to apply to LTIP awards to be granted in late 2017. 54 St Ives plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Notes:
1. Taxable benefits constitute additional payments in lieu of the provision of a company car and fuel benefit and medical expenses insurance cover.
2. Figures for ‘share plans vesting’ are based on the number of shares vesting for performance periods substantially completed as at year end. The 2014 LTIP award will lapse in full 
in November 2017. See page 55 for details. 
3. Pension benefits were in part paid into a Group Personal Pension Plan and part paid as a cash supplement for Matt Armitage and Brad Gray. Brad Gray participated in the  
Group’s Defined Benefits Pension Scheme (the ‘Scheme’) until it was discontinued on 1 September 2008. Brad Gray’s entitlement to a deferred pension from the Scheme ceased 
during the year on the payment out of the scheme on 20 December 2016 to a self-managed pension arrangement. The transferred sum of £1.2 million was calculated by the 
Scheme’s actuary after applying a reduction factor agreed by the Trustee and applying generally such calculations to take account of the underfunded position of the Scheme. 
£13,260 of the pensions benefits figure shown for Brad Gray in 2016 related to the capitalised increase in his defined benefit pension entitlement, calculated in accordance with 
the reporting requirements.
4. Richard Stillwell has elected to forego £20,000 per annum of his fee of £130,000 per annum. Richard Stillwell’s fees are shown above after foregoing this proportion of his fees 
during 2016/2017. The Company donates this sum so withheld, together with a matching sum from the Company, to registered charities.  55

INCENTIVE OUTCOMES FOR THE PERIOD ENDED 28 JULY 2017 (audited) 
Annual bonus
Executive Directors’ bonuses for the year ended 28 July 2017 provided for a payment of up to 100% of salary based 75% on Adjusted EPS 
performance over the financial year and 25% on personal/strategic objectives. All bonuses in excess of 50% of basic salary are deferred into 
Company shares in line with the overall remuneration policy. Details of performance against the financial targets set are provided below:
    Threshold  Stretch Actual % of
Financial measure    (25% of salary) (75% of salary)  performance salary earned
Adjusted EPS    16.90p  17.90p  13.39p 0%
In addition, each Executive Director could earn up to 25% of salary for the achievement of stretching strategic/personal objectives including 
areas such as portfolio reshaping and other business priorities. In its assessment, the Committee noted that whilst progress had been made, the 
stretching strategic objectives had not yet been achieved. Accordingly neither Executive Director will receive an annual bonus payment in respect 
of 2016/2017. The Board considers the strategic objectives to be commercially sensitive and therefore will not be disclosing these objectives 
prospectively. However, it is intended that these objectives will be disclosed retrospectively within two years.
2013 LTIP
As reported last year, 2015/2016 Adjusted EPS performance was below threshold against targets set for 2013 LTIP awards and accordingly  
this element lapsed in November 2016. Relative TSR performance would have been assessed over the three-year period to 12 November 2016;  
however since the EPS underpin applying to this element of the awards was also not met, the full award lapsed in November 2016. Accordingly,  
the value of 2013 LTIP awards vesting included in the single figure table above for 2016 is £Nil. 
2014 LTIP
Vesting of the 2014 LTIP awards is dependent on two equally-weighted measures over a three-year period; Adjusted EPS and TSR relative to the 
FTSE All-Share Media sector (excluding FTSE100 companies). Further details, including vesting schedules and performance against each of the 
metrics are provided in the table below:
Measure Weighting Targets Outcome Vesting %
Adjusted EPS in 
2016/2017
50% 0% vesting below 21.0p
25% vesting for 21.0p
100% vesting for 24.0p or more
Straight-line vesting between these points
13.39p 0%
TSR relative to the  
All-Share Media 
sector (excl. FTSE100 
companies)
50% 0% vesting below median performance
25% vesting for performance in line with median
100% vesting for upper quartile performance or greater
Straight-line vesting between these points
Performance period ends in 
November 2017, however 
EPS underpin not met
0% 
Total vesting 0%
With regard to the outcome of EPS performance, the Committee, as part of testing the condition, also assessed the potential impact on the targets 
of the adoption of the amendment to IAS 19 and the impact of the change in accounting policy to treat IAS 19 charges relating to the St Ives 
Defined Benefits Pension Scheme as Adjusting Items. The adjusted growth rate in EPS over the three-year performance period was such that the 
target was not met irrespective of the basis of testing the target (i.e. if the EPS targets had been restated to allow for the impact of IAS 19 and the 
change in accounting policy, this would not have affected the vesting result) and so the Committee was comfortable that the extent of achievement 
was not impacted by the change in accounting standards and change in policy.
The TSR portion of the award is measured over three years from the date of the award and so is not due to be measured until 12 November 2017. 
However, the EPS underpin of 20.0 pence applying to the TSR portion was not met, and accordingly the full award will lapse in November 2017.  56 St Ives plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Scheme interests awarded during the 2016/2017 financial year (audited)
In November 2016, Matt Armitage and Brad Gray were granted awards under the Company’s LTIP , as follows:

*Face value is based on a share price of 128.15 pence (the market value at the time of grant).
As disclosed in last year’s report, to reflect the fall in the share price, following the April 2016 Trading Update, LTIP grant sizes for 2016/2017 were 
reduced from 100% of salary to 90% of salary. Awards granted vest on Adjusted EPS, relative TSR and Adjusted operating profit from the Strategic 
Marketing segment, each measured over three years and with overall vesting underpinned by Committee discretion.

All awards made since November 2013 are subject to a malus and clawback provision, which will enable the Committee to reclaim value that should 
not have been received in the event that, if within the two-year period following the year of vesting, a material misstatement of the Company’s 
financial results relating to the year of vesting is identified. In such circumstances a clawback would be based on the extent to which the first vesting 
was overpaid based on new information. 57

IMPLEMENTATION OF EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR REMUNERATION POLICY FOR 2017/2018 
Basic salary 
Following the annual review and taking into account business circumstances, it was determined that there would be no increase in the salaries of the 
Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer for 2017/2018. Salary levels will remain as follows:
     From 1 August From 1 August 
     2017 2016 % increase
Matt Armitage Chief Executive      £400,000 £400,000 0%
Brad Gray Chief Financial Officer      £230,000 £230,000 0%
Pension and benefits
No changes in pension contribution rates or benefits provision to the Executive Directors are to be applied during the year.
 
Annual bonus 
The annual bonus for the 2017/2018 financial year will operate on broadly the same basis as in 2016/2017. Bonus opportunities for Executive 
Directors remain at 100% of salary, with any amount earned over 50% of salary deferred in shares for two years and subject to malus provisions in 
the event of material misstatement. As described earlier in the report, 75% of the bonus opportunity will be based on Adjusted PBT (previously 
Adjusted EPS) performance, with the remaining 25% based on the achievement of key strategic/personal objectives aligned with the business’s 
strategy and priorities that have been communicated to shareholders. 
A summary of performance measures and weightings is included in the table below: 
Measure       Weighting
Adjusted PBT       75%
Strategic/personal objectives       25%
In the event of any material acquisition or divestment the Committee would adjust the PBT targets for the acquisition/divestment plan. The Board 
considers the targets for the annual bonus measures to be commercially sensitive and therefore will not be disclosing these objectives prospectively. 
However, it is intended that retrospective disclosure, including any such adjustment of targets, will be provided in the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report within two years. In setting Adjusted PBT targets for the year, the Committee reviewed a range of internal and external reference points  
to ensure that targets are appropriately stretching yet achievable.  59

Long-term incentives 
LTIP awards to be made to Executive Directors in late 2017 are anticipated to be 90% of salary, and may vest subject to performance over  
a three-year period, with vested shares subject to a two year holding period. As described in the letter from the Chair of the Remuneration 
Committee, the Committee is proposing to link vesting of these awards 70% to Absolute TSR targets and 30% to growth in Adjusted operating 
profit from Strategic Marketing, with overall vesting underpinned by Committee discretion. For any shares to vest, the Committee must be satisfied 
with the underlying performance of the business. In making this assessment the Committee will take into account factors such as the strength of 
the balance sheet, quality of earnings, etc. The Committee believes that this will help to simplify the plan and support portfolio reshaping. While 
the Committee considered relative TSR, it felt that, on balance, Absolute TSR would be more motivational, simpler and provides direct shareholder 
alignment given the reduced share price. 
A summary of performance targets for the forthcoming grant, which are on the basis that the policy is voted for at the 2017 AGM, are included  
in the table below:

In the event of any material acquisition or divestment the Committee would adjust the operating profit targets to ensure only out-performance  
of the acquisition/divestment plan is rewarded. Vesting of awards is subject to overall Committee discretion.
The Absolute TSR performance range for 2017/2018 LTIP awards of 110p to 170p corresponds to c.75% to 170% growth from the trailing  
three-month average share price on 28 September 2017, the date of Committee approval of the performance range.
Implementation of Non-Executive Director remuneration policy for 2017/2018 
Base fee levels for the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors are currently £130,000 p.a. and £42,500 p.a. respectively, with an additional fee  
for the Audit and Remuneration Committee chairs of £7,500 p.a. and a fee for acting as the Senior Independent Director of £5,000 p.a. There will be 
no increases to these fees for 2017/2018. The Chairman continues to forego £20,000 p.a., which the Company donates, together with a matching 
sum from the Company, to registered charities.
Share ownership guidelines and Directors’ interests in the share capital of the Company (audited)
Shareholding guidelines are in place that require Executive Directors to acquire a holding equivalent to 200% of basic salary for the Chief Executive 
and 150% of basic salary for the Chief Financial Officer. These levels are considered appropriate to ensure that there is robust long-term alignment 
achieved between Executive Directors and shareholders. The net of tax number of deferred bonus shares or vested shares under the Company’s 
LTIP will normally be required to be retained until the guideline is met. Directors’ share dealings must be conducted in accordance with the 
Company’s Share Dealing Policy.

Under the ESOS 2001, LTIP and the Sharesave Scheme, awards of options over no more than an aggregate 10% of the Company’s issued share 
capital may be granted over new issue shares in any rolling ten-year period (with awards made under any other share plans also being counted).
As at 28 July 2017, excluding lapsed options and options exercised and satisfied from utilising existing issued shares, options over 8,759,794 shares 
(6.1% of the Company’s issued share capital) have been exercised through new shares or remain outstanding under all share plans and so count 
towards this limit.

Report set out on pages 32 to 35 also forms part of this report.
Details of significant events since the balance sheet date are contained in note 39 to the financial statements. An indication of likely future 
developments in the business of the Company and details of research and development activities are included in the Strategic Report.

Certain sections of this Annual Report contains forward-looking statements with respect to the strategy, financial condition, results, operations 
and businesses of the Group or markets in which the Group operates. These statements involve risk and uncertainty because they depend on 
circumstances that occur in the future and relate to specific events, not all of which are within the Group’s control. Although the Group believes 
that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, there are a number of factors that could cause actual results or 
developments to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. The Group undertakes no obligation to 
update any forward-looking statement. Nothing in the Annual Report should be construed as a profit forecast or an invitation to deal in the ordinary 
shares of St Ives plc.
DIRECTORS AND THEIR SHARE INTERESTS
The present membership of the Board is set out on pages 36 and 37. 
The Directors’ interests in ordinary shares of the Company are set out in the table on page 59 within the Directors’ Remuneration Report.

of 1.30 pence for each ordinary share payable on 18 December 2017 to holders on the register as at 24 November 2017. If approved, the final 
dividend will make total dividends for the year of 1.95 pence per ordinary share:

and safe working environment. Details of how we deliver on these commitments and communicate with our employees are provided in the 
Corporate and Social Responsibility Report on pages 28 to 31.
HUMAN RIGHTS
The Company does not have a specific human rights policy however ethical values and integrity are central to our businesses both in the UK and 
abroad. As a socially responsible business, we believe that we must operate legally, ethically and to approved policies at all times in order to deliver 
our customers the best service, consistent quality and confidence that the people who make and sell our products are not being exploited or 
exposed. Our Ethical Trading Policy establishes the principles which we expect our employees, contractors, agents, suppliers, consultants and other 
third parties with whom the Group trades to comply.
During the period, the Company published its first Modern Slavery Act Statement in accordance with section 54 of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 
(‘MSA’). The Company is completely opposed to any form of slavery and human trafficking and the Group will not knowingly do business with any 
organisation or body involved in slavery and human trafficking. More information on the Group’s approach to modern slavery can be found in the 
Corporate Social Responsibility section of the Strategic Report on pages 28 to 31. The Company’s MSA Statement can be found on its website at: 
www.st-ives.co.uk. 
GOING CONCERN
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position are set out in the 
Strategic Report.
The financial position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are described in the Financial Review. In addition,  
note 29 to the financial statements includes the Group’s objectives, policies and processes for managing its interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk, 
credit risk, liquidity risk and capital risk. The Strategic Report is to be found on pages 2 to 31.
During the period the Group has reduced its revolving credit facility to £95 million supplemented by a term loan of £30 million and increased its 
maximum leverage covenant condition (net debt to Adjusted EBITDA) for the remaining duration of the facility. Subsequent to the period end,  
the Group reduced its term loan by £5.5 million to £24.5 million.
As highlighted in note 28 to the financial statements, the Group meets its day-to-day working capital requirements through an overdraft facility  
of £15 million that is part of an overall funding facility of £125 million which falls due for renewal on 23 March 2019.  63
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT OUR FIGURES
St Ives plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
The current economic conditions create uncertainty, particularly over the level of demand for the Group’s services, but the Group’s forecasts and 
projections, taking account of reasonably possible changes in trading performance, show that the Group should be able to operate within the level 
of its current facility and obtain further financing when the current facility expires.
After making enquiries, the Directors consider that the Group has adequate resources and borrowing facilities to continue in operational existence 
for the foreseeable future. Consequently, they have continued to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
VIABILITY STATEMENT
In accordance with provision C.2.2 of the UK Corporate Governance Code, the Directors have assessed the Company’s viability over a three-year 
period, having taken account of the Company’s current situation and principal risks. A three-year assessment period, which is in alignment with 
our medium-term planning horizon, was selected as this gives management and the Board sufficient visibility of the future and is consistent with 
the average duration of contracts with key clients. Visibility is very limited beyond this horizon because of the fast changing nature of many of the 
markets in which the Company’s businesses operate. 
The analysis was performed by running a number of potentially stressful, yet plausible, scenarios against a base high level financial forecast over 
the three-year period starting from the end of the 2016/2017 financial year. The events reflected in the stress scenarios with the greatest financial 
impact included the potential closure of an operating site resulting from competitive pressure and a general decline in sales volumes of 10% due 
to challenging or uncertain economic conditions. The related scenarios reflected the estimated financial impact of the events associated with the 
principal risks outlined in the Principal Risks and Uncertainties Report from pages 24 to 27, and included mitigating actions where these would be 
under the Company’s control. Other scenarios were also modelled, including a weakening of the Pound Sterling against the US Dollar to 1:1.20,  
and the payment of the maximum possible remaining contingent consideration for The App Business.
In addition to an assessment of the impact the individual risks could have on the Company’s debt leverage and level of debt, the impact of a 
combination of the risks’ impacts occurring simultaneously was also modelled to test the results of a particularly high stress, combined scenario. 
To support the final conclusion on viability, the assessment also took account of potential mitigations available to the business in the event of the 
combined scenario. Additionally, the revolving credit facility is expected to be renewed within the three-year assessment period.
Based on this analysis, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as 
they fall due up to July 2020.
In making this statement, the Directors have also made key assumptions which they consider to be reasonable, for example on sales volumes and 
pricing, and on the availability of financing beyond the end of the term of the current bank credit facility in March 2019.
ACQUISITION OF THE COMPANY’S OWN SHARES
At the 2016 Annual General Meeting, shareholders approved an authority for the Company to make market purchases of its own shares up to a 
maximum of 14,249,966 shares. This authority ends on the date of the next Annual General Meeting. Since the year end, no ordinary shares have 
been purchased by the Company therefore, at the date of this Report, 90,637 ordinary shares are held in treasury.

DIRECTORS’ AND OFFICERS’ LIABILITY INSURANCE
The Company maintains Directors’ and Officers’ liability insurance which gives appropriate cover for legal action brought against its Directors.  
The Company has also granted indemnities to each of its Directors (on identical terms) who served during the period, to the extent permitted by 
law and the Company’s articles of association, in respect of liabilities incurred by virtue of their office. Qualifying third party provisions for the benefit 
of its Directors (as defined by Section 234 of the Companies Act 2006) were in force during the period ended 28 July 2017 and continue to be in 
force at the date of this Report. 
DIRECTORS’ CONFLICT OF INTEREST
In accordance with the provisions of Section 175 of the Companies Act 2006, the Company has procedures in place to deal with the situation where 
a Director has a conflict of interest and the Nomination Committee regularly reviews conflict authorisation. No conflicts of interests were identified 
during the period. Directors do not take part in discussions on matters in which they are interested and they may be requested to leave a meeting  
at which a matter in which they are interested is to be discussed.
CHANGE OF CONTROL
The Group has a revolving credit facility of £95 million supplemented by a term loan of £24.5 million, which falls due for renewal on 23 March 2019. 
The terms of the revolving credit facility and term loan stipulate that consent of the lenders to continue the overall facility is required, should there 
be a change of control of the Company.

STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors are required to prepare  
the Group financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRSs’) as adopted by the European Union and 
Article 4 of the IAS Regulation and have chosen to prepare the parent company financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law). Under company law the Directors must not approve the 
accounts unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and of the profit or loss of the Company 
for that year.
In preparing the Group financial statements, International Accounting Standard 1 requires that Directors:
• properly select and apply accounting policies;
• present information including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable information;
• provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in IFRSs are insufficient to enable users to understand the impact  
of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the entity’ s financial position and financial performance; and
• make an assessment of the Company’ s ability to continue as a going concern.
In preparing the parent company financial statements, the Directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
• state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial 
statements; and
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s transactions and 
disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply 
with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the 
prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the Company’s website. 
Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in  
other jurisdictions.
Directors’ responsibility statement:
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
• the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the relevant financial reporting framework, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, 
financial position and profit or loss of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole; and
• the Strategic Report includes a fair review of the development, position and performance of the business and the position of the Company and the 
undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face; and
• the Annual Report and Accounts, taken as a whole, are fair, balanced and understandable and provide the information necessary for shareholders to 
assess the Company’ s performance, business model and strategy.
This responsibility statement was approved by the Board of Directors on 2 October 2017 and is signed on its behalf by

REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
OPINION
In our opinion:
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the Parent Company’s affairs as at 28 July 2017 and of the 
Group’s loss for the period then ended;
• the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRSs’) as adopted 
by the European Union; 
• the Parent Company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting 
Practice including Financial Reporting Standard 101 ‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’; and
• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group 
financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
We have audited the financial statements of St Ives plc (the ‘Parent Company’) and its subsidiaries (the ‘Group’) which comprise:
• the Consolidated Income Statement;
• the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income;
• the Consolidated and Parent Company Balance Sheets;
• the Consolidated and Parent Company Statements of Changes in Equity;
• the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement;
• the related notes 1 to 40 of the Consolidated financial statements; and
• the related notes 1 to 19 of the Company financial statements.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the Group financial statements is applicable law and IFRSs as adopted 
by the European Union. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the Parent Company financial statements is 
applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards, including FRS 101 ‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’.
BASIS FOR OPINION
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (‘ISAs (UK)’) and applicable law. Our responsibilities under 
those standards are further described in the auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. 
We are independent of the Group and the Parent Company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the  
financial statements in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical Standard as applied to listed public interest entities, and we have fulfilled our other  
ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We confirm that the non-audit services prohibited by the FRC’s Ethical Standard  
were not provided to the Group or the Parent Company.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. St Ives plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 67

SUMMARY OF OUR AUDIT APPROACH
Key audit matters The key audit matters that we identified in the prior year were:
• Goodwill and intangible assets
• Retirement benefit obligations
• Valuation of Strategic Marketing revenue
• Classification and disclosure of Adjusting Items
• Acquisition Accounting (Deferred and Contingent Consideration)
No new matters have arisen in the current period and contingent acquisition accounting had been 
identified as a key audit matter in prior years reflecting the acquisitive nature of the Group. In the current 
year we have focused the risk to deferred and contingent consideration relating to previous acquisitions. 
Materiality The materiality that we used in the current year was £1,197,000 which was determined on the basis  
of Adjusted profit before tax.
Scoping Our scope last year comprised of a full audit for all main UK trading companies as well as an audit  
of specified account balances for Solstice in Chicago, due to the size and importance of this division  
to the Group. 
In the current year audit we have classified Solstice as a full scope audit and performed specified activities  
on a few of the smaller entities as detailed further below in our opinion. The percentage covered is similar 
year on year and explained in more detail further below. 
Significant changes  
in our approach
There were no changes in our audit approach apart from the matters described above.
 
CONCLUSIONS RELATING TO PRINCIPAL RISKS, GOING CONCERN AND VIABILITY STATEMENT
We have reviewed the Directors’ statement regarding the appropriateness of the going concern basis  
of accounting contained within note 1 to the financial statements and the Directors’ statement on the  
longer-term viability of the Group contained within the Strategic Report.
We are required to state whether we have anything material to add or draw attention to in relation to:
• the disclosures (on pages 24 to 27) that describe the principal risks and explain how they are being  
managed or mitigated;
• the Directors’ confirmation on page 65 that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal  
risks facing the Group, including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, 
solvency or liquidity;
• the Directors’ statement in note 1 to the financial statements about whether they considered it 
appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing them and their identification  
of any material uncertainties to the Group and the Parent Company’s ability to continue to do so over  
a period of at least twelve months from the date of approval of the financial statements;
• the Directors’ explanation (on page 63) as to how they have assessed the prospects of the Group,  
over what period they have done so and why they consider that period to be appropriate, and their 
statement as to whether they have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue  
in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their assessment, including any 
related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions; or
• whether the Directors’ statements relating to going concern and the prospects of the Company  
required in accordance with Listing Rule 9.8.6R(3) are materially inconsistent with our knowledge  
obtained in the audit.
We confirm that we have nothing 
material to add or draw attention 
to in respect of these matters.
We agreed with the Directors’ 
adoption of the going concern 
basis of accounting and we did 
not identify any such material 
uncertainties. However, because 
not all future events or conditions 
can be predicted, this statement 
is not a guarantee as to the 
Group’s ability to continue  
as a going concern. 68 St Ives plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF ST IVES PLC CONTINUED
KEY AUDIT MATTERS
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the 
current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) that we identified. These 
matters included those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts 
of the engagement team. 
These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not 
provide a separate opinion on these matters.
There are no new matters arising in the current year. 
Goodwill and intangible assets 
Key audit matter description The assessment of the carrying value of goodwill at £108.7 million (FY16 – £135.6 million) and acquired 
intangible assets of £42.2 million (FY16 – £52.0 million) involves considerable judgement due to the 
challenges in accurately forecasting future cash flows in the changing market environment. 
Data Marketing, Hive, Amaze, Service Graphics and Tactical Solutions were the most sensitive to changes  
in key assumptions and with the lowest headroom therefore we focused our testing on these entities. 
In the current year the impairments to goodwill totalled £27.1 million (FY16 – £12.3 million). Impairment 
charges of £21.1 million, £2.5 million and £3.5 million were recorded against SP Group, Service Graphics  
and Tactical Solutions’ respective assets. 
Key assumptions in management’s analysis include short and long-term growth rates and the discount rate 
applied to the future cash flows. Management disclose this as a key source of estimation uncertainty in note 2 
to the consolidated financial statements and this is detailed in note 16, and considered within the significant 
financial matters section of the Audit Committee report. 
How the scope of our audit 
responded to the key audit 
matter
We challenged management’s assumptions used in their impairment assessment of the Group’s goodwill and 
intangible assets. Our procedures included:
• assessing the short-term cash flow projections against recent performance, historical forecasting accuracy 
and gaining an understanding and challenging the key assumptions involved in the forecasts from 
management, including finance and those outside of finance along with agreeing the amounts to contract 
where available; 
• comparing the long-term forecasts against long-term economic growth rates from external data; 
• comparing the discount rate applied against a broad comparator group as well as involving our internal 
valuation specialists to assess the key components of the discount rate calculation; 
• considering the reasonableness of, and recalculating, the sensitivity assessment applied by management, 
and reviewing the sensitivity disclosure included in the Annual Report and Accounts;
• performing further sensitivity analysis of our own on the impairment model; and
• assessing the carrying value of the intangibles with specific focus on the ongoing use of the proprietary 
techniques and corroborating that the customer relationships remained in place.
Key observations We believe that the impairments recorded in the period are appropriate in light of the revised forecasts 
provided by management and are materially accurate. Following these impairment’s these CGU’s are 
supportable but sensitive to short term forecasts which has been appropriately disclosed in note 16.
We concur with management that a reasonably possible change in projected revenue growth for Service 
Graphics, Tactical Solutions, Data Marketing and Hive would indicate impairment and it is appropriate for 
additional disclosure to be provided.
Whilst the remaining CGU’s are dependent on both short and long-term growth assumptions we conclude 
that the assumptions applied in the impairment models, taken in aggregate, are within our acceptable range.  St Ives plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 69
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT OUR FIGURES
Retirement benefit obligations 
Key audit matter description Pension assets in FY17 is £354.5 million (FY16 – £344.1 million) and pension liabilities is £370.5 million in  
both FY17 and FY16. Therefore, the net pension deficit on the Consolidated Balance Sheet is £16.0 million  
(FY16 – £26.4 million). There is significant judgement involved in the valuation of the retirement benefit 
obligations. Therefore our key audit matter relates to the pension liability assumptions with the key 
assumptions being inflation rate and discount rate. Management has acknowledged this as a key source  
of estimation uncertainty in the accounting policy in note 2 and detailed in note 27, and considered within 
the significant financial matters section of the Audit Committee report.
How the scope of our audit 
responded to the key audit 
matter
The audit procedures we performed in respect of this risk included:
• meeting with the Group’s pensions advisors and management to discuss the valuation approach applied 
and the assumptions used in the valuation;
• using internal specialists to consider and challenge the actuarial assumptions adopted by the Group  
for the valuation of its retirement benefit obligations. This includes benchmarking the assumptions against 
a relevant comparator group.
Key observations We are satisfied that the methodology and assumptions applied in relation to determining the pension 
valuation, when taken in aggregate, fall within an acceptable range. 
Valuation of Strategic Marketing revenue 
Key audit matter description We pinpointed the key audit matter relating to strategic marketing revenue as the revenue related to 
incomplete projects at year end. This totalled £11.9 million in FY17 (FY16 – £11.4 million). 
In the strategic marketing businesses there are projects where revenue is recognised on a percentage 
of completion basis as noted in the revenue recognition policy in note 2 to the consolidated financial 
statements and detailed in note 3, we have also raised this as a key issue to the audit committee. There is a 
risk that revenue may be misstated due to the degree of judgement exercised by management in estimating 
future costs. We also note that revenue recognition carries with it a fraud risk. 
How the scope of our audit 
responded to the key audit 
matter
We have considered management’s application of revenue recognition policies to assess compliance with 
IAS 18 ‘Revenue’. In particular, this involved:
• reviewing the underlying contracts to assess whether revenue was correctly recognised in line with the 
contract; and
• pinpointing the key audit matter to projects not complete at period-end and challenging management  
on the percentage of revenue recognised for different projects and corroborating the judgements made 
to supporting information. 
Key observations We have not identified any issues or exceptions relating to revenue recognised over our reporting threshold. 
Classification and disclosure of Adjusting Items 
Key audit matter description Adjusting Items amount to £68.2 million (pre-tax) (FY16 – £36.1 million). This balance is made up of  
£3.0 million restructuring costs, £1.9 million pension costs and £66.1 million costs related to acquisitions 
made in the prior periods offset by £2.8 million income recognised from the sale of Property, Plant and 
Equipment. The increase from the prior period is due to higher impairment costs year on year. There is 
a risk that items relating to the ongoing business are being disclosed as adjusting and that items are not 
being split out in line with the Group accounting policy, which could distort the information presented to 
shareholders. 
Adjusting Items is detailed in the significant accounting policies in note 2 and detailed in note 7, and 
considered within the significant financial matters section of the Audit Committee report.
How the scope of our audit 
responded to the key audit 
matter
We challenged the appropriateness of the classification of Adjusting Items. Our procedures included:
• assessing whether there is sufficient justification for items to be classed as adjusting, particularly in the 
context of management’s accounting policy, as described in note 2;
• challenging management on how they have complied with the guidelines issued by ESMA on the APMs; 
and
• reviewing the Adjusting Items disclosure in note 7 of the accounts in line with IAS 1 ‘Presentation of 
financial statements’.
Key observations We are satisfied that the Adjusting Items have been classified in line with management’s accounting policy 
and that appropriate disclosure has been provided around the nature and quantum of each material item.  70 St Ives plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
OUR FIGURES 
INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF ST IVES PLC CONTINUED
Acquisition Accounting (Deferred/Contingent Consideration)
Key audit matter description Total deferred and contingent consideration on the balance sheet for FY17 is £15.9 million (FY16 – £1.8 million)  
and there is a risk that the treatment of amounts paid to former shareholders of acquired businesses is 
accounted for incorrectly. Post-acquisition, the risks relate to the EBITDA estimates for the earn-out targets 
and ensuring that the amounts classified as remuneration is correctly distributed over the period in which they 
relate. The EBITDA estimates directly impact the future deferred and contingent consideration expected to 
be paid and variances between forecasts and actuals can lead to significant variances in the timing of when 
deferred and contingent consideration is accounted for.
Deferred and contingent consideration is detailed in the significant accounting policies in note 2 and 
detailed in note 11, furthermore we have raised this to the audit committee as a key issue.
How the scope of our audit 
responded to the key audit 
matter
We challenged management’s assumptions used in their deferred and contingent consideration workings by 
performing the following procedures:
• reviewing the IFRS 3 workings which calculate the split between consideration and remuneration;
• assessing the forecast EBITDA estimates to ensure they align with the budgets used within goodwill 
impairment work, to ensure consistency of approach; and
• reviewing the amended workings for Solstice in light of the variation to the Membership Interest  
Purchase Agreement.
Key observations We consider that the accounting for deferred and contingent consideration has been performed correctly 
and that management have appropriately disclosed within the key sources of estimation uncertainty in  
note 2, the key sensitivities that exist.
OUR APPLICATION OF MATERIALITY
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements that makes it probable that the economic decisions of a 
reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced. We use materiality both in planning the scope of our audit work and in 
evaluating the results of our work. 
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:
Group materiality £1,197,000 (2016 – £1,430,000)
Basis for determining 
materiality
5% of Adjusted profit before tax (£23.6 million). Statutory loss before tax was adjusted to add back other 
pension costs classified as Adjusting Items by the Group (£0.5 million).
Rationale for the benchmark 
applied
In the past we have assessed that statutory income before tax was too variable to use as the sole benchmark 
for our materiality determination, and therefore as has occurred in prior periods we have considered a range 
of benchmarks using Revenue and profit before tax measures as a basis. 
Group materiality
£1.2 million
Adjusted profit 
before tax
£23.6 million
Component materiality range
 £0.1 million to £1.0 million
Audit Committee reporting 
threshold £0.06 million
95% Adjusted profit before tax
5% Group materiality
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the Committee all audit differences in excess of £59,000 (FY16 – £70,000), as well as 
differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. We also report to the Audit Committee on disclosure 
matters that we identified when assessing the overall presentation of the financial statements. St Ives plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 71
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT OUR FIGURES
AN OVERVIEW OF THE SCOPE OF OUR AUDIT
Our group audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of the Group and its environment, including group-wide controls, and assessing  
the risks of material misstatement at the Group level. Based on that assessment, and at the request of management and the Audit Committee,  
the following divisions were subject to full scope audit – Books, SP Group, Service Graphics, St Ives Management Services, Occam, Response One, 
Incite, Amaze, Realise, The App Business and Solstice. These locations represent the principal business units and account for 92% of the Group’s 
revenue, 92% of the Group’s Adjusted operating profit and 89% of the Group’s net assets. They were also selected to provide an appropriate basis 
for undertaking audit work to address the risks of material misstatement identified above. We performed analytical procedures on Hive, Tactical 
Solutions, Branded3, FSP and Pragma (representing the remaining 8% of both revenue and the Group’s Adjusted operating profit and 11% of the 
Group’s net assets). Our audit work at these locations was executed at levels of materiality applicable to each individual entity which were lower  
than group materiality and ranged from £178,000 to £1,014,000 (FY16 – £114,000 to £715,000). 
At the parent entity level we also tested the consolidation process and carried out analytical procedures to confirm our conclusion that there were 
no key audit matters of material misstatement of the aggregated financial information of the remaining components not subject to audit or audit  
of specified account balances.
The group audit team have ensured that they have maintained oversight of the work performed at the components by involving key component 
team members in our planning briefing, including a discussion of risk assessment, to ensure an integrated approach was followed. We have 
maintained regular communications with each component throughout the audit, attended closing meetings for each component, and reviewed 
documentation of the findings from their work.
During the course of the audit, the audit partner visited SP Group, St Ives Management Services, Response One and Occam. The audit manager 
also visited Incite.

OTHER INFORMATION
The Directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information 
included in the Annual Report, other than the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon.
Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent 
otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information 
and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial 
statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine 
whether there is a material misstatement in the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other 
information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of 
this other information, we are required to report that fact.
In this context, matters that we are specifically required to report to you as uncorrected material 
misstatements of the other information include where we conclude that:
Fair, balanced and understandable – the statement given by the Directors that they consider the Annual 
Report and financial statements taken as a whole is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the 
information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s performance, business model and strategy,  
is materially inconsistent with our knowledge obtained in the audit; or
Audit committee reporting – the section describing the work of the audit committee does not appropriately 
address matters communicated by us to the audit committee; or
Directors’ statement of compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code – the parts of the  
Directors’ statement required under the Listing Rules relating to the Company’s compliance with the  
UK Corporate Governance Code containing provisions specified for review by the auditor in accordance  
with Listing Rule 9.8.10R(2) do not properly disclose a departure from a relevant provision of the  
UK Corporate Governance Code.
We have nothing to report in 
respect of these matters.
RESPONSIBILITIES OF DIRECTORS
As explained more fully in the Directors’ responsibilities statement, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and 
for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the Directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation 
of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the Directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s and the parent company’s ability to continue as a going 
concern, disclosing as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Directors either 
intend to liquidate the Group or the parent company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
AUDITOR’S RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement,  
whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not 
a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise 
from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic 
decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting Council’s website at:  
www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor’s report.
USE OF OUR REPORT
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit 
work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report 
and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and 
the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. GENERAL INFORMATION

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
1. GENERAL INFORMATION CONTINUED
IFRS 15
The standard replaces IAS 18 ‘Revenue’ and specifies how and when an entity shall recognise revenue as well as providing users of financial 
statements with more informative and relevant disclosures. The Group is currently assessing the impact of the accounting changes that will arise 
under IFRS 15; however, the Group does expect that changes in the new standard relating to the treatment of incentive-based revenues and 
revenue recognised in respect of license fees will impact the timing of the revenue recognition for a number of the Group’s subsidiaries. 
IFRS 16
The standard will primarily change lease accounting for lessees; lease agreements will give rise to the recognition of an asset representing the right 
to use the leased item and a loan obligation for future lease payables. Lease costs will be recognised in the form of depreciation of the right to use 
asset and interest on the lease liability. Lessee accounting under IFRS 16 will be similar in many respects to existing IAS 17 accounting for finance 
leases, but will be substantively different to existing accounting for operating leases where rental charges are currently recognised on a straight-line 
basis and no lease asset or lease loan obligation is recognised.
Lessor accounting under IFRS 16 is similar to existing IAS 17 accounting and is not expected to have a material impact for the Group.
The Group is assessing the impact of the accounting changes that will arise under IFRS 16; however, the following changes to lessee accounting  
will have a material impact as follows: 
Right-of-use assets will be recorded for assets that are leased by the Group; currently no lease assets are included on the Group’s consolidated 
statement of financial position for operating leases.
Liabilities will be recorded for future lease payments in the Group’s consolidated statement of financial position for the “reasonably certain” period 
of the lease, which may include future lease periods for which the Group has extension options. Currently liabilities are generally not recorded 
for future operating lease payments, which are disclosed as commitments. The amount of lease liabilities will not equal the lease commitments 
reported on 31 July 2019, but may not be dissimilar. 
Lease expenses will be for depreciation of right-of-use assets and interest on lease liabilities; interest will typically be higher in the early  
stages of a lease and reduce over the term. Currently operating lease rentals are expensed on a straight-line basis over the lease term within 
operating expenses.
Operating lease cash flows are currently included within operating cash flows in the consolidated statement of cash flows; under IFRS 16 these will 
be recorded as cash flows from financing activities reflecting the repayment of lease liabilities (borrowings) and related interest.
 A high volume of transactions will be impacted by IFRS 16 and material judgements are required in identifying and accounting for leases. Therefore, 
the Group is continuing to assess the impact of these and other accounting changes that will arise under IFRS 16 and cannot reasonably estimate 
the impact; however, the changes highlighted above will have a material impact on the consolidated income statement, consolidated statement of 
financial position and consolidated statement of cash flows after the Group’s adoption on 2 August 2019.
Going concern
The Directors have, at the time of approving the financial statements, a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate 
resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Thus they continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in 
preparing the financial statements. Further detail is contained in the Directors’ Report on pages 62 to 64.
2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
(a) Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company (its subsidiary 
undertakings) for each period. Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee 
entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
The results of subsidiaries acquired during the period are included in the Consolidated Income Statement from the effective date of acquisition.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the results of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies into line with those of the Group.  
All intra-Group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation. St Ives plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 81
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT OUR FIGURES
(b) Adjusting Items
Statutory results (‘Statutory Results’) presented in the Consolidated Income Statement include Adjusting Items.
Income statement items are presented in the middle column under the heading ‘Adjusting Items’ where they are significant in size and either 
they do not form part of the underlying trading activities of the Group or, in the opinion of the Directors, their separate presentation enhances 
understanding of the financial performance of the Group and its businesses. Items included as Adjusting Items are as follows:
• Redundancies, restructuring costs and empty property costs
Redundancies and restructuring costs that occur as one-off costs in the individual businesses, that in aggregation can be significant in size, 
are recorded as Adjusting Items. Careful consideration is applied by management in assessing whether these costs relate to the restructure 
of a business within the Group or redundancies in the normal course of business which are not treated as Adjusting Items. Redundancies and 
restructuring costs related to the closure or disposal of a site are recorded within this caption. Empty property costs comprise expenses relating 
to the maintenance and security of leasehold property or property owned by the Group from which no on-going activity takes place. The costs do 
not relate to the continuing operations of the Group and are therefore recorded as Adjusting Items.
• Operating results of a site arising after a formal decision on its closure 
Operating losses from non-continuing sites, where that site does not meet the definition of a discontinued operation under IFRS 5 – Non Current 
Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations, include revenue, operational and overhead expenses incurred after a formal decision on a 
site’s closure has been taken. These items also include settlement of onerous leases, costs related to the transfer of assets and professional fees 
related to closure of the site. The above items are recorded as Adjusting Items on the basis that they do not form part of the on-going trading 
activities of the Group.
• St Ives Defined Pension Benefits Scheme income/expense
The Scheme was closed to new entrants in April 2002 and to the accrual of future benefits in August 2008. Given the substantial change in 
the composition of the Group over the last seven years, with a significant number of site closures and disposal of businesses which employed 
Scheme members, the number of scheme members still employed by the Group has declined substantially and stood at 161 as at 28 July 2017, 
representing less than 5% of the total Scheme membership. After the closure of the Scheme, all the in-service members at that time were 
transferred to a defined contribution scheme. Payments to the defined contribution scheme are expensed to the Consolidated Income Statement 
and are treated as part of on-going activities and not as an Adjusting Item. Therefore the Group classifies the income or expenses relating to the 
Scheme as an Adjusting Item.
• Non-cash impairment charges related to goodwill and other assets 
Impairment charges relate to non-current and current assets are non-cash items, do not occur in the normal course of business and tend to be 
significant in size and irregular in nature. The presentation of this item as an Adjusting Item further enhances the understanding of the on-going 
performance of the Group.
• Costs related to acquisitions made in prior periods
The Group has grown both organically with the development of new operating subsidiaries and through acquisition. However, there is significant 
inconsistency between the accounting treatment of the goodwill and intangibles associated with the acquisition of businesses and those 
generated internally. The treatment of acquired goodwill and intangibles is further complicated by the differences in accounting rules prevailing 
at the time of various acquisitions (pre and post introduction of IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations’). On an unadjusted basis, a business acquired 
under IFRS 3 would report substantially lower operating profits and a lower return on capital than a business acquired prior to the introduction  
of IFRS 3 and also to those businesses which have been developed by the Group, thus making comparison of performance of the businesses  
and segments difficult.
Therefore the following items are recorded as Adjusting Items to provide a more realistic and comparable view of the businesses and enhance 
the clarity of the performance of the Group and its businesses to the readers of the accounts:
(i) Amortisation charges related to intangible assets identified through acquisition accounting;
(ii) Expenses related to contingent consideration required to be treated as remuneration for acquired businesses;
(iii) Charges and credits arising from the re-estimation of deferred consideration payable in respect of acquisitions; and
(iv) Charges related to the acquisition of businesses or the setting up of new subsidiaries.
• Gain or loss associated with disposal of trade, subsidiaries or assets 
The gain or loss on disposal of trade, subsidiaries or assets tends to be significant in size and irregular in nature. The disposal of property,  
plant and equipment is primarily associated with closed sites or businesses that have been disposed of by the Group. Therefore the gain or loss 
on the disposal of these assets is treated as an Adjusting Item.
When reviewing these items, the Directors considered the guidelines issued by the European Securities and Markets Authority (‘ESMA’).
The results, excluding Adjusting Items, are presented in the Consolidated Income Statement under the heading ‘Adjusted Results’, in order  
to provide a consistent and comparable view of the performance of the Group’s on-going business. 
A reconciliation of Statutory Results to Adjusted Results can be found in the Consolidated Income Statement. Further details relating to the 
Adjusting Items are available in note 7. 82 St Ives plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017

2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
(c) Revenue recognition
Revenue from supply of goods and services is measured at the fair value of consideration received or receivable and comprises amounts receivable 
for goods and services, net of trade discounts, up-front payments, VAT and other sales-related taxes. 
Revenue for goods is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement when all the following conditions are satisfied:
• the significant risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the customer, normally on shipment of the product;
• the amount of revenue can be measured reliably;
• it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the entity; and 
• the costs incurred or to be incurred in respect of the transaction can be measured reliably.
Revenue for service is recognised as services that are delivered or in proportion to the level of services performed. Revenue for the level of services 
performed is recognised using the stage of completion method when the outcome can be measured reliably. 
The stage of completion is determined using relevant criteria including:
• Services performed as a percentage of total services
• Costs incurred to date as a proportion to the estimated total cost of the transaction such as market research fees.
• Services performed, on time basis, i.e. where the terms of contract have provision for licensing the product on a subscription basis, revenue  
is recognised over the subscription period on a straight-line basis.
• Services that are linked to delivering goods to fulfil the contract, the revenue is recognised when the goods are delivered to the customer.  
The goods can be delivered in full or in-part quantities.
The Group uses two main inputs in the measurement of the services performed and the total services:
(i) Time spent by staff:
The stage of completion is determined by the time incurred by operational staff to date compared to the total estimated on an individual  
project basis.
(ii) Progress against contracted outputs:
Where applicable, the value of time spent by staff is further validated against the relevant output measures such as project milestones achieved  
as contracted, number of reports delivered to the customer compared to the total reports contracted.
Income from advance billings is deferred and released to the Consolidated Income Statement when conditions for its recognition have  
been fulfilled.
Interest income
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable.
(d) Intangible assets
Goodwill
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of a subsidiary represents the excess of the cost of the acquisition over the net fair value of the identifiable 
assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the subsidiary at the date of the acquisition. Fair value is finalised within twelve months of the date  
of the acquisition. Goodwill is not amortised but reviewed for impairment annually in accordance with the impairment of goodwill policy  
set out in note 2 (g) below.
Other intangible assets – computer software
Computer software that is not integral to an item of property, plant or equipment is classified as an intangible asset and is held on the  
Consolidated Balance Sheet at cost less amortisation and impairments. These assets are amortised over their estimated useful lives, which are 
generally two to five years.
Other intangible assets – customer relationships 
Customer relationships identified as separable intangible assets in the context of business combinations are capitalised at their fair value at the date 
of acquisition. They are amortised over their estimated useful lives, which are generally two to ten years. 
Other intangible assets – proprietary techniques
Proprietary techniques identified as separable intangible assets in the context of business combinations are capitalised at their fair value at the date 
of acquisition. They are amortised over their estimated useful lives, which are generally three to ten years.
Other intangible assets – trademarks
Trademarks identified as separable intangible assets in the context of business combinations are capitalised at their fair value at the date of 
acquisition. They are amortised over their estimated useful lives, which are generally ten years. 
All intangible assets with finite lives are amortised on a straight-line basis. St Ives plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 83
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT OUR FIGURES
(e) Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment held for use in the production or supply of goods and services, or for administration purposes is stated in the 
Consolidated and Company Balance Sheets at deemed cost less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Costs are recognised as an asset only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost 
of the item can be measured reliably. All repairs and maintenance are charged to the Consolidated Income Statement during the period in which 
they are incurred. 
Assets in the course of construction are carried at cost less any recognised impairment loss. Cost includes professional fees. Depreciation of these 
assets commences when the assets are ready for their intended use.
Freehold land is not depreciated.
Depreciation is charged, other than on freehold land and assets under the course of construction, so as to write off the cost or valuation of assets 
over their estimated useful lives, using the straight-line method, on the following basis:
Freehold buildings       2% – 4%
Long leases       Period of lease
Plant and machinery       10% – 33

/
3
%
Fixture, fittings and equipment       10% – 33

Motor vehicles          20% – 25%
An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected to arise from the 
continued use of the asset. The gain or loss arising on the disposal or scrappage of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales 
proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in income.
(f) Impairment of property, plant, equipment and intangible assets excluding goodwill
At each balance sheet date the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its property, plant and equipment and intangible assets to determine 
whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered any impairment loss.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any).  
Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the  
cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value-in-use. In assessing value-in-use, the estimated future cash flows  
are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessment of the time value of money and the risks 
specific to the assets for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted. 
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset 
(cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised immediately as an expense in the Consolidated 
Income Statement. 
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (cash-generating unit) is increased to the revised estimate of its 
recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no 
impairment loss been recognised for the asset (cash-generating unit) in prior periods. 
A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised as income immediately in the Consolidated Income Statement.
(g) Impairment of goodwill
Goodwill arising on acquisition is allocated to the Group of cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the 
combination. A cash-generating unit represents the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored by the Group’s Board of Directors for internal 
management purposes. The recoverable amount of the Group of cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated is tested for 
impairment annually on a consistent date during each financial period, or more frequently when such events or changes in circumstances indicate 
that it may be impaired. If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is 
allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of 
the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. 
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the Consolidated Income Statement. Impairments of goodwill are not subsequently reversed.
On disposal of a cash-generating unit, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal. 84 St Ives plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017

(h) Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost comprises direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour costs and those production overheads that have been incurred in bringing  
the inventories to their present location and condition. Cost is valued on a first in, first out (‘FIFO’) basis. Net realisable value is the estimated  
selling price less the estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in selling and distribution.
(i) Tax
The tax expense in the Consolidated Income Statement comprises tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on the taxable profit for the period. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the Consolidated Income 
Statement because it excludes items of income and expense that are taxable or deductible in other periods and it further excludes items that are 
never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the 
balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the accounts and the corresponding tax bases 
used in the computation of taxable profit; and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally 
recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be 
available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary differences 
arise on non-deductible goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than business combinations) of other assets or liabilities in a transaction that 
affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit. 
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, except where the Group is able to 
control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and is reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that 
sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered. 
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised. Deferred tax  
is charged or credited in the Consolidated Income Statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited in other comprehensive income, 
in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income or when it relates to items that are 
charged or credited to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income or directly to the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current assets against current liabilities and when they 
relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis. 
Current tax and deferred tax for the year
Current tax and deferred tax are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement, except when they relate to items that are recognised in the 
Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income or directly to the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity. Where current tax or deferred 
tax arises from the initial accounting for a business combination, the tax effect is included in the accounting for the business combination.
(j) Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that the Group will be required  
to settle the obligation, and its value can be reliably estimated. When a provision needs to be released, the provision is taken back to the 
Consolidated Income Statement within the line where it was initially booked.
Provisions for repairs
Provisions for repairs are made where the Group is committed under the terms of the lease to make repairs to leasehold property. The provision  
is made for the estimated cost over the period of the lease.
Provisions for restructuring costs
Provisions for restructuring costs are recognised when the Group has a detailed formal plan for the restructuring that has been communicated  
to affected parties.
(k) Foreign currencies
The individual statements of each Group company are presented in the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates  
(its functional currency). For the purpose of the consolidated financial statements, the results and financial position of each Group company are 
expressed in Sterling, which is the functional currency of the Company, and the presentation currency for the consolidated financial statements.
Transactions in foreign currencies other than Sterling are translated at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets  
and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated to Sterling at the exchange rate ruling at that date. St Ives plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 85
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT OUR FIGURES
Exchange differences are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement in the period in which they arise except for:
• exchange differences on transactions entered into to hedge certain foreign currency risks; and
• exchange differences on monetary items receivable from or payable to a foreign operation for which settlement is neither planned nor likely 
to occur in the foreseeable future (therefore forming part of the net investment in the foreign operation), which are recognised initially in the 
Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income and reclassified to the Consolidated Income Statement on disposal or partial disposal  
of the net investment.
Foreign currency differences arising on translation or settlement of monetary items are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.  
Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate  
at the date of the transaction and not retranslated each period end. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that  
are stated at fair value are translated to Sterling at exchange rates ruling at the date the fair value was determined. Exchange gains and losses 
arising on the retranslation of non-monetary assets and liabilities are recognised directly in a separate component of Consolidated Statement  
of Comprehensive Income. 
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign operation  
and translated at the period end closing rate.
(l) Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the Consolidated Balance Sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions of the instrument.
The Group classifies its investments in the following categories:
    Fair value 
    measurement
Financial instrument category Note Classification Measurement hierarchy*
Investment property 15 Investment property Amortised cost 2
Available for sale investments  17 Available-for-sale financial assets Fair value through profit and loss 3
Trade and other receivables 20 Loans and receivables Amortised cost N/A
Cash and cash equivalents 20 Loans and receivables Amortised cost N/A
Trade and other payables 22 Other financial liabilities Amortised cost N/A
Derivative financial instruments 21 Derivative instrument Fair value through profit and loss 2
Deferred consideration payable 11 Other financial liabilities Fair value through profit and loss 3
Bank borrowings  23 Other financial liabilities  Amortised cost N/A
*The fair value measurement hierarchy is only applicable for financial instruments measured at fair value.
Fair value measurements, where applicable, are categorised into Level 1, 2 or 3 based on the degree to which the inputs to the fair value 
measurements are observable and the significance of the inputs to the fair value measurement in its entirety, which are described as follows: 
• Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Group can access at the  
measurement date;
• Level 2 inputs are inputs, other than quoted prices included within Level 1, that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly  
or indirectly; and
• Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. 
The Group’s primary categories of financial instruments are listed below:
Trade and other receivables
Trade receivables do not carry any interest and are stated at their nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable 
amounts. Allowances are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement when there is objective evidence that their asset is impaired.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and demand deposits.
Bank borrowings
Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded as the proceeds receivable, net of direct issue costs. Finance expenses are accounted for  
on an accruals basis in the Consolidated Income Statement using the effective interest rate method and are included in creditors to the extent that 
they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Available for sale investments
Unlisted shares held by the Group are classified as being available-for-sale and are stated at fair value. Fair values of unlisted shares are calculated 
with reference to exit price. All available-for-sale investments carried at fair value have been fair valued using a level 3 measurement as per the fair 
value hierarchy defined in IFRS 7. Gains or losses arising from changes in fair value are recognised directly in equity, until the security is disposed of 
or is determined to be impaired, at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in equity is included in the Consolidated Income 
Statement for the period.  86 St Ives plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
(l) Financial instruments continued
Trade and other payables
Trade payables are not interest bearing and are stated at their nominal value.
Investment properties
Investment properties are properties which are held to earn rental income and are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. 
Depreciation is charged between 2% to 4% per annum so as to write off the cost or valuation of assets over their estimated useful lives, using the 
straight-line method.
An investment property is derecognised upon disposal or when the investment property is permanently withdrawn from use and no future economic 
benefits are expected from the disposal. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the property (calculated as the difference between the net 
disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset) is included in the Consolidated Income Statement in the period in which the property  
is derecognised.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting
The Group’s activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. The Group uses 
derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange for the purchase of subsidiaries, goods and services denominated in 
foreign currencies and the sale of goods and services similarly denominated.
The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Group’s policies approved by the Board of Directors, which provide written principles on the use 
of financial derivatives consistent with the Group’s risk management strategy. The Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for 
speculative purposes.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated and effective as cash flow hedges of forecast transactions are 
recognised directly in equity and the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the Consolidated Income Statement.
If the cash flow hedge of a firm commitment or forecast transaction results in the recognition of an asset or liability, then, at the time the asset or 
liability is recognised, the associated gains and losses on the derivative that had previously been recognised in equity are included in the initial 
measurements of the asset or liability. For the hedges that do not result in the recognition of an asset or liability, amounts deferred in equity are 
recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement in the same period as gains or losses are recognised on the hedged item.
The gain or loss on hedging instruments relating to the effective portion of a net investment hedge is recognised in equity and the ineffective 
portion is recognised immediately in the Consolidated Income Statement. Gains or losses accumulated in equity are included in the Consolidated 
Income Statement when the foreign operations are disposed of.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or no longer qualifies for  
hedge accounting.
At that time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is retained in equity until the forecast transaction occurs.  
If a hedge transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in equity is included in the Consolidated 
Income Statement for the period. Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other host contracts are treated as separate derivatives 
when their risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of their host contracts and the host contracts are not carried at fair value with 
unrealised gains or losses reported in the Consolidated Income Statement.
Those derivatives which are not designed as hedges are classified as held for trading and gains and losses on those instruments are recognised 
immediately in the Consolidated Income Statement.
A derivative with a positive fair value is recognised as a financial asset whereas a derivative with a negative fair value is recognised as  
a financial liability.
Deferred/contingent consideration payable 
Deferred/contingent consideration payable and consideration required to be treated as remuneration are typically determined based on a multiple 
of future incremental EBITDA, and the related amounts are based on forecasts that have been derived from the most recent budgets and forecasts. 
Any change in the fair value of the outcome is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement as an Adjusting Item. The deferred consideration 
payable and accrued contingent consideration required to be treated as remuneration are recognised as financial liabilities, where amounts are 
expected or required to be cash settled. Where amounts are payable in the issuance of future PLC shares amounts required to settle the liability are 
recorded in equity.
The Directors consider that the carrying value of all financial assets and liabilities is approximately equal to their fair value, except for investment 
properties, which are recorded at amortised cost. Further details are provided in note 28. St Ives plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 87
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT OUR FIGURES
(m) Retirement benefits
The Group operates both defined benefits and defined contribution schemes for its employees. Payments to the defined contribution schemes are 
expensed to the Consolidated Income Statement as they fall due.
For the St Ives Defined Benefits Pension Scheme (the ‘Scheme’) full actuarial calculations are carried out every three years using the projected unit 
credit method and updates are performed for each financial period end. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they 
occur. They are recognised outside the Consolidated Income Statement and presented in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
The retirement benefits obligation recognised in the Consolidated Balance Sheet represents the present value of the defined benefits obligations 
and unrecognised past service costs, and as reduced by the fair value of the scheme’s assets.
Any asset resulting from this calculation is limited to past service costs, plus the present value of available refunds and reductions to the scheme.
Past service cost is recognised immediately to the extent that the benefits are already vested, and otherwise is amortised on a straight-line basis 
over the average period until the benefits become vested.
The Scheme was closed to new entrants in 2002 and to the future accrual of benefits in 2008. The composition of the Group has changed 
significantly since 2008 with a number of Companies sold or closed and from June 2010 to date the Group has made twelve acquisitions. Given the 
closure of the Scheme and the change in the composition of the Group, the Board has concluded that the Scheme’s income and expenses do not 
relate to the underlying trading activities of the Group. Furthermore the underlying assumptions used in the Scheme’s valuation are determined 
by reference to external market data (notably discount and inflation rates) that are outside the Group’s control and can vary significantly between 
periods. The Group’s accounting policy is to record the income and expenses related to the Scheme as an Adjusting Item.
Defined benefit income and expenses are split into three categories:
• gains and losses on curtailments and settlements and costs incurred in the running of the Scheme;
• net pension finance charge; and
• remeasurement of gains and losses.
The Group presents the first two components of the Scheme’s costs within Adjusting Items in its Consolidated Income Statement and the  
re-measurement costs within the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. Past service costs are recognised as an Adjusting Item  
in the Consolidated Income Statement
(n) Share-based payments
The Group makes equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees, which are measured at fair value at the date of the grant. The fair 
value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based 
on the Group’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest. At each balance sheet date, the Group revises its estimate of the number of equity 
instruments expected to vest as a result of the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions. The impact of the revision of the original estimates, 
if any, is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement such that the cumulative expense reflects the revised estimate, with a corresponding 
adjustment to equity reserves. The fair value of share options issued is measured using a binomial model, for the effects of non-transferability, 
exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
SAYE share options granted to employees are treated as cancelled when employees cease to contribute to the scheme. This results in accelerated 
recognition of the expenses that would have arisen over the remainder of the original vesting period.
The cumulative expense is reversed when an employee in receipt of the share options terminates service prior to the completion of the vesting 
period. Where the terms of an equity-settled award are modified on termination of the employment, the total fair value of the share-based 
payments is recorded in the Consolidated Income Statement.
(o) Leases
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee.  
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Rental costs under operating leases are charged to the Consolidated Income Statement in equal amounts over the terms of the lease.
In the event that lease incentives are received to enter into operating leases, such incentives are recognised as a liability. The aggregate benefit  
of incentives is recognised as a reduction of rental expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 88 St Ives plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
OUR FIGURES 
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
(p) Business combinations
Acquisitions of subsidiaries and businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method. The consideration for each acquisition is measured 
at the aggregate of the fair values (at the date of exchange) of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed by the Group together with the equity 
instruments equivalent to the mid-market share price on the date of completion, in exchange for control of the acquiree. Acquisition-related costs 
are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement as incurred. 
Where applicable, the consideration for the acquisition includes any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement, 
measured at its acquisition-date fair value. Subsequent changes in such fair values are adjusted against the cost of acquisition where they qualify 
as measurement period adjustments (see below). All other subsequent changes in the fair value of contingent consideration classified as an asset, 
liability or equity are accounted for in accordance with relevant IFRSs.
Contingent consideration payable to selling shareholders who continue to be employed by the Group, but which is automatically forfeited  
upon termination of employment, is classified as remuneration for post-combination services and is recorded in the Consolidated Income 
Statement. The contingent consideration is satisfied in cash and equity instruments equivalent to the mid-market share price on the date  
of the consideration payable. 
The cash-settled contingent consideration treated as remuneration for post-combination services is recognised in accordance with IAS 19 (revised) 
Employee Benefits and has been recorded as deferred consideration payable in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. At each balance sheet date, the 
Group revises its estimate for the contingent consideration payable which is to be settled in cash. The impact of the revision, if any, is recognised 
in the Consolidated Income Statement such that the cumulative expense reflects the revised estimate, with a corresponding adjustment to the 
Consolidated Balance Sheet.
The equity settled contingent consideration treated as remuneration for post-combination services is recognised in accordance with IFRS 2 
Share-Based Payments and is recorded in equity reserves. Further details can be found in the share-based payments accounting policy. At each 
balance sheet date, the Group revises its estimate of the consideration payable which is to be settled in shares. The impact of the revision, if any, is 
recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement such that the cumulative expense reflects the revised estimate, with a corresponding adjustment 
to equity reserves.
The acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 (2008) are recognised  
at their fair value at the acquisition date, except that: 
• deferred tax assets or liabilities and liabilities or assets related to employee benefit arrangements are recognised and measured in accordance 
with IAS 12 Income Taxes and IAS 19 Employee Benefits respectively;
• liabilities or equity instruments related to the replacement by the Group of an acquiree’s share-based payment awards are measured in 
accordance with IFRS 2 Share-based Payment; and
• assets (or disposal groups) that are classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued 
Operations are measured in accordance with that Standard.
If the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which the combination occurs, the Group 
reports provisional amounts for the items for which the accounting is incomplete. Those provisional amounts are adjusted during the measurement 
period (see below), or additional assets or liabilities are recognised, to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed 
as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the amounts recognised as of that date. 
The measurement period is the period from the date of acquisition to the date that the Group obtains complete information about facts and 
circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date, and is subject to a maximum of one year.
The value of non-controlling interests in subsidiaries is calculated initially as their share of identifiable net assets, and is subsequently adjusted by 
their share of comprehensive income.
(q) Joint arrangements
Joint arrangements are entities where no one party is able to exercise overall control in which the Group has an interest. The Group’s share of the 
post-tax results of its joint arrangements is included in the Consolidated Income Statement using the equity method of accounting. Where the 
Group transacts with a joint arrangement, profits and losses are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in the joint arrangement.
Investments in joint arrangements are carried in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at cost plus post-acquisition changes in the Group’s share of net 
assets of the entity, less any provision for impairment.
(r) Non-current assets held for sale
Non-current assets classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of amortised cost and fair value less costs of disposal. Non-current assets 
are classified as held for sale if their carrying value will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use. This condition 
is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and the asset is available for immediate sale in its present condition. The sale should be 
completed within one year from the date of classification as an asset held for sale. St Ives plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 89

(s) Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
In the course of applying the Group’s accounting policies the following estimations and accounting judgements have been made which could  
have a significant effect on the results of the Group were they subsequently found to be inappropriate.
Critical accounting judgements
In certain cases judgement is required in assessing whether amounts payable on acquisition and subsequently should fall to be treated as 
consideration or subsequent remuneration. 
Based on the substance of the agreement and historical experience of settlement the third tranche of deferred/contingent consideration 
payable for Solstice of £19,903,000 is treated as contingent consideration required to be treated as remuneration. £11,610,000 is recognised in 
the consolidated income statement in the current period and the remaining amount of £8,293,000 will be charged to the Consolidated Income 
Statement in future financial periods. The total amount is contingent on the achievement of the incremental EBITDA and on the continued 
employment of certain Group employees. 
Based on the substance of the agreement and historical experience of settlement the third tranche of deferred/contingent consideration for  
TAB of £16,087,000 is treated as contingent consideration required to be treated as remuneration. £7,277,000 is recognised in the Consolidated 
Income Statement in the current period and the remaining amount of £8,810,000 will be charged to the Consolidated Income Statement in future 
financial periods. The total amount is contingent on the achievement of the incremental EBITDA and on the continued employment of certain  
Group employees.
The key sources of estimation uncertainty in relation to the estimated deferred/contingent consideration payable can be found below.
 
Key sources of estimation uncertainty
Impairment of goodwill
Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the value-in-use of the cash-generating units for which goodwill has been 
identified. In arriving at the value in use the forecast of future cash flows of cash-generating units and selection of appropriate discount rates is 
required to calculate present values, a process which involves estimation. The recoverability analysis indicates that, other than as indicated in note 
16, the carrying amount of goodwill will be recovered in full. The situation will be monitored closely should future developments indicate that 
adjustments are appropriate. The carrying value of goodwill at the balance sheet date was £108.7 million (2016 – £135.6 million). A sensitivity  
analysis can be found in note 16.
Impairment of acquired intangibles and property, plant and equipment
The Group considers the recoverability of acquired intangibles and property, plant and equipment which are included within the Consolidated 
Balance Sheet at £42.8 million and £26.2 million respectively. The key areas of judgement when assessing the recoverability of these assets are in 
relation to the discount rates, terminal growth rates, budgets and forecasts to be applied to forecast cash flows. A sensitivity analysis can be found 
in note 16.
Retirement benefits obligations
The calculation of retirement benefits obligations requires estimates to be made of discount rates, inflation rates, future salary and pension 
increases and mortality. The net deficit in the Consolidated Balance Sheet for the retirement benefits scheme was £16.0 million (2016 – £26.4 million). 
A sensitivity analysis can be found in note 27.
Deferred/contingent consideration payable
Estimated deferred/contingent consideration for Solstice and TAB of £15.5 million – excluding the working capital consideration payable, recorded 
at the balance sheet date, is dependent upon the incremental level of EBITDA to be achieved by the respective businesses, which are based on the 
forecasts approved by the Board. The critical accounting judgement in relation to the estimated deferred/contingent consideration payable can be 
found above.
Further details and a sensitivity analysis can be found in note 11.

11. ACQUISITIONS
Solstice Consulting LLC
In March 2015, the Group acquired 100% of the equity stock of Solstice Consulting LLC (‘Solstice’). The deferred consideration is payable in three 
tranches dependent upon the level of EBITDA achieved by Solstice for the calendar years ending 2016, 2017 and 2018.The estimated deferred 
consideration payable for the third tranche is £19,903,000.
The App Business Limited
In January 2016, the Group acquired 100% of the share capital in The App Business Limited (‘TAB’). The deferred consideration is payable in four 
tranches dependent upon the level of EBITDA achieved by TAB for the years ending 30 April 2016, 30 April 2017, 30 April 2018 and 30 April 2019.
The estimated deferred consideration for the second, third and fourth tranches is £16,087,000. A further £424,000 of deferred consideration payable 
is relation to the working capital of The App Business Limited. This is payable based on the submission of tax returns.

Sensitivity analysis
The significant unobservable input used in the fair value measurement of the deferred/contingent consideration payable is future incremental 
EBITDA of the acquired entity. Significant increases in incremental EBITDA would result in an increase in deferred consideration payable.
As at the balance sheet date the Group has recorded the maximum possible level of deferred consideration in respect of Solstice. A sensitivity 
analysis in respect of deferred/contingent consideration payable for TAB is as follows:

SP Group, Service Graphics and Tactical Solutions are reported within the Marketing Activation segment. All other CGUs are reported within the 
Strategic Marketing segment. The Data Marketing CGU represents Occam and Response One.
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired. 
Current period
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined using a value-in-use calculation. The key assumptions for the value-in-use calculations  
are those regarding discount rates, terminal growth rates and cash flow forecasts in the medium term. Management estimates discount rates  
using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGUs. The Group prepares 
cash flow forecasts derived from five year forecasts. These include Board approved two year forecasts for the financial periods 2018 and 2019 and 
forecasts based on a revenue growth rate of 2.6% for the financial periods 2020, 2021 and 2022. In addition, a terminal value has been included in 
the value-in-use calculation for each CGU. 
The terminal growth rate used for each entity, and the growth rate used for the financial periods 2020, 2021 and 2022 was 2.6%, except for SP Group 
and Tactical Solutions, where Nil terminal growth was assumed. The terminal growth rate for CGUs other than SP and Tactical Solutions is calculated 
using a growth rate of 0.6% and a long-term inflation rate of 2.0% (in line with the Bank of England’s target for this measure), giving a nominal 
growth rate of 2.6%.
The key assumptions used in the value-in-use calculations and the sensitivities to the short-term growth, key revenue growth and pre-tax discount 
rate assumptions are detailed below.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT OUR FIGURES
Reasonably possible changes in key assumptions
The projected revenue growth for Service Graphics is highly dependent on a limited number of key clients and is subject to the risk of pricing 
pressure exerted by retail clients. In event of the further loss of a key customer, this could result in a further impairment of between £4,500,000  
and £6,500,000.
The projected revenue growth for Tactical Solutions is highly dependent on a limited number of key clients and is subject to the risk of further 
pricing pressure exerted by retail clients. A number of contracts are currently being re-tendered and the loss of a key customer could result in the 
full impairment of the goodwill and other intangible assets.
During the period the Data Marketing businesses were consolidated under a single management team in order to best support the expanding 
digital and data requirements of customers. The current priority within our Data Marketing businesses is to ensure that our offerings are fully 
compliant with, and so able to benefit from, the new General Data Protection Regulation (‘GDPR’) being implemented from May 2018. The impact 
of these new rules could have the potential to negatively impact the sector and so affect our five year forecasts and projected revenue growth rates. 
As outlined in the table above, the value-in-use calculation is highly sensitive to changes in forecast revenue and a reasonably possible reduction in 
revenue growth rates is likely to result in an impairment in goodwill and other intangible assets. At the present time, the impact of the introduction 
of GDPR cannot be quantified.
The US operations for the Hive CGU are currently at an early stage and are growing organically, as such the forecasts and projected revenue  
growth rates are very sensitive. As outlined in the table above, anything more than a 6.7% cumulative reduction in the five year growth forecast  
of Hive could result in an impairment of the Hive goodwill.
Prior period
The terminal revenue growth rate used for each entity in the prior period was 2.6%, except for SP Group, where a terminal growth of Nil was 
assumed. The pre-tax discount rate used in the prior period for Solstice, a US based subsidiary, was 10.01%. The pre-tax discount rate used  
for all the other entities was 10.23%.

During the current period the Group reduced its revolving credit facility to £95 million supplemented by a term loan of £30 million and increased its 
maximum leverage covenant condition (net debt to Adjusted EBITDA) for the remaining duration of the facility. Up to £15 million may be drawn as 
an overdraft facility. Interest on loan drawdowns is charged at LIBOR plus a margin which varies between 1.65% and 2.60%, depending on the ratio 
of the Group’s net debt to EBITDA excluding Adjusting Items. Interest on overdraft drawdowns is charged at 2.00% over UK base rate. 
As at 28 July 2017, the Group’s outstanding loans within this facility were £80.2 million (2016 – £92.6 million). The undrawn portion of this facility  
at 28 July 2017 was £44.8 million (2016 – £32.4 million). 
Subsequent to the period end the Group reduced its term loan facility by £5.5 million to £24.5 million.

Defined contribution schemes
The Group operates defined contribution schemes for all qualifying employees. The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the 
Group in funds under control of the trustees. Payments to the schemes are expensed to the Consolidated Income Statement as they fall due. 
The total expense recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement for continuing operations of £3,826,000 (2016 – £3,859,000) represents 
contributions payable to these schemes by the Group at rates specified in the rules of the schemes. At 28 July 2017, contributions of £628,000  
(2016 – £615,000) due in respect of the 2017 reporting period had not been paid over to the schemes. The amounts were paid over subsequent  
to the balance sheet date, within the requisite time limits.
St Ives Defined Benefits Pension Scheme 
The Group operates the St Ives Defined Benefits Pension Scheme (the ‘Scheme’) with assets held in separate trustee administered funds. Pension 
benefits are linked to a member’s final salary at retirement and their length of service. The Scheme was closed to new entrants from 6 April 2002, 
and closed to future benefit accruals with effect from 31 August 2008. 
The Scheme is a registered scheme under UK legislation and is contracted out of State Second Pension. The Scheme has two current participating 
employers, St Ives plc and Clays Limited. St Ives plc is responsible for paying all contributions to the Scheme. Each participating employer is liable 
for its share of the liabilities on wind-up or withdrawal from the Scheme in accordance with the Scheme’s trust deed and rules.
The Scheme was established from 30 September 1988 under trust and is governed by the Scheme’s trust deed and rules dated 23 April 1991 and 
subsequent amendments. The Directors of St Ives Pension Scheme Trustees Limited (‘the Trustees’) are responsible for the operation and the 
governance of the Scheme, including making decisions regarding the Defined Benefits Pension Scheme’s funding and investment strategy in 
conjunction with the Company.
The most recent full actuarial valuations of the scheme assets and the present value of the defined benefits obligations were carried out as at April 
2016 by Jonathan Punter, Fellow of the Institute of Actuaries, of Punter Southall & Co Limited, who is independent of the Group. The valuation was 
updated as at 28 July 2017, and has been calculated on the method and principles agreed for the 6 April 2016 valuation but allowing for the market 
prices and yields at 28 July 2017 and updated membership data as at 28 July 2017. 
The present value of the defined benefits obligation, and the related current service cost and past service cost, were measured using the projected 
unit credit method.
The principal assumptions used for the purpose of the actuarial valuations are as follows:

The Scheme’s assets do not include any of the Group’s own financial instruments, nor any property occupied by, or other assets used by, the Group. 
The Scheme exposes the Group to actuarial risks such as market (investment) risk, interest rate risk, inflation risk and longevity risk. The Scheme 
does not expose the Group to any unusual scheme-specific or company-specific risk.
Investment risk: the Scheme holds some of its investments in asset classes, such as equities, which have volatile market values and, while these 
assets are expected to provide the best returns over the long-term, any short-term volatility could cause additional funding to be required. 
Derivative contracts are used from time to time which would limit losses in the event of a fall in equity markets.
Interest rate risk: the Scheme’s liabilities are assessed using market rates of interest to discount the liabilities and are therefore subject to any 
volatility in the movement of the market rate of interest. The net interest income or expense recognised as an Adjusting Item in the Consolidated 
Income Statement is also calculated using the market rate of interest. The Scheme’s swap investments are expected to provide a degree of 
protection from any movement in the market rate of interest.
Inflation risk: a significant proportion of the benefits under the Scheme are linked to inflation. Although the Scheme’s assets are expected to 
provide a hedge against inflation over the long term, rising inflation over the short-term could lead to an increase in the deficit. The Scheme’s swap 
investments are expected to provide a degree of protection from any short-term inflationary movements.
Mortality risk: in the event that members live longer than assumed the liabilities may be understated, and thus increasing any deficit.
A sensitivity analysis of the principal assumptions used to measure the Scheme’s obligation as at 28 July 2017 is analysed as follows:
     Change in Impact on the defined 
    assumption benefits pension obligation 
Discount rate    Increase by 0.5% Decrease by 9%
Rate of Inflation (‘RPI’)    Increase by 0.5% Increase by 7%
Assumed life expectancy at age 65    Increase by 1 year Increase by 4%
The Scheme’s investment strategy is to invest broadly 65% in return-seeking assets and 35% in matching assets (mainly government bonds).  
The strategy reflects the Scheme’s liability profile and the Trustees’ and Group’s attitude to risk.
As at 28 July 2017 55% of the plan assets are quoted in active markets and 45% are un-quoted.
The last funding valuation of the Scheme was as at 6 April 2016 and revealed a funding deficit of £42,800,000. The Company has agreed to pay 
£3,400,000 over the year to 31 March 2018 and then £2,600,000 per year with a view to eliminating the shortfall by August 2026. The Company has 
also agreed to pay £400,000 per year towards the cost of running the Scheme.
The liabilities of the Scheme are based on the current value of expected benefit payment cash flows to members of the Scheme over the next  
75 years. The average duration of the liabilities is approximately 20 years.

29. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT
The Group’s Treasury function is responsible for managing the Group’s exposure to financial risk and operates within a defined set of policies and 
procedures reviewed and approved by the Board. 
These risks include market risk (including currency risk, fair value interest rate risk and price risk), credit risk, liquidity risk and cash flow interest rate 
risk. The Group does not enter into or trade financial instruments, including derivative financial instruments, for speculative purposes.
As at 28 July 2017, the Group’s borrowings consisted of various loan drawdowns under the Group’s revolving multicurrency banking facility.  
All of the Group’s borrowings were repayable within three months and so were set to mature within twelve months of the period end. 
The loan drawdowns are interest bearing and are recorded on an undiscounted basis. Under the terms of the current facility the Group has the right 
to renew these borrowings until the expiration of the facility.
Interest rate risk
The Group carries a cash flow risk where there are changes in the interest rate levied on the Group’s borrowings as currently interest on the Group’s 
borrowings is at floating rates. The Group finances its operations through a mixture of retained earnings and bank borrowings. Group policy is to 
constantly review the exposure risk to interest rate fluctuations in relation to the risk as a proportion of Group earnings and wherever possible with 
matching short-term deposits of surplus funds. The Group is not subject to fair value interest rate risk as the majority of debt is at floating rates.
Interest rate management
An analysis of financial assets and liabilities exposed to interest rate risk by currency is set out below:
Financial assets subject to interest rate risk
       2017 2016

       2017 2016
      £’000 £’000
100% movement in Sterling LIBOR      230 457
The changes would not have impacted other equity reserves as all interest bearing financial assets and liabilities are subject to floating interest rates 
and their fair values do not fluctuate with changes in interest rates.
Foreign exchange risk
From time to time the Group enters into contracts to supply goods and services to customers trading in following regions:
• Europe at prices denominated in Euros
• USA at prices denominated in US Dollars
• Singapore at prices denominated in Singapore Dollars
• China at prices denominated in Chinese Yuan
Forward foreign exchange contracts
The Group enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to cover specific foreign currency payments and receipts and to manage the risk 
associated with anticipated sale and purchase transactions. Basis adjustments are made to the carrying amount of non-financial hedged items when 
the anticipated sale or purchase transaction takes place.
Forward foreign exchange contracts have been used to hedge the exchange rate risk arising from these commitments which are designated as 
cash flow hedges. As at 28 July 2017, the aggregate amount of unrealised profits under forward foreign exchange contracts deferred in the hedging 
reserve relating to the exposure on trade receivables and anticipated sale transactions amounted to £28,000. It is anticipated that the sales receipts 
will occur in the twelve months following the balance sheet date. 
The following table details the forward currency contracts outstanding at the period end:
     Average

Sell Euros (up to 12 months)    1.13  841  742  742 
Exchange rate sensitivity analysis
As at 28 July 2017, $20 million dollars were drawn in US Dollars on the revolving credit facility. The cash element of the third tranche of the deferred/
contingent consideration payable in respect of Solstice (up to £19,903,000), is likely to be settled between March 2018 and August 2018 and is 
payable in US Dollars and St Ives ordinary shares. Both of these liabilities are subject to exchange rate risk.
If the value of Sterling were to decrease by 4% versus the US Dollar the amount payable would change as follows:
       £’000
US Dollar bank loan       15,855 
Solstice deferred/contingent consideration       20,290 
Subsequent to the period end, the Group is highly likely to increase the maximum deferred/contingent consideration payable for the third 
tranche for Solstice acquisition at £19,903,000. The Group entered into a combination of forward contracts and options to hedge the currency risk 
associated with the deferred/contingent consideration estimated which is to be settled in St Ives ordinary shares and cash in US Dollars.  St Ives plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 111
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT OUR FIGURES
Credit risk
The Group’s principal financial assets are bank balances and cash, trade and other receivables, which represent the Group’s maximum exposure 
to credit risk in relation to financial assets. The Group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables. The amounts presented in the 
Consolidated Balance Sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables, estimated by the Group’s management based on prior experience  
and their assessment of the current economic environment. The Group’s credit risk is relatively low as the Group maintains credit insurance for all  
of its UK and US operations up to a maximum aggregate claim in any one year of £15 million. In addition, its UK subsidiaries’ sales are principally 
with a large number of counterparties and customers in the UK, and are denominated in Sterling.
Before accepting any new customer, the Group uses an external credit scoring system to assess the potential customer’s credit quality and defines 
credit limits by customer. Limits and scoring attributed to customers are reviewed regularly.
Included in the Group’s trade receivables balance are debtors with a carrying amount of £6.0 million (2016 – £7.2 million) which are past due at the 
reporting date for which the Group has not provided as there has not been a significant change in credit quality and the amounts are still considered 
recoverable. The Group does not hold any collateral over these balances.

In determining the recoverability of a trade receivable the Group considers any change in the quality of the trade receivable from the date the credit 
was initially granted up to the reporting date. The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the customer base being large and unrelated, and 
being covered by credit insurance arrangements. Accordingly, the Directors believe that there is no further credit provision required in excess of the 
allowance for doubtful debts.

Liquidity risk
The Group’s policy is to maintain flexibility with respect to its liquidity position, by utilising short-term cash deposits and, where necessary, short-
term bank borrowings for working capital and longer-term borrowings for capital expenditure requirements. The Group renegotiated its revolving 
multicurrency facility from £115 million to £125 million in the prior period. The agreement includes an overdraft facility of £15 million to fund short-
term working capital requirements. The contractual maturities of drawn down borrowings, as well as undrawn facilities, are detailed in note 23. 112 St Ives plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Capital risk management
The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will each be able to continue as a going concern while maximising the return 
to stakeholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance. The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, which includes the 
borrowings disclosed in note 23, cash and cash equivalents, and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising issued capital, 
reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity. The Board have reviewed and discussed the 
Group’s funding requirements and concluded that the Group is well served by its current funding arrangements and do not see any need to adjust 
the Group’s capital in order to meet its objectives.
During the current period the Group reduced its revolving credit facility to £95 million supplemented by a term loan of £30 million and increased its 
maximum leverage covenant condition (net debt to Adjusted EBITDA) for the remaining duration of the facility. Up to £15 million may be drawn as 
an overdraft facility. Interest on loan drawdowns is charged at LIBOR plus a margin which varies between 1.65% and 2.60%, depending on the ratio 
of the Group’s net debt to EBITDA excluding Adjusting Items. Interest on overdraft drawdowns is charged at 2.00% over UK base rate. 
Subsequent to the period end the Group reduced its term loan facility by £5.5 million to £24.5 million.
The Group is subject to covenants on its borrowings (further discussed in the financial review on page 21) which could be considered an externally 
imposed capital requirement. The Board continually monitor the Group’s performance against its banking covenants and undertake monthly reviews 
of working capital, cash forecast, deferred/contingent consideration and headroom on banking covenants. At the period end the Group’s leverage 
ratio was 1.6 times and interest cover of 9 times. The Group has fully complied with the requirement of these covenants during the period under 
review and expects to continue to do so.

NOTES TO THE COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The separate financial statements of the Company are presented as required by the Companies Act 2006. The Company meets the definition  
of a qualifying entity under Financial Reporting Standard (FRS) 100 issued by the Financial Reporting Council. Accordingly, the financial statements 
have therefore been prepared in accordance with FRS 101 ‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’ as issued by the Financial Reporting Council.

The Company has taken advantage of the applicable disclosure exemptions permitted by FRS 101 in its financial statements, which are  
summarised below:

• Para 46-52 – fair value disclosures for share options
IFRS 7, ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’ • Full exemption
IFRS 13, ‘Fair Value Measurement’ • Para 91-99 – disclosure of valuation techniques and inputs used for fair value measurement  
of assets and liabilities
IAS 1, ‘Presentation of the Financial 
Statements’
• Para 10(d) – statement of cash flows
• Para 10(f) – a statement of financial position as at the beginning of the preceding period when 
an entity applies an accounting policy retrospectively or makes a retrospective statement of

The disclosures are given in the consolidated financial statements on pages 74 to 119 and notes 1 to 40. 
The principal accounting policies adopted are the same as those set out in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements except as noted below.
The Directors have, at the time of approving the financial statements, a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate

During the period the Company has reduced its revolving credit facility to £95 million supplemented by a term loan of £30 million and increased its 
maximum leverage covenant condition (net debt to Adjusted EBITDA) for the remaining duration of the facility. Up to £15 million may be drawn as 
an overdraft facility. Interest on loan drawdowns is charged at LIBOR plus a margin which varies between 1.65% and 2.60%, depending on the ratio 
of the Group’s net debt to EBITDA excluding Adjusting Items. Interest on overdraft drawdowns is charged at 2.00% over UK base rate. 
Subsequent to the period end the Company reduced its term loan facility by £5.5 million to £24.5 million.
As at 28 July 2017, the Company’s outstanding loans within this facility were £80.2 million (2016 – £92.6 million). The undrawn portion of this facility  
at 28 July 2017 was £44.8 million (2016 – £32.4 million). 
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of the loans approximates to their fair value.
The Company’s overdraft is guaranteed by certain United Kingdom subsidiary undertakings and the Company guarantees the loans and overdrafts 
of those United Kingdom subsidiary undertakings. At 28 July 2017, the aggregate liability for the Company under this guarantee amounted to 
£107,970,000 (2016 – £130,637,801). The aggregate value of overdraft liabilities belonging to these subsidiaries which are guaranteed by the 
Company amounted to £533,000 (2016 – £985,000).
As at 28 July 2017, there was no loan or overdraft secured against the assets of the Company (2016 – £Nil). The Directors consider that the carrying 
amount of the loans and overdrafts approximates their fair value.
The Company has guaranteed amounts payable to certain property landlords and specific financial guarantees for obligations to suppliers and 
customers of its trading subsidiaries. The maximum aggregate liability under these financial guarantees is £22,260,000 (2016 – £19,796,000). St Ives plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 127

pension costs across the Group as a whole. For the defined contribution scheme, the profit and loss charge represents contributions payable.

Dividend Reinvestment Plan 
The Dividend Reinvestment plan can be a convenient and easy way to build up your shareholding by using your cash dividends to buy more shares 
in the Company. The Plan is provided by Capita Asset Services (‘Capita’), a trading name of Capita IRG Trustees Limited, which is authorised and 
regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (‘FCA’).
Should you require any further information, please do not hesitate to contact Capita Asset Services on 0371 664 0381. Calls are charged at the 
standard geographic rate and will vary by provider. Calls outside the United Kingdom are charged at the applicable international rate. Lines are

shares@capita.co.uk or log on to www.stives-shares.co.uk.
Unauthorised brokers (‘Boiler Room Scams’)
It is very unlikely that a reputable authorised firm that a shareholder has had no relationship with would make contact out of the blue offering to buy  
St Ives’ shares or offer other investment opportunities.
Therefore, shareholders are advised to be wary of anyone offering to give unsolicited advice, buy shares at a discount or give free company reports. 
These calls are typically from overseas-based ‘brokers’ who target UK shareholders, offering to sell them what are often worthless or high risk shares 
in US or UK investments. This sharp practice is commonly known as a ‘boiler room scam’. If you receive any unsolicited investment advice:
• make sure you get the correct name of the person or organisation;
• check that they are properly authorised by the FCA before taking any action by visiting: www.fsa.gov.uk/register/home.do;
• report the matter to the FCA either by calling their Consumer Helpline (0800 111 6768) or by completing an online form  
at: www.fca.org.uk/scams; and
• if calls persist, hang up. 130 St Ives plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
