***Gross Transaction Value (‘GTV’) is a non-IFRS measure defined as total 
retail receipts excluding VAT and before the deduction of revenue deferral 
relating to loyalty points. GTV reflects the full retail sales value of digital 
sales, agency sales (including sales by business partners on GAME’s 
Marketplace website), warranties and other similar arrangements and 
thereby includes the publishers’ and sellers’ shares of those transactions. 
GTV provides the most reliable measure of activity in an environment where 
more sales are expected to move from physical to digital. Game changing

GAME Digital plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
Our priority remains on the business elements within our 
control, delivering on each of the four pillars of our strategy:
 — continuing to improve our core UK and Spanish retail 
businesses, based around the evolving needs and behaviours 
of customers
 — expanding the Group’s live and online gaming services 
for gamers and publishers 
 — developing and growing the Group’s digital enterprise services
 — optimising organisational efficiency while investing 
for the future.
At the core of this activity is our drive to reposition the business 
to address the changing consumer preferences and behaviours 
within our industry, and we are making good progress in 
this regard. Over the period, we have rapidly developed our 
live gaming operations, opening 18 BELONG gaming arenas; 
launched a major new membership scheme in the UK – 
‘GAME Elite’; successfully developed new retail categories 
and services; delivered a number of improvements to the 
omni-channel customer journey, including an enhanced Click 
& Collect service and new Reserve & Collect offer; hosted our 
largest ever Insomnia Gaming Festival and doubled sales from 
our digital enterprise businesses.
Whilst we have continued to invest in the long-term 
development of the business, we have also maintained strong 
capital discipline and cost control, with significant cost savings 
achieved across our UK retail operations in the year.
To this end, and on behalf of the Board, I would like to thank our 
management team and our colleagues, in every region and part 
of the business, for their hard work and dedication in driving 
forwards our strategy.
Performance
Despite the strong sales performance in the second half, 
up 7.8%, Group revenues fell 3.6% over the year as a whole, 
to £782.9 million.
As reported, trading conditions in the UK market were 
undoubtedly tough in the first six months of the year. Whilst 
the arrival of the Nintendo Switch in March 2017 brought new 
impetus and growth to our markets, limited supply in the first 
few weeks of launch meant we did not achieve our internal 
expectations for the UK business.
The Spanish market has continued to perform well and 
this helped our Spanish retail business deliver a strong 
performance, with record sales achieved in the year. 
We also achieved excellent growth in our newer Events, Esports 
& Digital businesses, although at this time these areas remain 
relatively small in the context of the overall Group. 
John Jackson
Chairman
The markets in which we operate remain 
both fast-paced and fast-changing, 
and whilst the market environment was 
once again challenging for our UK retail 
business in the year, particularly the first 
half, it has been a period of important 
strategic progress for the Group, with 
strong developments on many fronts. 
08
GAME Digital plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Balance sheet and capital allocation 
A strong balance sheet is a key part of any Company’s 
success and the Board is committed to ensuring it continues 
to strengthen its position whilst supporting the requisite 
investment to transform the Group that will ultimately lead 
to sustainable returns to shareholders. After investing 
£11.6 million in the business during the year, we ended the 
period with a cash position (net of overdrafts) of £47.2 million, 
up from £43.1 million last year. 
The Board is committed to a dividend policy which reflects 
the long-term earnings and cash generation potential of the 
Group, after retaining sufficient capital to fund future business 
growth. This commitment has seen over £57 million returned 
to shareholders by way of ordinary and special dividends since 
the Group’s flotation in 2014. 
At the time of our half year results in March, the Board 
announced a reduction in the interim dividend payment. 
This reflected the decision to prioritise investment in BELONG 
and the continued UK store optimisation programme, given the 
extremely short lease profile of the UK estate. This work has 
intensified over the last six months and, accordingly, the Board 
has taken the decision not to declare a final dividend for the 
year (2016: 1.75 pence per share) in order that it can continue 
to prioritise the allocation of capital to these areas over the 
next 12 months.
Board
As reported, I took up the role of Chairman of GAME Digital 
following the Group’s AGM in January 2017, having joined the 
Board at the time of the Group’s IPO in 2014. I would like to take 
this opportunity to thank my predecessor, David Hamid, for his 
contribution to the business since his initial involvement in 2013.
Looking forward
GAME Digital is a remarkable company, with great people 
and a strong and recognisable brand and it is building on 
this. Like many companies, we operate in dynamic markets 
and Martyn and the senior team have set out a clear strategy 
to address the challenges these dynamics present whilst 
capitalising on the opportunities, and we remain optimistic 
in the long-term prospects for the Group.
While we take nothing for granted, and recognise the potential 
challenges and risks that lie ahead, the Board believes we have 
the right strategy and a strong and experienced team to lead the 
organisation successfully through this transformational period 
for the Group.

STRATEGIC REVIEW
As evidenced by the tough UK market environment experienced 
in the first half of the year, some of these changes continue 
to provide challenges to our business, but they also provide 
significant opportunities. Our ‘GAME Changing’ strategy is focused 
on realising these opportunities and, while our overall financial 
results for the year were disappointing, I am pleased with the 
strategic progress we have made over the last 12 months.
Across our retail businesses we have continued to enhance 
and differentiate our specialist proposition, including launching 
our new ‘GAME Elite’ membership scheme in the UK. We 
have further developed new categories and ranges, such 
as digital content, PC gaming and licensed merchandise, 
delivering strong sales growth in these areas. We have made 
improvements to our multichannel proposition, to make 
shopping with us even more convenient and we continue to 
take steps to reduce costs and optimise the performance of our 
retail footprint. The immense flexibility of our lease portfolio 
continues to support significant reductions in fixed costs whilst 
also allowing us to reposition our retail and venue approach in 
major cities and towns.
Importantly, we have made significant progress in pioneering 
and delivering competitive gaming at a local level. Our ‘BELONG’ 
gaming arena initiative was launched just over a year ago, with 
an encouraging performance being delivered from the first 
18 venues in operation. At the same time, we have successfully 
developed our digital enterprise businesses. We will continue 
to expand our BELONG footprint in the UK and we are planning 
to launch our first arenas in Spain in 2018.
The fast-moving dynamics of our industry demand that we 
be agile and focused with regards to the Group’s strategic 
direction. Accordingly, following a recent review of the 
Group’s business areas, and particularly in light of the positive 
performance of BELONG, we have decided to prioritise the 
development of our experience based esports and competitive 
gaming proposition. Consequently, the Board has evaluated 
strategic options to maximise shareholder returns from our 
digital enterprise activities.
Despite GTV growth in the second half period of 6.6%, overall 
Group sales for the year (measured as GTV) fell by 2.4% to 
£891.0 million and Adjusted EBITDA was £8.0 million (2016: 
£25.6 million). Strong working capital management helped 
us to end the year with an increase in our cash position (net of 
overdrafts) to £47.2 million (2016: £43.1 million). Together with 
access to financing facilities across the Group of c.£77 million 
as at year end, this means that we have the required cash and 
facilities to develop our plans and drive future growth over the 
next 12 months.
Martyn Gibbs
Chief Executive Officer
 
Our industry continues to evolve rapidly, 
with huge growth in esports, live 
streaming, social and mobile gaming, 
whilst social media is changing the 
way games are played and how gaming 
communities interact. Innovative new 
games consoles and technologies are 
coming to market, including virtual 
reality devices and, most recently, 
the Nintendo Switch and Microsoft Xbox 
One X, and at the same time consumers 
are continuing to benefit from an 
ever-increasing choice in how they buy 
and play games. Console price points 
have reduced further encouraging 
more customers to buy into current 
generation consoles with PlayStation 4 
seeing stronger relative performance.

Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Beyond retail
Discover, browse,

all under one roof
Growing the number of locations that 
house a BELONG gaming arena with 
GAME is central to our strategy
By creating venues where gamers can 
discover, browse, buy, play and compete 
in their favourite games, we are providing 
gamers with access to everything they 
need as well as spaces to create unique 
and engaging gaming experiences.
Our average customer spends around 
£165 a year with us, whilst a customer 
who also visits BELONG will spend over 
£239. This increased customer loyalty 
has seen those stores with a BELONG 
arena deliver sales 9% ahead of the UK 
average, despite the reduction in retail 
selling space. 
We opened a further 17 in-store gaming 
arenas during the year, taking our total to 
18, and also launched the BELONG brand, 
under which the gaming arenas trade.

Annual Report and Accounts 2017 OUR MARKETPLACE
Introduction
GAME Digital operates in the global 
interactive entertainment and video 
games industry. 
The foundation of the Group’s business is its position as the 
leading retailer of video games in the UK and Spain, where 
the majority of the Group’s sales originate. These markets, 
comprising mint and preowned hardware, software and 
accessories, and digital content are core to the business.
More recently, a focus on the diversification of the Group’s 
operations through business development and acquisition has 
facilitated our entry into new markets, encompassing both new 
retail categories (for example the retailing of PC gaming and 
virtual reality products) and new gaming verticals, including 
esports and competitive gaming activities and major consumer 
gaming events. 
Below we discuss five significant long-term trends impacting 
our marketplace.

Major market trend 1:
An industry in growth
The audience and value of the video games industry is expected 
to continue to grow.
 — Video gaming is a large, dynamic and growing industry.
 — The global audience for gaming is expanding as games 
become ubiquitous across all platforms and devices, 
with billions of players globally.
 –  In 2016, there were estimated to be over 31m players 
in the UK (source: NewZoo), approximately half the total 
population. Of those that play games, 59% of them spend 
money on games.
 –  Approximately one third of UK players play mobile, console 
and PC games.
 — The total interactive entertainment (video games) market was 
estimated to be worth $113 billion in 2016 (IDG), making it the 
second largest entertainment platform behind TV.
 — The industry is forecast to grow to over $150 billion by 2021 
(IDG), a CAGR of over 7%. 
 –  Within this, the global console gaming market is forecast 
to grow to $30 billion by 2021, up from $21 billion in 2016.
What this means for GAME Digital?
 — The immense size and continued growth of the video games 
market presents opportunities for all industry players, 
including GAME Digital, providing a huge and growing 
audience with which to engage.
 — The long-term positive industry dynamic is attracting 
investment and innovation across the industry – across 
all formats – console, PC and mobile gaming, as well as in 
newer areas such as virtual and mixed reality and esports, 
as discussed in more detail below.
 — Our core focus is to take action to maintain and increase 
share in our core console markets and to drive growth from 
emerging market opportunities.

Major market trend 2:
Enduring popularity of console gaming, 
characterised by market cycles
Console gaming remains an enduringly popular, but cyclical 
gaming segment, driven by periodic platform innovation and 
the release of new games titles.
 — Despite the significant growth of smartphones and mobile 
gaming over the last decade, console gaming remains 
consistently popular, particularly in Western markets.
 – Having launched in November 2013, the number of PS4 
and Xbox One consoles now sold in the UK (the ‘installed 
base’) stands at 7.3 million as at September 2017, 13.6% 
ahead of the installed base at the same point in the 
previous cycle (GfK Chart-Track).
 – Furthermore, Nintendo’s latest console, ‘Nintendo Switch’, 
was released in March 2017, and set new records around 
the world for a Nintendo console launch. 
 - Since the popularity of the Wii console receded from 
2009, Nintendo has comprised a smaller share of the 
market in Western territories, however this decline 
is expected to reverse following the launch of the 
Nintendo Switch, which has brought renewed growth 
to console markets globally in 2017.
 — Console markets tend to exhibit cyclical characteristics, 
with total hardware and content sales typically peaking two 
to three years after the initial launch.
 – To extend the console lifecycle, reduce cyclicality and 
compete with the shorter upgrade cycles of PC and mobile 
hardware, more frequent and meaningful innovations are 
being introduced into the marketplace: 
 - Recent mid-cycle upgrades (e.g. PS4 Pro in 2016, Xbox 
One X in 2017) represent significantly more powerful 
consoles than the standard model, offering enhanced 
graphics fidelity and gameplay.
 - Innovative new accessories offer engaging new gaming 
experiences, such as Virtual Reality gameplay (e.g. PS VR).
 — Console market performance is also influenced by the 
strength of new games released in any given year. 
What this means for GAME Digital?
 — GAME Digital continues to derive the majority of its sales 
from console gaming markets (mint and preowned hardware, 
software and accessories and mint digital content), with 
dynamics in this market having a significant impact on the 
Group’s performance.
 — Whilst the continued popularity of console gaming is positive, 
the late-stage of the current PlayStation and Xbox console 
cycle (PlayStation 4 and Xbox One) resulted in a market 
contraction in the first half of the financial year in the UK, 
providing a challenging market backdrop. This contraction 
was compounded by a weaker line-up of new game releases 
in the period compared with the prior year.
 — Looking forward, we are well placed to benefit from the 
recent launch of the Nintendo Switch, which has helped the 
UK market return to growth, as well as Microsoft’s Xbox One 
X console, launched earlier in November 2017.
 — Console gaming will remain core to our business for the 
foreseeable future, and therefore maintaining and increasing 
our share in these markets remains a key priority for the 
Group. We are also focused on the Group’s expansion into 
new retail categories and gaming markets, which, over time, 
will allow us to reduce exposure to the inherent cyclicality 
within the console retail market.

Major market trend 3:
Growing consumer appetite  
for digital content
 — The consumption of digital content, comprising full game 
downloads, expansion packs, in-game ‘micro-transactions’ 
and digital subscriptions to console gaming platforms (e.g. 
PlayStation Network and Xbox Live), has seen strong growth 
in recent years, driven by increasing broadband penetration 
and the greater availability and promotion of in-game 
content, with publishers focused on driving greater player 
engagement across fewer, larger games titles.
 — This trend has seen the overall console content market 
(physical and digital) grow, however it has also impacted 
on the growth in the value of physical game purchases 
being made across the market.
 — IDG forecast that from 2016-2021 global sales of console 
digital content will increase 80%, from $10.4 billion to 
$18.6 billion, whilst over the same period physical sales 
will increase 1.3%, from $10.9 billion to $11.1 billion.
 — Sales of digital games and additional content take place 
directly through the ‘digital dashboard’ and also at retail. 
Retailers are able to participate in the digital marketplace, 
selling digital games, additional content, currency and 
subscriptions via Electronic Software Delivery (ESD) through 
our proprietary Codebank system and Point of Sale Activation 
(POSA) cards both in stores and online. 
What this means for GAME Digital?
 — The transition from physical to digital products and channels 
will continue to impact our markets and this is something we 
are focused on addressing.
 — Our priority is to take action to maximise our share of both 
the physical and digital content markets, while adding new 
products and services to our customer proposition and 
striving to improve efficiencies to lower operating costs.
 — Retailers have established themselves as an important 
channel for the sale of digital products and GAME is the 
market leader in this channel for digital console products, 
with a c.60% share of retail sales in both the UK and Spain.
 — An increasing range of digital content, novel ways to pay for 
products such as trade-in and GAME Wallet, and our focus 
on educating and assisting customers with their digital 
purchases ensures we are well placed to maintain and grow 
our position within the growing digital content market.

Major market trend 4:
The awareness and popularity of esports 
continues to grow rapidly
 — The esports market, defined as competitive video gaming, 
continues to experience rapid growth in viewership, 
participation and interest.
 — In 2016, industry analysts estimate that over 320 million 
people watched or participated in esports globally. This 
figure is expected to reach almost 600 million by 2020 
(source: NewZoo), driven by material investment into the 
industry and the continued growth of internet-connected 
gaming devices.
 — Like mainstream sports, the esports value chain is multi-
layered with participants comprising games developers and 
publishers, amateur and professional players, teams, clubs 
and associations, tournament and league organisers, local 
venue operators and event organisers, broadcast platform 
owners and studio content creators, viewers, fans and other 
consumers and brands. 
What this means for GAME Digital?
 — The continued growth in the popularity of esports is a 
strongly positive trend for GAME. Our nationwide footprint 
and brands ensure we are well positioned to lead the 
development of mass-participation amateur esports in the 
UK and Spain – which we are pioneering through BELONG 
gaming arenas, Insomnia and our UK Masters series of 
esports tournaments. 
 — From a retail perspective, the growth in the esports and 
competitive gaming market is expected to drive increased 
demand within the high-end peripherals markets across 
both PC and console gaming categories. In addition, the 
market for licensed merchandise related to esports teams, 
tournaments and games is also expected to grow.
 — We are focused on developing community gameplay, 
supporting grassroots players, organising major gaming 
events and expanding our PC gaming ranges to tap into the 
growing interest and participation in all forms of esports and 
competitive gaming.

Major market trend 5:
The online channel is becoming an 
increasingly popular option for consumers
 — A key structural change in the UK retail market has been the 
shift away from physical stores to online, particularly mobile, 
driven both by shoppers’ increasing appetite for convenience 
and digital connectivity, and service enhancements in 
online operations.
 – In 2017 it is estimated that 40% of the UK video games 
market will be transacted online, up from 27% in 2012.
 – The online channel in Spain is less well developed, 
accounting for 15% of the market. Similarly, from a lower 
base, this is also expected to grow.
 — As the online channel expands, driven by more competitive 
propositions, technology and services, consumers are 
encouraged to shift more of their spend online, accelerating 
the pace of the channel shift further.
What this means for GAME Digital?
 — Our position as a ‘bricks and clicks’ retailer affords us 
the ability to provide consumers with greater flexibility 
and convenience than online pure-plays, with our stores 
remaining a vital point of customer contact, education 
and engagement. 
 — Indeed, customers that shop in more than one channel 
are twice as valuable as single-channel customers and 
as online grows in importance as a channel we are focused 
on developing an integrated consumer proposition and 
multichannel strategy that delivers a consistent brand and 
customer experience regardless of touch point or channel.
 — Today, we retain a larger share of the physical ‘bricks and 
mortar’ channel than the online channel, however we 
continue to invest in the online channel and develop our 
range, offer and services and as the segment expands 
we have the opportunity to capture market share through 
improving both the online and omnichannel customer 
journeys and proposition.
 — GAME is uniquely placed to use all of our key differentiators 
around Reward, Elite, Trade-in and our specialist credentials 
through exclusive products and deals to deliver a unique 
multichannel experience.
 — As consumer habits develop we have adapted our in-store 
proposition to include experiential gaming concepts and 
introduced other developments to differentiate the retail 
proposition from online competitors.
 — Similarly, we continue to optimise our store portfolio through 
finding new, larger, more productive stores in major markets, 
to smaller, lower cost stores and concessions in other markets.

GAME Digital plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 These changes are being implemented so that our business 
model continues to maximise value creation across the Group 
and benefit all our stakeholders.
Our model is structured to enable us to provide these 
services directly to consumers (B2C) as well as to third-party 
businesses (B2B).
We expect the newer areas of the business, such as our live 
gaming services and gaming events, to develop substantially 
over the next three years, recognising that it will take time for 
these areas to mature and contribute at similar levels to our 
core retail businesses.
1. Our multiple resources
Our business model is underpinned by the Group’s resources 
and relationships:
Financial resources
The Group’s strong balance sheet, healthy cash position and 
access to additional lending allow us to maintain significant 
investment to deliver our plans and strategic ambitions. 
We carefully manage our working capital and wider balance 
sheet position to ensure we are well stocked to service our 
customer needs without tying up excess cash unnecessarily. 
Furthermore, there is a strong focus across our businesses 
on operational rigour, efficiency and cost control. 
People and culture
Our Group currently comprises over 4,600 colleagues across 
the UK and Spain. We continue to ensure we have the right 
people with the individual skills, competencies and experience 
who can create value and deliver our business objectives. By 
giving our team of talented, creative and experienced individuals 
the tools, training and support they need, we empower them to 
unleash their passion through innovation and collaboration to 
earn the loyalty of customers.
Brand, marketing and social reach
The GAME brand is highly recognisable in its markets and 
well known across a wide demographic. Our Insomnia brand 
is recognisable amongst a smaller, but key demographic of 
intense gamers and gaming influencers. BELONG is attracting 
a diverse population across PC and console gamers. Our brand, 
marketing and social media reach helps make us exciting, 
relevant and interesting for our customers and the broader 
communities of gamers.
OUR BUSINESS MODEL
Innovating our business model 
to create value for all our 
stakeholders
The Group’s core business activity 
remains the retailing of video games. 
However, through the execution of the 
Group’s strategy we have further 
developed the Group’s business model 
towards a more diversified retail and 
gaming services based model. Although 
this development remains in its early 
stages, there is significant focus to 
increase the pace of change in the 
coming year.

of individuals wanting to participate in or watch live gaming

Our core business divisions 
of retail, events, esports and 
local competitive gaming, 
are complementary and can 
be combined to create unique 
and sustainable competitive 
advantages. This strong 
combination will help the 
Group to effect the transition 
to ongoing profitable growth 
and deliver benefits to all 
its stakeholders.
In addition, on the enterprise 
side of the business we have 
continued to develop our 
digital capabilities over the 
past 12 months to deliver 
innovative, ground-breaking 
new services.
Finally, we will constantly 
focus on improving our 
operational efficiency and cost 
management to maximise 
the profitability of the

of the business, the Board had taken the decision to prioritise the further 
development of the Group’s experience based gaming proposition and 
esports activities and, consequently, has taken the decision to evaluate 
strategic options for the Group’s digital enterprise activities, including 
Multiplay’s Digital division. It is intended that the Group will focus 
management and capital resources on the acceleration of the 
development of the esports and live gaming initiatives and maximise 
the performance of the core multichannel retail businesses. Accordingly, 
the Group has recently commenced a review to maximise shareholder 
value in respect of Multiplay’s Digital business.

Overview Strategic report Governance Results Shareholder information 1. Improve
Continue to improve our core retail 
businesses in the UK and Spain, based 
around the needs and behaviours of 
customers, in order to maximise market 
potential and profitability 
Across our UK and Spanish retail business we continue 
to prioritise our efforts around four key strategic objectives: 
i) maximise the value of our core markets by delivering a 
compelling customer proposition, built around our specialist 
differentiators; ii) build new retail categories and services; 
iii) continue to improve our online and multichannel proposition; 
and iv) effect the ongoing optimisation of our store estate.
i) Delivering a compelling customer proposition
Enhanced UK loyalty scheme: ‘GAME Elite’
Launched 20 years ago this year, our customer loyalty 
programmes in the UK and Spain are some of the longest-
standing and most popular of their kind in their respective 
regions. We remain focused on increasing sign-ups and usage 
of these schemes. As well as encouraging greater brand loyalty, 
the schemes provide valuable insight into our customers and 
their shopping preferences. This insight helps us continuously 
refine, improve and personalise our offer and communications, 
driving increased sales and margins which also benefits 
our suppliers.
4.5 million GAME Reward scheme members shopped with us in 
the year (2016: 4.5 million), whilst our ‘swipe rate’ (transactions 
linked to a Reward account) increased by 4% to 65% in the UK, 
and reached 78% in Spain (2016: 79%).
Customer loyalty: reward scheme penetration in the UK 
as a percentage of retail sales
2016: 61%
65%
After significant consumer research and planning, in May 2017 
the Group launched a major new loyalty initiative, ‘GAME Elite’. 
GAME Elite is a subscription-based membership scheme for UK 
customers, offering enriched rewards and a range of additional 
benefits. This new initiative has been one of numerous initiatives 
within our refreshed ‘customer first’ retail strategy in the UK, 
intended to attract and retain customers and increase 
lifetime value. 
The new GAME Elite membership scheme has proved popular 
with customers, with over 60,000 memberships added so far 
and has helped recruit new customers and increase frequency 
and spend of previous loyalty scheme members. Overall, more 
than two million customers signed up to our GAME Reward 
programmes (including GAME Elite) during the year, across 
the two territories. 
Further expanding our exclusive proposition 
Maintaining and expanding our ‘ONLY AT GAME’ exclusive 
proposition remains another key focus for the Group, supporting 
our unique, specialist position. Working with our supplier 
partners during the year, we were once again able to secure 
exclusive editions on the vast majority of the years’ biggest 
selling titles.
Looking forward, we continue to focus on working with a 
broader range of our supplier partners to further expand 
our exclusive strategy, including new categories such as PC 
hardware, PC accessories and licensed merchandise.
Improving our trade-in and preowned propositions online
A key priority for the Group remains the successful promotion 
and development of our trade-in and preowned propositions, 
which support our specialist and value proposition and remain 
popular with customers. In September 2017 we launched an 
online trade-in service, allowing customers to trade-in their 
games, consoles and mobile phones online. More recently, 
we reconfigured our software stock management system to 
significantly improve the availability of preowned products 
online. We believe these developments will support the future 
growth and popularity of these areas.
ii) Building new categories and services
Our retail diversification strategy continues at pace. Over the 
last three years we have almost doubled sales (measured as 
GTV) from our digital and non-console categories, from £123.5 
million in FY13/14 to £236.8 million in FY16/17, with these areas 
contributing approximately 27% of our total GTV this year.
Continued digital growth 
Retail remains an important channel in the large and growing 
digital content market, with our total digital sales up 16.8% to 
£128.7 million in the year. Promoting and selling a broad range 
of digital products (across both console and non-console digital 
products) in our stores and online remains a key focus.
During the year we expanded our digital product range, 
improved in-store and online merchandising, worked with 
partners to support enhanced digital promotions, and improved 
education and training for in-store sales staff. Overall, this 
helped us to maintain our share of the retail digital market, 
with a c.60% share of the console segment in the UK and Spain.
Range development and new retail services 
We have continued to successfully develop a number of key, 
complementary product categories and retail services over the 
last 12 months. These product ranges include preowned mobile 
phones and tablets and associated peripherals (such as 
chargers and audio headphones); PC gaming hardware and 
accessories, virtual reality devices and accessories, collectibles, 
clothing and other licensed products. During the year we 
OUR STRATEGY 
CONTINUED
34
GAME Digital plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 As mentioned previously, we have also launched an online 
trade-in proposition and new preowned stock management 
engine during the year, enhancing our online proposition in 
these areas.
Finally, during the year we relaunched our App in the UK with 
a new look and feel, focused on engaging content and franchise 
‘campaigns’. Alongside social media, the Group’s Apps in the UK 
and Spain remain central pillars of customer engagement and 
communication and have been downloaded over 1.9 million times.
iv) Optimising the store estate
Our stores remain a key strategic asset of the Group, acting as 
the central hub of customer engagement and a vital part of our 
omnichannel strategy. They also remain a major cost of our 
business. During the year we have continued to focus our efforts 
on improving future store contribution by way of the following:
1) Fixed cost reductions through ongoing lease renewal 
programme and concession partnerships
During the year, 39 UK leases were successfully renewed on 
improved terms out of a total of 49 renewed, with rents reduced 
on an annualised basis by £1.4 million across those leases. 
To date 50 leases have been renewed on better terms, producing 
an annualised saving of £1.7 million. We have 221 lease events 
in the UK in the period to 31 December 2018 (out of a total of 
304 stores) which we are currently planning for.
In conjunction with this programme, six ‘2 into 1’ conversions 
were completed in the UK. In total 23 stores were relocated 
or closed across the UK and Spain. A further five new stores 
were opened in the year in the UK and four in Spain, including 
a concession trial of two stores in the UK with WHSmith. A 
further concession trial with Maplin was started in September 
2017, with four initial sites opened to date.
2) Improvements to the store operating model
After a successful trial launched over the Summer 2017, a new 
store efficiency programme is being rolled out across the UK 
store estate. The programme is designed to lower variable 
costs in stores whilst improving customer services levels by 
increasing store efficiencies. The programme covers several 
areas including payroll, logistics and in-store marketing and 
we are pleased with the initial results and savings that have 
been realised.
3) Enhancing the store environment and space utilisation
Whilst we remain disciplined on costs, we have and will 
continue to invest in the estate, refurbishing and refreshing the 
in-store environment where we believe it will generate a good 
return on investment. Through cosmetic enhancements, new 
fixtures and better merchandising and signage, we are improving 
the in-store customer experience. Given our small store 
footprints, space is at a premium. In the last year we rolled 
out new software which allows us to track space and category 
contribution more frequently and accurately. This is helping 
us to improve space allocation and merchandising to ensure 
sales and margin densities are maximised.
further increased the allocation of in-store space to these 
categories, continued to develop in-store and online ranges, 
improved in-store visual merchandising and up-weighted 
marketing support across these areas.
We have also continued to develop a much broader online range 
through our ‘Marketplace’ offer in the UK, which had over 
265,000 listings from a range of third-party sellers across a 
broad range of categories. We are pleased with the 35% growth 
in GTV achieved, to approximately £4 million.
Alongside these developments the Group continues to broaden 
and improve its range of retail services. Recent initiatives include 
the launch of a consumer finance proposition online for higher 
value transactions; an expanded UK gift card programme, a 
significantly increased repair service in Spain, and wider product 
protection plans. These initiatives helped our services revenue, 
in Spain, to grow 64% in the year, to almost £6 million.
Number of listings through our ‘Marketplace’ offer
265,000+
iii) Developing our online and multichannel proposition 
Like all retail markets around the world, we continue to see 
consumers completing a growing proportion of their purchases 
online, particularly through mobile devices. Delivering a 
seamless, connected and engaging customer journey is 
therefore increasingly important to our business. 
We have invested in our online teams, websites and 
infrastructure over recent years to improve the online and 
multichannel experience, ensuring that customers are able 
to discover content and easily shop online with us whenever 
and however they want. 
In the past 12 months, we have made several improvements 
to our Click & Collect service in the UK. Combined with our 
‘Endless Range’ in-store proposition customers can now order 
online or in-store, for delivery to home, or to store. During the 
year we also launched a new ‘Click & Reserve’ proposition, 
providing further convenience for customers. Click & Collect 
sales contributed c.8% of total online sales in the UK in 2016/17, 
and we expect them to continue to grow as a proportion of 
online sales in the future.
We have continued to invest in our eCommerce platforms, 
improving online functionality and customer journeys as well 
as enriching editorial content. One significant project completed 
during the year was our ‘One Account’ initiative, providing 
customers with a single login for every touch point (Reward 
card, online, App and GAME Wallet accounts). Since its launch 
we have seen significantly higher Reward utilisation rates online 
and higher online sales conversion.

Major new social and competitive gaming initiative launched 
– ‘BELONG by GAME’
Following a successful trial of the ‘gaming arena’ concept 
launched a year ago, in March we announced plans to 
accelerate and expand our roll-out plans for our experiential 
retail concept, BELONG, in the UK. We have now opened 19 
gaming venues (18 BELONG in-store arenas and one stand-
alone gaming lounge trial), with further openings planned for 
2017/18. A tribe identity has been established at every BELONG 
arena, to inspire players to feel part of their local community 
and encourage group and team participation in the inter-arena 
tournaments and local competitions.
The performance of the BELONG arena stores has been 
encouraging and continues to improve as we continually refine 
the offer, with a positive trend in pay-to-play utilisation rates, 
the growth of B2B income and venue hire for parties and events. 
In the first quarter of the new financial year, gaming hours 
played totalled c.90,000 which is up over 110% versus Q4 of 
FY16/17. The concept is successfully driving increased footfall, 
higher in-store dwell time and attracting a new customer 
demographic, with 25% of BELONG customers new to GAME. 
Importantly, we are achieving a retail sales uplift relative to the 
estate average in these stores, with the greatest impact seen 
in PC gaming and VR categories and core categories such as 
PlayStation 4 have also benefited despite consolidation of 
store space. 
Development has been completed for our booking platform 
which allows customers to book a station in each arena for 
specific time slots similar to systems operated by cinemas. 
We are also at Beta stage with our tournament platform allowing 
in-arena, online and competitive esports tournament play. 
Arena time has also been recently developed and launched 
which allows BELONG customers to purchase bulk ‘credits’ for 
gaming hours in our arenas. This will deliver a reward element 
for those that participate with us the most.
Feedback from customers, store teams, supplier partners 
and gaming communities continues to be very positive. 
The performance of the BELONG 
arena stores has been encouraging.
Footfall across our flagship Insomnia shows
2016: 100,000
1 55,000+
Continued expansion of our esports and events activities 
across the UK and Spain
In conjunction with BELONG, we have continued to develop and 
expand our esports and event capabilities and activities during 
the year, with directly attributable sales from these areas more 
than doubling in the year to £8.7 million (2016: £4.0 million). 
Key developments for the Insomnia Gaming Festival included 
the launch of a refreshed brand and website, further 
improvements to the show’s content, enhanced marketing and 
promotional arrangements and the signing of a major new three 
year partnership with Island Records (Universal Music). These 
initiatives have supported a further broadening of the show’s 
appeal and audience, with a record footfall of over 155,000 
achieved across the five flagship shows held during the year. 
We have continued to develop our proprietary online systems 
to allow us to expand our tournament hosting capabilities and 
have continued to increase the content and programming from 
our esports broadcast studios. During the period we completed 
three seasons of our own ‘UK Masters’ esports series of 
tournaments, with over £75,000 awarded in prize money and 
viewership targets exceeded. We were also selected by 
Activision to host a European qualifying event for the 2017 
Call of Duty World League (‘CWL ’) Championship. The CWL 
Birmingham Open was held at the Insomnia 60 festival in 
April 2017, with 96 teams competing for a share of the 
$50,000 prize pool.
We continue to organise major white label events on behalf of 
publishers, including acting as delivery partner for MineCon US, 
held in Anaheim, California, in September 2016 and successfully 
hosted our first Brick Live shows in the UK (an event for Lego 
enthusiasts) in July 2017, having signed a franchise agreement 
earlier in the year. In August 2017, we also entered into a licence 
agreement with Mojang to operate BlockFest, for a minimum of 
five years, that is, to run, market and promote official Minecraft 
community events globally. This will allow us to operate 
Minecraft events or sub-licence event management within 
defined territories, using assets created and built by 
Multiplay Events.
Our esports activities have also continued to develop in Spain, 
with the creation of a new broadcast studio to support high 
quality content creation, a new online esports website launched 
and a growing programme of successful esports partnerships 
with major gaming events across the territory, including Madrid 
Games Week. 
OUR STRATEGY

36
GAME Digital plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 4. Optimise 
Optimise organisational efficiency while 
investing for the future
Running an efficient business remains a key strategic priority 
for the Group and we have made good progress realising 
business efficiencies and delivering cost savings during the 
year. As discussed in more detail in the operating review, we 
achieved £11.1 million in cost reductions across our UK retail 
operations in the year, before the impact of higher statutory 
wage rates and other increases. Across our retail businesses 
we continue to carefully manage store employee costs, 
adjusting resourcing levels as required to maintain service 
standards during periods of higher or lower demand. We also 
continue to focus on reducing costs where possible across all 
areas of the business, including rent savings at lease renewal, 
business services contracts and procurement, productivity 
improvements in our distribution centres and other business 
process improvements. 
Considerable attention continues to be given to the 
rationalisation of our store footprint and reducing property 
costs. Since the UK plan was initiated in January 2016, 50 leases 
have been renewed on improved terms and where proposed 
new lease terms have not been acceptable, the Group has 
relocated to lower cost premises. We are planning for 221 lease 
events before the end of 2018 and, in conjunction with these 
plans, we are exploring opportunities to open new concession 
locations with complementary third-party brands, where a 
lower overall cost of occupation and flexible terms can be agreed.
Conclusion
Whilst dynamics in the UK console market have been 
challenging, we have made good progress in the year as we 
continue to focus on developing our strategic initiatives and 
creating a new cost base for our UK retail operations. 
We have reviewed our operations and are now accelerating the 
development of BELONG and our esports plans, as we seek to 
fully capitalise on the significant future potential of these high 
growth areas.
Our core markets returned to growth in the second half, 
and we expect that this momentum will continue into our peak 
Christmas trading period, driven by continued strong customer 
demand for the PlayStation 4 category, the increasing 
availability of the Nintendo Switch, the launch of Microsoft’s 
Xbox One X and a stronger selection of new games.
By organising ourselves effectively, continuing to improve 
and enhance our consumer proposition and building on the 
collaborative partnerships we hold with our key suppliers, 
the Group is confident we will be able to maximise this market 
potential whilst continuing to drive further strategic progress 
over the next 12 months.
3. Develop 
Develop and grow the Group’s digital 
enterprise services
We have been pleased with the further successful development 
of our digital business over the last 12 months. 
Strong growth in game server hosting
We have continued to successfully develop and grow Multiplay’s 
digital server hosting business during the year, with sales more 
than doubling to £4.5 million (2016: £2.1 million).
Sales from Multiplay’s digital server business
2016: £2.1m

Publisher and developer interest in the technology continues 
to grow, with major contracts successfully executed, several 
new contracts signed and a number of key proof of concepts 
underway. The Group has continued to invest sensibly during 
the year in the required resource and infrastructure to support 
the significant future growth anticipated.
Our portfolio of partners is impressive including Electronic 
Arts, Activision, Psyonixcs, Ready at Dawn, Tripwire Interactive 
and numerous other leading publishers and developers.
Successful development of Ads Reality, the Group’s AR-based 
digital marketing business 
Ads Reality was acquired in May 2016 after more than two years 
of collaboration between the two companies. During the first 
15 months of ownership we have continued to support the 
development of the business and its technology to drive future 
growth. During the year the team delivered projects for several 
major consumer brands and international businesses, including 
Sainsbury and Heathrow Airport and are successfully building 
a growing pipeline of future projects.
Strategic review of digital businesses launched
Following the strong early performance and significant 
potential of BELONG, the Group has decided to prioritise 
management and capital resources on the acceleration of the 
development of its esports and live gaming initiatives. 
Accordingly, the Board is evaluating strategic options for the 
Group’s digital enterprise activities to maximise shareholder 
value and allow the Group to increase its strategic focus.

GAME Digital plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Risk landscape
The Company is trading in a highly competitive market with 
significant, emerging challenges such as the trend towards 
longer lasting games, increasing digital disintermediation 
and uncertainty around the future evolution of the console 
cycle. In common with many retailers, GAME is also subject to 
significant and somewhat unpredictable spikes in trading and 
funding requirements over the Black Friday and Christmas 
periods as well as other peaks around major new launches. 
External factors such as Brexit or a banking crisis could also 
adversely affect consumer confidence and shopping habits.
Risk appetite
The Board has reviewed its risk appetite statements and the 
nature and extent of risks it is willing to accept. This has helped 
confirm the strategic priorities for the Group including those 
areas of the business that the Board is most willing to invest in. 
Risk management effectiveness
The Board is responsible for monitoring the effectiveness 
of risk management and internal control systems, supported 
by the Audit and Risk Committee and Internal Audit function. 
During the year the Board has monitored the Group and 
divisional risk profiles and received updates from management 
on the mitigation activities in place for each of the principal risks.
Overview
The Board is accountable for risk 
management which includes 
determining the nature and extent 
of risks that the business is willing 
to accept in pursuit of its strategic 
objectives. During the year, the Board 
has made a robust assessment of the 
principal risks to the Company’s 
business model, including those risks 
that could affect the ability to deliver its 
strategy, or weaken its financial position 
and or liquidity. This assessment is 
informed both by internal, divisional 
risk assessments undertaken by 
management and by external factors 
such as changing consumer behaviour, 
the economy and the dynamics and 
performance of the retail and gaming 
markets as a whole.

GAME Digital plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 OUR RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES 
CONTINUED
The table below sets out the risks identified as having the biggest potential impact on our business. The way in which our 
actions to mitigate these risks assist us in meeting our strategic objectives is indicated in the table below under ‘link to strategy’. 
The changes in the gross risk assessment are indicated in the table below, under the heading ‘movement of risk in year’. The gross 
risk profile of the Group has increased slightly since the prior year, driven predominantly by the increasing challenges in the UK 
retail market as a whole sector as well as in the gaming industry more specifically. 
Principal risk 1: Strategy and business model (VA)
Specific risks
The Company must continue to develop strategies to 
sustain and grow profitability in its core retail markets 
and to generate new revenue streams in new markets. 
Failure to correctly anticipate significant shifts in 
supplier strategy, technological advancements, and 
consumer behaviour, or the failure to respond and invest 
for change quickly enough, could lead to poor or untimely 
strategic choices and missed opportunities. 
As we enter new markets we will need to carefully 
balance the potential for downside risk with the 
opportunities and rewards we seek.
Finally, successful execution of our strategy is reliant 
on sufficient re-investment of profits from our retail 
businesses and potentially securing additional funding 
or proceeds from the sale of non-core assets.
Mitigating actions
 — Focus and discipline in our core retail business, 
exploiting all new launch/release opportunities 
and investing in multichannel development.
 — Focus on strengthening supplier relationships 
and improving commercial terms.
 — Concentrate investments in segments where 
profitability is good and risks are acceptable, 
e.g. focus on ‘growth categories’ (including through 
external partnerships) and optimise/rationalise the 
store portfolio.
 — Diversify the business, expanding beyond traditional 
retail into related markets of leisure, entertainment 
and hospitality e.g. our new, pay-to-play gaming 
arenas ‘BELONG’.
 — Invest in commercial partnerships, joint ventures and 
acquisitions which offer strong synergies and benefits 
and help accelerate the business’s growth and 
diversification strategy.
 — On-going strategic review and appraisal of non-retail 
business divisions to ensure appropriate return on 
investment going forward.

Develop
Principal risk 2: Competition (VA)
Specific risks
There is a risk of significant loss of market share in 
our UK and/or Spanish retail markets due to intense 
competition from large, well-established corporates. 
Furthermore, intense competition from established 
corporates and new entrants could lead to losses as 
the Company continues to establish itself in relatively 
new markets particularly in esports and events.
Mitigating actions
 — On-going monitoring of our competitive position.
 — Working with our strategic suppliers to secure 
the best commercial terms and exclusive deals.
 — Continued investment and development of our 
multichannel proposition including in-store 
environments, online and digital development.
 — Broadening the range of products and services.
 — Further developing a differentiated, specialist 
multichannel retail experience.
 — Further developing the Group’s reward schemes 
including the new subscription based loyalty scheme, 
Elite launched in the UK in Q4, offering enhanced 
incentives and benefits to our customers. Harnessing 
our customer insight to offer tailored propositions to 
our customers.

Principal risk 3: People and organisational capability
Specific risks
As the business continues its period of transformation, 
the ability to attract and retain the right talent and 
resources is becoming increasingly important. Failure to 
equip the business with the appropriate skill base could 
result in significant under-performance in our core 
business or poor execution of new business development. 
Mitigating actions
 — New senior management appointments, including a 
Chief Marketing Officer, Head of Online and on-going 
development of retained talent.
 — HR programme addressing rewards and benefits, 
performance management and employee 
engagement.
 — Executive and senior management succession 
planning.

GAME Digital plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Principal risk 4: Key supplier dependency
Specific risks
Our business model is predicated on close working 
relationships with, and continued support from, our 
publisher partners. In our core retail markets this 
helps us secure the most compelling and competitive 
propositions in the marketplace for gamers and gifters. 
It is also essential as we look to grow relatively new 
product categories such as ‘licensed merchandise’ 
and enter new markets of leisure, entertainment and 
hospitality. A change in the dynamics of our key supplier 
relationships, or a change in their strategic direction (for 
example, driving digital more aggressively or engaging 
directly with customers) could lead to a reduction in, 
or withdrawal of, commercial and financial support. 
Similarly, the impact of Brexit could increase the costs 
of goods purchased from suppliers which may lead to 
lower margins.
Mitigating actions
 — Significant executive level focus on strengthening 
supplier relationships.
 — Developing our multichannel and digital propositions 
so that we remain a relevant and valuable retail 
partner. 
 — Development of new and established experiential 
gaming concepts including BELONG and our in-house 
and third-party gaming events, Insomnia and 
MineCon, to reduce dependency on the core business.
 — Provision of valuable consumer insight to help our 
suppliers improve their products and target their 
marketing more effectively.

Principal risk 5: Trading and consumer confidence (VA)
Specific risks
The Company is trading in a highly competitive market 
with significant, emerging challenges such as the trend 
towards longer-lasting games, increasing digital 
disintermediation and uncertainty around the future 
evolution of the console cycle. There can also be 
considerable uncertainty around stock availability and 
the timing, features and ultimate success of new titles. 
This creates complexity in financial planning and 
forecasting and could lead to significant under-
performance and a lack of confidence from investors 
and creditors. 
In common with many retailers, GAME is also subject to 
significant and somewhat unpredictable spikes in trading 
and funding requirements over the Black Friday and 
Christmas periods as well as other peaks around major 
new launches. Failure to plan effectively and sufficiently 
in advance could materially impact on the Group.
External factors such as Brexit or a banking crisis 
could also adversely affect consumer confidence 
and shopping habits.
Mitigating actions
 — Robust planning across sales, marketing, 
commercial and merchandising, supply chain, IT and 
operations.
 — Timely engagement of suppliers on new releases and 
stock forecasts.
 — Continued investment in the multichannel proposition 
across store and online, plus greater actual and 
future planned IT investment.
 — Operational contingency planning including additional 
warehouse capacity. 
 — Risk assessment and optimisation of critical systems 
to ensure they can manage peaks in system demand 
appropriately.
 — Close monitoring of pre-orders, deposits and stock 
forecasts in the build-up to Black Friday and 
Christmas trading.
 — Robust cash flow forecasting and management 
of working capital.

Principal risk 6: Data protection and cyber security
Specific risks
There is a risk of a major cyber-attack or other 
customer data breach potentially resulting in: partial 
cessation of trading (e.g. online); interruption/
cancellation of a live event, or hosting of the launch 
of a new game; theft of commercially sensitive data, 
or personal identifiable information with the need for 
customer or supplier compensation; exposure to adverse 
national media coverage and/or reputational damage 
and regulatory fines.
The change in gross risk reflects the proximity and 
increasing severity of global cyber threats. In parallel 
the regulatory environment around data protection and 
the potential for significant fines is intensifying for many 
UK businesses. 
Mitigating actions
 — Information security programme and governance 
structure including regular Board and Audit and 
Risk Committee updates.
 — Cyber insurance cover in place. 
 — On-going training and awareness campaign across 
the UK business including a security handbook, 
e-learning modules, and unannounced testing. 
 — Regular programme of vulnerability scanning 
and penetration testing established in the UK.
 — Enhanced physical security at the UK head office.

Specific risks
Significant under-performance in our core retail 
business, or a failure of our new strategic initiatives, 
could, without adequate mitigating actions lead to the 
reduction or withdrawal of supplier credit and external 
finance. This could restrict our growth plans and 
threaten the future viability and solvency of the business.
Mitigating actions
 — Formal governance structures in place to monitor 
and optimise working capital and cash flow.
 — Asset-backed revolving loan facility agreement for 
the UK business of up to £75 million in place since 
July 2016.

Specific risks
Failure to respond effectively to a major incident such as: 
a fire at our head office or distribution centre; power or 
network outage; or critical infrastructure failure, could 
cause significant business disruption or wider impact 
on the Group during peak trading, at a headline gaming 
event or during the hosting of the launch of a major 
new gaming title. 
Mitigating actions
 — Disaster recovery plans in place for core IT 
infrastructure.
 — Business impact assessments undertaken in the UK 
and business continuity plan updated. 
 — Third-party resource recovery site and facilities in 
place in the event of denial of access to Unity House.

Specific risks
Failure to invest sufficiently in critical systems and in the 
development of new technologies could impact our ability 
to deliver our growth strategies and/or cause significant 
business disruption during peak trading, at a major 
gaming event or during the live hosting of a new gaming 
title. In addition, our multiple legacy systems could 
increase the risk of financial errors and omissions. 
Mitigating actions
 — On-going strategic review of core infrastructure. 
 — Formal governance in place to ensure that capital 
expenditure is approved in line with the Board’s risk 
appetite and that investment in new technologies 
is not unduly delayed. 
 — Continued focus on manual controls in Finance 
and on improving underlying business processes.
 — Business interruption and cyber insurance in place

Principal risk 10: Health and safety
Specific risks
The Company operated 572 stores across the UK and 
Spain at the end of 2016/17 and is implementing new 
strategies which utilise this space increasingly for local 
competitive gaming and esports tournaments. The Group 
also operates large distribution and online fulfilment 
centres in the UK and Spain. 
In addition, the business will be looking to host a growing 
number of major gaming and contract events attracting 
attendances in the thousands. 
A failure to maintain well-controlled, safe environments 
for employees, gifters and gamers across all of our 
locations and operations or to comply with relevant 
regulations could result in injuries to our employees and 
customers, potential fines and damage to our reputation.
Mitigating actions
 — On-going review and communication of health and 
safety policies.
 — Appropriately skilled and experienced health and 
safety managers representing each business division 
and providing training for others.
 — Formal governance and oversight via the quarterly 
health and safety executive committee and bi-annual 
Board level updates.
 — Risk assessments regularly undertaken across all 
key areas of the business and monitoring of action 
plans by the Committee.

People
The Group employs almost 4,700 members of staff across 
the UK and Spain. Our colleagues are a major asset of the 
business, differentiating our proposition and supporting the 
continued transformation and future success of the business. 
We are committed to supporting our people, establishing and 
maintaining practises which not only attract and retain the 
workforce, but also support employment flexibility and agility.

Training and career development
We continue to implement various programmes across both 
the UK and Spain to ensure we support skills development and 
career progression. This year, based on a belief that strong 
leadership drives company performance and an improved 
employee experience, we broadened our focus to include 
the top of the business. This saw us roll out a new leadership 
development programme to the senior leadership team in 
the UK which linked directly to a relaunched set of leadership 
expectations across the business. 
Our award-winning e-learning site, GAME Learning Zone, 
continues to play a central role in our employee training and 
development. 60% of employees visit GAME Learning Zone at 
least once a week in the UK, with more than 250,000 e-learning 
modules completed. This year, more than 1,500 e-books were 
added to the site to support continuous training across the 
business. This included information to support the launch of 
our new store training initiative, ‘GAME HERO’, focused around 
our core customer service values: ‘friendly’, ‘helpful’ and 
‘interested’. To date, over 30,000 GAME HERO training modules 
have been completed. 
60% of employees visit GAME 
Learning Zone at least once a week.
In addition, to complement the online learning platform, this 
year a ‘Regional Training Champions’ programme was set up 
in the UK to provide regular on-site training and support the 
sharing of best practise. The programme has not only seen 
the effectiveness and efficiency of our overall store training 
improve, but has also provided an excellent development 
opportunity for the store managers involved.
Maintaining mobility of internal talent is strategically important 
to the Group. For example, the rapid roll-out of BELONG arenas 
over the last year has only been possible through a flexible 
approach to internal talent, with 83% of the BELONG team 
being recruited from retail teams. The mobility of internal talent 
has been further strengthened this year through the launch of 
GAME Talent, an internal online platform enabling employees 
to share their experience, skills and interests to improve the 
internal sourcing of new roles and vacancies. 
Providing opportunities for career progression also remains 
a key focus and this year also saw the completion of the 
second year of our High Potential programme which provides 
accelerated career development and progression for high 
performing colleagues. Last year, the retail High Potential 
programme was extended to include managers within our 
distribution centre. Alongside this, we have launched a core 
foundation education initiative in partnership with our local 
further education college, helping colleagues improve their 
basic skills qualifications. Through the same partnership the 
college is providing a variety of business administration and 
management courses to teams within our head office and 
distribution centre, some of which will result in recognised 
management qualifications. Finally, in line with government 
legislation, GAME started to make Apprenticeship Levy 
contributions in April 2017 and an employee is due to begin an 
engineering apprenticeship under this scheme in the coming 
year, with further plans underway for the Apprenticeship Levy. 
46
GAME Digital plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 We believe that employees should 
be treated with dignity and respect 
and everyone is given an equal 
opportunity to reach their potential.
Health and safety 
The Group is committed to providing a safe and healthy working 
environment for its employees, customers and any others who 
may be affected by its activities. The prevention of accidents and 
ill health at work and minimising risk to people is essential and 
the Group is committed to continuous improvements in health 
and safety. 
Each trading company and all employees are accountable 
for their own health and safety and that of those around them. 
The companies promote a positive safety culture by maintaining 
high standards of health and safety in the workplace 
through training, education, effective communication and 
implementation of policies. All policies are subject to regular 
reviews at health and safety committee meetings.
There are several health and safety committees across the 
Group with three committees in Spain, three in the UK retail 
business and one for Multiplay. There is also a Group Health 
and Safety Committee with members including the CEO, CFO 
and senior managers which is chaired by the Head of Health and 
Safety and meetings are held quarterly. All senior health and 
safety management are NEBOSH (The National Examination 
Board in Occupational Safety and Health) qualified practitioners. 
Rewards and benefits 
We recognise that rewarding employees fairly, equitably 
and competitively is key to maintaining a motivated workforce. 
In the last year, we have undertaken a job evaluation and grading 
process using a Global Grading methodology to ensure we 
have a robust market competitive framework, enabling us to 
be confident that people are being recognised and rewarded 
fairly for the work they do in comparison to both the market 
and their peers.
We offer a range of incentives and management bonuses 
related to both Group, Company and individual performance 
to encourage active engagement with the success of the 
business, the newest of these being the enhanced retail 
bonus scheme with more opportunities to achieve additional 
earnings. Our approved benefits scheme ‘GAME Benefits You’, 
provides employees access to wide-ranging benefits such as 
our cycle-to-work scheme, as well as hundreds of offers from 
other high street retailers, supermarkets and more.
In 2016, we launched a new Performance Management 
System to ensure employees understood both the objectives 
of the Group and how they can individually contribute. Since 
its launch, we have ensured people’s achievements and areas 
for development have been tracked throughout the year through 
regular GAME Chats – regular conversations between managers 
and their teams. Our first year using the new platform has 
recently concluded through a formal performance review 
and the setting of objectives for the year ahead. 
Equal opportunities
GAME is an equal opportunities employer and believes that 
equality and diversity are key to a positive working environment. 
We positively encourage job applications from any suitably 
qualified, eligible candidates regardless of the individual’s 
gender, race, disability, age, sexual preference, religion 
or belief, marital or parental status. We also ensure that 
necessary arrangements are made to support the continued 
employment of employees who become disabled during their 
time with the Group.
We believe that employees should be treated with dignity and 
respect and everyone is given an equal opportunity to reach 
their potential. It is GAME’s firm intention to create a climate 
free from bullying and harassment and in which all employees 
feel confident in raising concerns of this kind and have them 
dealt with quickly, sensitively and effectively. We do not tolerate 
any acts of discrimination at any level and we have a Diversity 
and Respect Policy to detail this. This policy is communicated 
to all employees, and managers receive training to ensure that 
they understand its requirements in relation to their own teams. 
We take disciplinary action against any employee found to be in 
breach of this policy and we track and audit any such action to 
ensure it is consistent across our business.

GAME Digital plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Overview Strategic report Governance Results Shareholder information We see social media as an important 
means of interacting and engaging 
with our customers so we encourage 
our employees to participate.
Ethical trading and human rights
GAME is committed to the protection of the environment as 
well as the personal rights of individuals. The products we 
sell are sourced from a broad range of national and some 
international suppliers and we endeavour to select partners 
that share our core principles. Over the year we have engaged 
our suppliers, gathering information about their policies and 
processes in relation to modern slavery. This has involved a 
high level risk assessment of our supply chain that will lead 
to further follow up activity in FY 2018. Our Slavery and 
Human Trafficking statement is required under the Modern 
Slavery Act 2015 and is now available to view on our website at 
www.gamedigitalplc.com
Data protection 
GAME has defined and implemented relevant policies and 
procedures in the UK and Spain to ensure compliance with local 
data protection regulations. At the time of reporting, work was 
underway to align these policies and procedures with the new 
EU General Data Protection Regulation, due to come into force 
in May 2018.
GAME has put in place a number of technical and organisational 
measures to ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability 
of personal data at rest and in motion. We also take steps to 
minimise the volume of personal data we process and the 
number of third parties we need to share personal data with 
to deliver our products and services.
Communities
Protecting our younger customers 
We take the issue of age-related video games and the potential 
risk of a sale to under age children very seriously. As such, we 
have a three-pronged approach aimed at preventing the sale 
of inappropriate products: 
 — commitment and adherence to the Pan European 
Game Information (PEGI) system 
 — rigorous staff training on age-related sales policies 
and procedures 
 — monitoring store compliance with age-related sales 
guidelines set by the Video Standards Council.
Age-related sales training is completed on every employee’s 
first day working in-store, and then regularly throughout the 
year. This focuses our staff on compliance to all processes and 
helps to ensure they understand the importance of, and risks 
associated with, the sale of age-related products.
With the launch and rapid roll out of our new BELONG arenas, 
we ensure the protection of our younger customers by 
undertaking a check with the Disclosure and Barring Service 
(DBS) with every single person who works within a BELONG 
arena and do not employ anyone with convictions that may 
pose a risk to working with children.
Charitable causes and local projects
GAME employees chose SpecialEffect as the official charity 
partner of GAME UK in 2016/17. SpecialEffect is a UK-based 
charity which uses video games and technology to enhance the 
quality of life for people with disabilities. In total during the year 
over £115,000 was raised through various initiatives, including 
over £30,000 at the annual ‘GAME Blast’ event. We also donated 
100% of our plastic bag sales to SpecialEffect raising almost 
£60,000. Over the coming year, we will continue to consult 
with our employees about our continued partnership with 
SpecialEffect.
Social media 
GAME’s social communities remain incredibly important to 
the business. We continue to operate national Facebook, Twitter 
and YouTube accounts and, in addition, each store has their 
own Twitter and Facebook page. We see social media as an 
important means of interacting and engage with our customers 
so we encourage our employees to participate. Our Social Media 
Team work closely across all departments to raise awareness 
and understanding of social media, this includes a dedicated 
resource to help store teams with their efforts. 
We clearly communicate our expectations and standards 
of conduct through a Social Media Policy which covers an 
employee’s personal, non-work use of social media as well 
as use in an official capacity when acting on behalf of GAME.

GAME Digital plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Environment 
GAME is committed to fulfilling its statutory obligations 
and minimising the impact of its activities on the environment. 
We comply with the EU Energy Efficiency Directive 2012 (EED) 
and all our stores are installed with a smart meter, allowing 
us to measure our total energy consumption from buildings.
Carbon emissions
This report details GAME Digital plc’s greenhouse gas 
emissions for the 12 months ended 31 July 2017.
With the support of an independent consultant, Carbon Clear, 
we have calculated our Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions from 
activities under our operational control. Data from all emission 
sources was collected by GAME Digital plc and the validity and 
completeness of the dataset was checked by Carbon Clear. 
Our emissions were calculated by Carbon Clear using the main 
requirements of the ISO 14064-1:2006 standard for carbon 
reporting and the UK Government Greenhouse Gas Conversion 
Factors for Company Reporting 2017.
As required by The Companies Act 2006 (Strategic Report and 
Directors’ Report) Regulations 2013, we report an intensity ratio 
of our Scope 1 and 2 emissions in tonnes of CO2e per £ million of 
revenue. We also report on some Scope 3 categories, as this data 
is being used internally to drive emission and cost reductions. 
The total emissions last year were 11,597 tCO2e, compared to 
12,718 tCO2e for the previous year. This is an overall reduction of 
9%. The main reason for this shift was a decrease in emissions 
from purchased electricity of 11%. Purchased electricity 
remains the Group’s single largest source of carbon emissions.

WEEE and recycling 
As an electrical retailer the Group fulfils all statutory 
obligations in respect of WEEE (Waste Electrical & Electronic 
Equipment Regulations 2013) and the EU Directive on Packaging 
and Packaging Waste (94/62/EC). We actively promote WEEE 
to customers as a means of disposing of their old redundant 
consoles, peripherals and electronic devices when they 
purchase a like-for-like item from any GAME store. In addition 
we also provide a battery service for customers, whereby used 
batteries can be brought in to store, irrespective of where 
purchased, for recycling.
Total WEEE waste collected and disposed of in 2017
2016: 41.6 tonnes

Last year alone we collected and disposed of c.45.9 tonnes 
of WEEE waste, including batteries, through the distribution 
centre. In addition, we collected a further quantity of batteries 
through our store network that is returned directly to our 
processing partner for recycling. Waste card packaging is 
collated at all stores and distribution centres for recycling and 
last year we recycled 313.5 (2016: 394.8) tonnes of cardboard 
from our UK distribution centre alone. Various initiatives are 
also in place at head office in the UK and Spain including the 
recycling of paper, cardboard and plastic.

Overview Strategic report Governance Results Shareholder information Our markets
This positive market momentum has continued into our new 
financial year, with the total video game markets in the UK 
and Spain up 9.1% and 14.5% respectively, in local currencies, 
for the first 15 weeks (Spain 14 weeks) of FY17/18, compared 
to the equivalent period last year.
Consumer demand is expected to remain strong for the 
Nintendo Switch console as well as new and upcoming titles 
for the console. Sales of both the console and key software titles 
will remain dependent on stock availability. We are also seeing 
meaningful upside in the whole PlayStation 4 category as the 
price for the console migrates downwards and the quality of 
releases continually improves.
In addition to the Nintendo Switch, the continued strength 
of PlayStation 4 and the arrival of the Xbox One X console 
in November, together with a stronger slate of new titles 
announced for FY17/18, are expected to drive stimulus 
to the market over the next 12 months.
Group operating review
Core Retail: UK
UK Retail GTV declined by 2.8% in the second half, which 
nonetheless represented a significant improvement on the 
18.1% decline reported in the first half. This improved relative 
performance was supported by the launch of the Nintendo 
Switch in March 2017, with hardware sales up 21% in the 
second half, together with our continued focus on growing 
sales of digital content and an expanding range of non-console 
categories which are proving popular with our customer base. 
Overall, GTV from digital and non-console categories (including 
mint and preowned phones and tablets, PC and mobile 
accessories, licensed merchandise, virtual reality devices 
and retail services) increased 14.9%, to over £162 million.
We retained our position as the leading retailer of video games 
in our core markets during the year, with a 29% share of the 
market (2016: 32%). The movement in market share was largely 
explained by the market decline in certain key games where the 
UK business has historically achieved high market shares as 
well as an increased contribution of the online channel, where 
the business currently achieves a lower market share. We have 
continued to invest in improvements to our online, mobile and 
app channels during the year, as well as in our multichannel 
capabilities, e.g. the expansion of delivery options. We have 
started to see an improved impact on our online performance 
in recent months, with year-on-year growth in market share 
metrics, customer orders and conversion.
We continue to work closely with our supplier partners and have 
been successful in securing additional support. The benefits 
from these new arrangements, together with our continued 
focus on higher margin categories and digital content sales 
have driven a positive improvement in our UK gross margin 
rate, which increased 10 basis points in the year, to 27.4% 
(calculated as a % of revenue). 
BUSINESS REVIEW
A year of two halves
In a challenging first half, the value of the 
console gaming retail market in our two 
major geographic markets declined by 
5.4% (UK and Spain combined), reflecting 
the maturity at that time of the Xbox and 
PlayStation console cycles and a weaker 
line up of new titles compared with the 
prior year period. A perennial AAA 
release also significantly underperformed 
in the market which had a significant 
impact on our business.
Conversely, in the second half, despite 
constrained supply, the record breaking 
launch of the new Nintendo Switch 
console brought fresh impetus to 
markets globally, leading to local 
currency growth of 8.8% and 15.7% 
in the UK and Spain respectively.

GAME Digital plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Improving our performance through the realisation of 
organisational efficiencies and cost-saving measures, as 
outlined in the UK action plan initiated in January 2016, remains 
a key focus for the business. Considerable attention continues 
to be given to the review of our store footprint and reducing 
property costs wherever possible. Almost 40 lease renewals 
have been renegotiated on improved terms during the last 
12 months and where proposed new lease terms have not been 
acceptable, the Group has relocated to lower-cost premises. 
We are also exploring opportunities to open new concession 
locations where lower cost of occupation and more flexible 
terms can be agreed, commencing a concession trial with the 
leading consumer electronics retailer Maplin, in September 
2017. We are also exploring opportunities to open new BELONG 
venues in low-cost, high footfall retail and leisure locations both 
within, and outside, our existing estate.
Within retail operations, we continue to focus on improving 
customer service standards whilst carefully managing our 
store employee costs, flexing resourcing levels during periods 
of higher and lower demand. We have also continued to focus 
on reducing expenditure across the business, where possible, 
and have delivered procurement savings on certain business 
service contracts, productivity improvements in our distribution 
centres and other business process improvements. 
These initiatives have seen the realisation of £11.1 million 
in overall operational efficiencies and savings in the year, 
across our UK Retail operations including:
 — £3.8 million reduction in store payroll and other store 
variable costs, before absorbing additional inflation including 
the effects of statutory wage increases
 — a reduction of £1.4 million in property-related costs, 
reflecting savings from rent renegotiations 
 — distribution savings and efficiencies of £1.4 million
 — reduction in marketing costs other efficiencies and 
procurement benefits of £4.5 million.
Overall, underlying operating costs (before depreciation 
and amortisation and adjusting and exceptional items) were 
reduced by £7.4 million. This reflects the cost savings outlined 
above together with the investments we have made to support 
multichannel and customer service improvements, additional 
rent from the recent Basingstoke property sale and leaseback 
as well as the continued development of our growth categories. 
Further efficiencies and savings totalling £8.3 million have been 
targeted for FY17/18 with £2.1 million having been achieved in 
the first quarter of the new financial year.
We ended the year with 304 stores (2016: 313) in the UK, with an 
average length to first break of 0.9 years and 221 lease events 
by the end of calendar year 2018. We opened 11 new stores, 
closed 20 stores of which six were relocations during the year. 
We had eight loss-making stores in the UK in the year (2016: 
one) (calculated as annual store EBITDA contribution before the 
allocation of central overheads, excluding new stores or closed 
stores) all of which have been addressed with reduced rents (two 
moving to nil rents) or will be closing or have an imminent lease 
event/an opportunity to turnaround the operating performance.

GAME Digital plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Overview Strategic report Governance Results Shareholder information Events, Esports & Digital 
Events, Esports & Digital (EE&D) includes our local competitive 
gaming activity, managed under our new BELONG™ brand 
which launched in late 2016, together with Multiplay (comprising 
both the Events & Esports and Digital divisions), Ads Reality and 
SocialNat. Having been purchased in February 2016, SocialNat 
has been integrated into our Spanish business and rebranded 
as Game Esports Spain. 
In aggregate, we delivered sales of £13.2 million from EE&D 
in the year (2016: £6.1 million) up 116.4%, with the majority 
of sales in the year generated from Multiplay. The Group has 
continued to invest in and develop Multiplay’s Digital division, 
comprising its multiplayer game server-hosting technology, 
and the Events and Esports activities, encompassing major 
gaming and esports events during the year. Benefiting from 
this development both activities have independently delivered 
significant revenue growth over the last twelve months. 
Multiplay’s Digital sales more than doubled, from £2.1 million 
to £4.5 million, whilst Multiplay’s Events and Esports sales 
increased almost 50%, from £4.8 million to £7.3 million. 
Last year, the Multiplay Events and Esports business was 
relocated and its integration into the core GAME business has 
commenced. Multiplay’s Digital division remains a separate 
business unit, based in the New Forest, Hampshire.
Whilst we expect to achieve better than average gross margins 
from these areas over the medium term, the gross profit margin 
declined 2.4% percentage points in the year. This reduction was 
predominantly caused by the investment in the cost of sales 
within the Events business following the move of the Insomnia 
festival to the NEC in August 2016, as we scaled the event to 
a new and larger venue to accommodate future growth.
We continue to develop and invest in each of our Events, Esports 
& Digital activities to support the future growth ambitions 
for these businesses. Reflecting this investment, underlying 
operating costs (before depreciation, amortisation and adjusting 
and exceptional items) rose £4.1 million to £8.5 million (2016: 
£4.4 million). This included higher operating costs for Multiplay 
of £4.9 million (up £0.8 million in the period); first-time costs 
relating to the set-up and operation of the new BELONG concept 
of £2.2 million and the first full year of Ads Reality and Game 
Esports Spain of £1.4 million, up £1.1 million on the year.
Core Retail: Spain
Our Spanish business produced another strong performance. 
GTV growth of 12.8% was delivered in the second half, resulting 
in total GTV for the year up 6.7% on a local currency basis. 
We maintained our leading position in the Spanish market 
during the year, with a share of 40% (2016: 40%).
In local currency terms, we delivered Content GTV growth 
of 7.7% in the territory. Within this, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One 
physical software sales were up 21.3% and digital sales were up 
21.1%. Total Preowned sales rose 2.7% on the back of the strong 
mint software market, with further strong growth in PlayStation 
4 and Xbox One software sales, up 43.7%, and preowned 
technology sales, up 41.3%. Sales of Accessories & Other rose 
29.6%, whilst low-margin Hardware sales fell by 3.9% (including 
the growth in the second half of 21.1%, driven by the launch of 
the Nintendo Switch). 
Aligned with our UK priorities, we continue to focus our efforts 
in Spain on driving the development of digital and non-console 
retail categories, with GTV in these areas (including preowned 
technology products, PC accessories, licensed merchandise, 
virtual reality devices and retail services) up 31.1% in the year. 
We are also planning our first gaming arenas to launch in the 
first six months of 2018.
In total, after the effects of a stronger Euro, which appreciated 
approximately 13% against Sterling, our Spanish GTV rose 
22.5% and gross profit rose 16.8%, after a 0.9 percentage 
points decline in gross profit margin, to 24.5%. The margin rate 
decline was mainly explained by a lower mix of prior generation 
preowned sales.
Underlying operating costs (before depreciation, amortisation 
and adjusting and exceptional items) rose €2.5 million, or 4.0% 
on a local currency basis, well below the rate of increase in sales. 
We opened four new stores in Spain in the year and closed 
three, ending with 268 stores (2016: 267) of which three were 
loss making (2016: three).

£6.5 million or 0.9%. After a decline in the first half, sales grew 
in the second half of the financial year, with GTV increasing 6.6%. 
GTV in the second half of the year benefited from the release 
of the Nintendo Switch™ console in March 2017, together with 
a strong performance from digital content, gaming accessories 
and licensed merchandise. Sales from the Group’s Events, 
Esports & Digital businesses also continued to grow strongly, 
up 116.4% in the year. A key priority for the Group continues to 
be the further development of the Group’s digital and non-
console categories (including PC gaming accessories, virtual

and licensed merchandise), where GTV growth of 23.8% was 
delivered in the year.

GAME Digital plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Despite strong sales growth in the Spanish Retail business 
and across the Group’s Events, Esports & Digital divisions, 
Group revenue declined by 3.6% in the period to £782.9 million 
(2016: £812.5 million), driven by the decline in UK Retail. 
Group gross margins (as a percentage of revenue) reduced 
by 60 basis points to 26.2%. This decline was a result of 
the higher mix of sales originating from our Spanish Retail 
and Events, Esports & Digital businesses, where the Group 
currently achieves a lower gross margin than UK Retail. The 
reclassification of marketing income and other promotional 
funding from operating expenses to cost of sales has also 
impacted on the gross margin as the level of income varies 
between years.
The increase of 2.8% in underlying operating costs (excluding 
exceptional and adjusting items and excluding depreciation and 
amortisation) to £197.1 million was a result of cost increases in 
the core Spanish retail business as well as cost investment in 
the Group’s Events, Esports & Digital businesses offset in part 
by savings in the core UK retail business. Overall underlying 
costs in Core Retail rose 0.6%, with a £7.4 million reduction 
in UK retail operating costs (after absorbing statutory wage 
increases and additional cost increases from the sale and 
leaseback of the Basingstoke premise) being offset by the 
impact of higher Spanish retail costs, largely explained by 
the translation effect of weaker year-on-year Sterling to Euro 
exchange rates. Underlying Spanish retail costs increased 4% 
in local currency terms, broadly in line with the uplift in GTV 
of 6.7%. Costs across the Group’s Events, Esports & Digital 
divisions, comprising Multiplay, Game Esports Spain and Ads 
Reality, as well as the Group’s new local competitive gaming 
activities, increased by £4.1 million to £8.5 million.
The Group made an operating loss of £(8.7) million (2016: 
£2.2 million operating profit). This loss is explained by the lower 
gross profit generation, higher operating expenses, including 
a £1.0 million increase in depreciation and amortisation, and 
is after the inclusion of exceptional income of £6.3 million in 
the period (2016: exceptional costs of £0.5 million). The Group 
delivered an Adjusted EBITDA of £8.0 million (2016: £25.6 
million), reflecting a £14.7 million decline in Core Retail to £14.0 
million and the EBITDA loss of £(6.0) million (2016: EBITDA loss 
£(3.1) million) within Events, Esports & Digital incurred as the 
new business activities were being further developed.
The Adjusted loss before tax for the year was £(4.3) million 
(2016: £14.0 million profit) and the Adjusted basic loss per share 
was (3.8p) (Adjusted basic earnings per share 2016: 7.8 p). On 
a statutory basis, the loss before tax was £(10.0) million (2016: 
£1.1 million profit) and basic loss per share was (7.1p) (earnings 
per share 2016: 1.5p).

1. Calculated as a % of revenue.
After a stronger second half performance, the core UK Retail 
business saw Gross Transaction Values decline by 13.4% and 
revenue by 14.9% in the year. A key priority for the business 
continues to be the further development of its digital and 
non-console retail categories. GTV across these categories 
grew 14.9% in the year, to £162.8 million.
An increase in sales mix of higher margin categories, together 
with higher achieved margins on mint Hardware following 
the launch of the Nintendo Switch, drove a 10 basis point 
improvement to the gross margin (as a % of revenue), to 27.4% 
(2016: 27.3%).
Operating costs before depreciation and amortisation and 
adjusting and exceptional items were reduced by £7.4 million 
or 5.3%. This net reduction reflects achieved operating cost 
savings of £11.1 million, partially offset by statutory wage 
increases implemented during the year, cost investment to 
support strategic growth initiatives and rent payable on the 
UK distribution centre and head office buildings of £0.8 million 
following the sale and leaseback of the property in October 2016.
Despite the improvement in gross margin rate and lower costs, 
the fall in GTV meant Adjusted EBITDA for the core UK Retail 
business declined to £1.8 million in the year (2016: £17.7 million).

GTV growth of 6.7% over the period on a local currency basis. 
Excluding low margin hardware, Spanish retail GTV grew 10.0%. 
Consistent with the UK business, a key priority for the Spanish 
retail business is the continued development of digital and 
non-console retail categories (including PC gaming accessories 
and virtual reality headsets), where GTV growth of 31.1% was 
delivered on a local currency basis.
On a reported basis, after the effects of a stronger Euro during 
the period, Spanish GTV rose 22.5% while Spanish revenue 
grew 21.5% to £278.4 million.
Gross margin rates in the territory declined by 90 basis points 
to 24.5% (2016: 25.4%), reflecting a lower mix of higher margin 
older generation software (across both mint and preowned 
categories) as well as selected price investment across key 
categories to support our leading market shares. Spanish 
operating costs excluding depreciation, amortisation and 
adjusting and exceptional items increased to £55.9 million 
(2016: £47.3 million), representing 17.7% of GTV (2016: 18.3%). 
On a local currency basis, Spanish operating costs excluding 
depreciation, amortisation and adjusting and exceptional items 
increased €2.5 million, or 4.0%, broadly in line with the increase 
in sales.
The Adjusted EBITDA for the period was £12.2 million (2016: 
£11.0 million). In local currency terms Adjusted EBITDA was 
€14.2 million (2016: €15.1 million).

Revenue from Events, Esports & Digital, comprising the Multiplay 
and Ads Reality businesses in the UK, and revenue generated 
from esports and local competitive gaming activities in the UK 
and Spain, grew 116.4% to £13.2 million (2016: £6.1 million). 
Revenue streams include ticket sales, in-store gaming services 
such as ‘pay-to-play’ and advertising and sponsorship deals.
Combined gross margins across these areas declined by 
2.4 percentage points, to 18.9%. This decline was largely due 
to increased costs of sales within Multiplay’s Events division 
as a result of moving to the NEC, in preparation for further 
expected growth in audience numbers.

GAME Digital plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Overview Strategic report Governance Results Shareholder information Core underlying operating costs attributable to Events, 
Esports & Digital increased £4.1 million to £8.5 million (2016: 
£4.4 million) as the Group continued to expand its activities 
and further develop its operations. Cost investment across 
Multiplay’s Events and Digital businesses amounted to £0.8 
million, taking total Multiplay costs in the period to £4.9 million. 
In addition, £2.2 million of cost was incurred by the Group’s new 
local competitive gaming activities (2016: nil) with the balance 
of the remaining cost investment split across Ads Reality and 
Game Esports Spain.
Investment continues into activities targeted to deliver 
future growth, including the roll out of 18 BELONG gaming 
arenas during the year, and an upgrade to the Group’s server 
management platform to enable it to run the global hosting 
requirements for major AAA titles. The Adjusted EBITDA loss 
was £6.0 million (2016 EBITDA loss: £3.1 million).
Gross Transaction Value (GTV) and Revenue 
Total Group Gross Transaction Value (GTV) fell 2.4% over the 
year to £891.0 million (2016: £912.6 million) with strong growth 
achieved in the second half of the year (H1: (6.9)%, H2: +6.6%).
Hardware sales rebounded strongly in the second half, rising 
25.5% following the launch of the Nintendo Switch in March 
2017. However this was not sufficient to offset the declines 
experienced in the first half, with overall Hardware GTV for the 
year £28.1 million lower, at £174.2 million (2016: £202.3 million).
Excluding lower margin Hardware, GTV grew by £6.5 million or 
0.9%, with continued growth in Accessories & Other more than 
offsetting the decline in Content and Preowned. 
Content GTV, which includes both mint boxed and digital game 
content, fell by 1.2% (H1: (1.9)%, H2: +0.1%). In part, this is 
explained by the ongoing decline in physical sales for Xbox 360 
and PlayStation 3, with sales down a further 69.3% across the 
Group. The combined GTV of all other software formats was 
flat in the year, although, as reported in the Group’s first half 
results, the market reaction to certain key annual titles in the 
first half was not as strong as in the prior year and there was no 
major, non-perennial title to match the performance of Fallout 
4, which launched in the equivalent period in 2015/16. Within 
Content GTV, digital sales continued to grow, rising 16.8% to 
£128.7 million.
GTV from Preowned products decreased by 6.2% to £174.3 
million (H1: (8.7%), H2: (3.0%)). Sales of preowned PlayStation 
4 and Xbox One software products rose 12.1%, and sales 
of preowned mobile phones and tablets rose 4.4% over the 
year, but these were more than offset by a decline in sales 
of preowned Xbox 360, PlayStation 3 and other older format 
hardware and software.
GTV from the Accessories & Other category increased by £23.0 
million or 18.6% to £146.5 million, benefiting from a £7.1 million 
increase in Events, Esports & Digital sales, together with strong 
growth of PC accessories and licensed products. On a statutory 
basis, Group revenue declined 3.6% to £782.9 million (2016: 
£812.5 million).
Gross profit
Gross profit fell by 5.7% to £205.1 million (2016: £217.4 million). 
Foreign exchange rates positively impacted the reported gross 
profit during the half, with the Euro c.13% stronger relative to 
Sterling in the 52 weeks ended 29 July 2017. This accounted 
for a year-on-year benefit to gross profit of c.£8.6 million. 
On an underlying, constant currency basis, total gross profit 
decreased by 9.6%.

GAME Digital plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Overview Strategic report Governance Results Shareholder information Overall gross profit rates remained broadly stable in the year, 
at 26.2% (2016: 26.8%).
The Content gross profit rate decreased 0.8 percentage points 
to 32.3% given the mix of physical and digital product sales.
Preowned margin rates fell 2.3 percentage points due to 
the increasing mix of Xbox One and PlayStation 4 (new format) 
software and technology products, which achieve lower margin 
rates than older format preowned sales.
The gross margin of Accessories & Other fell 4.8 percentage 
points to 29.4%. This decline was due to the first-time 
contribution of virtual reality device sales launched in the 
period, which attract a lower margin than the category average 
as well as year-on-year decline in the gross margin achieved for 
the licensed merchandise sub-category, due to the mix of sales 
within that category.
Hardware margin rates improved 1.9 percentage points to 6.1% 
due to improved supplier terms and higher achieved average 
selling prices on the new console iterations launched during the 
year, comprising the Xbox One S, PlayStation 4 Slim, PlayStation 
4 Pro and Nintendo Switch.
Operating expenses 
Continuing operating expenses before exceptional and adjusting 
items, comprising selling and distribution and administrative 
expenses, increased by £3.9 million or 1.9% to £208.1 million. 
Continuing operating expenses, before exceptional and 
adjusting items and excluding depreciation and amortisation 
increased by 1.8% to £197.1 million. 
Group continuing selling and distribution expenses decreased 
1.7% or £2.7 million to £154.3 million, whilst Group continuing 
administrative costs increased by £6.6 million to £53.8 
million. Expansion of the Events, Esports & Digital businesses 
accounted for £3.1 million of the increase in Group continuing 
administrative costs. Further investment was also made in 
UK Retail to strengthen the senior management team and 
an additional rent cost of over £0.8 million has been incurred 
following the sale and leaseback of the distribution centre and 
head office buildings. Both the UK and Spain have also invested 
in the new retail categories.

GAME Digital plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Underlying core retail costs were up 0.6%, at £188.6 million 
(2016: £187.4 million). Within this, UK retail costs were reduced 
by 5.3% or £7.4 million to £132.7 million whilst Spanish retail 
costs increased 18.2% to £55.9 million predominantly due to 
the impact of a weaker pound. Across the Group’s UK retail 
operations a number of business efficiencies and cost savings 
have been delivered during the year:
 — £3.8 million reduction in store payroll and other store 
variable costs, before absorbing additional inflation including 
the effects of statutory wage increases
 — A reduction of £1.4 million in property related costs, 
reflecting savings from rent renegotiations 
 — Distribution savings and efficiencies of £1.4 million
 — Reduction in marketing costs, other efficiencies and 
procurement benefits of £4.5 million.
In local currency, Spanish retail costs for the period increased 
by 4.0% or €2.5 million, compared with GTV sales growth of 
6.7%. Higher distribution costs and store variable costs mainly 
linked to greater sales activity were incurred together with 
further investment in central costs to similarly drive the new 
growth initiatives including costs associated with the repair 
centre and the greater focus on developing the PC category. 
Operating expenses across the Group’s Events, Esports & 
Digital businesses rose £4.1 million to £8.5 million, with further 
investments made across each area. In 2017, for the first time 
these costs included expenses incurred in relation to the 
Group’s new live gaming UK retail concept (BELONG); first full 
year of costs for both Ads Reality and Game Esports Spain as 
well as increases in Multiplay’s costs associated with the ramp 
up in trading across both its Events and Digital divisions.

GAME Digital plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Overview Strategic report Governance Results Shareholder information Adjusted EBITDA 
Group Adjusted EBITDA (EBITDA less exceptional and adjusting 
items) of £8.0 million (2016: £25.6 million) fell by £17.6 million 
in the period. Core Retail performance reflects a £15.9 million 
decline related to the UK Retail operation whilst the Spanish 
Retail operations delivered an Adjusted EBITDA of £12.2 million, 
up £1.2 million. The Adjusted EBITDA loss from Events, Esports 
& Digital totalled £6.0 million (2016 EBITDA loss: £3.1 million) 
reflecting the scaling of operations to support future growth 
ambitions across these areas. 
Financing costs 
Net financing costs totalled £1.3 million (2016: £1.1 million). 
The increase in financing costs reflects more frequent drawings 
in Spain over the period and the higher non-utilisation costs of 
the new and larger UK facilities.
(Loss)/profit before tax
The loss before tax for the period amounted to £10.0 million 
(2016 (53 week): £1.9 million profit). The profit before tax for 
Core Retail was £0.4 million (2016 (53 week): £9.4 million profit) 
and Events, Esports & Digital incurred a loss before tax of 
£10.4 million (2016 loss: £7.5 million).
Taxation 
The effective tax rate (defined as the accounting tax charge 
divided by the accounting profits before tax) was -21.0% (2016: 
-68.4%). The tax rates in both periods has been impacted by a 
number of one-off adjustments to the tax charge, unrecognised 
losses and the sale of the freehold property in the UK.

Capital expenditure and proceeds from the sale of property
Group capital expenditure amounted to £11.6 million (2016: 
£13.3 million), representing 1.5% of revenue (2016: 1.6%). 
Capital expenditure was incurred on investment in the UK 
and Spanish retail operations. This included expenditure on 
16 new BELONG arenas, including seven store relocations, 
and further upgrade and maintenance capital expenditure for 
the existing store environment, core IT systems and distribution 
centre. In addition, capital expenditure was incurred on the 
Group’s online and digital infrastructure and managed server 
hosting technology.
Future capital expenditure is planned for the existing physical 
estate, focused on the development of more experiential 
BELONG gaming arenas, new Game concessions and other 
planned relocations. Capital expenditure plans also include 
visual merchandising opportunities to improve sales densities 
in stores in both UK and Spain. Finally, additional capital 
expenditure is planned for online initiatives, core IT and 
digital infrastructure.
Proceeds from the sale of property of £13.3 million (2016: 
£nil) related to the net sale proceeds received in October 2016 
from the sale and leaseback of the Group’s freehold property 
interests of the distribution centre and head office buildings 
located in Basingstoke, UK. The Group continues to operate 
its principal UK business activities from its Basingstoke head 
office and continues to use its distribution centre as its primary 
UK store and online storage and fulfilment centre.
Dividends
Reflecting the decision to increase investment in the Group’s 
new BELONG concept and optimise the UK estate in light of 
the significant number of lease events planned for over the next 
12 months, the Board has taken the decision not to declare a final 
dividend payment (2016: 1.75 pence per share). Total ordinary 
dividend in respect of the financial year therefore totals 
1.0 pence per share (2016: 3.42 pence per share). 
The Board will continue to evaluate future dividends and 
remains committed to returning surplus cash to shareholders 
after retaining sufficient capital to fund the required investment 
to support future business growth.
Cash resources and financing
As at 29 July 2017, the Group had aggregate available facilities 
of approximately £77 million (2016: £80 million) comprising a 
UK asset-backed revolving loan facility agreement with PNC 
Financial Services UK Limited and Wells Fargo Capital Finance 
(UK) Limited of £50 million and short-term financing facilities 
with Spanish banks BBVA and Banco Santander amounting to 
€30.0 million (2016: €49.6 million). The UK asset-backed facility 
can be increased annually over the peak season by a further 
£25 million. As at 29 July 2017, the UK and Spain facilities 
were undrawn.

Overview Strategic report Governance Results Shareholder information The asset-backed revolving loan facility of up to £100.0 million 
with Lajedosa Investments S.à r.l., a related party, matured on 
31 October 2017. No amount had been drawn under this facility 
up to the date of maturity. 
 
On 6 October 2017, 14 October 2017, 17 October 2017, 27 October 
2017 and 30 October 2017 the Company’s Spanish subsidiary, 
Game Stores Iberia SLU, entered into and renewed a number of 
short-term financing facilities with Spanish banks Banco Bilbao 
Vizcaya Argentaria, S.A., Bankia S.A. and Ibercaja Banco S.A. 
in an aggregate amount of €40,600,000, comprising €25,600,000 
of overdraft facilities and €15,000,000 of commercial credit 
guarantees made available to suppliers by the banks. The cost 
to the Group of the overdraft facilities is an arrangement fee up 
to 0.13 per cent, a quarterly commitment fee of between 0.10 
per cent and 0.18 per cent per annum and interest on drawn 
funds up to 2.75 per cent per annum above Euribor. The cost 
to the Group of the bank guarantees is an arrangement fee of 
up to 0.15 per cent and a quarterly commitment fee of between 
0.20 per cent and 0.30 per cent per annum. 
Working capital 
Net investment in trade working capital decreased by £9.6

Trade receivables 9.9 9.5 0.4 
Trade payables (47.3) (31.6) (15.7)
43.8 54.0 (10.2)
The Group is carrying higher stock balances of £81.2 million 
at the end of the financial year, up £5.1 million on last year. 
This increase is explained by further investment in growth 
categories such as PC accessories and preowned phones and 
tablets, as well as the impact of foreign exchange rates on the 
Spanish balance. The Group continues to maintain a strong 
focus on the efficient management of console software and 
hardware stock.
The trade receivables balance increased modestly, to 
£9.9 million (2016: £9.5 million). 
Trade payables increased by £15.7 million to £47.3 million. 
This movement was predominantly due to a strong focus on 
working capital management throughout the year as well as 
a timing benefit arising from the impact of the 53rd week last 
year which brought in an additional supplier payment run for 
the calendar month end in July 2016.
Prior period restatements and changes 
in accounting estimates
During the period, as part of a detailed review of financial 
processes, controls and reconciliations in the UK retail 
business, material differences were identified in two balance 
sheet accounts. Further investigation highlighted that 
the differences related to previous years and, due to their 
materiality, a prior period error has been recorded in the 
financial statements.
The first adjustment relates to the correction of accruals for 
stock received but not invoiced, of £2.3 million as at 25 July 2015 
and a further £0.9m in the period ended 30 July 2016. Secondly, 
the provision for margin adjustments in relation to the sale of 
preowned goods was found to be understated and, accordingly, 
£0.7 million has been recorded as a deduction from revenue 
in the period ended 30 July 2016 and £0.9 million in the period 
ended 25 July 2015.
Accordingly, the Adjusted EBITDA for the 53 weeks ended 
30 July 2016 was restated from £28.0 million to £26.4 million, 
reflecting an additional accrual for stock purchases of 
£0.9 million in the period and margin adjustment on preowned 
sales of £0.7 million.
The provision relating to the error in margin adjustments was 
identified and corrections have been made to restate amounts 
in the appropriate accounting periods. In order to recover 
potentially overpaid VAT on preowned goods, the error will need 
to be agreed with HMRC and, as there is currently no certainty 
over the recoverability of part or all of the error, no receivable 
balance has been recorded in the financial statements. 
 
In the next financial year, and subject to agreement with HMRC, 
any amount recovered will be recorded in the statement of 
comprehensive income. Any material recovery will be presented 
as an exceptional item, and, subject to the size of the amounts it 
may require separate presentation and disclosure. 
In addition, an exceptional item of £1.4 million was recorded 
in the statement of comprehensive income in the period ended 
30 July 2016 for gift card expiries relating to prior periods and 
other similar prior year items. This was not considered to be a 
material prior period error requiring restatement at the time, 
however, together with the amounts identified in the current 
financial year, this £1.4 million has been reflected in the years 
to which it relates, being the period ended 25 July 2015 and 
earlier financial periods.
FINANCIAL REVIEW 
CONTINUED
62
GAME Digital plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 The Group has also undertaken a review of all of its supplier 
funding arrangements and how these are reflected in the 
financial statements. In accordance with developing accounting 
practice and other recent guidance and interpretations, 
income received from suppliers in relation to promotional 
support where there are no directly attributable costs has 
been reclassified from other operating expenses to a deduction 
within cost of sales and a small amount recorded as revenue. 
The impact on the period ended 30 July 2016 has been to record 
an additional £0.1 million of revenue, an £11.8 million deduction 
to cost of sales and a corresponding £11.9 million increase to 
other operating expenses. The Adjusted EBITDA and operating 
profit for the prior period are unchanged as a result of this 
particular restatement.
Following the review into gift card reporting in the previous 
year, management have undertaken an additional project in 
the current year to age all gift card balances. This review has 
resulted in a change in the accounting estimate for the expiry 
rate and, accordingly, an additional £0.4 million of income has 
been recognised in the statement of comprehensive income, 
reflecting the change in the expiry rate methodology.
A similar detailed review of loyalty scheme balances by 
customers was also undertaken in the year, following a 
reduction in the validity period of loyalty scheme points in the 
previous period from 18 months to 12 months. This reduction 
had the effect of increasing the expiry rate and the resulting 
income recognition in the statement of comprehensive income 
in the current period. The change also resulted in higher 
expiries of points accrued in the previous financial period and, 
consequently, the value of prior year points recognised in the 
statement of comprehensive income when compared to the 
provision for expiries made at 30 July 2016. The reduced cost 
recorded in the statement of comprehensive income for points 
awarded in the prior year and recognised as expired that was 
incremental to the original accounting estimate of expected 
expiries made at 30 July 2016 was £1.0 million.
Going concern
The Directors have considered the activities and performance 
of the Group together with factors which could potentially affect 
future developments. After careful consideration the Directors 
believe that the Group has sufficient cash resources and 
appropriate financing facilities to ensure payments can be made 
as they fall due.
In making their assessment the Directors have reviewed the 
Group’s latest budget and forecasts and considered reasonably 
possible downside sensitivities in performance and mitigating 
actions. These indicate that the Group will operate within its 
cash resources, financing facilities and covenants. Accordingly 
the financial statements have been prepared on the going 
concern basis.
Viability statement
In accordance with provision C.2.2 of the 2016 revision of the 
Code, the Directors have assessed the viability of the Company 
and Group over a longer period than the 12 months required 
by the Going Concern reporting requirements. The Directors 
concluded that an assessment period of three years to July 
2020 is appropriate as this is consistent with the Group’s three 
year plan process. The Group’s plans take into consideration the 
current and expected future market conditions and latest and 
projected trading performance, the Group’s strategy, plans and 
the principal risks, as set out in the Report and Accounts.
In assessing viability, the Directors have considered the 
principal risks facing the Group and modelled reasonable 
downside scenarios to analyse the cash and borrowing levels 
as well as the headroom under the Group’s facilities and 
this modelling included the potential for and effectiveness 
of mitigating actions. Various scenarios were modelled, some 
of which took account of the impact of plausible multiple risks 
occurring and these included faster declines in the console 
market including lower sales of physical software; slower 
growth in profits from its new growth activities including its 
experiential gaming concepts; and potential changes in the 
financial position including changes in lending and credit 
insurance arrangements. The Directors also considered 
other strategic initiatives that could mitigate against the risks 
assessed above including the potential sale of parts of the Group. 
Based on this assessment and after careful consideration, the 
Directors believe that it is reasonable to expect that the Group 
will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as 
they fall due over the period to 31 July 2020.
The Strategic report has been approved by the Board of 
Directors on 14 November 2017 and is signed on its behalf by:

CHAIRMAN’S INTRODUCTION  
TO CORPORATE GOVERNANCE  I am pleased to present my first Corporate Governance 
Statement on behalf of the Board, following my appointment 
to the role of Chairman at the conclusion of the Company’s AGM 
on 18 January 2017 and I would like to thank David Hamid for his 
development of the Corporate Governance agenda during his 
time as Chairman. I would also like to extend my thanks to 
Frank Tuil who resigned from the Board in October 2016 and 
gave a valuable contribution to the Board in his time as a 
representative Director
1
. 
As Chairman my principal role is to lead the Board and ensure 
that it continues to operate effectively to help deliver 
shareholder value and promote the success of the Company. 
Good corporate governance underpins this role and the Board 
aims to ensure that good standards of corporate governance 
are upheld throughout the Group. The Group has developed a 
corporate governance framework designed to ensure that the 
business operates with integrity and in compliance with the UK 
Corporate Governance Code. Equally, governance is organised 
so that it does not detract from the entrepreneurial spirit of the 
management of the Group’s activities. I believe that the Group 
has maintained sufficient systems of internal control and open 
communication that gives Board members access to the 
correct level of information required for them to challenge 
effectively and fulfil their role.
Towards the end of the financial year, the Board carried out 
an internal review of the Board composition and effectiveness. 
This confirmed the Board’s view that the Non-Executive Directors 
offer the right mix of skills and experience to assist in the 
development of the strategic direction and the implementation 
of necessary changes to the business, given the challenges in 
our sector of the retail market. I am therefore satisfied that the 
Board operates effectively. Further details regarding the 
findings from the annual internal Board review are set out in 
this statement. Since my appointment as Chairman the position 
of Senior Independent Director has been vacant and the 
responsibilities of the Senior Independent Director have been 
fulfilled by the existing Non-Executive Directors. The Board is 
satisfied that the responsibilities, usually assumed by a Senior 
Independent Director, are being discharged effectively with the 
assistance of the Company’s independent Non-Executive 
Directors, particularly given the increased level of contact that 
Caspar Woolley has had with investors as part of the triennial 
remuneration policy review. However, we will keep the position 
under constant review to assess if a permanent appointment 
should be made in the future.

Compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code
Throughout the year including up to the date of this Annual 
Report, the Company has applied the principles and complied 
with the majority of the provisions set out in the UK Corporate 
Governance Code as revised in April 2016 (the ‘Code’) which 
is publicly available to view at www.frc.org.uk.
John Jackson, formerly the Company’s Senior Independent 
Director, was appointed to the position of Chairman following 
the conclusion of the Company’s Annual General Meeting 
(‘AGM’) on 18 January 2017 and since that date the position of 
Senior Independent Director has been vacant and the Company 
has technically not been in compliance with Code provisions 
A.4.1, A.4.2, B.6.3 and E.1.1 in relation to the appointment and 
responsibilities of the Senior Independent Director. However, as 
explained in full in the Company’s Nomination Report on pages 
78 to 80 the responsibilities of the Senior Independent Director 
are being fulfilled by the existing Non-Executive Directors and 
therefore although the Company is in technical non-compliance 
with the Code it does not feel it is necessary to formally appoint 
a Senior Independent Director at this time. The Company 
intends to keep under review the position of Senior Independent 
Director to ensure that the responsibilities continue to be 
discharged effectively and to monitor whether a formal 
appointment may be necessary in the future.
The requirement under the Listing Rules to produce a 
statement of how the ‘Main Principles’ set out in the Code have 
been applied is set out on our corporate website at 
www.gamedigitalplc.com. Detail needed in line with the specific 
provisions of the Code is set out in this Corporate Governance 
Statement and our compliance with key areas of the Code is 
summarised below:
 — independence – over half of our Board comprises 
independent Non-Executive Directors and the composition 
of all Board committees complies with the Code
 — accountability and election – there is a clear separation 
of duties between the Chairman and CEO and all Directors 
are required to stand for annual re-election. 
 — evaluation – an internal review of the Board and its 
committees was undertaken during the year. 
 — relations with shareholders – the Chairman and Non-
Executive Directors are available to shareholders and the 
Company met with its major shareholders during the year.
 — attendance – the Directors have all attended an acceptable 
level of Board and committee meetings. 
 — experience – the Audit and Risk Committee Chair met the 
specific requirements with regard to recent and relevant 
financial experience throughout 2016/17.
 — Auditor tenure – we changed our auditor in 2016/17, 
following a thorough tender process. 
 — Internal Audit – a full description of the Internal Audit 
function is provided within this report.
Share Dealing Code
The Company’s Share Dealing Code is in compliance with 
Regulation (EU) No. 596/2014 of the European Parliament and 
of the Council on Market Abuse which came into force on 3 July 
2016, and applies to companies listed on the main market of the 
London Stock Exchange. The Company’s Share Dealing Code 
applies to Board Directors, any additional identified individuals 
with senior managerial responsibility, together categorised as 
Persons Discharging Managerial Responsibility (‘PDMR’) and 
to certain employees of Group companies. All PDMR’s are 
responsible for ensuring compliance of those individuals to 
whom they are closely associated in line with the Company’s 
Share Dealing Code. Although the Model Code has now been 
removed, the Company will continue to follow best practice 
guidance published by the Financial Conduct Authority. 
Relations with shareholders
The Board recognises the importance of creating a clear flow 
of communication with all of the Company’s stakeholders, 
including shareholders, particularly with regard to business 
developments and financial results. The Board aims to 
communicate on a regular basis through news releases, 
investor presentations and Company publications. As part of an 
active investor relations programme, the Company met with all 
its major shareholders and a number of prospective investors 
over the course of the year. The Chairman also met with 
shareholders following the trading update issued in June 2017 
to discuss strategy, trading and plans for the year ahead.
Regular updates are given to the Board by the Head of 
Corporate Finance and Investor Relations, who also provides 
an immediate point of contact for the Non-Executive Directors 
to develop an understanding of the views major shareholders 
hold about the Company. The AGM provides an opportunity for 
the Chairman to explain the Company’s progress and, along 
with other members of the Board, to answer any questions 
raised by shareholders. All Directors attended the 2016 AGM.
In line with the Code, Caspar Woolley and Lesley Watkins, 
as the independent Non-Executive Directors, are available to 
shareholders throughout the year if they have concerns that 
contact through the normal channels of the Chairman or other 
Executive Directors have failed to resolve, or in circumstances 
where such channels of communication are inappropriate. 
Furthermore, as part of the triennial remuneration policy 
review process, Caspar Woolley accompanied by the Company 
Secretary met with key shareholders and took the opportunity 
to discuss wider points.

Leadership
Board structure 
The Company considers there to be an appropriate combination 
of Executive and Non-Executive Directors, with independent 
Non-Executive Directors comprising at least half the Board 
(excluding the Chairman). The Board comprises a Non-
Executive Chairman, two Executive Directors and two 
independent Non-Executive Directors. The Company regards 
Lesley Watkins and Caspar Woolley as independent Non-
Executive Directors for the purposes of the Code and believes 
the Board structure is in the best interests of shareholders.
Division of responsibilities
For the Board to remain effective, the Code requires a clear 
division of responsibilities between the Chairman and the Chief 
Executive Officer. These positions are currently held by John 
Jackson as Chairman and Martyn Gibbs as Chief Executive 
Officer. The division of responsibilities between the Chairman 
and the Chief Executive Officer is set out as a statement and 
available to view on the Company’s corporate website at 
www.gamedigitalplc.com.
The Chairman reports to the Board and is the guardian of the 
Board’s decision-making processes. He is responsible for the 
effective running of the Board, and provides information on the 
Company’s financial performance as well as corporate issues 
requiring attention and discussion by the Board. 
The Chief Executive Officer, assisted by senior management, 
is responsible for proposing and developing the Company’s 
strategy and commercial objectives for consideration by the 
Board, and for implementing the decisions of the Board into 
the day-to-day functions of the business.
The Non-Executives’ key responsibilities are to bring strong 
advice, judgement and independent challenge to the Executive 
Directors. Papers are distributed on a timely basis in advance 
of meetings and are of a quality appropriate to enable the Board 
to discharge its responsibilities.
Decision-making and conflicts of interest
No individual or group of individuals dominates the Board’s 
decision-making process. In accordance with the Company’s 
articles of association, procedures are in place for the 
disclosure by Directors, in advance, of any situational conflicts 
and for the consideration and authorisation of these conflicts 
by the Board. As at the date of this report, none of the Directors 
has any potential conflict of interest between their duties to the 
Company and their private interests and/or duties owed to 
third parties.
On 6 June 2014 the Company, the Major Shareholder and Baker 
Partners LP entered into a relationship agreement which 
regulates the on-going relationship between the Company 
and the Major Shareholder (the ‘Duodi Relationship Agreement’). 
In addition, on 10 March 2015 the Company and David Hamid, 
the former Chairman, entered into a relationship agreement 
in recognition of the historic connection between David Hamid 
and the Major Shareholder (the ‘Hamid Relationship Agreement’, 
and together with the Duodi Relationship Agreement, the 
‘Relationship Agreements’).
The Duodi Relationship Agreement will remain in place until 
the Duodi Associates (as defined in the Duodi Relationship 
Agreement), together with any person(s) with whom they are 
acting in concert, cease individually or in aggregate to hold a 
direct or indirect interest in 10 per cent or more of the ordinary 
shares. The Hamid Relationship Agreement will remain in place 
until David Hamid, together with any person(s) with whom he 
is acting in concert, ceases individually or in aggregate to be 
a Controlling Shareholder(s) (as defined by the Listing Rules) 
in the Company. In addition, both Relationship Agreements will 
terminate upon the Company ceasing to maintain a listing on 
the premium segment of the Official List.
The Company has, during the period under review, complied 
with the independence provisions included in the Relationship 
Agreements and, so far as the Company is aware, the Major 
Shareholder, Baker Partners LP and David Hamid (and each 
of their respective associates) have complied with the 
independence provisions included in the Duodi Relationship 
Agreement and the Hamid Relationship Agreement, 
respectively, during the period under review.

GAME Digital plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Appointment of Non-Executive Director and observer 
by the major shareholder
Under the Duodi Relationship Agreement, for so long as the 
Major Shareholder and its associates, together with any person 
with whom they are acting in concert, hold in aggregate, either 
directly or indirectly, an interest in 10 per cent or more in the 
aggregate voting rights in the Company, the Major Shareholder 
will be entitled to nominate one person to be a Non-Executive 
Director on the Board and one observer. The appointed observer 
is entitled to receive notice of Board meetings, including all Board 
papers, and to attend and speak at Board meetings, but is not 
entitled to vote.
Board responsibilities and procedures
The Board is responsible for overseeing the Group, and is 
therefore ultimately responsible for the success and performance 
of the business. The Board’s responsibilities, as set out in its 
schedule of matters reserved for the Board, include:
 — developing and approving business strategy and policies
 — approving the annual operating plan, the Annual Report and 
financial statements, and major acquisitions and disposals
 — consideration of funding and capital structure
 — ensuring high standards of corporate governance
 — assessing systems of internal control including risk 
management
 — approving Board and Board committee composition 
and changes to executive and senior management.
The types of decisions deferred to management revolve around 
the day-to-day running of the business, execution of strategy 
and approved capital expenditure projects with the financial 
delegated authorities in place as a control mechanism.
Board committees
There are three main committees of the Board: an Audit and 
Risk Committee, a Nomination Committee and a Remuneration 
Committee. A Share Plans Committee also exists, with a 
specific remit to administer the Company’s share plans. The 
Company also established a Disclosure Committee during the 
year with its main focus on the control and management of 
inside information within the Company. Each committee has 
formally delegated duties and responsibilities set out in its 
written terms of reference. If the need should arise, the Board 
may establish additional committees to consider specific issues 
as appropriate.
In line with each of the committees’ terms of reference, only 
members of the relevant committee have the right to attend 
and vote at its meetings. Committee meetings are also attended 
by the Company Secretary, who acts as the secretary to each 
of the committees. When appropriate, non-committee members 
on the Board including the Executive Directors can be invited to 
attend all or part of any committee meeting.
The matters reserved for the Board and the terms of reference 
of each of the main Board committees are available on the 
Company’s corporate website at www.gamedigitalplc.com/
investor-relations/corporate-governance.
Details of the committees and their activities during the year are 
set out in the separate committee reports on pages 78 to 103, 
which are incorporated into the Corporate Governance 
Statement by reference.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT
CONTINUED The Board’s activities and priorities in 2016/17
The Board aims to ensure its agenda programme covers strategic, operational, business, financial, HR and Corporate Governance 
items at the appropriate time at Board meetings. Set out below is a summary of activities under each of these four areas, covered 
during the course of the 2016/17 annual Board cycle.
Health and Safety Committee
The Board is committed to providing a safe working 
environment for all employees, contractors and partners 
across the Group. The Chief Executive receives and reviews 
a health and safety report on a monthly basis and where health 
and safety matters need to be brought to the Board’s attention, 
these are included as part of the Chief Executive’s monthly 
report. The Board also receives a more structured in-depth 
health and safety report and presentation bi-annually. The 
management of health and safety is supported by a committee 
in the UK which is attended by the CEO and CFO, although 
this is not a formally adopted sub-committee of the Board. 
This committee meets quarterly to ensure that health and safety 
is managed effectively and proactively. Duties of the health and 
safety committee include reviewing the health and safety policy; 
compliance with applicable health and safety directives and 
legislation; monitoring health and safety statistics, including 
incident rates and near misses and health and safety audit 
findings. In Spain, health and safety is managed through 
existing reporting lines that feed up through the Chief Executive 
Officer to the Board; this is seen as more appropriate for the 
size of the Company.

The Board intends to meet approximately 10 times a year and may meet at other times as required or otherwise at the request 
of one or more of the Directors. During the year the Board met on 11 occasions. Where urgent decisions are required on matters 
specifically reserved for the Board between meetings, there is a process in place to facilitate discussion and decision-making. 
The Directors regularly communicate and exchange information irrespective of the timing of meetings.
Confirmation of the number of meetings of the Board and the attendance by the Directors for the financial year is set out in the

3.  Franck Tuil resigned from the Board with effect from 13 October 2016.
4.  David Hamid resigned from the Board with effect from 18 January 2017. Development and advice
The Directors of all Group companies, as well as the Board, 
also have access to the advice and services of the Company 
Secretary. Independent external legal and professional advice 
can also be taken when it is necessary to do so. Furthermore, 
each committee of the Board has access to sufficient and 
tailored resources to carry out its duties. A personalised 
induction and subsequent training is provided to new members 
of the Board and its committees.
External directorships
With reference to the external commitments of the Chairman, 
these are set out in his Biography on page 70. The Board is 
comfortable with the level of external directorships of its 
independent Non-Executive Directors on the basis that it sees 
the Company benefiting from their current appointments due 
to the additional experience and expertise which they can bring 
to the Board. None of the Executive Directors holds external 
directorships which the Board considers to be of significance; 
Mark Gifford is a Non-Executive Director of a private investment 
fund for which he receives a fee of £7,500 p.a. and Martyn Gibbs is 
a Director of one dormant company for which he receives no fee.
Effectiveness
Board evaluation
The Board conducted an internal review at the end of the year 
to evaluate the effectiveness of the Board and its committees. 
A questionnaire-based approach was adopted which was 
facilitated by PwC LLP with input from the Company Secretary 
and the Chairman to ensure the questions were appropriately 
tailored to the Group. Board members were invited to respond 
via an external portal, to preserve confidentiality and anonymity. 
The Chairman reviewed the collated responses before 
presenting to the Board in full for discussion. 
The Board concluded that in the majority of areas it operated 
effectively, with succession planning remaining an area for 
improvement. The Board agreed that good progress in the 
development of the Board’s approach to risk management 
continued to be made. It is envisaged that another internal 
review be conducted during the forthcoming year in line with 
the Code requirements for smaller listed companies.
Meetings between the Chairman and the independent 
Non-Executive Directors in the absence of the Executive 
Directors were held twice during the year. The independent 
Non-Executive Directors in the absence of the Chairman met 
together to appraise his performance at the end of the year.

GAME Digital plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Summary of key activities during the year
In 2016/17 the principal activities focused on by the 
Committee were:
 — review of the UK senior management team structure
 — induction of the new Chief Operating Officer
 — succession planning for the role of Chairman of the Board
 — reviewing the role of Senior Independent Director
 — annual review of Board size, structure and composition 
including time commitment
 — the review and recommendation for new Chairs of the 
Audit and Risk Committee, Remuneration Committee 
and Nomination Committee.
Committee members
Caspar Woolley and Lesley Watkins, both independent 
Non-Executive Directors, are members of the Committee. 
Following the resignation of David Hamid as Chairman of the 
Committee, I was appointed as Chairman of the Committee 
during the year. In addition, Caspar Woolley was also 
appointed as a member of the Committee during the year. 
Full career profiles of the Board and Committee members 
can be found under Board of Directors on pages 70 to 71. 
The Board is satisfied that the collective skills and experience 
of the Committee continues to provide sufficient expertise to 
meet the needs of the role the Committee plays.
Responsibilities
The key responsibilities of the Committee are set out in the 
Committee’s written terms of reference. These can be found 
under the Corporate Governance section of the corporate 
website, www.gamedigitalplc.com/investor-relations/
corporate-governance/committees, and include:
 — making recommendations to the Board in respect of 
appointments to the Board and to the committees of the 
Board
 — keeping the structure, size and composition of the Board 
under regular review
 — making recommendations to the Board with regard 
to any changes necessary.
Work of the Committee
The Committee convened three times during the year. 
Attendance at the meetings is set out on page 76. The CEO, 
CFO where appropriate, and the Chief People Officer have 
also attended at the invitation of the Committee. The 
Company Secretary acts as secretary to the Committee.
Succession planning
Throughout the year succession planning, not only for a 
new Chairman but also for the Committee Chairs and senior 
management positions, was the principal focus of the Nomination 
Committee’s three formal meetings. The review of the senior 
management structure and recent appointment of a Chief 
Marketing Officer for the UK has helped the business in better 
focusing the strengths of its operational leadership team. 
Chairman succession
The Company announced on 9 September 2016 that, having 
served as Non-Executive Chairman of the Company since 2014, 
David Hamid would step down from the Board with effect from 
the AGM in January 2017. The process to find his successor 
was led by the Committee with the support of the Company 
Secretary. To assist the process a detailed specification for 
the role of the Chairman was prepared, taking into account the 
knowledge, experience, skills and time commitment required 
for the role. A series of frequent informal exchanges between 
Committee members and other Board Directors took place and 
those independent Non-Executive Directors who did not have an 
interest in the position of Chairman of the Board canvassed and 
fed back opinions and recommendations. 
As the then Senior Independent Director, I was identified as the 
most appropriate candidate taking all things into consideration, 
including time commitments. It was acknowledged that I had 
the requisite skills and knowledge of our evolving business and 
would satisfy the interests of stakeholders, including the major 
shareholders, and the management team. The decision not to 
engage the services of external recruitment consultants was 
made recognising both my suitability for the role and the 
business need to continue to deliver the current plans and 
strategy at optimum pace, given the innovation and change 
happening within the Group’s markets. It was considered that 
the business had recently gone through a period of significant 
change, entering into new business activities of strategic 
importance alongside its core activities. With an agreed 
strategic path in place the decision was taken that an externally 
recruited Chairman of the Board would take time to settle in 
and get to know the business at a time when it was imperative 
that the business move forward at pace. The Board agreed that 
an internal candidate would not face the further challenge of 
settling into the business. The Board concluded that I was a 
compelling candidate for the role and best placed to fulfil it, 
leading to the decision to not explore external candidates and as 
Non-Executive Director of GAME since 2014, I formally assumed 
the role of Chairman of the Board following the conclusion of 
the Company’s AGM on 18 January 2017.
Review of Senior Independent Director role
Clause A.4.1 of the UK Corporate Governance Code states that 
the Board should appoint one of the Non-Executive Directors to 
the role of Senior Independent Director. Since the appointment 
of myself as Chairman of the Board in January 2017 the role of 
Senior Independent Director has been vacant. The Board, on 
recommendation from the Committee, made the decision not 
to recruit a new Senior Independent Director immediately so that 
the requirements of the role could be assessed. The Committee 
also concluded that the duties of the Senior Independent 
79
GAME Digital plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Overview Strategic report Governance Results Shareholder information Director would be fulfilled by the two current independent 
Non-Executive Directors. The Committee has kept the role of 
Senior Independent Director under constant review but as at the 
date of this report no formal appointment for the role has been 
made. The current independent Non-Executive Directors will 
continue to fulfil the duties of the Senior Independent Director, 
as required by the UK Corporate Governance Code, until such 
a time as the decision is taken to formally appoint a new Senior 
Independent Director.
Effectiveness
During the year, the Committee also carried out its on-going 
corporate governance review in regard to the size, structure 
and composition of the Board and was satisfied that it remained 
appropriate. Following the announcement on 9 September 2016 
that I would succeed David Hamid as Chairman of the Board, 
the Committee met to re-evaluate the size and shape of the 
Board and Board committee composition. The Committee 
recommended to the Board that the Chairs of the Audit and 
Risk Committee and the Remuneration Committee be appointed 
from the existing independent Non-Executive Directors and it 
was agreed on appointment I would assume the role of Chairman 
of the Nomination Committee with the shape of the Board and 
its committees to be kept under review. The Committee 
recognises that the balance of the future independence of the 
Board should be considered in conjunction with ensuring that 
the Board maintains requisite skills to support the future 
activities of the business.
The current required time commitment for the role of Chairman 
and for the Non-Executive Directors was considered; the 
Committee has concluded that these Directors have sufficient 
available time. The Committee is satisfied that all the 
independent Non-Executive Directors continue to fulfil the 
criteria of independence and are able to commit the required 
time for the proper performance of their duties. Furthermore, 
following this formal performance evaluation, the Executive 
Directors and Non-Executive Directors are deemed to continue 
to be effective and demonstrate commitment to their roles and 
should be put forward for re-appointment at the AGM, with the 
exception of Caspar Woolley who notified the Board of his 
intention to step down at the conclusion of the AGM following 
the completion of his three-year term.
The Committee did retain the services of Korn Ferry to assist 
in identifying potential candidates for senior management roles 
considered by the Committee for recommendation to the Board. 
Korn Ferry were also appointed as the Company’s remuneration 
advisors during the year and appropriate arrangements have 
been put place to ensure there is no conflict of interest.
The individual training and development needs of all Directors 
are also considered as part of the annual Board evaluation 
process. On-going training and development for the Directors 
includes attendance at formal conferences and internal events 
as well as briefings from external advisors. The Company 
Secretary provides a list of relevant external seminars at the 
start of each financial year which Non-Executive Directors can 
attend as part of their continuous professional development.
Boardroom diversity
The Board recognises the importance of ensuring that there 
is diversity of perspective, background and approach in its 
management team and on its Board as it is in the interests 
of the Company and its shareholders to build a stable, cohesive 
and representative Board. The Committee considers carefully 
in relation to all appointments to the Board, whether for 
Non-Executive or Executive positions, the benefits of greater 
diversity, including gender, whilst also ensuring that it fulfils 
its obligations to shareholders to recruit the best person to 
the role, on merit. Korn Ferry, the executive search firm used 
by the business, are a signatory to the Voluntary Code of Conduct 
for Executive Search Firms. The Committee ensures that the 
specification for any new Director role is equally suited to both 
female and male applicants.
Diversity is monitored across the Group, including gender and 
age, which are analysed on a Group-wide scale and presented 
within the Operating Responsibly section of the Strategic report 
on page 45. Individual appointments within the Group and to the 
Board are based on individual merit and skill. Whilst the Group 
appreciates and believes in the benefits of diversity, appointments 
are not prescriptive to gender, or any other criteria which do not 
relate directly to the ability to perform the role. 
Taking account of appointments considered by the Nomination 
Committee and within the control of the Board, the female 
percentage ratio of the Board is 20 per cent, with one 
independent Non-Executive Director being female.
 
The future work of the Committee
I anticipate that the future work of the Committee will be 
to keep the size and shape of the Board under review, giving 
consideration to whether the recruitment of an additional 
Non-Executive Director is appropriate and the formal 
appointment of a Senior Independent Director. Such a review 
will look at maintaining an appropriate balance of skills and 
experience on the Board having regard to the needs of the 
business. In addition, it is likely that the Committee will 
continue with its work on succession planning for both 
senior management and executive roles.

Accountability
Board remit, governance and internal controls 
The Board remains ultimately accountable for matters that 
are clearly defined and are contained in its ‘Matters Reserved 
for the Board’. The Board as a whole will discuss, challenge 
and give approval on the financial statements. 
The Board also retains its responsibility to approve the annual 
budget. Monitoring of the annual budget, following approval, 
is carried out through regular updates circulated as part of the 
Chief Financial Officer’s report to the Board. In addition, the 
Board will review all significant capital expenditure requests 
individually, after a general approval for the capital expenditure 
budget has been granted. Measures such as these maintain 
adequate levels of control and scrutiny over the budget and 
capital expenditure at Board level. In relation to the Board’s 
responsibility to approve the financial statements, the Board 
sets out its Directors’ Responsibility Statement on page 109.
The Board recognises that its committees are only empowered 
to make recommendations to the Board for their approval, 
unless a specific authorisation to approve certain matters is 
granted. To facilitate information flows, a verbal update is given 
by the Chairman of the relevant committee in the subsequent 
Board meeting following a committee meeting.
Assessment of risk management and internal control
The Board is responsible for the Company’s overall approach 
to risk management and for identifying and managing the 
Group’s principal risks. The principal risks are set out in the 
Risk Management section on page 41. The risk management 
framework and processes are set out below and have been in 
place throughout the year. This framework ensures that risk 
management is embedded in the day-to-day operations of the 
business, integrated with strategic planning and execution and 
provides effective oversight for the Audit and Risk Committee

Assessing our principal risks and risk appetite
A review of the principal risks and mitigating actions takes 
place on a quarterly basis with a more robust assessment in 
the second half of the year. A top-down and bottom-up approach 
has been used to deliver a robust assessment of the Company’s 
principal risks as follows: 
 — in determining the risk profile for the Group, the Board 
members have assessed the gross and net risk for the 
existing principal risks and have considered whether there 
are any new or emerging risks
 — divisional risk workshops, attended by the relevant 
leadership team and facilitated by the Head of Internal Audit, 
were undertaken in the second half of the year. The outputs 
were collated in a risk register and the most significant risks 
plotted on a heat map for presentation to the Audit and 
Risk Committee
 — a consolidated Group risk register was created allowing 
similar risks to be grouped into themes. Board members 
then had the opportunity to discuss and agree any potential 
changes to the Group’s risk profile or to its risk appetite
 — work is on-going to ensure the Board’s risk appetite is 
cascaded through the organisation and reflected in business 
policies to guide appropriate management decision-making.
Details of the internal controls of the Company and the manner 
in which the Board and its committees assess the effectiveness 
of internal controls during the year are set out as part of the 
Audit and Risk Committee Report on pages 83 to 89. This 
includes activities undertaken by the Board with the support 
of the Audit and Risk Committee and a description of the main 
features of its internal control and risk management 
arrangements in relation to the financial reporting process.
These reviews have led the Board to conclude that the systems 
of internal control and risk management are effective and have 
complied with the requirements of the Code during the year. 
The Board considers there to have been no significant control 
failings during the year, however, management did identify 
control weaknesses that resulted in the restatement of items 
which had occurred in prior reporting periods. These are 
discussed further in the paragraphs below. In assessing the 
effectiveness of the Company’s risk management and internal 
control systems, the Board has considered whether the events 
leading up to the June trading update constituted a significant 
control failure and have concluded that they did not. The Board 
determined that external factors beyond its reasonable control 
in the broader UK gaming market, in particular a lack of 
Nintendo Switch stock, led to a decline in trading performance. 
There has been continued focus on strengthening business 
processes and financial controls during the year to support 
the accuracy and reliability of financial reporting. Control 
weaknesses impacting prior reporting periods were identified 
by management during the year as part of this detailed review 
of processes, controls and reconciliations in the UK business. 
Further investigation highlighted that control weaknesses had 
led to accounting errors, which due to their materiality, require 
restatement of the results for the 53 week period ended 30 July 
2016 as well as the consolidated statement of financial position 
as at 30 July 2016 and at 25 July 2015. 
These adjustments relate to the correction of accruals for stock 
received but not invoiced (a £3.2 million difference) and provision 
for margin adjustments in relation to the sale of pre-owned 
goods (a £1.6 million difference). In addition, an exceptional 
item of £1.4m was recorded in the statement of comprehensive 
income in the period ended 30 July 2016 for gift card expiries 
relating to prior periods and other similar items. This was 
recorded in the 2016 financial statements as an exceptional item 
as it was not considered a material prior period error requiring 
restatement at the time. However, together with the amounts 
identified in 2017, this £1.4 million has been reflected in the 
years to which it relates being the period ended 25 July 2015 
and earlier financial periods.
The Going Concern Statement together with the Viability 
Statement is set out in the Strategic report on page 63 and 
by reference is incorporated as part of the Corporate 
Governance Statement. AUDIT AND RISK COMMITTEE REPORT
I am pleased to present the report of the Audit and 
Risk Committee (the ‘Committee’) in respect of the year 
2016/17. This is my first report as Chair of the Audit & 
Risk Committee, following John Jackson’s appointment 
as Chairman of the Board in January 2017.
During the year the Committee has continued to focus 
significant time and attention on the Group’s systems 
of internal control and risk management, the integrity 
of financial reporting and the effectiveness of both the 
external and internal auditors. In this report, I set out 
the key activities initiated by the Committee to ensure 
we continue to comply with related parts of the Code.

relevant activities and recommendations of the Committee.
I met with the external auditor separately during the year. I also 
meet alone on a quarterly basis with the Head of Internal Audit.
AUDIT AND RISK COMMITTEE REPORT

GAME Digital plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Evaluation of the Committee
The Committee self-assessed its performance in August 2017, 
taking into account its collective skills and experience, the 
activities it has engaged in during the year and the effectiveness 
of its actions in improving the Group’s system of risk 
management and internal control. This assessment has been 
submitted to the Board and the Board has concluded that the 
Committee has operated effectively.
In 2017/18, the Committee will remain focused on the areas 
of activity outlined above with particular focus on maintaining 
sufficient oversight of key areas of risk and, in particular, 
the effectiveness of the controls and mitigation plans in place 
monitoring and anticipating changes in the Group’s risk profile 
as the business model evolves.
External Audit
Appointment, terms and remuneration for audit and 
audit‑related services
In the Annual Report 2015/16, the Committee announced 
it had initiated a competitive tendering process for the Group’s 
statutory audit. In August 2016, the Committee invited four 
firms, including the Group’s incumbent statutory auditor, 
Deloitte LLP, to compete for the provision of external audit 
services. Following the initial round of presentations to 
management, John Jackson as Chairman of the Board and 
me as Chair of the Committee, two of the firms met with all 
Committee members. Subsequently, the Committee made the 
recommendation to the Board that BDO LLP, led by the firm’s 
partner, Anna Draper, should be appointed as the Group’s 
statutory auditor. The Committee considered BDO LLP to offer 
the most competitively priced, professional service and to 
provide the most straightforward transition from Deloitte LLP, 
having acted as statutory auditor for companies within The Game 
Group plc until their administration in 2012. The Committee’s 
recommendation to the Board was considered free from 
influence by a third party and no contractual term of the kind 
mentioned in Article 16(6) of Regulation (EU) No 537/2014 of 
16 April 2014 has been imposed on the Company. 
The Committee has reviewed the external audit plan, terms 
of engagement and scope of work and approved the audit fee. 
The fee for 2016/17 is estimated at £388,000, which includes 
£8,500 in respect of turnover rent certificates, £25,000 in 
respect of the fee for the interim review and £39,500 in respect 
of the statutory audit of Game Stores Iberia SLU (and £65,000 
of additional work in connection with prior year items). The 
Committee was satisfied that the fee was appropriate to ensure 
an effective and high quality audit. See note 7 to the Consolidated 
Financial Statements, Auditor Remuneration.
Non‑ audit services and independence
The Committee is mindful of the need to preserve auditor 
objectivity and independence. Its express approval is needed 
in all circumstances before the external auditor provides 
non-audit services. The exception to this is where the 
Committee has pre-approved certain immaterial services, 
as was the case in 2016/17 with BDO LLP’s work in respect 
of the turnover rent certificates.
In the period prior to appointment as Group auditors, BDO Spain 
provided tax services to Game Stores Iberia SLU. This service 
ceased from 31 January 2017 which was as soon as practicable 
following appointment as Group auditors. In addition, BDO Spain 
provided some clerical resource to Game Stores Iberia SLU to 
write up various procedures. This project completed before 
the year end.
Assessing the effectiveness of the external audit process
A review of the effectiveness of the external auditor and audit 
process has been undertaken with input from the Committee 
members, CFO, UK and Spanish finance teams and internal audit.
The Committee has adopted a formal assessment framework 
which covers a number of key areas, including:
 — the auditor’s independence and objectivity
 — the auditor’s knowledge and skills, particularly in relation to 
the industry and the environment in which the Group operates
 — the quality of the assessment of audit risk and how this has 
been addressed
 — the quality of the audit planning, execution and reporting 
to management
 — the role of management in facilitating an effective audit
 — the quality of professional judgement, advice and insight 
 — the quality, sufficiency and timeliness of communication 
between the auditor and the Company
 — the quality of the formal audit report to the shareholders.

GAME Digital plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Overview Strategic report Governance Results Shareholder information The assessment is an on-going review that takes place towards 
the end of the audit process and is undertaken annually using a 
tailored questionnaire and is initially completed by individuals in 
private rather than by the Committee as a group. The responses 
are collated by the Company Secretary and presented back to 
the Committee at its next meeting. Any differences of opinion 
are highlighted and discussed and consensus is then reached 
on the Committee’s overall assessment. The Committee 
deemed the performance of the external auditor to have been 
effective and was satisfied with the quality of work produced.
Internal Audit
Internal Audit attended all Committee meetings during the 
year and also met separately with me, in my role as the Audit 
and Risk Committee Chair prior to each Committee meeting.
The Committee has reviewed and approved the internal 
audit charter and risk-based internal audit plan, and received 
quarterly updates outlining: the internal audit activity, 
engagement results and the status of, and time to close, 
management actions, to help it form a view on internal 
audit effectiveness.
The Committee satisfied itself as a result of the activities 
outlined above that the quality, resources, experience and 
expertise of the internal audit function are appropriate for 
the Company.
Financial reporting and significant financial judgements 
The Committee reviews the accounting policies of the Group, 
focusing particular attention on those which are more complex 
in nature or require significant judgement. To inform the 
Committee’s assessment of the appropriateness of such 
policies and judgements, management prepares accounting 
papers outlining the basis of the calculations and any associated 
estimates. In addition, the Committee receives detailed reports 
from the external auditor setting out their approach in gaining 
assurance over the key judgements and calculations.
The table below sets out the significant financial reporting 
issues that the Committee has devoted most time to during the 
year and which could give rise to material misstatement of the 
Group’s financial statements. The associated accounting policies 
are set out on pages 122 to 127 and references are included in 
the table below to the relevant note to the financial statements.

AUDIT AND RISK COMMITTEE REPORT
CONTINUED Activities of the Audit and Risk Committee during the year
Prior period error
 
(see ‘Prior period restatements’ 
under the ‘Accounting Policies 
of the Group’, page 127).
During the year management identified material differences in two balance sheet accounts as part of a detailed 
review of processes, controls and reconciliations in the UK retail business. Further investigation highlighted that 
the differences related to previous years and due to the materiality of the amounts, a prior period error has been 
recorded in the financial statements.
In addition, an exceptional item of £1.4 million was recorded in the statement of comprehensive income in 
the period ended 30 July 2016 for gift card expiries relating to prior periods and other similar prior year items. 
This was not considered to be a material prior period error requiring restatement at the time; however, together 
with the amounts identified in the current financial year, this £1.4 million has been reflected in the years to which 
it relates being the period ended 25 July 2015 and earlier financial periods.
In gaining assurance over the quantum of the errors and the financial years to which these relate the Committee has:
 — discussed with management and the auditors the analysis prepared and the reconciliations performed 
so as to determine the value of the errors and the correct allocations to financial years.
The Committee is satisfied that the correct accounting treatment has been applied and the appropriate 
restatements and disclosures have been set out in the financial statements, including the following items:
 — the recording of £1.6 million of a prior period error to revenue in the previous period
 — the recording of £3.2 million of a prior period error to opening reserves for amounts that relate to the period 
ended 25 July 2015 and earlier years
 — the reconciliations of the affected balance sheet accounts have been properly performed and reviewed
 — processes and controls have been improved to prevent the reoccurrence of these errors.
Assessing whether 
contractual performance 
conditions of supplier 
funding agreements 
(including marketing income 
and rebate discounts) have 
been met and discounts or 
income recognised 
appropriately
 
(see ‘Supplier Funding’ under 
the ‘Accounting Policies of the 
Group’, page 127).
The Group receives supplier funding in the form of sale-out agreements (supplier supported promotional 
discounts), volume rebates, promotional funding and marketing income. In light of developing accounting practice 
and other recent guidance and interpretations, the Committee has reviewed with management the recognition and 
accounting treatment of supplier funding, and in particular marketing income.
 — management prepared an analysis of marketing income received in the UK and Spanish retail businesses in the 
current year and previous year.
 — two principal forms of marketing income are received by the Group: income received from suppliers where there 
are identifiable and directly attributable costs that have been incurred and income received relating to general 
promotional funding with no directly attributable costs.
The Committee is satisfied that the correct accounting treatment has been applied in terms of:
 — ensuring performance criteria have been met before supplier funding is recognised in the statement of 
comprehensive income
 — the classification of marketing income and promotional support in the statement of comprehensive income 
between amounts recognised as a deduction to cost of sales and amounts recognised within other operating 
expenses and the restatement of the prior year statement of comprehensive income as set out in note 1.
The Committee has reviewed and discussed reports from management outlining the Group’s approach and is 
satisfied that income is accurately reported and presented in the financial statements.
The carrying value of 
inventories
 
(see ‘Inventories’ under the 
‘Accounting Policies of the Group’, 
page 126 and note 17 to the 
financial statements).
Significant judgement is required in determining the net realisable value of inventory, particularly in relation 
to estimating stock losses and future sales value.
 — the Committee has reviewed the accounting policy, inventory balance, associated provisions and disclosures.
 — in assessing the appropriateness of the net realisable value and slow-moving stock provisions, the Committee 
discussed and challenged management on the assumptions made regarding sales and, where relevant, supplier 
returns and contributions.
 — the Committee has reviewed the findings and assessment of the external auditor and monitored management’s 
responsiveness to their recommendations.
Overall, the Committee is satisfied with accuracy of the inventory balance.

GAME Digital plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Overview Strategic report Governance Results Shareholder information The carrying value of 
accruals for gift cards and 
loyalty schemes 
 
(see ‘Gift cards and vouchers’ 
and ‘Loyalty schemes’ under the 
‘Accounting Policies of the Group’, 
page 123 and note 22 to the 
financial statements).
Gift cards 
The Group recognises revenue from gift cards upon the redemption of the gift card. Monies received represent 
deferred revenue prior to redemption and are disclosed within accruals. 
 — During the year management have undertaken a project to age each gift card balance as the third-party gift card 
provider are unable to provide this level of detail. This review has also given a greater understanding of customer 
behaviour in relation to top ups, redemptions and expired balances.
 — The expiry rate has been amended to reflect the historical redemption and expiry rates of aged balances and this 
change in accounting estimate resulted in the recognition of an additional £0.4 million of income in the statement 
of comprehensive income compared to the previous expiry rate methodology.
The Committee is satisfied that the correct accounting treatment has been applied in terms of:
 — The calculation of the revised redemption and expiry rates of gift cards and the income recognised in the 
statement of comprehensive income
 — the calculation of the current year accounting estimate of the gift card accrual, net of expected expiries, 
representing the closing balance in the statement of financial position
 — the restatement of prior year expiries previously included in exceptional items in the year ended 30 July 2016 
is appropriately recorded.
Loyalty schemes 
The Group operates loyalty schemes where the deferred revenue recognised is adjusted for the value of points 
expected to expire, based on historical redemption and expiry rates.
 — In the previous financial year in May 2016, the UK retail business reduced the validity period of loyalty scheme 
points, where rewards expire after 12 months of inactivity on customer accounts; previously 18 months of 
inactivity. This change to the loyalty scheme had the effect of increasing the expiry rate and resulting income 
recognition to the statement of comprehensive income.
 — A review was performed in the current year to assess the impact of the higher expiry rates since the validity 
period of points was changed. This resulted in a reduction to the cost of points awarded in the current year 
(based on a higher estimated expiry rate) that are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income. The 
change has also resulted in higher expiries of points awarded in the previous financial period and the value of 
prior year points recognised in the statement of comprehensive income when compared to the provision for 
expiries made at 30 July 2016. The additional income recognised in relation to points awarded in the prior year 
and incremental to the original accounting estimate of expected expiries made at 30 July 2016 was £1.0 million.
The Committee is satisfied that the correct accounting treatment has been applied in terms of:
 — the calculation of the revised redemption and expiry rates of loyalty points and the associated net cost of awards 
made in the current year
 — the calculation of the current year accounting estimate of the cost of the outstanding loyalty points, 
net of expected expiries, representing the closing balance in the statement of financial position.
Assessing the goodwill 
impairment review for 
Multiplay and other 
non-current assets within 
the Group
 
(see ‘Impairment of goodwill’ 
under the ‘Accounting Policies of 
the Group’, page 125 and note 15 
to the financial statements).
Impairment reviews 
Multiplay (UK) Limited continues to develop and grow its core events and digital activities. In scaling its operations 
to deliver further growth, the business has underperformed against initial plans and budgets. However, based on 
the three-year plan and other strategic initiatives planned, management has determined that no adjustments for 
impairment are required.
To gain comfort over the carrying value of Multiplay, the Committee has:
 — analysed the three-year plan, cash flows, discount and growth rate assumptions incorporated in the annual 
impairment review
 — reviewed strategic plans for the business
 — discussed the impairment review with management and the external auditor and is satisfied that the value-in-use 
and valuation of the Company exceeds Multiplay’s carrying value and that no impairment is required.
Going concern and long-term 
viability assessment
In light of the rapidly changing and cyclical nature of the video games industry (linked to major new console 
launches and significant new game releases), combined with the Group’s evolving strategy and business model, 
the Committee has devoted significant time towards year-end assessment of the short- and medium- to 
longer-term viability of the Group. For further details of the Committee’s activities here, please see the Internal 
control and risk management section, under Risk assessment within this report.

AUDIT AND RISK COMMITTEE REPORT
CONTINUED Internal control and risk management
Overview
The Board retains ultimate responsibility for the Company’s 
system of risk management and internal control and for the 
on-going monitoring of its effectiveness. The system, which has 
been in place and subject to on-going improvement throughout 
the year, is outlined below. It is designed to manage rather than 
eliminate threats to the achievement of business objectives. 
In this section I share with you some of the key improvements 
we have made.

continues to receive reports from management to monitor 
the performance of the business and progress with 
strategic priorities.
Risk assessment
The Committee, supported by the Head of Internal Audit, 
has continued to make progress during the year in assisting 
the Board in improving risk management. Key activities 
undertaken were as follows:
 — the roll-out of a risk management e-learning module for the 
UK business
 — the further enhancement of Board level risk updates 
 — divisional risk workshops, facilitated by the Head of Internal 
Audit in the second half of the year, the results of which were 
communicated to and reviewed by the Committee and Board 
 — a robust assessment by the Board of the Company’s principal 
risks as set out in the Accountability section of the Corporate 
Governance Statement on page 81 which took into account 
those significant risks raised by the divisional leadership teams
 — a review of the risk appetite statements for each of the 
principal risks
 — an assessment of the Company’s medium- to longer-term 
viability and completion of the Viability Statement, which can 
be found on page 63 in the Strategic report
 — an annual assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s 
risk management and internal control systems, which can be 
found in the Corporate Governance Statement on page 81.
Control activities
 — There are a number of committees and senior management 
meetings that take place either on a regular basis or 
periodically, to monitor business performance, oversee 
projects, monitor compliance or agree strategic plans and 
monitor effective execution.
 — There has been continued focus on strengthening controls 
during the year to support the accuracy and reliability of 
financial reporting including under the leadership of a new 
Finance Director – UK Operations and Controls. There 
continue to be clear lines of delegated authority, a three-year 
planning cycle, annual budget with quarterly review and 
half-yearly reforecast, monthly management accounts and 
weekly 13-week rolling cash flow forecasts.
 — Individual teams and functions have responsibility for 
implementing and monitoring a number of other operational 
and compliance controls such as loss prevention and health 
and safety.
 — The in-house internal audit function continues to support the 
Committee in assessing the effectiveness of internal controls 
and risk management. See the Internal Audit section of this 
report for more details.
 — A confidential reporting policy and process was updated 
during the year and the Company introduced an independent 
confidential reporting hotline. No material control failures or 
serious instances of fraud or wrong-doing have been reported.
Information and communication
The Board and Committee receive reports and updates from 
senior management and the internal and external auditors 
periodically and on request to help it monitor the risk 
management and internal control system. These are detailed 
in the Work of the Committee section within this report.

Overview Strategic report Governance Results Shareholder information DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present the report 
of the Remuneration Committee (the ‘Committee’).
2016/17 has been a challenging year for the business. 
This is reflected in remuneration outcomes for the year. 
There have been no annual bonus payments to the 
Executive Directors, and Performance Share Plan (‘PSP’) 
awards granted in 2014 have lapsed. Nevertheless, the 
Committee retains confidence in the ability of the 
management team to address the challenges facing the 
Group and take forward its key growth initiatives and our 
remuneration policy has been developed to help drive 
performance at this critical time for the business.

Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Annual Statement
Directors’ Remuneration Policy
The current remuneration policy was approved by shareholders 
at the AGM in January 2015 and the three-year policy period will 
shortly come to an end. Accordingly, during the year the 
Committee consulted with major shareholders on the terms 
of a revised policy to be presented for shareholder approval 
at the AGM in January 2018. 
Despite the present challenges faced by the Company, the 
Committee has determined that the current remuneration 
policy remains broadly fit for purpose and as a result is 
proposing no major changes. There are no increases to 
Directors’ pay under the new policy. We have, however, taken 
the opportunity to review the policy to ensure that it continues 
to support the Group’s strategic and business objectives, 
and have made some minor amendments.
 — We have introduced additional flexibility to allow the 
Committee to operate a wider range of performance 
conditions for the annual bonus scheme and PSP. The 
current policy limits the Committee to using only financial 
measures for the scheme; under the new policy, the 
Committee will also be able to use non-financial metrics. 
The majority of the bonus will remain subject to financial 
performance conditions.
 — We have also added flexibility in the performance conditions 
which can be used for awards under the PSP. Under the 
current policy, awards can only be granted with earnings 
per share (‘EPS’) and total shareholder return (‘TSR’) targets. 
The new policy gives the Committee greater freedom to 
determine the appropriate performance metrics to apply 
to each year’s grant.
 — The share ownership guidelines for the Executive Directors 
has increased from 100% of salary to 200% for the CEO and 
150% for the CFO.
Rationale for the changes
The Committee is keen to ensure that it has sufficient flexibility 
under the remuneration policy to set performance targets 
which will motivate the management team to drive the 
performance of the business and restore shareholder value. 
While the Committee has no intention of reducing the clear 
focus on the achievement of challenging financial targets, some 
greater flexibility would be helpful to incentivise performance 
against key strategic objectives that relate to the changing 
nature of the business.
The Committee also recognises the importance of fully 
aligning the interests of the Executive Directors with those 
of shareholders, and hence has increased the share ownership 
guidelines as set out above. The revised guidelines are 
considered appropriate for a company of GAME’s size.
The full remuneration policy, which is subject to a shareholder 
vote at the AGM, is set out on the following pages.
Application of the remuneration policy for 2017/18
As mentioned there will be no change to base salary, benefits 
or pension.
Annual bonus
Recognising the priority on improving profitability and 
maintaining cash flow, the performance metrics for the 2017/18 
bonus scheme will be EBITDA (75% weighting) and cash flow 
(25%). This represents a change from the profit before tax 
measure which has applied to date. The shift to EBITDA aligns 
to the Company’s leading profit-based KPI, while the 
introduction of a cash measure will ensure that there is a strong 
emphasis on the Company generating sufficient cash from 
operations to maintain the business and develop the other 
business lines under the wider strategic plan.
The specific targets are considered commercially sensitive but 
will be disclosed retrospectively in next year’s Annual Report 
on Remuneration. 
Performance Share Plan
Recognising the decline in the share price during the year, 
the Committee determined that the award levels for the Chief 
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer should be reduced 
when compared to the value of previous awards and the number 
of share options to be granted should be fixed at a pre-
determined level. This decision was made at a time when the 
share price was such that this would represent a scale-back 
from the normal grant levels, expressed as a percentage 
of salary.
Consistent with the approach taken in prior years, PSP awards 
will be subject to the achievement of the following performance 
conditions, measured over the three financial years to the 
financial year ending in July 2020:
Metric Weighting
Relative Total Shareholder Return compared to the 
companies in the FTSE All Share Index (TSR) 80%
Earnings Per Share (EPS) 20%
91
GAME Digital plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Overview Strategic report Governance Results Shareholder information TSR targets have been chosen for 80% of the PSP awards to 
provide a clear and direct incentive to recover the GAME share 
price over the next three years, while also recognising the 
importance of the dividend to shareholders. Retaining an EPS 
measure ensures that there remains a focus on the core 
measures of our long-term profitability. Overall the two 
measures together aim to ensure that growth is delivered 
in a profitable way.
Remuneration decisions for 2016/17
GAME continued to face a challenging external environment 
during the year and the full-year results were below the Board’s 
expectations. Against this backdrop, and reflecting 
performance against the targets set at the start of the year, 
the Committee determined that there would be no annual bonus 
payments to the Executive Directors. In addition, PSP awards 
with performance periods ending 2016/17 have lapsed due to 
the performance conditions not being met.
The Remuneration Committee reviewed basic salaries during 
the year and determined that there would be no increase to 
the Executive Directors’ salaries for the year commencing 
1 October 2017.
The Committee considered the new remuneration policy 
carefully and after considering a range of alternatives, 
determined that the current policy, with slight modifications, 
should be retained.
Liaison with institutional shareholders
Since taking over as Chairman of the Committee at last year’s 
AGM I have met several of our significant shareholders to 
understand more fully their views on our remuneration policy 
and its application. With this in mind there will be no change 
to the status of previously granted PSP awards and we have 
considered the impact of the decline in the share price over the 
last year in relation to this year’s proposed PSP awards, where 
the proposed grant level represents a scale back at the time 
the number of share options was determined.
Having completed my three-year term as a Non-Executive 
Director I will be stepping down at the AGM in January 2018.
However, I will be available at the meeting to answer any 
questions you may have on Directors’ remuneration at GAME. 
I hope you will be able to support both the new remuneration 
policy and the 2016/17 Annual Report on Remuneration at 
the meeting.

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT
CONTINUED Directors’ Remuneration Policy
Introduction
This Directors’ Remuneration Policy will be presented to 
shareholders at the January 2018 AGM. Subject to shareholder 
approval, the policy will take formal effect from that date and 
is intended to operate for the three-year period to January 2021.
Policy overview
The Remuneration Committee has responsibility for 
determining the remuneration for the Chairman, Executive 
Directors and other senior managers.
The aim of the remuneration policy is to: attract, retain and 
motivate high-calibre senior management; focus them on 
the delivery of the Group’s strategic and business objectives; 
promote a strong and sustainable performance culture; 
incentivise high growth; and align the interests of Executive 
Directors and other senior managers with those of 
shareholders. In promoting these objectives, the policy aims 
to ensure that no more is paid than is necessary.
The policy has been structured with due consideration of both 
best practice as set out in the Code and market practice for 
UK-listed companies.
Changes to the remuneration policy
The remuneration policy described below includes a small 
number of changes when compared against the remuneration 
policy approved by shareholders at the AGM in January 2015:
 — additional flexibility has been introduced to allow the 
Committee to operate a wider range of performance 
conditions for the annual bonus scheme. The 2015 policy 
limits the Committee to using only financial measures for 
the scheme; under the new policy, the Committee will also be 
able to use non-financial metrics. The majority of the bonus 
will remain subject to financial metrics
 — flexibility has also been added to the performance conditions 
which can be set for awards under the PSP. Under the 2015 
policy, awards can only be granted with EPS and TSR targets. 
The new policy gives the Committee greater freedom to 
determine the appropriate performance metrics, aligned 
with our business strategy, to apply to each year’s grant
 — the Committee has increased the share ownership guidelines 
for the Executive Directors from 100% of salary to 200% for 
the CEO and 150% for the CFO.
The remuneration policy for Directors
The total remuneration package for Executive Directors is structured so that variable elements (annual bonus and long-term 
incentives) make up a significant proportion of the package. This table summarises the key aspects of the Company’s remuneration 
policy for Executive and Non-Executive Directors:

 — responsibilities, abilities, experience and 
performance of an individual
 — the Company’s salary and pay structures 
and general workforce increases.
There is no prescribed maximum 
annual base salary or salary 
increase. The Committee is guided 
by the general increase for the 
broader employee population but 
may decide to award a lower 
increase for Executive Directors or 
exceed this to recognise, for 
example, an increase in the scale, 
scope or responsibility of the role 
and/or take account of relevant 
market movements.

targets which will apply to each 
award prior to the date of grant.
Share ownership
 
To increase 
alignment between 
management and 
shareholders.
Guidelines require Executive Directors to retain 
50% of any shares acquired on vesting of the PSP, 
and any subsequent share awards thereafter (net of

Annual Report and Accounts 2017
DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT
CONTINUED How the Committee operates the annual bonus and 
Performance Share Plan
The Committee operates the annual bonus and share plans 
in accordance with their respective rules and in accordance 
with the Listing Rules and HMRC regulations where relevant. 
The Committee, consistent with market practice, retains 
discretion over a number of areas relating to the operation 
and administration of certain plans, including:
 — who participates in the plans
 — when to make awards and payments
 — implementation and operation of bonus deferral
 — how to determine the size of an award or a payment, 
and when and how much of an award should vest
 — the testing of a performance condition over a shortened 
performance period
 — how to deal with a change of control or restructuring 
of the Group
 — whether a Director is a good/bad leaver for incentive plan 
purposes; what proportion of awards vest at the original 
vesting date, or whether and what proportion of awards 
may vest at the time of leaving
 — how and whether an award may be adjusted in certain 
circumstances (e.g. for a rights issue, a corporate 
restructuring or for special dividends)
 — what the weighting, measures and targets should be for 
the annual bonus plan and PSP from year to year.
The Committee also retains the discretion, within the policy, 
to adjust existing targets and/or set different measures for the 
annual bonus and the PSP. This may only take place if events 
occur that cause the Committee to determine that the targets 
set are no longer appropriate and that amendment is required 
so the relevant bonus can achieve its original intended purpose.
Any use of the above discretions would, where relevant, be 
explained in the following Annual Report on Remuneration.
Choice of performance measures for Executive 
Directors’ awards
The performance conditions chosen for the annual bonus 
scheme and the PSP reflect key financial metrics which are 
critical to the short- and long-term success of the business.
Targets for the annual bonus will be set by the Committee and 
linked to the Company’s priorities for the year ahead. A majority 
of the targets will be based on financial metrics, recognising the 
importance of underlying financial performance to the success 
of the Company. Non-financial metrics may apply for a minority 
of the bonus scheme with these targets linked to stretching 
short-term strategic objectives.
Performance conditions applying to PSP awards will be set 
by the Committee ahead of each grant depending on 
circumstances at the time, and will be aligned to the strategic 
plans of the Company. The targets may include financial 
measures such as TSR, share price or EPS, and may also 
include long-term non-financial strategic objectives.
In line with HMRC regulations for such schemes, SAYE and SIP 
awards are not subject to performance conditions.
Notes:
1.  Salary levels are based on those applying on 1 October 2017. The value of 
taxable benefits is based on the value of taxable benefits as disclosed for the 
financial year ended 29 July 2017.
2.  The on-target bonus is taken to be 50% of the maximum bonus opportunity 
(125% of salary for the CEO and 100% of salary for the CFO).
3.  The on-target level of vesting under the PSP is taken to be the 50% of the 
maximum opportunity.
4.  The maximum value of the PSP is taken to be 100% of the face value of the 
award at grant based on a grant for the CEO and CFO of 1,125,000 and 
700,000 respectively. This grant level was determined using an assumed 
share price of 40p which represents a 20% scale back on normal grant levels. 
Awards to be granted remain subject to the limits set out in the PSP rules.
5. No share price appreciation has been assumed for the PSP award.

Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Overview Strategic report Governance Results Shareholder information Loss of office
Notice periods will normally not exceed 12 months. The service 
contracts for the Executive Directors are terminable by either 
the Company or the Executive Director on not less than 
12 months’ notice in respect of Martyn Gibbs or six months’ 
notice in respect of Mark Gifford.
The Committee’s policy is to apply an appropriate level of 
mitigation, having regard to the circumstances of the individual, 
the termination of employment and to any legal advice received. 
The Company can terminate either Executive Director’s service 
contract by payment of a cash sum in lieu of notice equivalent to 
the base salary or in monthly equal instalments over the notice 
period. The Company also has the discretion to include pension 
contributions, car allowance and the cost of providing insured 
benefits within the payment in lieu of notice. There are no 
enhanced provisions on a change of control.
The Company may also pay outplacement costs, legal costs and 
other reasonable relevant costs associated with termination.
Annual bonus on termination
There is no automatic or contractual right to bonus payment. 
At the discretion of the Committee, in certain circumstances to 
incentivise short-term retention and completion of key business 
deliverables, and where poor performance is not a factor in the 
decision to exit, a bonus may become payable in cash at the 
normal payment date (or earlier) for the period of employment. 
Where the Committee decides to make a payment, the rationale 
will be fully disclosed in the Annual Report on Remuneration.
PSP on termination
The default treatment is that any outstanding awards would 
lapse on termination. However, in certain prescribed 
circumstances, such as death, injury, ill-health, retirement, 
redundancy, leaving the Group because the employer company 
or business leaves the Group or where the Committee 
determines otherwise, ‘good leaver’ status can be applied.
Awards held by a good leaver will vest on the normal vesting 
date, unless the Committee determines otherwise. Vesting will 
be subject to satisfaction of any performance conditions which 
shall, where the Committee has decided that the PSP awards 
may vest early, be measured over the period from grant to the 
date of cessation. The proportion of the award which vests will, 
unless the Committee determines otherwise, be reduced to 
reflect the proportion of the vesting period which has elapsed 
as at the date of cessation.
Policy on external appointments
Subject to Board approval, Executive Directors are permitted 
to take on non-executive positions with other companies and to 
retain their fees in respect of such positions. Details of outside 
directorships held by the Executive Directors and any fees that 
they received are provided in the Annual Report on Remuneration.
Approach to recruitment and promotions
The recruitment package for a new Director would be set 
in accordance with the terms of the Company’s approved 
remuneration policy.
The initial salary may (but need not necessarily) be set below 
the normal market rate, with phased increases as the Director 
gains experience. The rate of salary should be set to reflect 
the individual’s experience and skills.
The Company may compensate for amounts foregone from a 
previous employer, taking into account the quantum foregone, 
the extent to which performance conditions apply, the form of 
award and the time left to vesting.
For an internal appointment, any variable pay element awarded 
in respect of their prior role should be allowed to pay out 
according to its terms.
The Committee may agree that the Company will meet 
appropriate relocation costs.
For the appointment of a new Chairman, Committee Chair, 
or Non-Executive Director, the fee arrangement would be set 
in accordance with the approved remuneration policy in force 
at that time.
Service contracts and letters of appointment
Service contracts and letters of appointment are available 
for inspection at the Company’s registered office.
Letters of appointment
All Non-Executive Directors had letters of appointment with 
the Company for an initial period of three years, subject to 
re-appointment each year at the AGM. John Jackson commenced 
a new three-year term at the Company’s AGM on 18 January 
2017, following his appointment as Chairman. The appointment 
letters for the Non-Executive Directors provide that no 
compensation is payable on termination. The appointments 
are terminable by the Company on three months’ notice.
Under the terms of the Relationship Agreement the Major 
Shareholder has the right to nominate one person to serve as 
a Non-Executive Director on the Board, subject to maintaining 
an interest of at least 10 per cent in the aggregate voting rights 
in the Company. The Major Shareholder is entitled to remove 
from office such person as is appointed as its nominated 
Director and to nominate another individual in their place.

Annual Report and Accounts 2017
DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT
CONTINUED Remuneration policy for other employees
The policy described above applies specifically to the 
Company’s Executive and Non-Executive Directors. The 
following differences exist between the Company’s policy for 
the remuneration of the Executive Directors and its approach 
to the payment of employees generally:
 — a lower level of maximum annual bonus opportunity (or zero 
bonus opportunity) may apply to employees
 — performance metrics attached to the annual bonus may 
differ to reflect the precise roles and responsibilities of the 
employee and may be based on country rather than Group 
financial performance
 — variable pay plans, where appropriate (such as commission 
based plans) are used to incentivise employees. Where 
employees participate in such plans they are not eligible 
for any annual bonus awarded in that year
 — participation in the PSP is limited to the Executive Directors 
and certain selected senior managers
 — participation in a long-term incentive cash plan for certain 
selected senior managers not participating in the PSP
 — the Executive Directors are not eligible to participate in the 
Group-Wide Share Acquisition Plan (approved by 
shareholders at the 2015 AGM).
In general, these differences arise from the development 
of remuneration arrangements that are market competitive 
for the various categories of employee. They also reflect that, 
in the case of the Executive Directors and senior management, 
a greater emphasis is placed on performance-related pay 
reflecting their influence over the Company’s performance.
Statement of consideration of conditions elsewhere 
in the Company
In setting the remuneration for the Executive Directors, 
the Committee takes note of the overall approach to reward 
for employees in the Group; salary increases will ordinarily 
be (in percentage of salary terms) in line with those of the wider 
workforce. The Committee does not formally consult directly 
with employees on executive pay but does receive periodic 
updates from UK and Spanish HR teams.
How the views of shareholders are taken into account
The Committee consulted with major shareholders during 
2017 on the terms of the revised remuneration policy, and 
their views were taken into account when finalising the policy. 
The Committee will consider any further shareholder feedback 
received in relation to the policy at the AGM. This, plus any 
additional feedback received from time to time, will be 
considered as part of the Company’s annual review of 
remuneration policy.
Legacy arrangements
In approving this Directors’ Remuneration Policy, authority is 
given to the Company to honour any commitments entered into 
with Directors which were fully disclosed in the IPO prospectus. 
Details of any such payments will be set out in the Annual 
Report on Remuneration as they arise.
Annual Report on Remuneration
The Committee
Committee members
The Remuneration Committee is chaired by Caspar Woolley and 
also includes Lesley Watkins and John Jackson. Caspar Woolley 
and Lesley Watkins are independent Non-Executive Directors 
and John Jackson was an independent Non-Executive Director 
at the time of his appointment as Chairman of the Board in 
January 2017.
The Board is satisfied that the collective skills and experience 
of the Committee continues to provide sufficient commercial 
and sector-related expertise to meet the needs of the Company.
Responsibilities
The key responsibilities of the Committee are set out in the 
Committee’s terms of reference. These can be found under 
the Corporate Governance section of the corporate website, 
www.gamedigitalplc.com/investor-relations/corporate-
governance/committees.
The Board remains responsible for the approval and 
implementation of any recommendations made by the 
Remuneration Committee. Fees in relation to the Non-Executive 
Directors are discussed and determined by the Board.
Work of the Committee
The Committee convened 10 times during the year in line with 
activities as part of the Company’s remuneration cycle and 
ad-hoc as required. Attendance at the meetings is set out in 
the Corporate Governance Statement on page 68. The Company 
Secretary (who acts as secretary to the Committee) and Chief 
People Officer are regularly invited to attend. The CEO, CFO and 
the Committee’s independent advisor also attend by invitation 
from time to time as requested.
Meetings normally take place on the day of but prior to Board 
meetings. The Chairman of the Committee then reports to the 
Board on the relevant activities and recommendations of the 
Committee.
Evaluation of the Committee
The Committee self-assessed its performance in August 2017, 
taking into account its collective skills and experience, the 
activities it has engaged in during the year and the effectiveness 
of its actions in applying appropriate rigour and challenge. 
This assessment has been submitted to the Board for review 
and the Board has concluded that the Committee has 
operated effectively.

Overview Strategic report Governance Results Shareholder information Remuneration Committee advisors
The Remuneration Committee has access to independent 
advice where it considers it appropriate. During the year, 
following a tender process carried out as part of a review of 
advisors following three years since the IPO, the Committee 
appointed Korn Ferry Hay Group (‘KFHG’) as independent 
advisors. KFHG provides no other services to the Company. 
The Committee is satisfied that the advice received by KFHG 
in relation to executive remuneration matters during the year 
was objective and independent. KFHG is a member of the 
Remuneration Consultants Group and abides by the 
Remuneration Consultants Group Code of Conduct, which 
requires its advice to be objective and impartial. The fees 
payable to KFHG for providing advice in relation to executive 
remuneration over the financial year under review were £19,914 
(2016: £nil). 
New Bridge Street (‘NBS’), part of Aon plc, provided advice to 
the Committee prior to the appointment of KFHG. Fees payable 
to NBS in respect of the financial year under review were £5,428 
(2016: £34,160). NBS provided no other services to the Company 
although Aon UK Limited, part of the Aon plc group, provided 
insurance brokerage services to the Company during the year.

Overview Strategic report Governance Results Shareholder information Annual bonus for the financial year ended 29 July 2017 – audited
The bonus scheme for the 2016/17 financial year was based wholly on the achievement of profit before tax (‘PBT’) targets. The loss 
before tax of £10.0 million did not achieve the payment threshold, partly due to market challenges faced in its core console categories, 
and accordingly, no bonus was paid to the Executive Directors. The full target range is set out below.

on Remuneration, the threshold level of PBT was not met and therefore no bonus was payable. The specific PBT targets were 
not disclosed in last year’s Annual Report on Remuneration as they were considered to be commercially sensitive at the time.

Scheme interests lapsed during the year – audited
IPO awards were granted under the PSP to Martyn Gibbs in June 2014. The vesting of these awards was subject to absolute growth 
in TSR from the Offer Price of £2.00 over the three years following grant. 50 per cent was scheduled to vest for absolute growth 
of 75 per cent over the performance period and 100 per cent was scheduled to vest for absolute growth of 100 per cent over the 
performance period, with pro-rata vesting between these points. The Company reported a decline in the share price from £2.00 
on IPO to 35.5 pence per ordinary share on 9 June 2017. Accordingly, the threshold performance condition was not met and the 
IPO awards lapsed during the financial year under review.

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT
CONTINUED Pro-rata vesting will be applied between the points. TSR will be measured over the three financial years starting with the financial 
year in which the award is made, based on an average share price for the 30 dealing days prior to the start of the first financial year 
and ending with the average share price over the last 30 dealing days of the last financial year.
Malus provisions apply to the period prior to the vesting of awards, and clawback provisions apply for a period of one year after 
they vest.
Payments to past Directors and for loss of office – audited
No payments were made in the year to past Directors or for loss of office. 
External directorships
Mark Gifford is a Non-Executive Director of a private investment fund for which he receives a fee of £7,500 p.a. Martyn Gibbs 
is a Director of one dormant company for which he receives no fee.
Directors’ shareholding and share interests in PSP – audited
Share ownership plays a key role in the alignment of our Executive Directors with the interests of shareholders. Under the 
Directors’ Remuneration Policy, which is subject to shareholder approval at the January 2018 AGM, the shareholding requirement 
for the Executive Directors will increase to 200 per cent of salary for the CEO and 150 per cent of salary for the CFO. In terms of 
assessing the extent of compliance with these guidelines, the Remuneration Committee will use the share price on acquisition. 
On this basis the current share ownership level of the CEO significantly exceeds the requirement.
The two tables below set out the number of shares held or potentially held by Directors (including their connected persons where 
relevant) as at 29 July 2017.

Notes:
1.  The market price used to calculate awards is the average of the middle market quotation for a share during the five dealing days prior to that date of grant.
2.  The number of shares comprising the IPO awards was determined based on the Admission share price of £2.00. The performance condition attached to 
this award required absolute growth in TSR from the Offer Price. 50% vested for absolute growth of 75% over the performance period and 100% vested 
for absolute growth of 100% over the performance period with pro-rata vesting between the points. The threshold performance condition was not met 
and these awards lapsed during the financial year under review.
3.  50% of the award requires the Group’s basic adjusted EPS to be 26p (25% vests) rising to 28p (100% vests). The remaining 50% of the award requires 
three-year absolute TSR growth of 30% (25% vests) to 75% (100% vests). Based on the current assessment of performance the TSR performance has not 
been achieved and the EPS will not be achieved. Therefore the award will lapse accordingly.
4.   20% of the award requires the Group’s adjusted EPS to be 14.8p (25% vests) rising to 17.4p (100% vests), for the 12 months ending 26 January 2019. 
The remaining 80% of the award requires relative TSR growth vs. FTSE All-Share Index of 0% p.a. (25% vests) to 10% p.a. (non-cumulative) (100% vests).

Notes:
Votes withheld are not included in the final proxy figures as they are not recognised as a vote in law. 
*Result of votes cast at AGM held on 15 January 2015.
The Committee recognises that although the resolution to approve the Annual Report on Remuneration was passed, 13% of 
shareholders voted against the resolution. The Committee has taken feedback from major shareholders on this result, and we 
understand that the primary issue of concern raised by those who did not support the Committee’s decision to cancel the PSP 
awards granted in October 2015 and grant new awards in May 2016 with lower EPS targets. While we believe that the approach 
taken was an appropriate response to the significant changes in external conditions which emerged soon after the initial grant, 
we can confirm that there are no plans to make similar changes to outstanding PSP awards.
At the forthcoming AGM there will be two separate ordinary resolutions, one approving the Annual Statement and Annual Report 
on Remuneration and one approving the new Directors’ Remuneration Policy.
Approval
This Directors’ Remuneration Report, including both Policy and Annual Remuneration Report, has been approved by the Board

DIRECTORS’ REPORT Results and dividends
The results for the year are set out in the consolidated 
statement of comprehensive income on page 118. An interim 
dividend of 1.00p per ordinary share was paid to shareholders 
in August 2017. 
The trustee of the Employee Benefit Trust has waived its right 
to dividends paid on any ordinary shares it holds on the terms 
of the Employee Benefit Trust in respect of the period covered 
by the financial statements and future periods. The aggregate

statements was £30,129.82.
Directors
The individuals who have acted as Directors of the Company 
during the year and biographical details setting out their key 
strengths and experiences are set out on pages 70 to 71. Each 
Director served throughout the year ended 29 July 2017 except 
for David Hamid who resigned as Chairman and from the Board 
on 18 January 2017 and Frank Tuil who resigned on 13 October 2016.
Only the Executive Directors have service contracts in place, 
which run for an indefinite period. The Non-Executive Directors 
were all appointed on 16 May 2014 commencing an initial 
three-year term from 15 January 2015, the date of the 
Company’s first AGM (the ‘Initial Term’). John Jackson 
commenced a new three-year term at the Company’s AGM 
on 18 January 2017, following his appointment as Chairman. 
Following review by the Board, Lesley Watkins has been invited 
to commence a second three-year term following the expiry 
of her Initial Term and the Board has acknowledged Caspar 
Woolley’s intention to step down at the conclusion of the 
Company’s AGM in January 2018, following the completion of 
his Initial Term. Copies of Executive Directors’ service contracts 
and the Non-Executive Directors’ letters of appointment are 
available to shareholders for inspection at the Company’s 
registered office and at the AGM. Details of each Executive 
Director’s contractual arrangements, including notice periods, 
are included as part of the Directors’ Annual Report on 
Remuneration on pages 90 to 103 and that information is 
incorporated by reference into the Directors’ Report.
Following the Board’s internal review and upon receiving 
recommendations from the Nomination Committee, the Board 
considers that all Directors continue to be effective, committed 
to their roles and able to devote sufficient time to discharge their 
responsibilities. With the exception of Caspar Woolley, each of the 
Directors will seek re-election at the Company’s forthcoming 
AGM in accordance with the Company’s articles of association 
and in line with the recommendation in the Code which require 
all of the Directors to stand for election at each AGM. 
Subject to the Company’s articles of association, the Companies 
Act 2006, any directions given by the Company by special 
resolution and any relevant statutes and regulations, the 
business of the Company, including in relation to the allotment 
and issuance of ordinary shares, is managed by the Board which 
may exercise all the powers of the Company. Matters reserved 
for the Board are detailed on page 73 of the Corporate 
Governance Statement.
Related party transactions
On 20 April 2016, the Company and certain members of the 
Group entered into an asset-backed revolving facility agreement 
(the ‘Lajedosa Facility Agreement’) with Lajedosa Investments 
S.à r.l (‘Lajedosa’), on a conditional basis, which reached 
maturity on 31 October 2017. 
On signing the Lajedosa Facility Agreement the Company also 
signed (but did not complete) a debenture creating fixed and 
floating security for the obligations under the Lajedosa Facility 
Agreement (the ‘Lajedosa Debenture’). At the time of entry by 
the Company into those financing documents, for the purposes 
of Chapter 11 of the Listing Rules, Lajedosa was an associate of 
Duodi Investments S.à r.l. (‘Duodi’), which was a related party of 
the Company by virtue of holding approximately 43.44 per cent 
of the Company’s ordinary shares of £0.01 each. As a result, 
Lajedosa itself was also a related party of the Company and the 
entry into such financing documents by the Company and the 
other members of the Group was, therefore, treated as a related 
party transaction for the purposes of Chapter 11 of the Listing 
Rules. Duodi is an investment vehicle ultimately wholly-owned 
by Elliott International, L.P. and Elliott Associates, L.P. (the 
latter via a participation interest with Elliott International, L.P.).
The Lajedosa Facility Agreement provided that the substantive 
terms of the Lajedosa Facility Agreement would become 
effective only once the Group had satisfied certain conditions. 
Those conditions included the approval of the shareholders of 
the Company for the purposes of the related party transaction 
rules referred to above, which was obtained on 19 May 2016, and 
that the Company and Game Retail Limited (‘GRL ’, the borrower 
under the Lajedosa Facility Agreement) had delivered a written 
notice to Lajedosa, the lender under the Lajedosa Facility 
Agreement (the ‘Lajedosa Activation Notice’).
As disclosed under a regulatory announcement issued on 
21 April 2016, the primary terms of the Lajedosa Facility 
Agreement and Lajedosa Debenture were as follows: 
Lajedosa Facility Agreement
The initial aggregate principal commitment of Lajedosa under 
the Lajedosa Facility Agreement is £50,000,000, which sum may 
be increased, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, 
at GRL ’s request up to a maximum of £100,000,000. Once all the 
conditions relating to the effectiveness of the Lajedosa Facility 
Agreement have been satisfied, subject to the deferral 
described below, GRL will be required to pay a commitment 
fee equal to 0.5 per cent per annum on the undrawn committed 
amounts under the Lajedosa Facility Agreement.

GAME Digital plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Overview Strategic report Governance Results Shareholder information Interest on borrowings under the Lajedosa Facility Agreement 
will accrue at a rate which is the aggregate of 5.5 per cent per 
annum plus one-month LIBOR. If GRL fails to pay any amount 
payable by it under the Lajedosa Facility Agreement on its due 
date, interest will accrue on the unpaid sum at a rate which 
is 2 per cent higher than that rate. 
The Lajedosa Facility Agreement is cross-guaranteed by the 
Company, GRL and the other members of the Group (each an 
‘Obligor’) and is secured by the Lajedosa Debenture, which 
creates fixed and floating charges over all the assets of each 
Obligor. The Lajedosa Facility Agreement does not include any 
financial covenants, but does include restrictions, amongst 
other things, in relation to mergers, acquisitions, investments, 
disposals, new business activities and entry into certain forms 
of financing arrangement, in each case subject to certain 
exceptions. The Lajedosa Facility Agreement also includes 
customary events of default, including a cross-default clause 
whereby non-payment of any member of the Group’s (as defined 
in the Lajedosa Facility Agreement) indebtedness of £2,500,000 
or more when due constitutes an event of default under the 
Lajedosa Facility Agreement (subject to applicable grace 
periods). For the purposes of the Lajedosa Facility Agreement, 
the ‘Group’ includes each of the Company’s subsidiaries other 
than Game Stores Iberia SLU.
Lajedosa Debenture
The Lajedosa Debenture is standard in form and creates fixed 
and floating security over each Obligor’s assets, including 
property owned by them. The Lajedosa Debenture also contains 
standard provisions requiring the Obligors to notify 
counterparties to any insurance policies which are charged 
or assigned to Lajedosa pursuant to the Lajedosa Debenture, 
and any banks which hold accounts which are charged pursuant 
to the Lajedosa Debenture, as well as provisions relating to 
investments (including shares) held by the Obligors, including 
that, once the security created pursuant to the Lajedosa 
Debenture has become enforceable, Lajedosa may exercise any 
voting rights in respect of the relevant investments in the name 
of the Obligor which holds those investments.
The security created pursuant to the Lajedosa Debenture 
becomes enforceable upon the occurrence of an event of default 
under, and as defined in, the Lajedosa Facility Agreement. 
If the Lajedosa Debenture becomes enforceable, it would allow 
Lajedosa to appoint an administrator to any Obligor or a receiver 
to any assets which are secured by the security created 
pursuant to the Lajedosa Debenture.
Summary of planned use of borrowing facilities in the UK
The Company does not expect to use any working capital 
facilities in the short term.
Significant agreements – change of control
A number of agreements take effect, alter or terminate upon 
a change of control of the Group, such as credit facilities and 
employee share-based incentive schemes. 
The Group’s main credit facilities, under the £75,000,000 
asset-backed revolving loan facility agreement (the ‘PNC 
Facility Agreement’), contain a provision which means that, 
should a change of control occur (i.e. a person or group of 
persons acting in concert gain, in relation to, the power to (i) 
cast or control the casting of a majority of the votes at a general 
meeting of the Company, (ii) appoint or remove all or the 
majority of the Directors of the Company, (iii) give directions 
with respect for the operating and financial policies of the 
Company or (iv) beneficially hold more than 50 per cent of the 
share capital of the Company), the facilities will be cancelled 
and the loans, together with accrued interest, be declared 
immediately due and payable. However, this is subject to certain 
exceptions. Firstly, should such change of control involve solely 
Lajedosa and/or Duodi and/or any affiliate of either of them 
taking control of the Company, then subject to customary ‘know 
your customer’ and anti-money laundering procedures being 
satisfied in relation to the entity or entities which are taking 
control of the Company, then the facilities under the PNC 
Facility Agreement will remain in place. Secondly, the PNC 
Facility Agreement also provides that the Lenders may agree 
that any such event shall not constitute a change of control 
for the purposes of the PNC Facility Agreement. 
The Group’s back-up facility, the ‘Lajedosa Facility Agreement’, 
which reached maturity on 31 October 2017, also contained a 
change of control provision such that, if any person or group of 
persons acting in concert (in each case, other than (i) Lajedosa, 
(ii) Duodi, and (iii) any Affiliate of Lajedosa or Duodi) acquired 
direct or indirect beneficial ownership of more than 50 per cent 
of the share capital of GRL or the Company, as the case may be, 
or the issued share capital of GRL or the Company, as the case 
may be, having the right to cast more than 50 per cent of the 
votes being cast in a general meeting of GRL or the Company, 
as the case may be, or otherwise gaining the power to direct the 
management and policies of GRL or the Company, as the case 
may be, whether through the ownership of voting capital, by 
contract or otherwise, then Lajedosa may have, by notice to 
GRL, cancelled the facility under the Lajedosa Facility 
Agreement and declare loans under it, together with accrued 
interest and all other amounts payable accrued under the 
Lajedosa Facility Agreement and related finance documents, 
immediately due and payable.

CONTINUED Share capital 
The Company’s only class of share is ordinary shares of £0.01 
each. The authorised and issued share capital of the Company, 
together with any shares issued during the period, are set out in 
note 27 of the financial statements. The voting rights of each of 
the ordinary shares in the Company are identical, with each 
share carrying the right to one vote. The rights and obligations 
attached to the ordinary shares are governed by UK law and 
the Company’s articles of association.
Ordinary shareholders are entitled to receive notice of and 
to attend and speak at general meetings. On a show of hands, 
every shareholder present in person or by proxy (or a duly 
authorised corporate representative) shall have one vote and, 
on a poll, every member who is present in person or by proxy 
(or a duly authorised corporate representative) shall have one 
vote for every share held by that member.
Other than the general provisions of the articles of association 
and prevailing legislation, there are no specific restrictions 
on the size of a holding of the Company’s share capital.
The Directors are not aware of any agreements between 
holders of the Company’s shares that may result in the 
restriction on the transfer of securities or on voting rights. 
No shareholder holds securities carrying any special rights 
or control over the Company’s share capital. 
Restrictions on the transfers of shares
The articles of association do not contain any restrictions on the 
transfer of ordinary shares in the Company other than the usual 
restrictions, which are applicable where a share instrument is 
not duly stamped or certified as exempt from stamp duty, is in 
respect of more than one class of share, relates to joint 
transferees and such transfer is in favour of more than four 
such transferees, or relates to shares that are not fully paid.
Authority to purchase own shares
No authority was put in place at the Company’s AGM in January 
2017 for the Company to make one or more market purchases 
of its ordinary shares.
Directors’ interests
The number of ordinary shares of the Company in which 
the Directors were beneficially interested at 30 July 2016 
and 29 July 2017 is set out in the Directors’ Annual Report

Directors’ indemnities and insurance 
In accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and the Company’s 
articles of association, the Company has purchased directors’ 
and officers’ liability insurance cover which remains in place 
as at the date of this report. A review is carried out on an annual 
basis to ensure that the Board remains satisfied that an 
appropriate level of cover is in place.

29 July 2017 prospectus liability insurance to provide cover for 
liabilities incurred by the Directors in the performance of their 
duties or powers in connection with the issue of the prospectus 
in relation to the listing of the Company’s shares on the London 
Stock Exchange.
The Company has entered into a deed of indemnity with each of 
its Directors whereby, to the extent permitted by the Companies 
Act 2006 and the Company’s articles of association, and 
provided that the Director has at all times acted in good faith, 
the Company: (a) indemnifies the Director against costs, 
liabilities or expenses (including reasonable professional and 
legal fees) incurred by them by virtue of them being, or having 
been, a Director or other officer of the Company; and (b) agrees

DIRECTORS’ REPORT
CONTINUED The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report 
and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law 
and regulations. 
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial 
statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors 
are required to prepare the Group financial statements in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union and Article 4 of the 
IAS Regulation and have also chosen to prepare the parent 
company financial statements under IFRSs as adopted by the 
EU. Under company law the Directors must not approve the 
financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give 
a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and the 
Company and of the profit or loss of the Group and the Company 
for that period. In preparing the Group and Company financial 
statements the Directors are required to:
 — select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently
 — make judgements and accounting estimates that are 
reasonable and prudent
 — state whether they have been prepared in accordance with 
IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, subject to any 
material departures disclosed and explained in the financial 
statements
 — prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will 
continue in business
 — prepare a Director’s Report, a Strategic report and Director’s 
Remuneration Report which comply with the requirements 
of the Companies Act 2006.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time 
the financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure 
that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 
2006. The Directors also have a general responsibility for taking 
such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the 
assets of the Group and Company and hence to prevent and 
detect fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for ensuring the Annual Report 
and the Financial Statements are made available on a website.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity 
of the corporate and financial information included on the 
Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom 
governing the preparation and dissemination of financial 
statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Responsibility statement pursuant to DTR 4
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
 — the financial statements, prepared in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by 
the European Union and Articles of the IAS Regulations, give 
a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position 
and profit or loss of the Group
 — the Strategic report includes a fair review of the development 
and performance of the business and the position of the 
Group, together with a description of the principal risks and 
uncertainties that they face
 — the Annual Report and financial statements, taken as a 
whole, are fair, balanced and understandable and provide 
the information necessary for shareholders to assess the 
Company’s performance, business model and strategy.

Overview Strategic report Governance Results Shareholder information Opinion
We have audited the financial statements of GAME Digital plc 
(the ‘Parent Company’) and its subsidiaries (the ‘Group’) for the 
52 week period ended 29 July 2017 which comprise the 
Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, the 
Consolidated Statement of Financial Position, the Consolidated 
Statement of Changes in Equity, the Consolidated Statement 
of Cash Flows, the Parent Company Statement of Financial 
Position, the Parent Company Statement of Changes in Equity, 
the Parent Company Statement of Cash Flows and notes to 
the financial statements, including a summary of significant 
accounting policies. The financial reporting framework that 
has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted 
by the European Union and, as regards the Parent Company 
financial statements, as applied in accordance with the 
provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
In our opinion the financial statements:
 — give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of 
the Parent Company’s affairs as at 29 July 2017 and of the 
Group’s loss for the period then ended;
 — the Group financial statements have been properly prepared 
in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union;
 — the Parent Company financial statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the 
European Union and as applied in accordance with the 
provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and
 — the financial statements have been prepared in accordance 
with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006; and, 
as regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 
of the IAS Regulation.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International 
Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. 
Our responsibilities under those standards are further 
described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the 
financial statements section of our report. We are independent 
of the Group in accordance with the ethical requirements that 
are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, 
including the FRC’s Ethical Standard as applied to listed public 
interest entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical 
responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. 
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient 
and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Conclusions relating to principal risks, going concern 
and viability statement
We have nothing to report in respect of the following 
information in the annual report, in relation to which the ISAs 
(UK) require us to report to you whether we have anything 
material to add or draw attention to:
 — the disclosures in the annual report set out on pages 41 to 44 
that describe the principal risks and explain how they are 
being managed or mitigated;
 — the directors’ confirmation set out on page 41 in the annual 
report that they have carried out a robust assessment of the 
principal risks facing the Group, including those that would 
threaten its business model, future performance, solvency 
or liquidity;
 — the directors’ statement set out on page 63 in the financial 
statements about whether the directors considered it 
appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting 
in preparing the financial statements and the directors’ 
identification of any material uncertainties to the Group 
and the Parent Company’s ability to continue to do so over 
a period of at least 12 months from the date of approval 
of the financial statements;
 — whether the directors’ statement relating to going concern 
required under the Listing Rules in accordance with Listing 
Rule 9.8.6R(3) is materially inconsistent with our knowledge 
obtained in the audit; or
 — the directors’ explanation set out on page 63 in the annual 
report as to how they have assessed the prospects of the 
Group, over what period they have done so and why they 
consider that period to be appropriate, and their statement as 
to whether they have a reasonable expectation that the Group 
will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities 
as they fall due over the period of their assessment, including 
any related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary 
qualifications or assumptions.
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional 
judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the 
financial statements of the current period and include the most 
significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether 
or not due to fraud) that we identified. These matters included 
those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit 
strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing 
the efforts of the engagement team. These matters were 
addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements 
as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not 
provide a separate opinion on these matters.

Annual Report and Accounts 2017
INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS 
OF GAME DIGITAL PLC Areas of Audit Focus Audit Response
Revenue recognition – gift card and loyalty scheme revenues 
Gift cards
Receipts from the sale of gift cards are deferred until the gift cards 
are redeemed against subsequent purchases.
An element of gift card revenue is recognised immediately as ‘breakage’ 
based on a redemption estimate of the cards not expected to be redeemed. 
The key judgement, which could be subject to management override, is the 
determination of the redemption rate used to calculate breakage revenue 
and there is a risk that expired gift card balances and the breakage rate are 
misstated and therefore revenue is not recognised in the appropriate period.
To determine the breakage that should be recognised, management consider 
the historic proportion of gift cards that expired without being used. 
We have:
 — obtained the full data set of the gift card database and re-created 
the data set by period with the assistance of our IT audit specialists 
and compared it to the analysis provided by management
 — we reviewed management’s analysis of the data by age and tested 
the subsequent breakage calculation
 — re-performed the breakage calculation to check calculation accuracy
 — performed sensitivity analysis on the rates calculated by management.
Loyalty schemes provision
Points earned as part of the Game Reward schemes are deferred at their 
potential revenue value and held on the balance sheet until they are 
redeemed.
The key judgement, which could be subject to management override, is the 
determination of the points that will be redeemed in the future and therefore 
the proportion of revenue that should be deferred. Hence there is a risk that 
the redemption rate is misstated and therefore revenue is not recognised 
in the appropriate period.
Refer to Accounting Policies of the Group on pages 122 to 127 for further detail 
on the Group’s revenue recognition policies and note 22 for the accruals and 
deferred income balances.
We have:
 — obtained the full data set of the loyalty point database, 
and management’s calculations that were used to determine 
the redemption rates
 — re-created the data set by age with the assistance of our IT audit 
specialists and compared it to the analysis provided by management
 — re-calculated the redemption rates from the data set and compared 
this to the rate calculated by management
 — performed sensitivity analysis on the rates calculated by management.
Recognition and classification of marketing income 
(supplier funding)
The Group receives amounts from suppliers in a number of different forms 
and based on a number of different criteria.
As the basis and criteria for these payments varies in terms of their 
performance requirements the subsequent accounting for this involves an 
element of judgement in assessing whether these requirements have been 
met and the point at which it is appropriate to recognise the amounts. Hence 
there is a risk that the amounts are not recognised in the right period.
Marketing income has historically been classified within operating expenses. 
Management have re-assessed the nature of the different arrangements 
with suppliers which has resulted in a prior year adjustment to reclassify 
certain amounts to within cost of sales. The risk is that the amounts are 
not classified within the appropriate balance in the Statement of 
Comprehensive Income.
Refer to Accounting Policies of the Group on pages 122 to 127 for the 
accounting policy and ‘Note 1’ of the financial statements on page 128. 
We have:
 — sample tested marketing income calculations to supporting 
documentation
 — performed cut off procedures at the year end to ensure the 
completeness of supplier funding income in the year
 — considered the appropriateness of management’s assumptions 
of the reclassification with reference to industry best practice
 — obtained management’s calculation of the split of marketing income 
between a reduction in operating expenses and a reduction in cost 
of sales and audited this calculation on a sample basis.

Inventory valuation
Inventory is held at the lower of cost and net realisable value and the 
determination of net realisable value involves the exercise of significant 
judgement. 
Given the size of the inventory balance, and the level of provisioning required, 
we consider the provision calculation to be an area of material judgement. 
Hence there is a risk that the inventory valuation is inappropriate.
Refer to the Accounting Policies of the Group on pages 122 to 127 for 
further detail on the policies impacting inventory valuation and note 17 
for the financial disclosure.
We have:
 — considered the appropriateness of management’s assumptions 
within the provision calculation
 — obtained management’s calculations and re-calculated the 
provision value
 — tested the amounts included in the provision on a sample basis.
Impairment of Multiplay goodwill
The Group acquired 100% of Multiplay (UK) Limited in March 2015. On 
acquisition, £5.3m of intangible assets were recognised for brand, customer 
relationships and technology. In addition, £8.5m of goodwill was recognised 
on acquisition. There has been no impairment recognised against this 
balance since acquisition.
Management have assessed the recoverable amount of Multiplay based 
on its future value-in-use. Value-in-use has been calculated by reference 
to discounted future expected cash flows.
Significant judgement is required in assessing future cash flows and 
determining the appropriate discount rate used in the calculation due to 
the expectation of significant future growth in the business. Hence there 
is a risk that these amounts are not valued appropriately.
Refer to the Accounting Policies of the Group on pages 122 to 127 for further 
detail on the policies relevant to Multiplay and note 15 for the financial 
disclosure of this balance.
We have:
 — considered and challenged the underlying forecasts prepared 
for the Multiplay business by management
 — assessed the discount rate used in the calculation prepared 
by management by reference to market comparatives
 — with the assistance of the expertise of our valuations specialists, 
considered the reasonableness of the inputs and assumptions used 
in management’s impairment review
 — recalculated the relevant computations used in management’s review
 — considered the level of headroom in the calculations to assess the risk 
that the value-in-use of the business may fall below its carrying value
 — reviewed the disclosure provided in the financial statements in respect 
of the impairment review to ensure compliance with IFRS 3.

Prior year adjustments
During the year, management identified two material differences in two 
statements of financial position accounts as part of a detailed review of 
processes, controls and reconciliations in the UK retail business. Further 
work evidenced these as relating to prior periods and therefore these have 
been accounted for in the financial statements as prior year adjustments.
Preowned VAT
Under the ‘Global Accounting Scheme’ (GAS) the VAT due on sales of 
preowned goods should be calculated as 1/6th of the margin in any given 
period. The margin equals the sales in the period less all purchases made 
in the period. If the margin is negative, no VAT is due and the balance is 
carried forward to the next period.
Management have calculated an adjustment of £1.6m to increase the year 
end preowned VAT provision with the other side being recorded in prior 
periods. The risk is that the adjustment has not been calculated correctly 
and does not relate to accounting periods to which they have been attributed.
We have:
 — obtained management’s workings for the adjustment and tested 
the arithmetic accuracy
 — reviewed and challenged the key judgements in arriving at the 
adjustment
 — tested the apportionment of the error to the prior periods.
Goods received not invoiced (‘GRNI’) and trade payables
Management identified an issue with GRNI during the year as a result 
of a number of historical invoices being received in the current year. 
This revealed a shortfall in GRNI of £2.3m in the period ended 25 July 2015, 
increasing to £3.2m as at 30 July 2016. The risk is that the GRNI accruals 
are not complete or not recognised in the correct accounting period.
Refer to note 1 of the financial statements on page 128.
We have:
 — obtained the GRNI listing for the period ended 25 July 2015 and 
substantively tested management’s assessment on a sample basis, 
that the GRNI shortfall largely related to this period
 — reviewed and substantively tested on a sample basis, management’s 
analysis of the shortfall at 29 July 2017
 — tested a sample of supplier statement reconciliations as at 29 July 2017 
to ensure that the appropriate liability for trade payables and GRNI is 
recorded in the financial statements
 — reviewed the shortfall by period and the associated management 
judgements in determining the final adjustments.

GAME Digital plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Overview Strategic report Governance Results Shareholder information Our application of materiality
We apply the concept of materiality both in planning 
and performing our audit, and in evaluating the effect of 
misstatements. For planning, we consider materiality to be 
the magnitude by which misstatements, including omissions, 
could influence the economic decisions of reasonable users 
that are taken on the basis of the financial statements. In order 
to reduce to an appropriately low level the probability that any 
misstatements exceed materiality, we use a lower materiality 
level, performance materiality, to determine the extent of 
testing needed. Importantly, misstatements below these levels 
will not necessarily be evaluated as immaterial as we also take 
account of the nature of identified misstatements, and the 
particular circumstances of their occurrence, when evaluating 
their effect on the financial statements as a whole.
The materiality for the Group financial statements as a whole 
was set at £1.4m. This was determined with reference to a 
benchmark of revenue (of which it represents 0.18 per cent) 
which we consider to be the most appropriate consideration 
in assessing the financial performance of the Group.
Performance materiality was set at 65 per cent of the above 
materiality level.
Where financial information from components was audited 
separately, component materiality levels were set for this 
purpose at lower levels up to a maximum of 72 per cent 
of Group materiality.
Materiality levels are not significantly different from those 
applied in the previous year by the former auditor.
We agreed with the Audit and Risk Committee that we would 
report to the committee all individual audit differences in 
excess of £70,000. We also agreed to report differences below 
this threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on 
qualitative grounds.
An overview of the scope of our audit
Our Group audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of 
the Group and its control environment and assessing the risk of 
material misstatement at a Group level. Audit work was planned 
and undertaken to address the risks of material misstatement.
The Group operates in two main geographical markets, which 
are the UK and Spain. Significant judgements impacting the 
local markets are undertaken by local management with 
significant judgements impacting the consolidated financial 
statements undertaken by head office management.
We have performed a full scope audit over all companies within 
the Group. A component materiality was set at £1.0m in the UK 
and €1.0m in Spain. We have also performed audit procedures 
on the Group consolidation process. 
The Group audit team control and direct the work of the 
component audit team in Spain. This includes providing detailed 
audit instructions and setting of materiality. The Group audit 
team also took part in local audit meetings at the planning and 
completion stage of the component audit and the Group audit 
partner visited Spain to review the audit work undertaken and 
meet with local management.

other information is materially inconsistent with the financial 
statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise 
appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material 
inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are 
required to determine whether there is a material misstatement 
in the financial statements or a material misstatement of the 
other information. If, based on the work we have performed, 
we conclude that there is a material misstatement of the other 
information, we are required to report that fact.
We have nothing to report in this regard.
In this context, we also have nothing to report in regard to 
our responsibility to specifically address the following items 
in the other information and to report as uncorrected material 
misstatements of the other information where we conclude 
that those items meet the following conditions:
 — Fair, balanced and understandable set out on page 109 – 
the statement given by the directors that they consider the 
annual report and financial statements taken as a whole 
is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the 
information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s 
performance, business model and strategy, is materially 
inconsistent with our knowledge obtained in the audit; or
 — Audit and risk committee reporting set out on pages 83 to 89 
– the section describing the work of the audit committee 
does not appropriately address matters communicated 
by us to the audit committee; or
 — Directors’ statement of compliance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code set out on page 68 – the parts of the 
directors’ statement required under the Listing Rules 
relating to the Company’s compliance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code containing provisions specified for review 
by the auditor in accordance with Listing Rule 9.8.10R(2) do 
not properly disclose a departure from a relevant provision 
of the UK Corporate Governance Code.
Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies 
Act 2006
In our opinion, the part of the directors’ remuneration report 
to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with 
the Companies Act 2006.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF GAME DIGITAL PLC
CONTINUED In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course 
of the audit:
 — the information given in the Strategic report and directors’ 
report for the financial period for which the financial 
statements are prepared is consistent with the financial 
statements; and
 — the Strategic report and directors’ report have been prepared 
in accordance with applicable legal requirements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group 
and the Parent Company and its environment obtained in the 
course of the audit, we have not identified material 
misstatements in the strategic report or the directors’ report.
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters 
in relation to which the Companies Act 2006 requires us to 
report to you if, in our opinion:
 — adequate accounting records have not been kept by the 
Parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have 
not been received from branches not visited by us; or
 — the Parent Company financial statements and the part of 
the directors’ remuneration report to be audited are not 
in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
 — certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified 
by law are not made; or
 — we have not received all the information and explanations 
we require for our audit.
Responsibilities of directors
As explained more fully in the directors’ responsibilities 
statement set out on page 109, the directors are responsible 
for the preparation of the financial statements and for being 
satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal 
control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the 
preparation of financial statements that are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the directors are 
responsible for assessing the Group’s and the Parent 
Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, 
as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the 
going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either 
intend to liquidate the Group or the Parent Company or to cease 
operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial 
statements
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a 
body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies 
Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might 
state to the Company’s members those matters we are required 
to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. 
To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or 
assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company 
and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, 
for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether the financial statements as a whole are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to 
issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable 
assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee 
that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will 
always detect a material misstatement when it exists. 
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered 
material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably 
be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken 
on the basis of these financial statements. 
Our audit was planned and performed to provide a reasonable 
expectation that material fraud would be identified. This work 
includes the review of unusual journal entries processed during 
the year in each component and in the Group consolidation 
process. A number of criteria are used in assessing whether 
journal entries are considered to be unusual.
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of 
the financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting 
Council’s website at: www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. 
This description forms part of our auditor’s report.
Other matters which we are required to address
Following the recommendation of the Audit and Risk 
Committee, we were appointed by the Audit and Risk Committee 
on 1 November 2016 to audit the financial statements for the 
period ended 29 July 2017 and subsequent financial periods. 
The period of total uninterrupted engagement is one year, 
covering the current year.
The non-audit services prohibited by the FRC’s Ethical Standard 
were not provided to the Group or the Parent Company and we 
remain independent of the Group and the Parent Company in 
conducting our audit.
Our audit opinion is consistent with the additional report 
to the Audit and Risk Committee.

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS
FOR THE 52 WEEKS ENDED 29 JULY 2017 General information
GAME Digital plc is a public limited company, which is listed 
on the London Stock Exchange and incorporated in the 
United Kingdom.
The Group offers an extensive range of gaming and 
gaming-related products, including hardware (which comprises 
consoles, personal computers and handheld devices), console 
physical content, console digital content (in the form of 
downloadable content, full game downloads, digital 
subscriptions and digital currency top-ups), non-console 
digital content (such as PC downloads), accessories, licensed 
merchandise and own-label products in the UK and Spain. 
The Group also sells mobile devices and movies. This range 
(with the exception of digital content) includes both new and 
preowned products (which is supported by the Group’s trade-in 
model). The Group also offers gaming experiences in-store on 
consoles, PCs and VR devices and operates community-based 
specialist gaming activities including gaming events and 
esports, digital hosting services for businesses and end 
customers for multiplayer gaming. Furthermore, the Group 
operates a software development business specialising in 
visual recognition and augmented reality technologies.
Basis of preparation
GAME Digital plc, and its subsidiaries (together ‘the Group’), 
is required to prepare its consolidated financial statements 
in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRS) and IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRS IC) 
interpretations as adopted by the European Union and in 
accordance with the Companies Act 2006 applicable to 
companies reporting under IFRS.
The Group’s accounting reference date is 31 July. The Group 
draws up its financial statements for the accounting period 
ending on the Saturday directly before or following the 
accounting reference date, as permitted by section 390 (3) 
of the Companies Act 2006. 
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical 
cost basis, except for the revaluation of certain financial 
instruments that are measured at fair values at the end of 
each reporting period, as explained in the accounting policies 
below. Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of 
the consideration given in exchange for goods and services. 
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
The Group’s accounting policies have been applied consistently.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial 
statements of GAME Digital plc (‘the Company’) and entities 
controlled by the Company (its subsidiaries). Consolidation 
of a subsidiary begins when the Group obtains control over 
the subsidiary and is deconsolidated from the date that control 
ceases. Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial 
statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies into 
line with those used by the Group. Intercompany transactions, 
balances and unrealised gains and losses on transactions 
between Group companies are eliminated on consolidation.
Standards affecting the financial statements
Adoption of new and revised standards
The following new and revised standards and interpretations 
are relevant to the Group and have been adopted for the first 
time for the financial period. Their adoption has not had 
any significant impact on the amounts reported in the 
financial statements: 
 — Annual Improvements 2012 – 2014 Cycle
 — Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements
 — Amendments to IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment 
and IAS 38 Intangible Assets
 — Amendments to IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate 
Financial Statements
 — Amendments to IFRS 11 Acquisitions of Interests 
in Joint Operations
There are no other IFRSs or IFRIC interpretations that 
are effective and have a material impact on the Group.
A number of new standards, amendments to standards and 
interpretations are effective for periods beginning on or after 
30 July 2017, and have not been applied in preparing these 
consolidated financial statements. None of these are expected 
to have a significant effect on the consolidated financial 
statements of the Group: 
 — Annual Improvements 2014 – 2016 Cycle
 — Amendments to IAS 7 Cash Flow Statements
 — Amendments to IAS 12 Income Taxes
 — Amendments to IFRS 2 Share-based Payment
 — IFRS 9 Financial Instruments
 — IFRIC 22 Foreign Currency Transactions and 
Advance Consideration
 — IFRIC 23 Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers has been issued 
and is effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. 
We are currently assessing the impact on the consolidated 
financial statements and it is not practicable to provide a 
reasonable estimate of the effect of this standard until our 
detailed review has been completed. 
IFRS 16 Leases has been issued and is effective for periods 
beginning on or after 1 January 2019. We have not begun to 
assess the impact this standard will have on the consolidated 
financial statements and it is not practicable to provide a 
reasonable estimate until a detailed review has been completed 
although as with most retailers this standard is expected to 
have a significant impact on the Group’s results and balance 
sheet. With 572 store leases across the Group and head office 
and distribution centre leases in the UK and Spain, these leases 
will be brought onto the balance sheet. This will have the effect 
of increasing the Adjusted EBITDA but the overall impact on the 
profit before tax has not been quantified.
There are no other IFRSs or IFRIC interpretations that are not 
yet effective that would be expected to have a material impact 
on the Group.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES OF THE GROUP  Significant accounting policies
Going concern
The Company’s business activities, together with factors which 
potentially affect its future development, performance or 
position, can be found in the Strategic Report on pages 7 to 63 
and the Directors’ Report on pages 104 to 108.
The Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group 
and the Company has adequate financial resources to ensure 
it continues to operate for a period of not less than 12 months 
from the approval of the financial statements. In reaching their 
conclusion the Directors have carefully considered the cash 
resources and financing facilities available to the Group and 
have reviewed budgets and forecasts including downside 
sensitivities. Given this information the Directors have adopted 
the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the 
financial statements.
Revenue
Revenue from the sale of games and gaming-related products, 
which consists of physical and digital content, hardware and 
accessories, all offered as new and preowned products, 
comprises the value of sales (excluding VAT and similar taxes 
and trade discounts) of goods provided in the normal course 
of business. Revenue is recognised at the point of sale, 
for high street retailing, to the extent that it is probable that 
the economic benefits will flow to the Group. Online revenue 
is recognised when the goods are despatched to the customer. 
Revenue for goods, such as third-party gift cards and digital 
content, sold on a commission basis is recognised net of 
associated purchase costs. A provision is made within revenue 
and cost of sales for estimated customer returns. 
Revenue relating to the organisation and management of events 
is recognised on the occurrence of the event. Hosting revenue 
and multiplayer gaming subscription income is recognised on a 
straight-line basis over the period to which it relates. Software 
development income and similar services are recognised when 
contracts are signed and services are substantially completed 
or over the term of the contracts, as appropriate.
Supplier funding
Supplier rebates and other similar promotional funding 
(including marketing contributions from suppliers where there 
are no directly attributable marketing costs incurred by the 
Group) are generally recognised as a credit to cost of sales over 
the period to which they relate and, where appropriate, based 
on actual or estimated volumes. See page 87 and note 1 for 
further details of the reclassification in the previous period.
Suppliers also provide marketing and advertising support 
to the Group which is recognised when specific, incremental 
and identifiable actual costs are incurred, and is classified 
as a reduction to other operating expenses.
Loyalty schemes
The Group operates loyalty programmes which allow members 
to accumulate points on purchases and receive exclusive offers 
and other benefits. Pursuant to IFRIC 13 Customer Loyalty 
Programmes, the fair value of the points awarded to customers 
is accounted for as a separately identifiable component of a sales 
transaction. For every loyalty transaction, points are earned 
and the value of those points is estimated. Revenue is deferred 
to match the estimated value of earned loyalty points. Deferred 
revenue is adjusted for the value of points that are not expected to 
be redeemed by customers based on historical redemption rates.
When the points are redeemed and the Group fulfils its 
obligations pursuant to the programmes, the revenue that was 
deferred is recognised. 
In the UK, points awarded expire following a period of 12 months 
of inactivity. In Spain, the points awarded are valid until the end 
of the following calendar year. 
Gift cards and vouchers
Revenue from gift cards and gift vouchers sold by the Group 
is recognised on the redemption of the gift voucher or gift card. 
Monies received represent deferred revenue prior to redemption 
and are disclosed within accruals. The valuation of the accrual 
is adjusted based on amounts relating to outstanding gift card 
balances where redemption is deemed to be remote, calculated 
based on historical redemption and expiry rates, which are 
recognised within revenue. 
Deposits
The Group takes deposits in advance of new releases of 
software titles, hardware consoles and other products. Monies 
received are recorded in deferred revenue until the date of 
release and despatch to the customer at which point the 
revenue is recognised. Deposits are non-refundable in cash and 
the ability to exchange unredeemed deposits typically expires 
12 months after the launch date of the product. Unredeemed 
deposits relating to products that have been launched are 
recognised within revenue using calculations based on 
historical redemption and expiry rates.
Exceptional items
The Group presents as ‘Exceptional items’ on the face of 
the statement of comprehensive income those items which, 
because of their size, nature or expected infrequency of events 
giving rise to them, merit separate presentation to allow the 
users of the financial statements to understand better the 
Group’s financial performance in the period. Examples of items 
that may give rise to disclosure as exceptional items include:
 — Property-related items arising from a material lease 
reorganisation, such as profit or loss on the disposal of 
property, significant lease surrender costs or similar 
contract cancellation costs and impairment charges;
 — Corporate-related costs including refinancing costs, costs 
associated with the issue of equity including IPO-related costs, 
costs relating to the administration of the former GAME Group 
and significant costs relating to acquisitions and disposals;
 — Legal costs or litigation settlements from major claims made 
against or by the Group;
 — Significant restructuring and integration costs including store 
closure costs and major reorganisations within the Group; and
 — Material impairments of intangible assets or property, plant 
and equipment as well as the reversal of such write downs 
or impairments.

Overview Strategic report Governance Results Shareholder information Operating segments
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with 
the internal reporting presented to the Group’s chief operating 
decision maker. The Group’s operating segments are UK Retail, 
Spain Retail and Events, Esports & Digital.
Inter-segment revenue and expenses represent items eliminated 
on aggregation and are accounted for on an arm’s-length basis. 
Foreign currencies
The presentational currency of the Group is Pounds Sterling 
because that is the currency of the primary economic 
environment in which the Group operates. The functional 
currency of Group companies is Pounds Sterling other than 
Game Stores Iberia SLU for which it is the Euro.
In preparing the financial information of each Group entity, 
transactions in currencies other than the entity’s functional 
currency (foreign currencies) are recognised at the rates of 
exchange prevailing at the dates of the transactions. At each 
reporting period end, monetary assets and liabilities that are 
denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the 
rates prevailing on the balance sheet date. 
For the purpose of presenting consolidated financial 
information, income and expense items are translated at the 
average exchange rates for the period. The assets and liabilities 
of the Group’s foreign operations are translated at exchange 
rates prevailing on the balance sheet date. All resulting 
exchange differences are recognised in other comprehensive 
income. On the disposal of a foreign subsidiary, the cumulative 
translation differences that were recognised in equity are 
recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.
Interest income
Interest income is recognised by applying the effective interest 
rate, except for short-term receivables when the recognition 
of interest would be immaterial.
Finance costs
Interest payable is charged to the statement of comprehensive 
income as incurred.
Dividend distribution
Dividends proposed by the Board but unpaid at the period end 
are not recognised in the financial statements until they have 
been approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting. 
Interim dividends are recognised when paid. 
Business combinations
Acquisitions of subsidiaries and businesses are accounted for 
using the acquisition method. The consideration transferred 
for the acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair values of the assets 
transferred, the liabilities incurred to the former owners of the 
acquiree and the equity interests issued by the Group in 
exchange for control of the acquiree. The consideration 
transferred includes the fair value of any asset or liability 
resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement. 
Acquisition-related costs are recognised in the statement 
of comprehensive income as incurred. 
Goodwill is measured as the excess of the sum of the 
consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling 
interest in the acquiree, and the fair value of the acquirer’s 
previously held equity interest in the acquiree (if any) over 
the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired.
Where a business combination is achieved in stages, the 
Group’s previously-held interests in the acquired entity are 
re-measured to fair value at the acquisition date (i.e. the date 
the Group attains control) and the resulting gain or loss, if any, 
is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.
Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the Group 
is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. Changes 
in the fair value of the contingent consideration that qualify as 
measurement period adjustments are adjusted retrospectively, 
with corresponding adjustments against goodwill. Contingent 
consideration that is classified as an asset or liability is 
re-measured at subsequent reporting dates in accordance with 
IAS 39 with the corresponding gain or loss recognised in profit 
or loss. Contingent consideration that is classified as equity is 
not re-measured and its subsequent settlement is accounted 
for within equity.
If the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete 
by the end of the reporting period in which the combination 
occurs, the Group reports provisional amounts for the items for 
which the accounting is incomplete. Those provisional amounts 
are adjusted during the re-measurement period or additional 
assets or liabilities are recognised to reflect new information 
obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the 
acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the amounts 
recognised as of that date. The measurement period is the 
period from the date of acquisition to the date the Group obtains 
complete information and is subject to a maximum of one year.
Investments in associates
Associates are all entities over which the Group has significant 
influence but not control, generally accompanying a shareholding 
of between 20% and 50% of the voting rights. Investments in 
associates are accounted for using the equity method of 
accounting whereby the investment is initially recognised at 
cost, and the carrying amount is increased or decreased to 
recognise the share of profit or loss after the date of acquisition.
The Group’s share of post-acquisition profit or loss and 
movements in other comprehensive income are recognised in 
the statement of comprehensive income with a corresponding 
adjustment to the carrying amount of the investment.
The Group determines at each reporting date whether there 
is any objective evidence that the investment in the associate 
is impaired.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less 
accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment loss.
ACCOUNTING POLICIES OF THE GROUP
CONTINUED
124
GAME Digital plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Depreciation is provided to write off the cost less estimated 
residual values of all property (other than freehold land), plant 
and equipment, on a straight-line basis, over their expected 
useful lives: 
 — Improvements to leasehold property – over the lesser of 
the remaining period of the lease or 5 years for longer leases 
 — Freehold property – 50 years
 — Fixtures, fittings and equipment – 3 to 10 years
 — Computer hardware – 3 to 5 years
The estimated useful lives, residual values and depreciation 
method are reviewed at the end of each reporting period, 
with the effect of any changes in estimate accounted for 
on a prospective basis.
Assets under construction are recorded as property, plant 
and equipment and are transferred to the appropriate asset 
category when completed, and depreciated from that date.
Intangible assets – goodwill
Goodwill is initially recognised and measured as set out above.
Goodwill is not amortised but is reviewed annually for 
impairment. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill 
is allocated to the relevant cash-generating units of the Group. 
Goodwill impairment reviews are undertaken annually or more 
frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate a 
potential impairment. If the recoverable amount of the 
cash-generating unit is less than the carrying value of the unit, 
the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying 
amount of any goodwill and then to other assets of the unit. 
An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed 
in a subsequent period.
Intangible assets – software and development costs
The development of software and website costs are accounted 
for as intangible assets where the criteria of IAS 38 Intangible 
Assets have been met. These intangible assets are valued at 
cost and are amortised on a straight-line basis over three years. 
Amortisation is charged to the other operating expenses line in 
the statement of comprehensive income. Intangible assets with 
finite lives are reviewed for impairment if there is any indication 
that the carrying value may not be recoverable. 
Technology assets acquired in a business combination are 
included in the software, development and technology category 
and are amortised on a straight-line basis over five years.
Intangible assets acquired in a business combination
Intangible assets acquired in a business combination and 
recognised separately from goodwill are initially recognised 
at their fair value at the acquisition date. Subsequent to initial 
recognition, intangible assets are reported at initial cost less 
accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. Amortisation 
is calculated on a straight-line basis, over their expected useful 
lives as follows:
 — Brand – 8 to 10 years
 — Customer relationships and contracts – 6 to 8 years
Impairment of non-financial assets
An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is tested for 
impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes 
in circumstances indicate a potential impairment.
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying 
amounts of its property, plant and equipment and intangible 
assets to determine whether there is any indication that those 
assets have suffered an impairment loss. For the purposes of 
assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels 
for which there are largely independent cash flows (cash-
generating units). An impairment loss is recognised for the 
amount by which the asset’s carrying value exceeds its 
recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher 
of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value in use. 
An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately.
Prior impairments of assets (other than goodwill) are reviewed 
for possible reversal at each reporting date. 
Leased assets
Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the 
Group at their fair value or, if lower, at the present value of the 
minimum lease payments, each determined at the inception of 
the lease. The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in 
the statement of financial position as a finance lease obligation.
Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges 
and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a 
constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. 
Finance charges are charged directly to the statement of 
comprehensive income.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the 
statement of comprehensive income on a straight-line basis 
over the term of the relevant lease. In some instances, the 
Group will agree to revenue-based lease agreements where 
a portion of the rent is contingent upon future sales of the store. 
The costs associated with the revenue-based portion of the 
lease are recognised as a period expense within other operating 
expenses. Leases which include minimum agreed uplifts are 
assessed and calculated on entering the lease and spread over 
the term of the lease.
Premiums paid or lease incentives received on the acquisition 
of short leasehold properties are transferred to the statement 
of comprehensive income on a straight-line basis over the 
length of the lease or to a break date that has been exercised 
where relevant.
Assets held for sale
Assets are classified as held for sale when their carrying 
amount is to be recovered principally through a sale transaction 
and a sale is considered highly probable. On classification as 
held for sale, assets are stated at the lower of carrying amount 
and fair value less costs to sell.

GAME Digital plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Overview Strategic report Governance Results Shareholder information Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable 
value. Cost is calculated to include, where applicable, duties, 
handling, transport and other directly attributable costs.
Net realisable value is based on estimated normal selling 
prices less further costs expected to be incurred in selling and 
distribution, with a provision being made against lines identified 
as slow-moving, old or at risk of obsolescence. Where relevant 
future expected supplier contributions are considered when 
assessing net realisable values. A further shrinkage provision 
is made to provide for expected stock loss.
Inventories considered by management to be held on a 
consignment basis remain the property of the supplier and 
hence are not recognised on the Group’s balance sheet.
Taxation
The tax expense for the period comprises current and 
deferred tax.
The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of 
the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance 
sheet date in the countries where the Group operates and 
has taxable income.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable 
on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and 
liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and the 
corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable 
profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability 
method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for 
all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are 
recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits 
will be available against which deductible temporary differences 
can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if 
the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial 
recognition of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that 
affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected 
to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is 
realised based on tax laws and rates that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is 
charged or credited in the statement of comprehensive income, 
except when it relates to items charged or credited in other 
comprehensive income, in which case the deferred tax is also 
dealt with in other comprehensive income.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a 
legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against 
current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes 
levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends 
to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Pension contributions
The Group makes payments to a number of defined contribution 
pension schemes. The assets of these schemes do not form 
part of the assets of the Group. The pension cost charge 
represents contributions payable during the period.
Share-based compensation
Equity-settled share-based payments and equity-settled 
post-acquisition remuneration granted to employees are 
measured at the fair value of the equity instruments at the grant 
date. The fair value excludes the effect of non-market-based 
vesting conditions.
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled 
share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over 
the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of equity 
instruments that will eventually vest. At each balance sheet 
date, the Group revises its estimate of the number of equity 
instruments expected to vest as a result of the effect of market 
and non-market-based vesting conditions. The impact of the 
revision of the original estimates, if any, is recognised in profit 
or loss such that the cumulative expense reflects the revised 
estimate, with a corresponding adjustment to equity reserves.
The social security contributions payable in connection 
with the grant of the share options is considered an integral 
part of the grant itself, and the charge is treated as a 
cash-settled transaction.
Trade receivables
Trade and other receivables are initially recognised at fair value 
and subsequently carried at amortised cost, less provision for 
impairment. To the extent an indicator of impairment is identified, 
a provision for impairment of trade and other receivables is 
established when there is objective evidence that the Group will 
not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original 
terms of the receivables. This provision represents the difference 
between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of 
estimated future cash flows. The amount of the provision is 
recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand, deposits held 
at call with banks and bank overdrafts. Bank overdrafts are 
shown within borrowings in current liabilities on the statement 
of financial position.
Financial assets held at fair value through profit and loss 
(‘FVTPL’)
Financial assets are classified as FVTPL when the financial 
asset is either held for trading or it is designated as at FVTPL.
Derivative financial instruments
Derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value 
on the contract date and are subsequently valued at fair value 
at each reporting date. Changes in the fair value of derivative 
financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting 
are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income 
as they arise.
Trade payables
Trade and other payables are recognised on the trade 
date of the related transactions. Trade payables are not 
interest-bearing and are stated at their nominal value.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES OF THE GROUP
CONTINUED Borrowings
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of 
transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently stated 
at amortised cost, with any difference between the proceeds 
(net of transaction costs) and the redemption value recognised 
in the statement of comprehensive income over the period of 
the borrowings using the effective interest method.
Critical accounting judgements and key sources 
of estimation uncertainty
In the application of the Group’s accounting policies, the 
Directors are required to make judgements, estimates and 
assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and 
liabilities. The estimates and judgements are based on historical 
experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant 
and are reviewed on an on-going basis. Actual results may 
differ from these estimates. 
Critical judgements in applying the Group’s accounting policies
Inventory provisions
As inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable 
value, this requires the estimation of the eventual sales price of 
goods. A high degree of judgement is applied when estimating 
the impact on the carrying value of inventories to take into 
account factors such as slow-moving items, expected future 
supplier support, shrinkage and obsolescence. There is 
uncertainty in the assessment of the provisions because the 
calculations require management to make assumptions and to 
apply judgement regarding inventory ageing, forecast consumer 
demand, the promotional environment and technological 
obsolescence (note 17).
The shrinkage provision involves uncertainty because the 
calculations require management to make assumptions and 
to apply judgement regarding a number of factors, including 
historical results and expectations of current inventory loss trends. 
The quantity, age and condition of inventories are reviewed and 
assessed through the inventory count process undertaken 
throughout the financial period and across the Group.
Loyalty provision and gift card provision
Management calculates the net cost of loyalty rewards issued 
and estimates the amount that will be redeemed. The resulting 
value is recorded as a deduction to revenue and recognised as 
deferred income in the statement of financial position. The key 
judgement used is the estimated redemption rate. Management 
uses historical redemption rates experienced under the loyalty 
programme and continually reviews the methodology and 
assumptions based on developments in redemption patterns. 
Changes in this redemption rate have the effect of increasing or 
decreasing the provision at the reporting date. If the redemption 
rate at the balance sheet date was 5% higher/lower with all 
other variables held constant, the post-tax profit would have 
been £0.4m higher/£0.4m lower.
Provisions for future redemptions of gift cards and gift 
vouchers are estimated by management on the basis of historical 
transactions and redemption patterns. Changes in this 
redemption rate have the effect of increasing or decreasing 
the provision at the reporting date. The key judgement is the 
redemption rate which is calculated based on historic data. 
If the redemption rate at the balance sheet date was 5% higher/
lower with all other variables held constant, the post-tax profit 
would have been £0.4m higher/£0.4m lower.
In the current year, as set out in the Audit and Risk Committee 
Report on page 88, management performed a detailed review 
and recalculation of the loyalty scheme in the UK following 
a reduction in the expiry period in the previous financial year. 
This resulted in additional income being recorded in the current 
period revenue relating to a change in the accounting estimate 
of future expiries.
Supplier funding arrangements
The supplier funding arrangements that the Group has in 
place for rebates, marketing income and other supplier support 
require judgements to be made but are not complex to calculate. 
 — Rebates are recognised in arrears in line with a 
pre-determined formula codified in signed agreements 
with our suppliers.
 — Supplier funding is also received to support stock clearance 
and this can be in the form of upfront funding to allow the 
markdown of a particular stock line which is recorded on 
receipt or retrospective margin support for promotion and 
clearance activity which is recognised as sales of the stock 
are made.
 — Marketing income is conditional on the Group performing 
specified actions or satisfying certain performance 
conditions and is recognised over the period earned and 
when it can be reliably measured. Where this marketing 
income has incremental and identifiable direct costs 
associated with it, it is recognised as a reduction to other 
operating expenses. Marketing income in relation to 
promotional support where no direct costs are incurred 
is recognised as a deduction to cost of sales. This represents 
a change to the classification of this form of supplier funding 
to previous years and the previous period has been restated 
to reflect the reclassification of this income (note 1). 
Key sources of estimation uncertainty
Impairment of goodwill
The Group tests annually whether goodwill has suffered any 
impairment, in accordance with the accounting policy on page 
125. The recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit has 
been determined based on value-in-use calculations. This 
calculation requires the use of estimates (note 15). The key 
estimates include the forecast cash flows, the discount rate 
and growth rate.
Prior period errors
Management identified material differences in two balance 
sheet accounts which related to previous years and an 
adjustment for these prior period errors has been recorded in 
the financial statements (note 1). The quantum of the error to be 
recorded in each financial year required the use of estimates.
127
GAME Digital plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Overview Strategic report Governance Results Shareholder information 1. Prior period restatements
During the period, as part of a detailed review of processes, controls and reconciliations in the UK business, material differences 
were identified in two balance sheet accounts. Further investigation highlighted that the differences related to previous years and 
due to their materiality, require restatement of the results for the 53 week period ended 30 July 2016 as well as the consolidated 
statement of financial position as at 30 July 2016 and at 25 July 2015. 
The first adjustment related to the correction of accruals for stock received but not invoiced of £2.3m in the period ended 25 July 
2015 and a further £0.9m in the period ended 30 July 2016. The second adjustment was for a provision for margin adjustments in 
relation to the sale of preowned goods of £0.9m in the period ended 25 July 2015 and £0.7m in the period ended 30 July 2016. 
The provision relating to the error in margin adjustments was identified and corrections have been made to restate amounts in the 
appropriate accounting periods. In order to recover potentially overpaid VAT on preowned goods, the error will need to be agreed 
with HMRC and as there is currently no certainty over the recoverability of part or all of the error, no receivable balance has been 
recorded in the financial statements. 
In the next financial year, and subject to agreement with HMRC, any amount recovered will be recorded in the statement of 
comprehensive income. Any material recovery will be presented as an exceptional item, subject to the size of the amounts that 
may mean separate presentation and disclosure is required. 
In addition, an exceptional item of £1.4m was recorded in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income in the period 
ended 30 July 2016 for gift card expiries relating to prior periods and other similar items. This was recorded in the 2016 financial 
statements as an exceptional item as it was not considered a material prior period error requiring restatement at the time. 
However, together with the amounts above that have been identified to relate to the period ended 25 July 2015, the previously 
disclosed exceptional item of £1.4m has been reflected in the years to which it relates being the period ended 25 July 2015 and 
earlier financial periods.
In addition to the prior period error, the Group has undertaken a review of all of its supplier funding arrangements and how these 
are reflected in the financial statements. In light of developing accounting practice and other recent guidance and interpretations, 
income received from suppliers in relation to promotional support where there are no directly attributable costs has been 
reclassified from other operating expenses to a deduction within cost of sales with a small proportion recorded as revenue.
A summary of the combined impact of the prior period adjustments as well as the reclassification of certain marketing income 
on the consolidated statement of comprehensive income and consolidated statement of cash flows for the 53 weeks ended 30 July 
2016 as well as the consolidated statement of financial position as at 30 July 2016 and at 25 July 2015 arising from the restatements 
is as follows:

3. Segmental information
The Group’s Chief Executive Officer is the Group’s chief operating decision-maker. Management has determined the operating 
segments based on the information reviewed by the Chief Executive Officer for the purposes of allocating resources and assessing 
performance.
The Group’s Chief Executive Officer considers the business from a geographic perspective for the retail businesses, namely the UK 
(including one store in the Isle of Man) and Spain and these segments are separately managed. 
Recent acquisitions and new business ventures, comprising BELONG, Multiplay (UK) Limited, Ads Reality Limited and Game 
Esports Spain, are presented as a separate segment titled ‘Events, Esports & Digital’. The performance of this segment is reviewed 
separately by the Chief Executive Officer, the activities are different to those of the retail segments and significant growth is 
expected in the next few years.
The Group’s Chief Executive Officer assesses the performance of the operating segments based on Gross Transaction Value, 
Revenue and Adjusted EBITDA defined as follows: 
 — Gross Transaction Value is a non-IFRS measure defined as total retail receipts and all other Group revenue excluding VAT and 
before the deduction of revenue deferral relating to loyalty points and other accounting adjustments. Gross Transaction Value 
reflects the full retail sales value of digital sales, agency sales (including sales by business partners on GAME’s Marketplace 
website), warranties and other similar arrangements and thereby includes the publishers’ and sellers’ shares of those 
transactions. Gross Transaction Value provides the most reliable measure of activity in an environment where more sales 
are expected to move from physical to digital. 
 — Revenue is measured in a manner consistent with that in the statement of comprehensive income.
 — The Group defines Adjusted EBITDA as operating profit before depreciation and amortisation, exceptional and adjusting 
items (note 5). Adjusted EBITDA is a supplemental measure of the Group’s performance and liquidity that is not required 
to be presented in accordance with IFRS.
The segment information provided to the Chief Executive Officer for the reportable segments is as follows:

reduction in the expiry period in the previous financial year. This resulted in a lower deduction for loyalty point redemptions being 
recorded in the current period revenue relating to a change in the accounting estimate of future expiries.
Other accounting adjustments comprise movements in provisions and estimates (including accounting for gift card, returns and 
deposits), other revenue for the Core Retail segment and marketing income (note 1).

The Group defines exceptional items as per the accounting policy. Certain items that do not meet the definition of exceptional, 
but in management’s view are not reflective of underlying trading, are presented as adjusting items, when calculating non-GAAP 
performance measures, namely Adjusted EBITDA (note 3) and Adjusted Earnings per Share (note 13).

Other exceptional income: gain on sale of freehold property 6.3 –
Redundancy and reorganisation costs – (0.5)
Total 6.3 (0.5)
On 7 October 2016 the Group sold its freehold property interest in the distribution centre and head office buildings located in 
Basingstoke, UK, and entered into an immediate leaseback of these premises. The total cash consideration was £13.5m less 
transaction costs of £0.2m resulting in an exceptional gain of £6.3m. 
Redundancy and reorganisation costs were associated with the implementation of the organisational redesign for the UK 
businesses in the previous period to ensure they were structured and resourced to drive future growth opportunities and to realise 
savings opportunities.
Adjusting items in the period are as follows:

Brand and other acquired intangibles amortisation 9.6 9.1

Cost of IPO-related share-based payment compensation (note 28) 0.2 –
Costs relating to the acquisition of Ads Reality – 0.5
Impairment relating to the acquisition of Ads Reality (note 16) – 0.1
Total adjusting items 12.0 12.4
Brand amortisation arose in the UK on the purchase of the trade and assets from the former GAME Group plc and in Spain 
on consolidation of the company. Following the acquisition of Multiplay (UK) Limited and Ads Reality, the separately identifiable 
intangible assets were capitalised, including brand value, customer relationships and contracts and technology, and amortised 
over their useful lives. These amortisation charges are recurring costs to the Group and therefore not classified as exceptional, 
however, as they are significant non-cash items and are not reflective of the underlying trading of the business they are presented 
as adjusting items.
Post-acquisition remuneration relates to cash and shares payable to certain selling shareholders agreed at the time of the 
acquisition of Multiplay (UK) Limited and this cost is in addition to recurring annual remuneration for these employees. Similar 
post-acquisition remuneration is also payable, subject to certain performance criteria, in shares or cash to certain senior 
management of Ads Reality and is in addition to recurring annual remuneration for these employees.
One-off awards of ordinary shares were made in conjunction with the IPO in June 2014. The share-based payments charge and 
associated costs in respect of these awards are presented within adjusting items due to the nature of the awards. Subsequent 
annual awards are included within operating expenses as they are a recurring cost to the Group.
Legal and professional fees associated with the acquisition of Ads Reality and impairment of the investment are not deemed 
significant enough to meet the definition of exceptional items. However, as the costs are acquisition related and not part of the 
underlying trading of the business they are classified as adjusting.

Impairment tests for goodwill
Goodwill is allocated to the Group’s cash-generating units (‘CGUs’) identified according to the operating segments. All goodwill 
relates to the Events, Esports & Digital segment as follows:

Multiplay (UK) Limited 8.5 8.5
Ads Reality 0.2 0.2
Game Esports Spain 0.6 0.6
Total 9.3 9.3
Goodwill is tested annually for impairment. The recoverable amount of each CGU has been determined from value-in-use 
calculations. 
The key assumptions for the value-in-use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and pre-tax cash flow 
projections which are derived from the most recent financial budget and forecast approved by management for the next three 
years. The cash flow projections are those by which the recoverable amount of the CGU is most sensitive given the early stages of 
growth of these businesses. Cash flows beyond the three year period are extrapolated using the estimated growth rate of between 
0% and 1.7% (2016: 2.2%). The growth rates do not exceed the long-term average growth rates for the UK or Spain.

GAME Digital plc

Overview Strategic report Governance Results Shareholder information The pre-tax discount rate which has been applied in determining the value-in-use is between 15.0% and 15.59% (2016: 15.59%).
The Group has conducted sensitivity analysis on the impairment test for the Multiplay (UK) Limited CGU. A 66% reduction in the 
pre-tax cash flow projections would cause the carrying value of goodwill to equal its recoverable amount. No sensitivity analysis 
has been performed on the Game Esports Spain and Ads Reality CGUs as the goodwill balances are not material to the Group.

The cost of inventories, net of rebates, recognised as an expense and included in cost of sales amounted to £578.3m 
(2016 Restated: £616.9m).
The Directors consider that the replacement value of inventories is not materially different from their carrying value. There are no 
individual items of inventory held at fair value less costs to sell. The stock provision as at 29 July 2017 of £5.9m (2016: £5.1m) is an 
estimate of the difference between the cost of stock and its estimated net realisable value. There has been no material reversal of 
provisions made in the previous period and previous write-downs have been reversed where the inventory has been sold in the period.
The majority of mint inventory purchased is subject to retention of title when delivered and this is released (subject to certain 
‘all monies’ conditions in some agreements) when the inventory is paid for. The asset-based revolving loan facility provided 
by PNC and Wells Fargo was secured by way of a floating charge over all inventory of Game Retail Limited (note 24).

The other classes within trade and other receivables do not contain impaired assets.
The fair values of trade and other receivables are the same as book values due to the negligible credit risk associated with these

Cash-settled equity forward – 0.2
On IPO in June 2014, the Group created the Virtual Loyalty Share Plan whereby 20,000 of the Group’s most loyal customers in 
the UK were offered virtual shares in the Company. These shares could be redeemed for loyalty points at certain times over a three 
year period at the market value of the shares on that date. At the same time, Game Retail Limited entered into a derivative contract 
with HSBC, the cash-settled equity forward, in order to finance and hedge its liabilities under the Virtual Loyalty Share Plan. 
When customers redeemed their Virtual Loyalty Shares over the three year period, HSBC would reduce the number of Ordinary 
Shares it held by the same amount and pay to Game Retail Limited the proceeds at the market price at that date.
The cash-settled equity forward was recognised at fair value through profit and loss and classified as a Level 1 financial asset 
in accordance with the fair value hierarchy as its value was derived from the Company’s share price which is publicly available. 
The Virtual Loyalty Share Plan ended in June 2017 and the cash-settled equity forward contract has been settled in full.

Financial risk management
The main risks arising from the Group’s activities are market risk (primarily foreign exchange risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. 
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks, and risk management is controlled by the finance 
functions in the UK and Spain.
It is, and has been throughout the period under review, the Group’s policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.

Trade and other payables excludes the gift card liabilities and loyalty liabilities as detailed in note 22.
The Directors consider that the carrying amounts of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded at amortised cost in the 
financial statements approximate their fair values.
Market risk
The Group operates autonomously with respect to trading in the UK and Spain and therefore does not carry any material exposure 
to foreign currency exchange movements in respect of its trading activities. 
The Group is exposed to currency exposures on the Euro on the translation of the investment and the results of its Spanish 
subsidiary and no hedging is carried out to manage this exposure.
Credit risk
Credit risk on trade and other receivables is minimised as the Group trades only with recognised, creditworthy third parties. 
At the end of the reporting period there were no concentrations of credit risk.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is represented by the carrying value of the financial assets in the 
statement of financial position.
The Group does not have any significant credit risk exposure to any single counterparty or any group of counterparties having 
similar characteristics. The Group defines counterparties as having similar characteristics if they are related entities. 
Liquidity risk
The Group’s policy on liquidity is to ensure that there is sufficient cash, working capital and committed borrowing facilities to 
meet the Group’s medium-term funding requirements. Cash flow forecasting is performed by each trading entity and consolidated 
centrally to manage the Group’s overall position.
The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate cash reserves, banking facilities and other financing or similar 
arrangements, by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows, and by matching the maturity profiles of financial 
assets and liabilities.

Floating rate Sterling bank borrowings – –
Floating rate Euro bank borrowings – 5.7
On 15 July 2016, the Company (as guarantor), its subsidiary Game Retail Limited (as borrower) and certain other subsidiaries of the 
Company (each as guarantors) entered into an asset-backed loan facility with PNC Financial Services UK Limited and Wells Fargo 
Capital Finance (UK) Limited in an aggregate amount of £50.0m and an additional £25.0m available for a number of weeks annually 
over the peak Christmas period, expiring on 31 December 2020. If utilised the interest rate on drawn funds is 2.5% per annum plus 
LIBOR. This facility has not been utilised in the year and no drawdowns were made.
The Spanish subsidiary reviewed and renewed its overdraft and commercial credit guarantees with BBVA, Bankia, Banco 
Santander and Caixa Bank S.A. throughout the period and had an aggregate facility of €30.0m (2016: €49.650m) at the balance 
sheet date. These facilities expire in October 2017 (2016: between January to July 2017). The overdraft facility incurs interest on 
drawn funds of between 2.0% and 3.0% per annum above Euribor 90 and the bank guarantees incur interest on committed 
amounts at a maximum of 1.0% per annum. The facilities also incur a quarterly commitment fee of 0.1%.
(b) Currency of cash balances
The currency exposure of the Group’s floating rate net cash balances is shown below:

£m
Sterling 31.1 37.5
Euro 15.9 5.5
US Dollar 0.2 0.1
47.2 43.1
(c) Sensitivity analysis
The Group’s principal funding facilities during the period were an asset-backed loan facility of up to £50.0m in the UK and an 
overdraft and commercial credit guarantees of up to €49.65m in Spain. The interest on drawn balances attracts a floating rate 
interest. The overdraft and commercial credit guarantees were utilised in Spain during the period and a 1% increase in the floating 
interest rate would have increased interest payable on drawn balances in the period by £0.1m (2016: £0.1m).
Foreign currency risk management
The Group had no material monetary assets or liabilities that are not denominated in the functional currency of the Company and 
each subsidiary. Forward currency contracts are entered into on an ad hoc basis to manage foreign currency payments and there 
were no open contracts at the period end (2016: £nil).
The Group has one Euro denominated subsidiary whose net assets are exposed to foreign currency translation risk. No hedging 
is carried out to manage this exposure although the Group operates a dividend policy ensuring surplus cash is remitted to the UK 
thereby minimising the impact of exchange volatility.
The Group’s main foreign exchange exposure is to the Euro and US Dollar. If at the balance sheet date the Pound had weakened/
strengthened by 15% (2016: 15%) against these currencies with all other variables held constant, post-tax profit would have been 
£0.1m higher/£0.1m lower (2016: £0.2m higher/£0.4m lower). Management consider 15% to be a reasonable sensitivity threshold 
based on the fluctuations in the exchange rate in the financial period.
Capital risk management
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern in order to 
provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders, and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the 
cost of capital.
The capital structure of the Group consists of cash and cash equivalents, borrowings and equity attributable to equity holders of 
the parent company, comprising issued capital, reserves and the retained deficit as disclosed in the statement of changes in equity.

equivalents to meet short-term requirements. The capital structure of the Group can also be maintained or adjusted by adjusting

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current 
tax liabilities and when the deferred tax relates to the same fiscal authorities.

Deferred tax assets are recognised for tax losses to the extent that the realisation of the related tax benefit through future taxable 
profits is probable. The Group has not recognised deferred tax assets of £3.2m (2016: £0.1m) in respect of losses amounting to 
£18.6m (2016: £0.6m) that can be carried forward against future taxable income.
Deferred tax liabilities are not recognised on unremitted earnings of the Spanish subsidiary as the dividends by which these 
are remitted are expected to be tax exempt. Unremitted earnings totalled £36.0m (2016: £27.9m) at the balance sheet date.

All IPO awards including the SIP were not paid for by the Company or the Employee Benefit Trust (‘EBT’) and were designed to be 
one-off IPO-related incentives. The share-based payments charge in the accounts in respect of these awards has been excluded 
from Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EPS calculations, in line with the treatment of other one-off IPO-related costs in the previous 
financial period.
Shares held in the EBT and SIP Trust
The EBT was established to hold and purchase shares on behalf of the Company, in connection with the obligation to satisfy current 
and future share awards under the PSP and any other employee incentive schemes. The SIP Trust was established to hold and 
purchase shares on behalf of the Company for the benefit of employees, in connection with the SIP.
The EBT has waived its rights to receive dividends on any shares held by them, unless otherwise instructed by the Company, 
if required by the terms of an employee share scheme, or by reference to other requirements set out in the EBT Trust Deed. 
The Company may direct that the Trustees can vote at any general meeting. If the Trustees do vote, the Company cannot direct 
the manner in which the Trustees votes. In the absence of such circumstances, the Trustees of the EBT will abstain from voting 
at any general meeting. 
On certain awards granted under the PSP in previous periods, participants are entitled to any dividends paid during the vesting 
period, to the extent the awards vest. The expected amount of these payments has been included within employee costs in 
operating expenses.

Performance share plan
The following awards have been made under the PSP:
1. Director and Senior Manager IPO Awards
Nil cost options were granted to the CEO of the Company and one other senior manager within the Group (‘Director and Senior 
Manager IPO Awards’) on IPO in June 2014 for which there was a vesting period of 36 months at the end of which these options 
would vest, provided certain performance conditions were satisfied. The performance conditions that these options were subject 
to was continued employment and absolute growth in Total Shareholder Return (‘TSR’) from the IPO Offer Price as follows:
 — 50% will vest for absolute growth of 75% (being equivalent to a compound annual growth rate of approximately 20.5% per 
annum); and
 — 100% will vest for absolute growth of 100% (being equivalent to a compound annual growth rate of approximately 26% per 
annum), with straight-line vesting between these two points. 
The TSR performance condition was not met in June 2017 and these options lapsed.

there was a vesting period of 12 months for part of the award and a vesting period of 24 months for the remainder of the award, 
at the end of which the Senior Employee IPO Awards vested. The Senior Employee IPO Awards were not subject to performance 
conditions other than continued employment.

of between 30 and 36 months (2016: 18 and 36 months) and at the end of these periods options will vest or lapse. All awards are

for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.
Share incentive plan
The SIP is an HMRC approved scheme open to all UK employees at the date of invitation. During the financial period ended 
26 July 2014 the plan made an award of free shares under the SIP to participating employees, with individual values being 
pro-rated on salary and length of service. No further awards have been made in subsequent financial periods. 
There are no performance conditions other than remaining in employment for three years from the date of award in June 2014. 
Shares are held in the GAME Digital plc Share Incentive Plan Trust (the ‘SIP Trust’) for at least three years and are capable of being 
released to participants at any time thereafter.

Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Overview Strategic report Governance Results Shareholder information Equity-settled post-acquisition remuneration
Deferred post-acquisition remuneration comprising 2,079,002 ordinary shares in the Company, valued at £5.0m on a five-day 
average from 24 March 2015, will be payable to certain selling shareholders of Multiplay (UK) Limited subject to their remaining 
in employment with the Group for three years from the acquisition date of 2 March 2015. The earn-out payments are accounted 
for within share-based payments in the statement of comprehensive income as the services are provided and classified as 
post-acquisition remuneration in other operating expenses (note 5).
Deferred post-acquisition remuneration totalling £2.0m and to be settled by the issue of shares may be payable to certain former 
directors of Ads Reality subject to their remaining in employment with the Group for two years from the acquisition date and 
satisfying certain performance conditions. The earn-out payments are accounted for within share-based payments in the statement 
of comprehensive income as the services are provided and classified as post-acquisition remuneration in other operating expenses 
(note 5). Management have determined that the performance criteria are unlikely to be met and hence the charge recorded to date 
has been reversed. Further post-acquisition remuneration up to a maximum of £16.0m is payable subject to continuing employment 
and satisfying certain performance conditions and profit targets over a five year period from the acquisition date. Management 
have determined that at this early stage in the development of the business, payment is not probable and hence no amounts 
have been recognised in the financial statements.
29. Equity reserves
Share premium account
The share premium account represents amounts received in excess of the nominal value of shares on issue of new shares, 
net of the direct costs associated with issuing those shares. 
Merger reserve
On 11 June 2014 the Group was listed on the Premium Listing segment of the Official List of the UK Listing Authority and trading 
on the main market of the London Stock Exchange following a reorganisation implemented by way of a share-for-share exchange 
made by the Company for the shares of Game Digital Holdings Limited. As the Group had been formed through a reorganisation 
in which GAME Digital plc became a new parent entity of the Group, the consolidated financial statements were prepared as a 
continuation of the existing Group using the pooling of interests method (or merger accounting). 
Merger accounting principles for this combination gave rise to a merger reserve of £130.9m.
Cumulative translation reserve
The translation reserve is used to record exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial statements of foreign 
subsidiaries.
Other reserve
The other reserve represents the value of share capital and share premium to be issued in future periods relating to deferred 
equity-settled post-acquisition remuneration payable on recent acquisitions (note 28).

Operating lease commitments relate primarily to land and buildings, being the Group’s retail stores, head office buildings and 
distribution centres. The Group focuses on maintaining a flexible lease profile across the store estate hence there are few store 
leases longer than five years. Following the sale and leaseback of the UK head office and distribution centre buildings in October 
2016 on a 17 year lease and initial annual rent of £1.06m, future lease payments later than five years have increased significantly 
in the current period.

At the balance sheet date the contingent rent accrued was £0.2m (2016: £0.4m). 
31. Related party transactions
Transactions between the Company and its subsidiaries, which are related parties, have been eliminated on consolidation.
Transactions with related parties
In the previous period Game Retail Limited received software and development services from Paperclip Mobile Limited, a company 
in which the Group had a 3% holding (note 16). The fees paid for these services amounted to £0.1m and services were discontinued 
in May 2016 when the Group acquired the trade and assets of Paperclip Mobile Limited. 
Game Stores Iberia SLU has a lease agreement for a property in which a member of key management owns 50% of the ordinary 
share capital of the lessor company. The annual rent is £0.1m and the lease term is for a period of five years from June 2015, 
however the lessee can terminate the lease at any time by providing three months’ notice.
There were no amounts (2016: £nil) owed by or to related parties at the end of the financial period.
On 20 April 2016, the Company, its subsidiary Game Retail Limited (as borrower) and certain other subsidiaries of the Company 
entered into an asset-backed revolving loan facility of up to £100.0m with Lajedosa Investments S.à r.l., a related party. Lajedosa 
Investments S.à r.l. is an associate of Duodi Investments S.à r.l. which is a related party of the Company by virtue of holding 
approximately 42.98% of the Company’s ordinary share capital. No amount had been drawn under this facility up to the period end 
date. The cost to the Group of this facility should it be activated is a commitment fee of 0.5% per annum on the undrawn committed 
amount and interest on drawn funds of 5.5% per annum above LIBOR. The facility was not extended by the Company during the 
year and it expired on 31 October 2017.
Remuneration of key management personnel
The Group made payments regarding the remuneration of key management personnel as defined in the Strategic report.

STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS OF THE COMPANY
FOR THE 52 WEEKS ENDED 29 JULY 2017 Basis of preparation
The Company’s accounting reference date is 31 July. The 
Company draws up its financial statements for the accounting 
period ended on the Saturday directly before or following the 
accounting reference date, as permitted by section 390 (3) 
of the Companies Act 2006. 
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance 
with IFRS and IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRS IC) 
interpretations as adopted by the European Union and in 
accordance with the Companies Act 2006 applicable to 
companies reporting under IFRS.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical 
cost basis, except for the revaluation of certain financial 
instruments that are measured at fair values at the end of each 
reporting period, as explained in the accounting policies below. 
Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the 
consideration given in exchange for goods and services. 
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below 
and have been applied consistently through the period and 
the preceding period.
Critical accounting judgements and key sources 
of estimation uncertainty
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with 
IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates 
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and 
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported 
amounts of income and expenses during the reporting period.
Significant items subject to such assumptions and estimates 
include the carrying value of investments. The most critical 
accounting policies in determining the financial condition and 
results of the Company are those requiring the greatest degree 
of subjective or complex judgements. 
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on 
historical experience and various other factors that are believed 
to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which 
form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values 
of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other 
sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The critical accounting judgement is the interest rate applied to 
record the long-term loan to a subsidiary undertaking at amortised 
cost (note 4). There are no key sources of estimation uncertainty.
Standards affecting the financial statements
Adoption of new and revised standards
The following new and revised standards and interpretations are 
relevant to the Company and have been adopted for the first time 
for the financial period. Their adoption has not had any significant 
impact on the amounts reported in the financial statements:
 — Annual Improvements 2012-2014 Cycle
 — Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements
 — Amendments to IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial 
Statements
 — Amendments to IFRS 11 Acquisitions of Interests in Joint 
Operations
There are no other IFRSs or IFRIC interpretations that 
are effective and have a material impact on the Company.
A number of new standards, amendments to standards and 
interpretations are effective for periods beginning on or after 
30 July 2017, and have not been applied in preparing these 
consolidated financial statements. None of these are expected 
to have a significant effect on the consolidated financial 
statements of the Company:
 — Annual Improvements 2014-2016 Cycle
 — Amendments to IAS 7 Cash Flow Statements
 — Amendments to IAS 12 Income Taxes
 — Amendments to IFRS 2 Share-based Payment
 — IFRS 9 Financial Instruments
 — IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers
 — IFRS 16 Leases
 — IFRIC 22 Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance 
Consideration
 — IFRIC 23 Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments
There are no other IFRSs or IFRIC interpretations that are not 
yet effective that would be expected to have a material impact 
on the Company.
Going concern
The Company’s business activities, together with factors 
which potentially affect its future development, performance or 
position, can be found in the Strategic Report on pages 6 to 63 
and the Directors’ Report on pages 104 to 108.
The Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company 
has adequate financial resources to ensure it continues to 
operate for a period of not less than 12 months from the 
approval of the financial statements. In reaching their 
conclusion the Directors have carefully considered the cash 
resources and financing facilities available to the Company 
and Group and have reviewed budgets and forecasts including 
downside sensitivities. Given this information the Directors have 
adopted the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the 
financial statements.
Significant accounting policies
Foreign currencies
The presentational and functional currency of the Company 
is Pounds Sterling because that is the currency of the primary 
economic environment in which the Company operates.
In preparing the financial information of the Company, 
transactions in currencies other than the entity’s functional 
currency are recognised at the rates of exchange prevailing 
at the dates of the transactions. At each reporting period end, 
monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign 
currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the 
balance sheet date. 
Interest income
Interest income is recognised by applying the effective interest 
rate, except for short-term receivables when the recognition 
of interest would be immaterial.

GAME Digital plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2017
ACCOUNTING POLICIES OF THE COMPANY Dividend distribution
Dividends proposed by the Board but unpaid at the period end 
are not recognised in the financial statements until they have 
been approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting. 
Interim dividends are recognised when paid. 
Investments
Fixed asset investments in subsidiaries are shown at cost 
less provision for impairment reviewed annually on the 
reporting date.
Taxation
The tax expense for the period comprises current and 
deferred tax.
The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis 
of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the 
balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable 
on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and 
liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax 
bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is 
accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. Deferred 
tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary 
differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent 
that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against 
which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such 
assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary 
difference arises from the initial recognition of other assets and 
liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor 
the accounting profit.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected 
to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is 
realised based on tax laws and rates that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is 
charged or credited in the statement of comprehensive income, 
except when it relates to items charged or credited in other 
comprehensive income, in which case the deferred tax is also 
dealt with in other comprehensive income.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a 
legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against 
current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes 
levied by the same taxation authority and the Company intends 
to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Pension contributions
The Company makes payments to a defined contribution 
pension scheme. The assets of this scheme do not form part of 
the assets of the Company. The pension cost charge represents 
contributions payable during the period.
Share-based compensation
Equity-settled share-based payments to employees are 
measured at the fair value of the equity instruments at the grant 
date. The fair value excludes the effect of non-market-based 
vesting conditions. Details regarding the determination of the 
fair value of equity-settled share-based transactions are set 
out in note 9.
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled 
share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over 
the vesting period, based on the Company’s estimate of equity 
instruments that will eventually vest. At each balance sheet 
date, the Company revises its estimate of the number of equity 
instruments expected to vest as a result of the effect of 
non-market-based vesting conditions. The impact of the 
revision of the original estimates, if any, is recognised in profit 
or loss such that the cumulative expense reflects the revised 
estimate, with a corresponding adjustment to equity reserves.
When employees of the Company’s subsidiary companies are 
issued equity-settled compensation awards over shares in the 
Company, the Company recognises an increase in the value 
of its investment in the subsidiary and an increase in reserves. 
The social security contributions payable in connection 
with the grant of the share options is considered an integral 
part of the grant itself, and the charge is treated as a 
cash-settled transaction.
Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables are initially recognised at fair value 
and subsequently carried at amortised cost, less provision for 
impairment. To the extent an indicator of impairment is identified, 
a provision for impairment of trade and other receivables is 
established when there is objective evidence that the Company 
will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the 
original terms of the receivables. This provision represents the 
difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present 
value of estimated future cash flows. The amount of the provision 
is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand, deposits held 
at call with banks and bank overdrafts. 
Trade and other payables
Trade and other payables are recognised on the trade date of 
the related transactions. Trade payables are not interest-bearing 
and are stated at their nominal value.

The £1.4m (2016: £2.5m) addition in the period reflects the 
increase in the value of the investment for equity-settled 
compensation awards recorded in the Company’s subsidiary 
undertakings as detailed in the share-based compensation 
accounting policy. In the previous year an additional investment 
was made in Game Digital Holdings Limited of £29.0m.
The Directors believe that the carrying value of fixed asset

Within amounts owed by group undertakings, a long-term loan

interest at a rate of 0% and is repayable on or before 21 June 
2031 (2016: 21 June 2031). This receivable is recognised on an 
amortised cost basis of £12.6m (2016: £12.0m) and the fair value 
was determined using an interest rate for similar borrowings 
within the GAME Group. The remaining balance of £0.3m (2016: 
£nil) is unsecured, interest free and is repayable on demand.
The fair values of trade and other receivables are the same as 
the book values due to the negligible credit risk associated with 
these assets and their short duration.

6. Financial instruments
Financial risk management
The Directors of the Company are responsible for financial 
risk management. The main risks arising from the Company’s 
activities are liquidity risk, market risk (primarily foreign 
exchange risk) and credit risk. The Directors review and agree 
policies for managing each of these risks, and risk management 
is controlled by the finance function in the UK.
It is, and has been throughout the period under review, the 
Company’s policy that no trading in financial instruments shall 
be undertaken.

The Directors consider that the carrying amounts of financial 
assets and financial liabilities recorded at amortised cost in the 
financial statements approximate their fair values.
Market risk
The Company operates in the UK and therefore does not carry 
any material exposure to foreign currency exchange movements 
in respect of its activities except on the translation of monetary 
assets and liabilities denominated in Euro. 
Credit risk
The Company does not enter into derivatives contracts to manage 
its credit risk.
With respect to credit risk arising from financial assets of the 
Company which comprise trade and other receivables and cash 
at bank, the Company’s exposure to credit risk arises from the 
default of the counterparty with a maximum exposure equal 
to the carrying amount of these instruments.
Liquidity risk
The Directors seek to maintain sufficient liquid assets to settle 
liabilities as they fall due.
(a) Cash balances
All cash balances are held in interest-bearing Sterling bank 
accounts.
(b) Sensitivity analysis
The Company has not performed sensitivity analysis as it is not 
exposed to any currency or interest fluctuations.
Capital risk management
The Company’s objectives when managing capital are to 
safeguard the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern 
and retain sufficient funds to continue to invest and grow its 
activities whilst providing appropriate returns for shareholders 
and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal 
capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.

Details of options granted under the Company’s share schemes

9. Share-based payments
The Company has established a performance share plan (the ‘PSP’). 
One-off awards of ordinary shares were made in conjunction with 
the IPO in June 2014 under the PSP and further awards under the 
PSP have been made in subsequent financial periods. 
The charge recognised in the statement of comprehensive 
income for share-based payments and associated costs in the 
period is £0.3m (2016: £nil) and £0.3m (2016: £0.3m) has been 
recorded in equity.
Shares held in the EBT
The EBT was established to hold and purchase shares on behalf 
of the Company, in connection with the obligation to satisfy 
current and future share awards under the PSP and any other 
employee incentive schemes. 
The EBT has waived its rights to receive dividends on any shares 
held by them, unless otherwise instructed by the Company, 
if required by the terms of an employee share scheme, or by 
reference to other requirements set out in the EBT Trust Deed. 
The Company may direct that the Trustee can vote at any 
general meeting. If the Trustee does vote, the Company cannot 
direct the manner in which the Trustee votes. In the absence of 
such circumstances, the Trustees of the EBT will abstain from 
voting at any general meeting.
On certain awards granted under the PSP in previous periods, 
participants are entitled to any dividends paid during the vesting 
period, to the extent the awards vest. The expected amount of 
these payments has been included within employee costs in 
operating expenses.
As at the balance sheet date, the EBT held 880,989 (2016: 880,989) 
ordinary shares of 1p each.
Performance share plan
The following awards have been made under the PSP:
1. Director and Senior Manager IPO Awards
Nil cost options were granted to the CEO of the Company and 
one other senior manager within the Group (‘Director and Senior 
Manager IPO Awards’) on IPO in June 2014 for which there was 
a vesting period of 36 months at the end of which these options 
would vest, provided certain performance conditions were 
satisfied. The performance conditions that these options were 
subject to was continued employment and absolute growth in Total 
Shareholder Return (‘TSR’) from the IPO Offer Price as follows:
 — 50% will vest for absolute growth of 75% (being equivalent to 
a compound annual growth rate of approximately 20.5% per 
annum); and
 — 100% will vest for absolute growth of 100% (being equivalent 
to a compound annual growth rate of approximately 26% per 
annum), with straight-line vesting between these two points.

estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise 
restrictions, and behavioural considerations.
