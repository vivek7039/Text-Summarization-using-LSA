Chairman’s Statement
B
loomsbury has delivered a robust 
performance over the year to  
28 February 2017. Group revenue 
is up 15% (9% at constant currencies) and 
profit before taxation and highlighted 
items after incurring the development 
costs for new digital content products 
is £12.0 million (2016: £13.0 million), 
above market expectations. The Board 
is recommending a final dividend of 5.6 
pence per share to shareholders on the 
register on 25 August 2017. This represents an increase in full year 
dividend of 5% and continues Bloomsbury’s dividend growth each 
year for over 20 years.
The past year was Bloomsbury’s 30th and the 23rd year of listing on 
the London Stock Exchange. Looking back to the time of the 1994 
listing, the proposition was to be a medium–sized independent 
publisher of works of the highest literary and commercial 
quality. Although much has changed in publishing since then, 
Bloomsbury remains true to its original publishing mission. The 
current evolutionary phase is the digital resources growth strategy, 
Bloomsbury 2020. This will accelerate the expansion of the Group’s 
portfolio of high-quality digital products for academic libraries and 
for professionals. To support Bloomsbury 2020 we are investing in 
new products, technology platforms to fulfil them and B2B sales 
processes. 
Early in 2016, we simplified the organisational structure. The Group 
now has just two publishing divisions, namely Consumer and Non-
Consumer, supported by global functions for sales, marketing, 
production, technology and finance. The new Consumer division 
brings together, under Emma Hopkin, the Adult and Children’s 
trade publishing divisions. This has coincided with Richard Charkin 
reducing his time commitment to around two days a week. He 
remains President of Bloomsbury USA, Chairman of Bloomsbury 
India, and Managing Director of our Special Interest publishing. We 
are delighted that Richard will remain on the Board.
As explained in the 2016 Annual Report, the Board concluded that 
it can best support the business as it evolves through a programme 
of regular new Board appointments, while keeping the size of the 
Board fixed at eight Directors. This will ensure that, at a time of 
continual change in our markets, there is a steady inflow to the 
Board of new insights from other businesses. Accordingly, I am 
pleased to welcome Steven Hall who joined the Board in March 2017 
as a Non-Executive Director and member of the Audit Committee 
and Nomination Committee. He has extensive experience of digital 
publishing and has led the development of pioneering online 
content databases, which will benefit the Board as Bloomsbury 2020 
is rolled out. At the same time, Stephen Page stood down from the 
Board. Stephen Page joined the Board in 2013 and has provided 
extensive practical insights and counsel of great value. We have 
drawn heavily on his publishing experience and thank him for the 
tremendous support he has given Bloomsbury.
Observing the approach of steady rotation of the Board, I confirmed 
in the 2016 Annual Report my intention to stand down from the 
Board at the 2017 AGM. A rigorous search process is underway for 
my successor who will be joining the Board following the 2017 AGM 
as Non-Executive Chairman, Chair of the Nomination Committee and 
a member of the Remuneration Committee.
Bloomsbury’s core business has high social value, namely 
supporting authors to publish their works of scholarship, literature 
and information. Bloomsbury’s books and content products help 
enrich the lives of millions of people of all ages. The advent of digital 
media has not replaced printed books. Rather it has provided 
exciting opportunities for Bloomsbury to fulfil its publishing mission 
in new ways. The capacity of the business to evolve with changes in 
technology and its markets and the depth of talent across the Group 
give me confidence in Bloomsbury’s future. It has been a privilege to 
have been Chairman for the past four years.
Sir Anthony Salz
Non-Executive Chairman

Chief Executive’s Review
B
loomsbury has had a year 
of strong progress – with 
excellent revenue growth and 
good strategic development through 
investment in the Bloomsbury 2020 digital 
resources growth strategy. Book sales, 
and print in particular, continue to be 
resilient in spite of political and economic 
uncertainty. 
Bloomsbury achieved excellent revenue 
growth of 15% for the year ending 
28 February 2017 (9% at constant currencies) resulting in total 
revenues of £142.6 million (2016: £123.7 million). Profit before 
tax and highlighted items was £12.0 million (2016: £13.0 million), 
£1.0 million below the prior year in line with the guidance we gave 
in May 2016 to reflect our £0.6 million investment in the Bloomsbury 
2020 digital resources growth strategy and also the end of the 
seven–year term of the Qatar Foundation contract in December 
2015.
During the year revenues generated by each of Bloomsbury’s four 
territorial offices grew. The Group’s ambitious plans to grow in 
Australia, announced in July 2016, saw Bloomsbury Australia grow 
revenues by 50% (26% at constant currencies) from £7.0 million 
to £10.5 million. Revenues in Bloomsbury India grew 46% (30% at 
constant currencies) and the business made an operating profit 
for the first time. 61% of Bloomsbury’s sales now originate from 
customers outside the UK (2016: 54%).
Book sales grew by 18% year on year to £133.3 million, with digital 
sales, included in this total, increasing by 7% to £16.0 million. Digital 
growth was driven by strong sales of digital resources. Rights and 
services revenues were £9.3 million (2016: £10.6 million), being 7%  
of total Group revenues compared to 9% in the previous year. 
The Consumer division, and Children’s publishing in particular, 
delivered an excellent performance, with its fourth year in a row of 
double digit revenue growth. The Illustrated Edition of Harry Potter 
and the Chamber of Secrets by J. K. Rowling and illustrated by Jim 
Kay was a major international seller. Book sales in the Non-Consumer 
division grew by 5% but, as expected, the division saw a reduction 
in rights and services revenues following the end of the term of the 
Qatar contract and last year’s strong rights performance.
A key strategic focus in 2016/17 was the Bloomsbury 2020 digital 
resources growth strategy. During the year we built a new platform 
to host our digital resources. Our programme is on schedule, with 
two resources launched onto the new platform. We are encouraged 
that digital resources revenues exceeded our expectation, growing 
by 50% year on year to £3.9 million. Our guidance on future 
investment and returns for this growth strategy is unchanged. 
Due to the strong trading in the year, the Group was able to make 
a bonus provision of £1.0 million (2016: Nil).
“This has been a very strong year for 
Bloomsbury with excellent revenue growth in 
all our territories. Our Children’ s publishing, 
in particular, had an exceptional year, 
delivering double digit revenue growth for the 
fourth year in a row. 
W e are well-placed for the coming year.  
W e are launching three further major  
digital resources, as planned, and have  
an exciting publishing list from new and 
existing authors. ”

Chief Executive’s Review
Highlighted items of £2.6 million (2016: £2.7 million) include  
£1.7 million (2016: £1.8 million) of amortisation of acquired intangible 
assets. Other highlighted items in this period of £0.9 million are 
primarily as a result of the strategic restructuring of the US operation. 
The effective rate of tax for the year was 22% compared to 6% for 
the year ended 29 February 2016. The rate last year was low as it 
included the utilisation of previously unrecognised tax losses and  
a double tax relief benefit.
Diluted earnings per share, excluding highlighted items, were 
12.63 pence (2016: 15.24 pence). Total diluted earnings per share  
for the year were 9.81 pence compared to 12.93 pence in 2016.
Cash generation was strong with cash and cash equivalents net  
of bank overdraft of £15.5 million at 28 February 2017 (2016:  
£5.2 million). Our focus on working capital continues – stock 
has reduced by 5% or £1.3 million year on year, using constant 
currencies. We are working to achieve a similar stock reduction 
in the new financial year. Our strategic priority for cash is organic 
investment to grow and enhance our existing business. Including 
capital expenditure, during the year we invested an additional £1.5 
million of cash in Bloomsbury 2020. 
Another strategic priority for cash is the growth of our dividend. 
The Group has a progressive dividend policy while aiming to keep 
dividend earnings cover in excess of two. Investment in Bloomsbury 
2020 is leading to earnings cover falling below that level in the 
short-term, but the dividend is underpinned by strong cash cover. 
The Board has committed during this period of investment to 
maintain its progressive dividend policy on the basis that earnings 
cover will improve as the return on Bloomsbury 2020 accrues. The 
Directors are therefore recommending a final dividend of 5.6 pence 
per share, which subject to shareholder approval at our AGM on 18 
July 2017, will be paid on 20 September 2017 to shareholders on the 
register at the close of business on 25 August 2017. Together with 
the interim dividend, this makes a total dividend for the year ended 
28 February 2017 of 6.7 pence per share, a 5% increase on the  
6.4 pence dividend for the year ended 29 February 2016. Including 
the full year dividend increase, over the past 12 years the dividend 
has increased steadily at a compound annual growth rate of 7%.
Consumer division
The Consumer division, which consists of Adult and Children’s 
trade publishing, has had an exceptional year, significantly due 
to an excellent Children’s performance. Revenue for the division 
increased by 28% to £85.4 million (2016: £66.4 million). Operating 
profit before highlighted items increased by 33% to £7.9 million 
(2016: £6.0 million). There was good revenue growth in all territories; 
23% in Australia, 17% in the US, 55% in India and 21% in the UK  
(all at constant currencies).

The division won many important awards, notably the Financial 
Times and McKinsey Business Book of the Year Award for The Man 
Who Knew, a biography of Alan Greenspan by Sebastian Mallaby; 
and Bloomsbury Children’s Books became the first publisher in 
50 years to win both the Carnegie and Greenaway Medals for One 
by Sarah Crossan and Chris Riddell for illustrating The Sleeper and 
the Spindle by Neil Gaiman. The Children’s team were shortlisted for 
the Independent Publishers Guild Children’s Publisher of the Year 
and the British Book Awards Children’s Publisher of the Year. These 
awards recognise the high standard and quality of our authors and 
illustrators and support our strategy to focus on acquiring global 
commercial rights, targeted and strategic marketing and brand 
management of our major authors. 
Children’s revenues increased by 48% to £55.9 million (2016: 
£37.7 million). Operating profit before highlighted items increased by 
44% to £7.6 million (2016: £5.3 million). Sales of Harry Potter titles grew 
by 88% in the year. Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets Illustrated 
Edition was published to great acclaim in October 2016. We sold rights 
to Jim Kay’s Harry Potter illustrations, in which we control world rights, 
in 30 languages. The film tie-in Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them 
– Newt Scamander: A Movie Scrapbook sold well following the release 
of the film, the first of five, in November 2016. Sales of Sarah J. Maas 
titles grew by 87% year on year. A Court of Mist and Fury, the second 
book in the A Court of Thorns and Roses series, was number one on 
the New York Times Young Adult bestseller list. Her new Throne of Glass 
novel – Empire of Storms – was on the New York Times Series bestseller 
list for nine weeks reaching number two and was also number two on 
the Bookseller UK children’s chart. The success of Sarah J. Maas and 
other Young Adult publishing contributed significantly to Children’s 
e-book sales increasing by 19% to £3.4 million. Neil Gaiman reached 
number one in the Nielsen BookScan original fiction chart with Norse 
Mythology. Bloomsbury Children’s UK market share value grew by 
21% year on year to 4% (source: Nielsen BookScan). During the year 
we created a Children’s Non-Fiction team to enhance focus and 
growth in that part of the division.
Adult revenues increased by 3% to £29.5 million (2016: £28.7 
million). Operating profit before highlighted items of £0.3 million 
(2016: £0.7 million) was affected by a reduction in higher margin 
e-book revenues and increased advance provisions. William Boyd’s 
Sweet Caress, Ann Patchett’s Commonwealth, Hannah Rothschild’s 
Improbability of Love and Natasha Pulley’s The Watchmaker of Filigree 
Street all sold strongly. In cookery, Tom Kerridge’s Dopamine Diet 
sold over 140,000 copies and went to number one in the overall 
Nielsen BookScan chart in the UK on publication. Le Manoir Aux Quat’ 
Saisons by Raymond Blanc also sold well. Peter Frankopan’s The Silk 
Roads was in the Sunday Times paperback non-fiction chart for 11 
weeks and in the US, Dreamland by Sam Quinones won the National 
Book Critics Circle non-fiction award. Bloomsbury Adult in the UK 
grew market share by value by 2% year on year (source: Nielsen 
BookScan).
Sales of Harry Potter titles grew during the year helped by the release 
of the next in the series of illustrated editions and a film tie–in.
Bloomsbury’s bestselling fiction authors enjoyed an impressive year. 
Sarah J. Maas topped the New York Times Young Adult bestseller list 
whilst Neil Gaiman topped the UK Neilson BookScan original fiction 
chart.

Chief Executive’s Review
During the year a new Publishing Director joined the Adult team in 
London and we launched a new crime imprint, Raven Books, run by 
a new Editorial Director. Crime is a constantly growing segment of 
the market. Bloomsbury’s first book in this imprint, The River at Night 
by Erica Ferencik was published in January 2017. It is nominated 
as The Bookseller’s Book of the Month for June. The US Consumer 
division has been restructured and a new Editorial Director for 
Fiction was appointed in January 2017. 
Non-Consumer division
The Non-Consumer division consists of Academic & Professional, 
Special Interest and Content Services. Both revenues in the division 
of £57.2 million (2016: £57.3 million) and adjusted operating profits 
of £4.1 million (2016: £7.1 million) were affected by the end of the 
term of the Qatar Foundation contract in December 2015, our 
£0.6 million net incremental investment in Bloomsbury 2020 and the 
benefit of a full year of results from certain Family Law titles, which 
were acquired in January 2016. Academic & Professional revenues 
make up 65% of total division revenues and were up 1%. Within 
this, Education had revenue of £2.5 million (2016: £3.9 million) and 
operating profit before highlighted items of £0.3 million (2016: 
£0.7 million) in the year ended 28 February 2017. The £1.4 million 
reduction in revenues year on year is due to a strong year for 
rights sales last year. Excluding Education, Academic & Professional 
revenues grew by 5%. 
The Bloomsbury 2020 digital resources growth strategy, announced 
in May 2016, will make Bloomsbury a leading non-consumer 
publisher in the B2B academic and professional information market 
and significantly accelerate the growth of digital revenues. The 
plan is to increase the output and speed to market of a range of 
new digital products, provide a robust scalable set of platforms, 
and improve the strength, depth and geographical spread of our 
institutional digital sales team. Bloomsbury Digital Resources, a 
separate team within Non-Consumer, has been set up under its own 
Managing Director and Sales Director to bring this to fruition more 
quickly. During the year ended 28 February 2017, the focus of this 
plan was to deliver the digital platform upon which to host the new 
services and hire the new content acquisition, sales and marketing 
teams as well as launch two new resources on the new platform. 
All this was achieved as planned during the year. Academic & 
Professional digital resources revenues grew by 58% to £3.7 million 
(2016: £2.4 million), well above our expectations. Over 40% of digital 
resources revenues originated from outside the UK, with the largest 
single territory being North America at 33% (2016: 18%) which had 
194% revenue growth year on year. Bloomsbury now has over 1,700 
active institutional customers worldwide for its digital resources 
(2016: 1,009), a growth of 68%. All our existing major digital resources 
saw revenue growth. In the year, as planned, we launched four 
new major digital resources: Fairchild Books Library, The Fashion 
Photography Archive, Arcadian Library and Bloomsbury Popular 
Music – the latter two hosted on our new platform. In addition, there 
were a number of modules added to existing products including

BBC Drama and Hollow Crown added to Drama Online, which now 
reaches over one million students worldwide. The pipeline of new 
resources is strong – over the next year we will be launching three 
new resources: The Bloomsbury Design Library, The Bloomsbury 
Food Library and Bloomsbury Cultural History, as well as three new 
modules to Drama Online.
Including e-book revenues, Academic & Professional digital 
revenues in total grew by 25% year on year to £6.9 million, more 
than four times the industry growth rate of 6% for academic and 
professional digital revenues (Source: Publishing Association 
Yearbook 2016). 
The Academic division generally had a good year, with a sizeable 
increase in output of titles, a third Dartmouth prize in seven years 
and a new strategic partnership for the Classics list with leading 
exam board Oxford Cambridge and RSA, making Bloomsbury the 
largest publisher in UK secondary schools classics. Bloomsbury’s 
expanding digital resources sales mitigated the ongoing flat US 
print library budgets. The effect of retailer text book rental and used 
book programmes on higher education text book sales in North 
America, while structurally significant for the market, is restricted 
within Bloomsbury to the Fairchild Books list. Fairchild comprises 7% 
of Non-Consumer revenues and less than 3% of Group revenue. 
Through Bloomsbury 2020, we are able to exploit the Fairchild 
content digitally on Bloomsbury Fashion Central, with direct 
institutional sales. 
The integration of the Family Law titles, acquired in January 2016, 
into Bloomsbury’s Professional division was completed during 
the year. Family Law contributed £0.9 million of revenue (2016: 
£0.3 million) and £0.5 million of profit (2016: £0.3 million), in excess 
of our expectations. Excluding these results in both years, Group 
revenues grew by 15% (9% at constant currencies). 
In the year, Bloomsbury was shortlisted for Academic, Educational 
and Professional Publisher of the Year at the Bookseller Industry 
Awards, for the fourth year in a row. 
Our focus on special interest niches is succeeding, with revenues 
up by 5% to £18.4 million (2016: £17.5 million). The value of our 
strategy is the ability to pinpoint market sectors and promote and 
sell direct to a community of shared interest. Our chosen niches 
are military history (through Osprey), natural history (through 
Helm and Poyser), sport (through Nautical, Reeds, and Wisden), 
popular science (through Sigma) and reference (through Who’s 
Who, Whitaker’s, and www.writersandartists.co.uk). In each of these 
areas we have strengthened our editorial positioning, and invested 
in digital marketing, new products and widening our portfolio. In 
particular, Wisden has seen one of its highest sales for many years. 
The division launched the Green Tree imprint in February 2017 with 
the goal of publishing the best in health and wellness books – a 
natural extension from our expertise in sport and fitness publishing. 
Bloomsbury Popular Music and Arcadian Library were 
launched during the year on our new digital platform.

Chief Executive’s Review
Bloomsbury Content Services had revenue growth of 9% to 
£1.9 million (excluding the loss of £1.5 million revenue year on 
year from the end of the term of the Qatar contract). This organic 
growth was in content marketing and publishing services, with new 
customers including the Royal Bank of Canada and the Institute of 
Chartered Accountants in England and Wales. The agreement with 
the Institute of Labor Economics for the provision of publishing, 
marketing and digital services for the IZA World of Labor knowledge 
hub was extended for a further 18 months from January 2017. A new 
and enhanced version of the website was launched in February 2017.
Outlook 
In 2017/18 we will continue to expand Bloomsbury 2020 digital growth 
resources by launching three further digital services. 
June 2017 is the 20th anniversary since Harry Potter and the 
Philosopher’s Stone was first published. To celebrate, there will be 
new editions of this title and a series of events. There is a new edition 
of Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them with a foreword by 
J.K.Rowling and six new beasts. There are also two new illustrated 
Harry Potter editions, the Illustrated Edition of Harry Potter and the 
Prisoner of Azkaban, and the Illustrated Edition of Fantastic Beasts 
and Where to Find Them. In addition our strong publishing list for  
the new year includes Utopia for Realists by Rutger Bregman, Lincoln 
in the Bardo by George Saunders, A Court of Wings and Ruin by  
Sarah J. Maas, The Strange Death of Europe by Douglas Murray and  
Breaking Mad by Anna Williamson.
Trading in the new financial year is in line with our expectations.

Financial Review
Revenue
Revenues grew by 9% at constant 
currencies. Reported revenues 
 increased by 15% to £142.6 million  
(2016: £123.7 million).
The excellent growth in Children’s 
division revenues and Harry Potter 
titles in particular has been a significant 
contributor to this performance. Revenue 
growth has been achieved year on year  
in all of Bloomsbury’s territories: India 30%; US 1%; Australia 26%; UK 
11% (growth quoted is in local currencies). 
The Family Law titles, acquired in January 2016, contributed 
£0.9 million to revenues (2016: £0.3 million) and £0.5 million to profit 
(2016: £0.3 million). Currency movements in the year increased total 
revenues by 6%. 
The following chart shows where Group revenues were generated 
for the year ended 28 February 2017. 
Revenues by territory
UK 62%
USA 29%
Australia 7%
India 2%
The following chart shows the proportion of Group revenue that 
each product type generates.
Revenues by type
Print 82%
Digital 11%
Rights and Services 7%
Print sales grew strongly, particularly in the Children’s division. 
Digital sales also grew, with digital resources revenues growth of 
50% mitigating a 2% fall in e-book sales. The UK publishing industry 
saw an 11% reduction in e-book sales in 2016 (source: PA Publishing 
Yearbook). Rights and Services revenues fell as a result of the end  
of the term of the Qatar contract. 
 
 
 
 
Profit
Profit before tax and highlighted items at constant currencies 
reduced by £1.9 million to £11.1 million. Currency movements in 
the year increased profit by 8% (£0.9 million). Profit before tax and 
highlighted items was £12.0 million (2016: £13.0 million). Profit before 
tax was £9.4 million (2016: £10.4 million).
 
The key items impacting the year on year movement in profit were: 
the exceptional revenue performance in the Children’s division; the 
£0.6 million incremental investment in the Bloomsbury 2020 digital 
resources growth strategy; a £1.5 million reduction in profit from 
the end of the term of the Qatar contract; and a £1.0 million bonus 
provision (2016: Nil).
Administrative expenses excluding highlighted items were up 
by 9% including the effect of foreign exchange rate changes 
of £1.5 million, the incremental investment for Bloomsbury 2020 
(£0.3 million included in administrative expenses) and bonus 
accrual. Excluding these items, overheads were up by 2% year on 
year. The operating profit margin before highlighted items declined 
year on year to 8.4% from 10.6% for the same reasons given above. 
Excluding these, the margin was 10.4% in 2017. 
Highlighted items consisted of the amortisation of acquired 
intangibles assets of £1.7 million and £0.9 million incurred mainly 
following a major one-off restructuring of the US business. 
Interest
The net finance income for the Group for the year was £0.04 million 
compared with a net finance cost of £0.09 million for 2016. £0.1 million 
of interest was received from HMRC in the year following a successful 
tax tribunal.
Taxation
The tax charge of £2.1 million (2016: £0.7 million) represents an 
effective rate of tax of 22.1% for the year compared to 6.3% last 
year. Excluding the effect of highlighted items, the effective tax rate 
for the Group was 21.9% (2016: 8.5%). Last year’s rate was lower 
because of adjustments for the carry back of double taxation relief 
to prior years and we were able to use previously unrecognised 
Bloomsbury Verlag losses in the UK following a successful HMRC 
tribunal. We expect the effective rate of tax excluding highlighted 
items to remain reasonably stable going forward. 
Earnings per share
Diluted earnings per share before highlighted items were 12.63p, 
down by 17% from 15.24p last year, as a result of the extra 
£0.6 million investment in Bloomsbury 2020 in the year, the end  
of the Qatar contract and the lower tax rate in the prior year.

Financial Review
Capital structure
Our balance sheet at 28 February 2017 can be summarised as set out in the table below:
2017
£’m
2016
£m
Goodwill and acquired intangible assets 57.2 58.2
Internally generated intangible assets 6.6 6.3
Property, plant and equipment 2.2 2.5
Net deferred tax assets 2.5 0.3
Working capital 55.8 60.6
Other non-current assets and liabilities (0.5) (0.1)
Total net assets before net cash 123.8    127.8
Net cash 15.5 5.2
Total net assets 139.3 133.0
Net assets increased by 5% to £139.3 million (2016: £133.0 million) 
and net assets per share by 4% to 185 pence (2016: 177 pence). 
The main movements on the balance sheet are in working capital 
and cash due to increased trading levels and currency movements, 
particularly the dollar sterling exchange rate. Inventories increased 
by 4% to £28.6 million (2016: £27.6 million). On a constant currencies 
basis however, inventories reduced by 5% to £1.3 million. The latter, 
following extensive work around improving stock efficiency over  
the last couple of years. We expect these improvements to continue  
into the 2017/18 year. 
Both trade receivables and trade payables have increased following 
the significant increase in revenues and currency movements. Trade 
and other receivables increased by 7% to £77.8 million (2016: £72.5 
million) and 3% using constant currencies. Since books sold are 
generally returnable by customers, the Group makes a provision 
against books sold in the accounting year. The unused provision at the 
year end is then carried forward and offset against trade receivables in 
the balance sheet, in anticipation of further book returns subsequent 
to the year end. A provision of £6.5 million (2016: £5.8 million) has 
been made for future returns relating to sales up to 28 February 
2017. This provision was 13% of gross trade receivables (2016: 13%). 
Trade payables increased by 26% to £49.6 million (2016: £39.3 
million). Accruals have increased from £12.9 million to £18.8 million, 
mainly because of increased trading, currency movements, the 
addition of a management bonus accrual of £1.0 million (2016: Nil) 
and a £2.4 million increase in royalties accrual following a change in 
disclosure from trade payables/advance receivables last year. 
Deferred tax assets have been increased by £2.6 million for 
temporary differences on how stocks are valued for tax purposes 
in the US. An equal and opposite tax payable has been recognised 
which will be settled over three years. 
Cash 
Cash and cash equivalents were £15.5 million (2016: £5.2 million). 
Cash flow conversion in the year was 180% (2016: 56%). Cash flow 
conversion is calculated as cash generated from operating activities 
less capital expenditure divided by reported operating profit. Cash 
conversion has improved due to receipts from the timing of other 
income at the end of the prior year and improved working capital 
management, especially following the reduction in inventory at 
constant currencies during the year.
The net cash generated from operating activities, including the 
effect of highlighted items, was £18.8 million, £13.7 million up on 
2016. This movement is due to improvements in working capital 
noted above and lower taxes being paid. Investing activities for the 
year resulted in an outflow of £2.8 million (2016: £3.1 million) and 
mainly comprise the cost of internally generated intangible assets. 
The net cash of £6.1 million (2016: £7.1 million) used in financing 
activities was predominantly made up of dividend payments of  
£4.8 million (2016: £4.6 million) and £1.2 million of share purchases 
by the Employee Benefit Trust (2016: Nil). 
Liquidity 
The Group has an unsecured revolving credit facility with Lloyds 
Bank plc, with £10 million to £14 million of committed loan facility 
(amount dependent on time during the year to match Bloomsbury’s 
cash flow cycle), a £2 million overdraft facility renewed annually and 
a £6 million uncommitted term loan facility. The loan facilities expire 
in May 2021. All loan facilities are subject to two covenants, being a 
maximum net debt to EBITDA ratio and a minimum interest cover 
covenant. No facilities were drawn down as at 28 February 2017.
The Group’s net cash position changes over the course of the year 
as a result of the seasonality of the business with the most significant 
expenses being the payment of royalties in March and September 
and the most significant sale receipts being in February from the 
Christmas sales.

Alternative performance measures
The Board considers it helpful to provide performance measures 
that it uses to assess the operating performance of the Group. 
The Annual Report presents the following non-GAAP measures 
alongside the standard accounting terms prescribed by IFRS and 
the Companies Act, which the Board considers would be beneficial 
to users. 
Alternative profit measures
The Group uses adjusted profit measures to assist users in 
understanding operational performance. These measures exclude 
Income Statement items arising from significant non-cash charges 
and major one-off initiatives which are highlighted in the Income 
Statement because, in the opinion of the Directors, separate 
disclosure is helpful in understanding the underlying performance 
of the business that underpins long-term value generation. The 
Income Statement items that are excluded from Adjusted profit 
measures are referred to as highlighted items.
Both Adjusted profit measures and highlighted items are presented 
together with statutory measures on the face of the Income 
Statement. Highlighted items are not a defined term under IFRS, 
so may not be comparable to similar terminology used in other 
financial statements. Details of the charges and credits presented as 
highlighted items are set out in note 4 to the financial statements. 
The basis for treating these items as highlighted is as follows:
Amortisation of acquired  
intangible assets 
Charges for amortisation of acquired intangible assets arise from 
the purchase consideration of a number of separate acquisitions. 
These acquisitions are strategic investment decisions that took place 
at different times over a number of years, and so the associated 
amortisation does not reflect current operational performance. 
Other highlighted items
Other highlighted items are recorded in accordance with the 
Group’s policy set out in note 4 of the financial statements. They 
arise from one-off major initiatives such that in the opinion of 
the Directors, separate disclosure is helpful in understanding the 
underlying performance of the business that underpins long-term 
value generation. Examples include major restructuring initiatives or 
legal and professional fees stemming from an acquisition.
Tax related to highlighted items
The elements of the overall Group tax charge relating to the above 
highlighted items are also treated as adjusting. These elements 
of the tax charge are calculated with reference to the specific tax 
treatment of each individual highlighted item.

Constant currency measures
Given the significant impact that Brexit has had on exchange rates in the year, it is helpful to compare like-for-like revenue between periods. 
Changes in exchange rates used to record non-sterling businesses results in a lack of comparability between periods since equivalent local 
currency amounts are recorded at different sterling amounts in different periods. Results using constant currencies are disclosed where they 
have a material impact on those numbers, enabling a better understanding of the underlying performance. 
We have therefore restated below the current year revenue at the prior year exchange rates. The currency adjustment is calculated by 
applying the monthly foreign exchange rates used in 2016 to convert the overseas revenue into sterling. This has been applied on a month– 
by–month basis to the 2017 revenue. This method allows better comparability given the seasonality of the business.

Group Overview
Group Strategic Summary
Bloomsbury is a global publisher of books and other media for 
general readers, children, students, researchers and professionals. 
Bloomsbury offers authors access to these multiple markets in 
multiple formats throughout the world: in print, through e-books, 
through digital downloads and apps; in schools; in libraries; 
in universities; and in terrestrial and internet bookshops; with 
entrepreneurial teams in New York, London, New Delhi and Sydney 
serving all territories. 
Our overall strategy is unchanged and is to grow a high quality 
global publishing business delivering high value to its authors and 
other contributors, readers and shareholders.
We achieve this by:
 ✷ publishing authors and works of excellence and originality; 
 ✷ delivering professional services to those seeking publication; 
 ✷ combining tradition and technology to achieve excellence; and
 ✷ establishing solid profit streams.
Area of focus Reason for the focus
Growing Non-Consumer* revenues so that 
they match or exceed our Consumer revenues
Non-Consumer revenues have higher margins, are generally a more predictable 
revenue stream, are less reliant on the retail bookshop environment and have more 
digital opportunities. They are typically derived from our Academic & Professional 
and Content Services divisions and Education and Special Interest books.
Continuing acquisition of rights to publish 
outstanding works by undiscovered and 
established authors
Bloomsbury differentiates its brand by the quality of its publishing.
Expanding internationally in English 
language markets
This reduces the Group’s reliance on the UK market and, in particular, takes 
advantage of the biggest academic market worldwide in the US and the significant 
growth potential in India.
Creating and exploiting copyright and 
IP , including by licensing information 
databases to support major institutions and 
corporations
This reduces the Group’s reliance on Consumer revenues and increases higher 
value B2B transactions.
Benefiting from the digital opportunity
This expands the markets we are in and our revenue opportunities.
Delivering excellent service to our authors
Excellent service is core to attracting and keeping our authors.
* Non-Consumer: This includes Academic & Professional, Content Services, Education and Special Interest 
During the year the Group was organised as two worldwide publishing divisions supported by global back office functions. A review of 
these follows.

Risk Factors
O 
utlined in the table on pages 24 to 26 is a description of 
risk factors that management considers are relevant 
to the Group’s business. Not all the factors are within 
management’s control and other factors besides those listed below 
could also affect the Group. Actions being taken by management 
to mitigate risk factors should be considered in conjunction with the 
cautioning note to Shareholders in the Directors’ Report on page 39 
with regards to forward looking statements. Details on financial risk 
management are given in note 22. 
Viability statement
Provision C.2.2 of the UK Corporate Governance Code requires 
the Directors to assess the viability of the Group over a period 
significantly longer than 12 months from the date the financial 
statements are approved.
The Group prepares five-year projections developed from the long-
term plans for each of the global publishing divisions. As well as the 
existing backlist titles, the projections for the first three years of the 
plan are based on the future title, online platform and other income 
pipelines. There is inherently less certainty in years four and five. The 
Board therefore concludes that three years is an appropriate period 
for the viability statement.
The Group’s principal risks (see pages 24 to 26) and its approach 
to managing them have formed the basis for the assessment of 
longer term viability. The Board believes the principal risks to 
viability are primarily:
 ✷ volatility of book sales for the consumer market including, but not 
limited to, the risk of a major high street retailer going  
out of business;
 ✷ the increasing importance of internet retailing;
 ✷ volatility of rights and services deals; 
 ✷ changes that might occur to the digital book market; 
 ✷ erosion of copyright; and
 ✷ risks associated with Brexit, principally the impact on the cost of 
overseas printing of UK originated titles.
We have developed plausible downside scenarios for each of these 
risk areas and quantified the impact on the Group’s revenue, profit 
and cash for each one. We evaluated all the principal risks below and 
focused our sensitivity analysis on the key risks.
Individual and multiple scenarios were overlaid on our three-year 
projections. Through this analysis, the Board concludes that the 
Group does not face a risk to longer term viability except in the 
event of remote combinations of material events. The analysis took 
account of the Group’s current funding, forecast requirements and 
existing committed borrowing facilities. 
Based on this assessment, the Board has a reasonable expectation 
that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its 
liabilities as they fall due over the period to 29 February 2020.
It is also important to bear in mind the quantum of Intellectual 
Property (“IP”) which the Group holds and how that impacts the 
viability assessment. Bloomsbury does have easily transferable IP 
assets that can be broken up into any number of combinations that 
it could sell were a catastrophic risk failure to occur.
Bloomsbury business model 
Our strategy
The Group’s mission is to grow a high quality global publishing 
business delivering high value to its contributors, readers and 
Shareholders. The Group Overview section of the Annual Report 
includes information on our strategy, which has evolved to 
address the risks faced by the Group. The Corporate Responsibility 
section gives information on how we take account of social and 
environmental matters when implementing our strategy.
Overview of Bloomsbury’s processes
Bloomsbury is an independent publisher and has been listed on 
the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange since 1994. Over a 
period of 30 years the business has built up a substantial body of 
publishing rights.
The Group is structured as fully integrated worldwide publishing 
divisions under a global brand supported by centralised sales, 
marketing, production and head office functions (this structure is 
named “One Global Bloomsbury”). Each publishing division reports 
to the Chief Executive. The Group encourages each publishing 
division to develop and grow diversified income streams. Each 
division has the capability to publish books in all formats but may 
also produce other products such as online content accessible 
through subscription. Each division may also use its expertise to 
provide publishing-related services to clients. 
Book publishing
Book publishing (e-books, printed books etc) is the main activity of 
Bloomsbury. This generates two core income streams: book sales 
and rights sales. 
In competition with other publishers, Bloomsbury’s commissioning 
editors acquire the intellectual property rights to publish the 
works of authors. Ultimately, the authors and their literary agents 
control which rights each publisher acquires. Bloomsbury focuses 
on publishing worldwide in English but getting the specific 
rights desired can entail acquiring an assortment of other rights. 
Bloomsbury re-sells on to other publishers any rights it does not 
need, which generates an income stream. When it makes financial 
sense, Bloomsbury also sells the publishing rights to titles in its 
extensive backlist e.g. for a book in a series published by another 
publisher which is valuable to them to complete the series.
22 Bloomsbury Publishing Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Bloomsbury AR2017-proof 6.indd   22 6/12/2017   1:33:40 PM 25133.04    12 June 2017 1:31 PM    Proof 6
Bloomsbury sells its own books typically through online retailers 
such as Amazon, through bookshops, through supermarkets and 
direct to customers.
Bloomsbury’s global production function produces books in all 
formats. Bloomsbury has produced e-books since 2005 and as an 
early adopter benefited from the worldwide growth in e-book sales. 
Printed books that are sold through retail outlets are normally sold 
on a sale-or-return basis. The Group does not print its own books but 
subcontracts the printing, warehouse storage and distribution of 
printed books to a number of long-term global partners.
Positioning the business towards Non-Consumer 
revenues 
Bloomsbury is a cash generative business and has enjoyed the 
benefit of publishing many bestselling titles over a prolonged 
period. Bloomsbury has balanced its core consumer book 
publishing business with academic and professional publishing.  
This addresses a number of risks: 
Long-term growth potential, less sales volatility and higher 
margins: The demand for academic and professional books is more 
regular which reduces the volatility of book sales compared  
to consumer book sales; 
Barriers to entry: Since acquiring Methuen Drama in 2006, 
Bloomsbury has continuously invested in growing its academic 
publishing business through organic growth and acquisitions of 
publishing businesses, lists of academic books and online databases. 
The time, cost and expertise required to build up an academic 
publisher acts as a barrier to entry for significant new competitors; 
Exploiting intellectual property: Bloomsbury is developing 
innovative academic online products which are sold under annual 
subscriptions and which exploit the Group’s content assets and 
expertise; and 
Lower risk: Academic publishing acquisitions require lower 
advances to authors.
Growth in emerging markets 
India has one of the world’s largest English-speaking populations 
and an increasing number of highly educated readers of English. 
Bloomsbury has a growing publishing business in India that publishes 
the works of local talented authors in addition to the works of 
Bloomsbury authors with works originally published in the UK and 
the US.

Risk Factors
Principal Risks
The table below provides a description of risk factors that 
management considers relevant to the Group’s business. Other 
factors besides those listed could also affect the Group. The risks are 
illustrated schematically in the following chart:
More Likely Less Likely
High Impact Low Impact
Impact
Likelihood
1. Market 
2. Rights and services
3. Financial valuations
4. Information and  
technology systems
5. Growth of digital
6. Title acquisition
7. Reputation
8. IP and copyright
9. Overseas operations
During the financial year ended 28 February 2017 the Principal Risks 
have not changed substantially. The launch of the Bloomsbury 2020 
digital resource growth strategy increases the focus on developing 
the sales of digital resources, which changes the significance rather 
than the nature of the risk labelled as “Growth of digital”.
Brexit risks
The risks relating to Britain’s exit of the European Union (“EU”) are 
not considered Principal Risks to Bloomsbury. Bloomsbury is exposed 
to fluctuations in the value of sterling, in particular:
 ✷ a substantial proportion of sales are made outside the UK mainly 
in US dollars; and
 ✷ paper for printed books is sourced outside the UK so the price 
paid in sterling depends on the value of sterling.
Each of these factors tends to negate the other over time albeit 
Bloomsbury’s paper purchase contracts typically fix the price for a 
period of time, which delays the full financial impact of exchange 
rate movements being reflected in the Income Statement. The 
business has capacity to adapt to longer term changes in exchange 
rates by shifting its focus between different global regions in the 
selection of works to publish, through marketing efforts and in the 
location of where it employs staff.
The level of sales into Continental Europe are minor to Bloomsbury’s 
Group revenue. Whilst there is uncertainty as to whether Brexit will 
positively or negatively impact on Bloomsbury’s EU sales, Brexit is not 
expected to have a major impact on Bloomsbury.
Key area Risk Description Mitigation
1. Market Volatility of 
consumer book 
sales 
Sales of books to the consumer market can 
be seasonal and volatile.
Develop special interest, academic and 
professional publishing where revenues  
are less volatile.
Develop other revenue streams, including 
from rights and services, increasing 
the scope to enter annually renewing 
agreements.
Increased 
dependence on 
internet retailing
Readers might not discover, and so buy, 
Bloomsbury’s print and e-books sold 
through internet retailers who may control 
discoverability.
Grow expert marketing teams skilled in 
internet sales.
Engage with multiple internet retailers.
Increase focus on developing other 
marketing opportunities and other revenue 
streams, e.g. Academic & Professional digital 
products, rights and services.

Key area Risk Description Mitigation
2. Rights and 
services
Dependence on 
timing of closing 
rights and services 
deals
Generating new/
non-renewal of 
subscription and 
services agreements
Entrepreneurial risk
The timing for completing high margin 
rights and services deals can depend 
on the performance by multiple parties 
including the main customer.
The pipeline of new products and 
agreements might be uneven.
A customer or partner might not renew 
larger agreements that generate 
significant ongoing income.
A deal may require upfront staff time  
and costs but fail to close resulting in  
lost investment.
Increase the number of rights and services 
deals to reduce the dependency on 
individual deals.
Increase the portfolio of products and 
agreements to grow income and reduce the 
dependency on individual agreements.
Senior managers are responsible for 
ensuring strong performance by 
Bloomsbury of its obligations and strong 
customer care.
Similar to ordinary publishing risks: increase 
the portfolio of deals to leverage economies 
of scale and reduce volatility.
3. Financial 
valuations
Judgemental 
valuation of assets 
and provisions
Significant assets and provisions in the 
balance sheet depend on judgemental 
assumptions e.g. goodwill, advances, 
intangible rights, inventory and returns 
provisions.
Consistent and evidence based approach  
to assumptions.
Board approval of key assumptions.
Rigorous audit of valuations.
4. Information 
and 
technology 
systems
Productivity of IT 
systems and data
Cyber security
Continuing to improve staff efficiency 
depends on the IT systems and data 
keeping pace with the needs of the 
business.
Unauthorised access could be made to 
Bloomsbury’s systems to perpetrate a fraud 
or cause damage.
Board level representation on steering IT 
strategy, implementation and IT operations.
Clear responsibility for systems, increasing 
use of the cloud, monitoring security risks, 
internal control reviews of the systems and 
up to date anti-virus software are amongst 
the measures in place.
5. Growth of 
digital
Digital development
Development of the 
digital book market
Rise of alternative 
book supply 
arrangements
Unforeseen hold ups may delay 
development of new online content 
services and revenue for the services may 
not grow in line with our stretching targets.
Consumer e-book prices may not hold up 
in the longer term. Possible emergence of 
not yet known reading technology.
US readers may licence books from retailers 
for a limited period at a lower cost to 
buying books, with no revenues or royalty 
paid to the publisher.
Develop high quality online content services 
in markets we understand well.
Standardise the digital delivery platform  
to simplify and speed up the development 
and implementation of new online  
content services.
Continue to supply books in all formats 
through multiple digital delivery systems 
aligned with the demands of readers.
Ensure the Group is positioned to take 
advantage of e-book (or any new format) 
growth in international markets.
Use social media and other digital 
marketing to encourage direct sales  
to consumers.
Develop non-consumer offering where 
revenues are less volatile and there is a 
direct relationship with the customers.
Develop digital platforms to deliver on  
a subscription basis the content that  
readers demand.

collapse of a retailer.
Careful selection and rigorous review 
of titles by broad teams of experienced 
publishers, planning of the title pipeline to 
focus on publishing strengths.
Rigorous production procedures and 
planning of titles and digital resource 
content.
Security awareness in teams and additional 
security measures to protect high value 
assets and data.
Diversify the portfolio of products and 
services to reduce dependencies on 
individual customers, sales channels  
and markets.
8. IP and 
copyright
Erosion of copyright
Piracy
Erosion of traditional copyrights. 
Open access.
Piracy of titles in print or digital form.
Continue policy of support for copyright 
and intellectual property rights as a 
fundamental facet of publishing.
Develop digital services that deliver mixed 
open access and proprietary content in 
the form that customers demand and will 
continue to pay for.
Adopt robust anti-piracy policies.
Ensure good digital rights management 
protection of e-books and digital formats.
Participate in key industry anti-piracy 
initiatives.
9. Overseas 
operations
Overseas offices Growing offices in the US, India and 
Australia may increase the operational risks 
and demands on management.
One Global Bloomsbury structure of global 
publishing divisions supported by Group 
functions provides an effective internal 
control framework and oversight of the 
overseas offices. Keep under review the 
management resources deployed within 
this structure as the business evolves.

Corporate Responsibility
T
he following section provides an outline of Bloomsbury’s 
work as a good corporate citizen.
Our literary and literacy heart
Bloomsbury’s core business is the worldwide promulgation and 
promotion of literature, literacy and information for readers of 
all ages, which has a high social value. The Group has a significant 
beneficial social impact globally through sales of e-books and print 
books and access to online resources that are embraced by many 
adults and children in all walks of life. 
Our ethos
We aim for integrity in all our activities, consider our impact on 
society and the environment and maintain high ethical standards. 
This is key to our commercial success and ability to deliver good 
returns to our Shareholders, which depends on attracting and 
retaining talented authors who want us to publish them and on 
products for which there is a significant demand.
The Board recognises that the achievements of the Group have 
depended upon the high standards of social responsibility 
demonstrated by the Directors and employees for more than 30 years. 
The Board takes account of the relevant social, environmental and 
ethical issues and associated risks and opportunities to the Group’s 
short-term and long-term value. The Company continues to be 
included in the FTSE4Good index.
Board review
The Board has instigated annual reviews, as separate items on the 
agenda, for the Group of the environmental impact of the business 
and of Health and Safety. For example, following the Board’s review 
the business implemented monitoring of the proportion of Forest 
Stewardship Council certified sourced paper used in Bloomsbury’s 
books worldwide and internal reporting metrics for air-freight used 
for shipping books because of the increased level of CO
2
 this causes. 
The Board has considered areas such as how Bloomsbury can reduce 
overall greenhouse gas emissions in the supply chain for books and 
the overall environmental impact of flexible working by staff.
Community 
Bloomsbury has a significant direct beneficial impact on the 
community through its commercial activities. Our publishing teams 
share a common passion for promoting the enjoyment of reading 
and high quality literature that is often cutting edge and provides 
new authors with opportunities to establish themselves. We have a 
substantial Children’s division focused on promoting literacy for 
young readers of all abilities and ages, including specialist ranges for 
“Hi-Low” pupils (high age, low attainment) which provide parents and 
teachers with the tools needed to engage their children in reading.
Support by Bloomsbury
In addition to our direct commercial activities and with a focus 
mainly on promoting literature, literacy and education, we actively 
support numerous organisations worldwide including schools, 
universities, libraries and other good causes and charities. The 
following examples illustrate the range of our support worldwide:
Corporate volunteering  
and educational development
 ✷ Our collaboration between Methuen Drama and Prison Reading 
Groups (PRG) supports and encourages the reading of plays 
by the inmate community within HM prisons. For example, we 
provide gratis copies of the books and arrange for playwrights 
and authors to visit the prisons to run drama workshops.
 ✷ A Bloomsbury UK employee recently travelled to Nigeria to train 
170 teachers on the importance of reading and how to set up an 
effective classroom library.
 ✷ Our Australia office supports the Indigenous Literacy Foundation 
with fundraising and time given for administrative support. Our 
India office, in partnership with the Hope Foundation, recently 
published Ten Steps To Good Health, a guide for children, particularly 
in schools in non-urban areas. The book is promoted through the 
India state education system for distribution to school children. 
 ✷ Bloomsbury’s Chief Executive is President of Book Aid 
International that gifts approximately 500,000 books a year  
to libraries in Africa.
 ✷ We provide work experience days and weeks for secondary school 
pupils, have sponsored achievement prizes for students within US 
and UK universities and invite students to visit us for presentations 
on working in publishing e.g. our UK offices hosted a group of 
young adults from The Challenge’s Apprentice Scheme.
Corporate donating
 ✷ Our US, UK and Australia offices donate, or provide at a reduced 
cost, a substantial quantity of books and games each year, which 
includes donations of mainstream titles to schools and libraries, 
e.g. our US office participates in, and has donated much of our 
Children’s e-books catalogue for free to the White House’s 
ConnectED Open eBooks programme that gives underprivileged 
students access to e-books. Other donations of books and Osprey 
games worldwide have been to good causes such as to Book Trust, 
Barnardos, Oxfam, the Red Cross, the Salvation Army and smaller 
organisations local to our offices worldwide such as schools, e.g. 
our UK offices donated Osprey games to a children’s and adults’ 
hospice, our Adlard Coles Nautical imprint donated sea-related 
books to the RNLI for fundraising and our Australia office donated 
books to support a growing charity with a mission that “No child 
should be left behind in literacy” amongst others.

Corporate Responsibility
 ✷ The Bloomsbury Institute (the events function of Bloomsbury) 
organises charitable fundraising events such as for Book Aid and 
to celebrate International Women’s Day, with guest speakers who 
have included Bob Geldof, William Boyd and Aminatta Forna. Our 
Writers & Artists team organises masterclasses to raise money for 
Book Aid International.
 ✷ We support good causes that promote literacy and literature, e.g. 
we are a sponsor and partner with World Book Day, which was 
established by UNESCO to promote reading amongst children 
and adults, and our Australia office has supported a major award 
that celebrates Australian women’s writing.
We make a small number of targeted minor cash donations 
predominantly to not-for-profit organisations that support 
literature, literacy and education, which in recent years has included 
Book Aid International, the Independent Publishers Guild, The 
Charleston Trust and Woodland Trust.
Support by employees of Bloomsbury 
We encourage the spare time involvement of staff worldwide in 
supporting good causes and in the promotion of literature, literacy 
and education. These voluntary activities by employees are often 
directly or indirectly assisted by the business and by Bloomsbury 
colleagues. Examples of the many such activities recently 
undertaken are as follows.
Staff volunteering
 ✷ A significant number of our employees worldwide, both through 
a Bloomsbury coordinator and privately, are involved in formal 
volunteer reading schemes and regularly attend schools in the UK 
and the US. These provide supervised reading support to young 
readers, often from disadvantaged backgrounds where their 
opportunities to develop reading skills may be hindered. 
 ✷ Bloomsbury employees attend schools and colleges to give 
talks that have included on careers, such as in publishing and 
IT, and on reading skills required in the workplace. They have 
also assisted young people with interview practice and school 
magazines. They are unpaid public speakers at presentations, 
have published articles and hosted discussions on publishing 
topics and are volunteers for literary festivals and societies for 
young publishers.
 ✷ Many employees worldwide are involved in their local 
communities typically promoting literacy, literature and 
education, such as by sitting on committees, as governors of 
schools, by supporting special interest groups and as trustees 
and supporters of publishing industry and arts voluntary 
organisations, e.g. a Bloomsbury employee has established a 
scholarship scheme for a US university, UK employees mentor 
disadvantaged teenagers, who are aspiring authors, to go to 
university, and US employees support an organisation helping 
low-income parents to improve English literacy and language 
skills where English is not their first language.
In our offices worldwide the employees volunteer regularly to 
assist good causes unrelated to publishing e.g. in the UK they are 
Samaritans and worldwide they provide spare time support for 
homeless, sick and vulnerably housed adults and children.
Staff donating
Bloomsbury employees worldwide often call on their colleagues 
for fundraising sponsorship such as with marathons, cake sales and 
many other employee-inspired activities. Our offices will put up 
teams to participate in events, e.g. our US office participates in a food 
drive for hunger by donating canned goods and non-perishables to 
the Food Bank of New York City, and an Australian office employee 
participated in Diabetes Walk for Cure.
Diversity
We have a diverse workforce and management team led by 
a gender diverse Board. The majority of senior managers and 
employees worldwide in the Group are women. As at 28 February 
2017 the number of employees by each sex is:
Female Male
All employees of the Group
1
 432 (69%) 190 (31%)
Senior managers of the Group

Directors of the Group parent 
Company
2 6
1. Excludes workers who are freelance consultants and temps.
2. Includes the heads of publishing divisions, Group functions and country heads who 
are not Executive Directors on the parent Company Board. 
Employment KPIs
The senior management team monitors staff related KPIs (e.g. 
joiners and leavers) but the Group does not disclose all of these for 
commercial reasons that are in the interests of the Shareholders. 
Management considers the business has a low rate of staff turnover, 
especially amongst the team of skilled publishers.
Employees and human rights
We recognise that people are a key asset and employment policies 
are directed at creating a workplace that attracts, motivates, 
develops and retains high calibre employees.
Supported by territory heads of human resources, the managing 
directors of the publishing divisions, the heads of each Group 
function and managing directors of regional offices have 
responsibility for the employment matters (including human 
rights) of their teams. The Chief Executive has overall Board level 
responsibility for employment matters. For example, where 
employment matters have a Group-wide impact or cannot be 
resolved at a lower level in the business then they may be referred  
to the Chief Executive.

Bloomsbury AR2017-proof 6.indd   28 6/12/2017   1:33:41 PM 25133.04    12 June 2017 1:31 PM    Proof 6
Key features of the Group’s employment policies and practices are: 
 ✷ Openness: Bloomsbury provides a high degree of openness 
and transparency on its activities and performance through 
information provided to employees. Employees are kept updated 
frequently on sales, book releases, project achievements, internal 
newsletters, corporate news and feedback from external media 
and other sources. The Bloomsbury Institute arranges regular 
events, which enable staff to meet socially. Weekly and other regular 
team meetings and internal annual conferences bring employees 
together from across the Group’s worldwide sites allowing team 
members to formally and informally share information about the 
business and develop strong working relationships. 
 ✷ Engagement: we promote a friendly collegiate culture in which 
employees are encouraged to discuss their concerns and issues 
with their line managers and senior colleagues. The senior 
management team meets frequently to discuss employee matters 
and is supported by regular operational meetings attended by 
managers covering all of the Group’s worldwide sites. 
 ✷ Ethical behaviour: we expect employees, Directors, 
subcontractors and others to exercise the highest ethical 
standards at all times in respect of the relationships and dealings 
that Bloomsbury has with other third parties. Bloomsbury at  
www.bloomsbury-ir.co.uk publishes:
 — Whistleblower procedures, which it publishes to enable 
employees, other categories of workers and third parties to 
have their concerns confidentially addressed; and
 — Ethical behaviour Group policies such as for anti-bribery and 
corruption, dealing in Bloomsbury shares and anti-slavery 
and human trafficking. Compliance with these policies is an 
employment term with Bloomsbury.
 ✷ Employee development: Bloomsbury is acquisitive and has 
benefited from an intake of high calibre entrepreneurs who 
support the Group’s capacity to innovate. The Group develops 
its management structure to serve the changing needs of the 
business. This creates opportunities for suitably high calibre 
individuals to progress to increasing levels of seniority as they gain 
capabilities and expertise. External recruitment is supported by 
territorial Human Resources functions enabling vacancies across 
sites worldwide to be filled internally where employees of an 
appropriately high calibre seek new opportunities. 
 ✷ Performance and merit: senior employees agree personal 
objectives and are rewarded based on performance determined by 
business results and appraisals. Senior managers are accountable 
for the performance of their teams and determine the most 
appropriate approach to performance management for each 
team. Promotions and external recruitment are based on merit and 
ensure that the most suitable person is selected for each position.
 ✷ Employee participation: the Group offers UK employees the 
opportunity to participate in an all employee HM Revenue & 
Customs approved Sharesave scheme to encourage employee 
participation in the performance and growth of the Group. High 
performing senior managers may also be eligible to participate in 
the Company’s Long Term Incentive Plan. 
 ✷ Flexible working: we encourage family-friendly working 
practices such as flexible working hours and recognise that 
experienced employees returning to work following maternity, 
paternity or other career breaks are an asset. 
 ✷ Equality of opportunity: Bloomsbury has a diverse workforce 
and follows a policy that no employee or other person receives 
more or less favourable treatment on the grounds of gender, 
sexual orientation, colour, race and ethnic origin, nationality, 
religion, disability or age. This extends to any person known to be 
HIV positive. The Human Resources function monitors compliance 
with the policy and with applicable legislative requirements to 
ensure the equality of opportunity in the recruitment, selection and 
promotion of employees. Grievance and disciplinary procedures 
protect employees from discriminatory behaviours and attitudes. 
 ✷ Disabled persons: Group policy is to offer equal treatment in 
respect of the recruitment, training, career development and 
promotion of disabled persons. Should people become disabled 
during the course of their employment, the Group will seek to 
retain their services and to provide retraining where necessary. 
 ✷ Human rights: Bloomsbury is committed to meeting its 
responsibility to respect human rights. The regional Human 
Resources managers monitor for human rights issues and ensure 
any remedial action that is needed is taken promptly. Bloomsbury 
is committed to complying with employment and other legislation 
applicable to the locations in which it employs people, ensuring 
the human rights of individuals are protected. 
Health and safety
The Company Secretary reporting to the Chief Executive in 
respect of Health and Safety (“H&S”) heads an H&S team that 
ensures Group-wide compliance with H&S policy. At least annually, 
the main Board and senior team review H&S including risks 
assessments, developments and incident reports. The H&S team 
works closely with management and employees to ensure that 
the H&S policy is effectively communicated, implemented and 
maintained across the business. Managers of the worldwide sites 
are accountable for ensuring their areas of the business are in 
compliance with H&S policy.
The Group maintains H&S risk assessments and accident books 
for all its locations worldwide (including where there is no local 
legal requirement to do so) and staff are encouraged to report all 
accidents or near misses. 
During the year there were no serious injuries, fatalities or reportable 
incidents. Accidents have typically included infrequent bumps and 
scalds from hot drinks associated with the office environment.

Corporate Responsibility
Environment 
The Board recognises that a responsible approach to the 
environment is attractive to the Group’s existing and prospective 
stakeholders. Customers can require Bloomsbury to demonstrate 
that the Group is a good corporate citizen during the tender process 
for new and existing contracts. 
The Executive Committee (which consists of the Executive Directors 
and the managing directors of the publishing divisions and Group 
functions) have responsibility for environmental matters of their 
teams. These people report to the Chief Executive who has overall 
Board level responsibility for environmental matters and issues. 
The impact on the environment of our business predominantly 
arises from the activities the Group subcontracts to its suppliers 
including the printing, production, distribution, recycling and 
disposal of printed books. Bloomsbury also has office-based editorial, 
product development, sales and administrative activities, which 
operate through an employee workforce based at offices in the UK, 
the US (New York), India (New Delhi) and Australia (Sydney). 
Our policy is to reduce both the financial cost to the business and 
the impact of the business on the environment. We employ specialist 
independent external advisors, Trucost, to monitor our impact on 
the environment. Key areas where we are active in reducing the 
direct and indirect environmental impact of the business include: 
Print on demand: changes in technology and the print supplier 
base are increasingly making it economic to print books at the time 
and in the quantity needed for sale rather than bulk printing and 
holding as warehouse stock. This reduces the CO
2 
generated by 
pulping, recycling and transporting unsold books.
Online print: we are increasingly moving to e-books and online 
products that have very little environmental impact and will 
save on using natural resources. Our strategy embraces digital 
publishing and the potential benefits this may bring to the 
environment. However, we recognise that each physical book on 
a bookshelf represents a significant quantity of captured carbon 
so that the interplay between electronic and physical books on the 
environment is more complex.
Book manufacture: We are committed to reducing the 
environmental impact of our products and controlling the materials 
that go into their composition. Our major suppliers hold FSC, or 
FSC and PEFC accreditation, and we specify on our Purchases 
Orders when FSC-accredited materials are to be used (over 90% of 
purchasing). Where FSC-accredited materials are not available, we 
specify the grade, type, and trade name of the paper, which must 
be from a known and reputable source. We make regular trips to 
their factories to monitor their recycling and other locally relevant 
environmental initiatives. These visits also provide an opportunity 
to view employment practices at first hand, including employee 
minimum age and working conditions. Other required accreditations 
to act as a supplier to the Group are ISO 9001 and ISO 14001. Where 
the manufacture/handling of novelty items is involved, e.g. on our 
Children’s lists, we also require ICTI accreditation. 
Building and office facilities: most of our employees travel to 
work by public transport and we support part-time and home-
working. We provide bicycle storage for staff who ride to work. For 
most employees we have implemented separate recycling bins for 
different waste materials so that a significant proportion of our office 
waste is recycled. Lights are generally fitted with motion detectors 
and our office policy is to turn off lights out of hours when not in use. 
We have previously taken advice from the Carbon Trust and continue 
to apply their recommendations to reduce our carbon footprint. 
For example, we use point-of-use instead of bottled water coolers, 
fit energy efficient lamps, ensure heating systems are regularly 
maintained and programmed efficiently and turn off unnecessary 
electrical equipment out of hours, amongst other measures. 
Environmental targets 
We aim to beat the greenhouse gas and waste production 
normalised tonnes per £million revenue averaged for the previous 
two years. By setting such a target we are focused on continuously 
increasing our efficiency at using natural resources.
Our direct operations are predominantly office-based and have been 
independently assessed as having a low impact on the environment. 
The Group’s consumption of natural resources, although relatively 
minor, is significantly impacted by ambient weather conditions 
beyond our control and by the buildings we lease.

Greenhouse gases
Our independent external advisor, Trucost, has calculated the tables below based on data we have provided. We report on our waste production 
and greenhouse gas emissions aligning with the 2006 Government Guidelines, Environmental Key Performance Indicators, Reporting Guidelines 
for UK Businesses. In respect of greenhouse gases, we report consumption of natural gas, vehicle fuel and electricity in kWh, converted to CO

following the protocols provided by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural affairs (“DEFRA”). Emissions have been categorised 
against the Greenhouse Gas Protocol scopes of reporting. This information is unaudited.
The Board reviews the emissions and environmental impact of the Group as a formal agenda item at least annually.

Details of Directors’ service contracts and Directors’ interests 
in shares, awards and options are shown in the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report. Other than as disclosed in the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report, none of the Directors held any interest, either 
during or at the end of the financial year in any material contract 
or arrangement with the Company or any subsidiary undertaking. 
The terms of termination of the Directors’ contracts are described 
in the Directors’ Remuneration Report, which includes details of any 
agreements by which the Company would pay compensation to 
its Directors for loss of office, for loss of employment or would make 
payments in respect of a change of control of the Company.
Company policy is to appoint Directors to the Board on the 
recommendation of the Nomination Committee. This may be as 
part of the progressive refreshing of the Board, to reappoint a 
Director retiring by rotation, to fill a vacancy arising as a result of a 
retiring Director or as part of measures taken to enhance the skills, 
experience, capability and balance of the Board. 
Directors retiring by rotation at an Annual General Meeting (“AGM”) 
may offer themselves for re-election at the AGM. The Company’s 
Articles of Association (the “Articles”) require as a minimum:
 ✷ new Directors appointed by the Board must offer themselves for 
election at the next AGM;
 ✷ any Director who did not stand for re-election in either of the two 
preceding AGMs must retire by rotation at the next AGM; and 
 ✷ one-third of Directors who have remained in office for the longest 
period since being elected or re-elected must retire by rotation  
at the AGM.
The Board applies the FTSE 350 best practice of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code and requires all Directors to stand for re-election.
The Chairman, on behalf of the Board, confirms that each Director 
proposed for re-election at the AGM continues to contribute 
effectively and to demonstrate commitment to the role (including 
commitment of time for Board and Committee meetings and any 
other duties).
Directors’ indemnities and insurance 
In accordance with the Articles, Directors are granted an indemnity 
from the Company to the extent permitted by law in respect of 
liabilities incurred as a result of their office. The Group maintained 
insurance throughout the year for its Directors and Officer (the 
Company Secretary) against the consequences of actions brought 
against them in relation to their duties for the Group. 
Director conflicts of interest 
Procedures are in place to ensure compliance with the Directors’ 
conflict of interest duties set out in the Companies Act 2006. These 
procedures have been complied with during the year and the Board 
considers that these procedures operate effectively. During the 
year, details of any new potential conflict matters were submitted 
to the Board for consideration and, where appropriate, these were 
approved. Authorised conflicts or potential conflict matters will  
be reviewed by the Board on an ongoing basis.
Charitable and political donations
The Group made charitable donations of £3,500 in respect of the 
year (2016: £4,009). Details of the non-cash support given by the 
charitable and voluntary activities of the Company are as set out  
in the Corporate Responsibility section. 
No political donations were made by the Group during the current 
or previous year. 
Financial instruments 
Details of financial risk management are given in note 22. 
Share capital and rights attaching  
to the Company’s shares 
The share capital of the Company comprises a single class of 
ordinary 1.25 pence shares (“Ordinary shares”). During the year the 
Company allotted new shares as follows:
Fully paid Ordinary 
shares in issue Reason for allotment
As at 1 March 2016 75,081,177 Allotment for deferred 
consideration on the 
Berg Fashion Library 
acquisition 
Allotted 10 August 2016 247,393
As at 28 February 2017 75,328,570
As at the date of this Directors’ Report, there were 75,328,570 fully paid 
issued shares, all listed on the London Stock Exchange, with a further 
25,107,012 Ordinary shares that the Directors are authorised to issue. 
Details of the issued share capital of the Company can be found 
in note 19 together with details of the shares issued and cancelled 
during the year. 
No Ordinary shares carry special rights with regard to control of the 
Company. At a general meeting of the Company every member 
has one vote on a show of hands and on a poll one vote for each 
share held. The notice of general meeting specifies deadlines for 
exercising voting rights either by proxy or present in person in 
relation to resolutions to be passed at a general meeting.
Under the Articles, any share in the Company may be issued with 
such rights or restrictions, whether in regard to dividend, voting, 
return of capital or otherwise as the Company may from time to time 
by ordinary resolution determine (or, in the absence of any such 
determination, as the Directors may determine).

Directors’ Report
No Shareholder is, unless the Board decides otherwise, entitled to 
attend or vote either personally or by proxy at a general meeting or 
to exercise any other rights conferred by being a Shareholder if he 
or she or any person with an interest in shares has been sent a notice 
under section 793 of the Companies Act 2006 (which confers upon 
public companies the power to require information with respect 
to interests in their voting shares) and he or she or any interested 
person failed to supply the Company with the information requested 
within 14 days after delivery of that notice. The Board may also decide 
to apply to the court for an order under section 794 of the Companies 
Act 2006 so that no dividend is payable in respect of those default 
shares and that no transfer of any default shares shall be registered. 
These restrictions end seven days after receipt by the Company of 
a notice of an approved transfer of the shares or all the information 
required by the relevant section 793 notice, whichever is earlier. 
The Directors may refuse to register any transfer which is not a fully 
paid share, although such discretion may not be exercised in a 
way which the Financial Conduct Authority regards as preventing 
dealing in the shares of that class from taking place on an open 
and proper basis. The Directors may likewise refuse any transfer of a 
share in favour of more than four persons jointly. 
The Company is not aware of any other restrictions in the transfer 
of Ordinary shares in the Company other than certain restrictions 
that may from time to time be imposed by laws and regulations (for 
example, insider trading laws); and pursuant to the Listing Rules of the 
Financial Conduct Authority whereby certain employees of the Group 
require approval of the Company to deal in the Company’s shares. 
The Company is not aware of any agreements between 
Shareholders that may result in restrictions on the transfer of the 
securities or voting rights. 
Share dilution 
In respect of dilution limits, the Company adheres to the “Investment 
Association principles of remuneration” issued in October 2016. In 
particular: 
 ✷ The rules of the Company’s Long Term Investment Plan (“LTIP”) 
scheme ensure that; 
 — commitments to issue new shares or re-issue treasury shares 
under executive (discretionary) schemes do not exceed 
5% of the issued Ordinary share capital of the Company 
(adjusted for share issuance and cancellation) in any rolling 
ten-year period; and
 — commitments to issue new shares or re-issue treasury shares, 
when aggregated with awards under all of the Company’s 
other schemes, do not exceed 10% of the issued Ordinary 
share capital (adjusted for share issuance and cancellation) in 
any rolling ten-year period.
 ✷ The Remuneration Committee ensures that appropriate policies 
regarding flow-rates exist in order to spread the potential issue of 
new shares over the life of relevant schemes so that the limit is  
not breached. 
As set out below in this report, the Bloomsbury Employee Benefit 
Trust purchases shares in the market to be used for satisfying LTIP 
awards and other employee share options that vest. 
Authorities to purchase shares, to allot  
shares and pre-emption rights 
Notice of the 2017 Annual General Meeting and explanatory 
foreword set out: 
 ✷ an ordinary resolution renewing the authority for the Directors to 
allot shares under section 551 of the Companies Act 2006; 
 ✷ a special resolution renewing the authority given to the Directors 
to disapply statutory pre-emption rights under section 571 of that 
Act to allow shares to be issued for cash or treasury shares to be 
sold for cash on a non-pre-emptive basis; and 
 ✷ a special resolution renewing the authority given to the Directors 
to purchase the Company’s own shares on the stock market. 
Employee Benefit Trust 
The Bloomsbury Employee Benefit Trust (“EBT”) purchases shares in 
the market to be used for satisfying LTIP awards and other employee 
share options that vest. During the year the EBT held Ordinary shares 
of 1.25 pence in the Company as follows:
Fully paid

held 651,011 Ordinary shares of 1.25 pence in the Company being 
less than 0.9% of the issued Ordinary share capital. The Trustee may 
vote on shares held by the EBT at its discretion, but waives its right  
to a dividend.

Changes of control 
The Group has established close relationships over a long period 
within the publishing markets in which it operates. It relies heavily on 
its goodwill and reputation and in particular on its reputation as an 
autonomous independent publisher with authors, customers and 
key employees that could be affected by a change of control.
The Company’s share incentive schemes (see note 20 for further 
details of the share incentive schemes) contain provisions relating 
to a change of control of the Company following a takeover bid. 
Under these provisions, a change of control of the Company would 
normally be a vesting event, facilitating the exercise of awards, 
typically subject to the discretion of the Remuneration Committee. 
Contracts and arrangements  
essential to the business 
The Group has a diverse base of authors, customers and general 
suppliers so that its dependency on any one individual author, 
customer or supplier is reduced. Primarily for printed books, the 
Group develops longer term relationships with a reduced number 
of business partners, printers and distributors to maximise process 
efficiencies and economies of scale. Failure of a main supplier 
could temporarily disrupt the supply of books to market or result in 
increased cost of working whilst alternative arrangements are made. 
The Group depends on its reputation which strongly influences 
authors and customers in their selection of publisher.
Future developments 
The Group intends to continue to develop its range of publishing 
businesses and services. Although the primary focus of the Group  
is on organic growth, acquisitions in these areas of business will  
be considered. 
Cautionary statement 
Under s417 of the Companies Act 2006, a company’s Directors’ 
Report is required, among other matters, to contain a fair review 
by the Directors of the Group’s business through a balanced and 
comprehensive analysis of the development and performance 
of the business of the Group and the position of the Group at the 
period end, consistent with the size and complexity of the business. 
The Directors’ Report together with all sections incorporated into 
it by reference has been prepared only for the Shareholders of 
the Company. Its sole purpose and use is to assist Shareholders to 
exercise their governance rights. In particular, the Directors’ Report 
has not been audited or otherwise independently verified. The 
Company and its Directors and employees are not responsible for 
any other purpose or use or to any other person in relation to the 
Directors’ Report. 
The Directors’ Report contains indications of likely future 
developments and other forward looking statements that are 
subject to risk factors associated with, among other things, the 
economic and business circumstances occurring from time to 
time in the sectors, countries and business divisions in which the 
Group operates. These factors include, but are not limited to, those 
discussed in the Risk Factors section. These and other factors could 
adversely affect the Group’s results, strategy and prospects. Forward 
looking statements involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. 
They relate to events and/or depend on circumstances in the future 
that could cause actual results and outcomes to differ materially 
from those currently anticipated. No obligation is assumed to 
update any forward looking statements, whether as a result of new 
information, future events or otherwise. 
Auditor 
a) Reappointment of the Auditor 
A resolution to reappoint KPMG LLP as Auditor will be proposed  
at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting. 
b) Statement as to disclosure  
of information to the Auditor 
The Directors who were in office on the date of approval of these 
financial statements have confirmed that, as far as they are aware, 
there is no relevant audit information of which the Auditor is 
unaware. The Directors have each confirmed that they have taken all 
the steps that they ought to have taken as Directors in order to make 
themselves aware of any relevant audit information and to establish 
that it has been communicated to the Auditor.

Directors’ Report
Statement of Directors’ responsibilities 
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and 
the Group and parent Company financial statements in accordance 
with applicable law and regulations. 
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and parent 
Company financial statements for each financial year. Under that 
law they are required to prepare the Group financial statements 
in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(“IFRSs”) as adopted by the European Union (“EU”) and applicable 
law and have elected to prepare the parent Company financial 
statements on the same basis. 
Under company law the Directors must not approve the financial 
statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view 
of the state of affairs of the Group and parent Company and of their 
profit or loss for that period. In preparing each of the Group and 
parent Company financial statements, the Directors are required to: 
 ✷ select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently; 
 ✷ make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and 
prudent;
 ✷ state whether they have been prepared in accordance with  
IFRSs as adopted by the EU; and 
 ✷ prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the 
parent Company will continue in business. 
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the parent 
Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy 
at any time the financial position of the parent Company and 
enable them to ensure that its financial statements comply with the 
Companies Act 2006. They have general responsibility for taking 
such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of 
the Group and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities. 
Under applicable law and regulations, the Directors are also 
responsible for preparing a Strategic Report, Directors’ Report, 
Directors’ Remuneration Report and Corporate Governance 
Statement that complies with that law and those regulations.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of 
the corporate and financial information included on the Company’s 
website, www.bloomsbury-ir.co.uk. Legislation in the United 
Kingdom (“UK”) governing the preparation and dissemination of 
financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
We consider the Annual Report and accounts, taken as a whole, is 
fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information 
necessary for Shareholders to assess the Group’s position and 
performance, business model and strategy. 
Safe harbour
Under the Companies Act 2006, a safe harbour limits the liability 
of Directors in respect of statements in and omissions from the 
Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report. Pages 1 to 134 of the 
Annual Report, and the front and back covers to the Annual Report, 
are included within the Directors’ Report by reference and so are 
included within the safe harbour.
Responsibility statement of the Directors  
in respect of the annual financial report 
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
 ✷ the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the 
applicable set of accounting standards, give a true and fair view 
of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the 
Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation 
taken as a whole; and
 ✷ the Directors’ Report includes a fair review of the development 
and performance of the business and the position of the issuer 
and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as 
a whole, together with a description of the principal risks and 
uncertainties that they face.
Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination 
of financial statements may differ from legislation in other 
jurisdictions. 
The Strategic Report and Directors’ Report were approved  
by the Board on 18 May 2017.

he Board takes its responsibility to achieve sound 
governance of the Bloomsbury Group seriously and 
continuously maintains high standards of corporate 
governance that focus on serving the interests of the shareholders. 
Confirmation of compliance with the code 
The UK Corporate Governance Code edition issued September 
2014 (the “Code”) is published on the Financial Reporting Council’s

provisions of the Code in addition to the Listing Rules of the Financial 
Conduct Authority. 
In addition, the Company has complied fully throughout the year 
with the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code edition 
issued April 2016 as though these provisions had been in effect 
(the provisions are effective for the audit of financial statements for 
periods beginning on or after 17 June 2016).
The following sections provide information on how the Company 
has applied the Code principles and adhered to Code provisions.
Review of Bloomsbury by the  
Financial Reporting Council (“FRC”)
In January 2017, the Chairman was notified that Bloomsbury’s 
Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 29 February 
2016 had been reviewed by the Financial Reporting Council who 
indicated that, based on their review, there were no questions or 
queries that they wished to raise with the Company. In performing 
their review, the FRC noted that they may seek to raise queries in  
the future, should new information become available to them.
Board and the Directors
Board effectiveness 
The Board is responsible to the Shareholders for ensuring that the 
Company is appropriately managed and that it achieves its objectives.

each Director to provide updates on areas of their responsibility and 
items for the chairs of each Board committee to update the Board. 
The Board has approved the matters specifically reserved 
for consideration by the Board. The Board determines the 
responsibilities and authority of its committees, individual Directors 
and the level of authorities delegated to management. The Audit 
Committee, Nomination Committee and Remuneration Committee 
have terms of reference approved by the Board that can be found 
on the Company’s website, www.bloomsbury-ir.co.uk. 
Matters considered at Board meetings during the year have 
typically included: 
 ✷ review and setting of strategy for the Company’s operations; 
 ✷ review of the management accounts, short and long-term 
forecasts, key performance indicators and full year forecasts; 
 ✷ approval of the annual and interim results statements; 
 ✷ review and approval of the annual budget; 
 ✷ regular reports by the Chief Executive, proposals and updates on 
developing business operations, significant investments, major 
initiatives, other organisational changes, environmental impact of 
the business and health and safety;
 ✷ reports of the chairs of Board committees and minutes following 
committee and subcommittee meetings; 
 ✷ review and approval of decisions, transactions and sensitive 
policies that are significant to the Company such as dividends, 
the organisational, legal and capital structure of the Company, 
acquisitions of literary titles, businesses and companies and 
major contracts;
 ✷ risk management and review of the risks of the Company; and 
 ✷ evaluation of the effectiveness of the Board including the 
appropriateness of the terms of reference of Board committees. 
There is a clear division of responsibilities at the head of the 
Company, with the Chairman responsible for the effective operation 
of the Board, encouraging the active participation of all Directors, 
and the Chief Executive responsible for the strategic running of the 
Company’s businesses. The Board has approved formal statements 
describing the role and remit of both the Chairman and Chief 
Executive, which further emphasise this division of responsibilities 
and can be found at www.bloomsbury-ir.co.uk.
The Executive Directors regularly hold formal meetings with senior 
managers as a management team to assist the Chief Executive in 
fulfilling his operational and strategic objectives. This management 
team makes recommendations to the Board and seeks approval 
from the Board where required. The Non-Executive Directors 
constructively challenge and help develop proposals on strategy 
and proposed corporate initiatives such as acquisitions at meetings 
specifically set up for the purpose attended by all Board members. 
All Directors and Board committees have access to the advice and 
services of the Group Company Secretary, who is responsible for 
ensuring that Board procedures are followed and advising the 
Board, through the Chairman, on governance matters and best 
practices. Directors also have access to independent professional 
advice, if required, at the Company’s expense. 
The Chairman has held meetings during the year with the Non-
Executive Directors without the Executive Directors present to discuss 
relevant matters.

Conflicts of interest procedures
A standing item on Board agendas at the start of meetings is for Directors to disclose their significant interests. The Board has reviewed the 
interests of the Directors and maintains a register of areas of potential conflict of interest for Directors. In accordance with the Board’s formal 
policy, should a matter arise where there is a risk of a conflict in the Board discussing matters or making decisions then the Director affected 
by the conflict will absent themselves from the room whilst the matter is considered.
During the year there were no actual or potential conflicts of interest arising that required a Director to absent themselves from a Board meeting.
Director independence 
The Board considers each of the Non-Executive Directors who served during the year to be independent in character and judgement and 
does not consider that there are any relationships or circumstances which affect, or could appear to affect, their independent judgement. 
Board and committee attendance 
The table below shows the attendance at main Board and committee meetings during the year ended 28 February 2017. Further meetings in

Board evaluation 
The Board conducts a formal evaluation annually that considers the 
balance of skills, experience, independence and knowledge of the 
Board, its diversity including gender, how the Board works together 
as a unit and other factors relevant to its effectiveness. The evaluation 
reviews the progress made by the Board in developing strategy and 
the underlying processes supporting the effective operation of the 
Board, including the quality of information it receives. 
The evaluation of the Board and of each individual Director is through: 
 ✷ one-to-one interviews by the Chairman, using evaluation 
questionnaires to facilitate discussion, of each Director to appraise 
the performance of the Director on the Board and to discuss any 
improvements needed to the Board processes;
 ✷ the Senior Independent Director evaluates the performance  
of the Chairman through confidential discussions with the other 
Directors and a one-to-one interview with the Chairman;
 ✷ the chair of each Board committee leads the evaluation of their 
committee and reports the findings and recommendations  
to the Board; 
 ✷ the Chief Executive conducts additional management appraisals 
of the Executive Directors and the senior management team; 
 ✷ the Board discusses the findings and recommendations for 
improvement actions in respect of all the evaluations of the 
Board, each Director, the Board committees and the processes 
supporting the Board; and
 ✷ the Nomination Committee considers the conclusions of  
the Board evaluation.
Upon completing the interviews, the Chairman and Senior 
Independent Director make formal reports to the Board on the 
findings with recommendations for actions to be implemented by 
the Board, by individual Directors, by the Group Company Secretary 
and by senior management in the business. Where needed, the 
Chairman holds confidential follow-up meetings with individual 
Directors to address concerns they have raised or to address 
concerns raised about them. The Board monitors progress relating 
to implementing the actions arising from the Board evaluation.

Board committees are evaluated annually against the terms of 
reference for the committee and against adherence to relevant 
regulation such as the Code. The committees approve the 
evaluations and make recommendations to the Board on any 
changes needed to the Board processes and terms of reference.
The conclusions of the Board evaluations are considered by 
the Nomination Committee when reviewing the structure and 
composition of the Board and succession planning. As a result of 
the review of performance, the Chairman on behalf of the Board 
confirms that each of the Directors proposed for re-election at 
the AGM continues to contribute effectively and to demonstrate 
commitment to the role (including commitment of time for Board 
and committee meetings and any other duties). 
Examples of the matters arising from the 2016/17 Board and 
committee evaluations include:
 ✷ The Board is working well; there is a good level of commitment 
among Non-Executive Directors and they bring a relevant 
range of skills to the Board. There is a sense of openness in Board 
meetings with all Directors able to voice their thoughts effectively. 
 ✷ The Board and Non-Executive Directors have engaged with the 
senior management team below Board level and more time 
should be set aside to further this engagement. The Board should 
increase its focus on development of the talent pool below 
the senior management team to maintain and even increase 
momentum/energy in the business.
 ✷ The Board will keep under review what are the right performance 
indicators for the business as the marketplace evolves and in 
view of the increasing delivery of our content digitally under the 
Bloomsbury 2020 digital resource growth strategy.
 ✷ Discussing the significant risks and mitigation should be a 
standing item on the agenda for Board meetings.
Relations with Shareholders 
The Board, led by the Chairman, is responsible for ensuring an open 
dialogue with Shareholders based on the mutual understanding  
of objectives. 
The Annual Report, interim reports, AGM, market updates and 
post-results announcement presentations are the principal means 
through which the Company communicates its strategy and 
performance to Shareholders. All Shareholders are welcome to 
attend the AGM, at which senior managers give presentations on 
the business and investors are encouraged to take advantage of 
the opportunity given to ask questions. The chairs of the Audit, 
Remuneration and Nomination Committees attend the AGM and  
are available to answer questions.
The Company maintains an active dialogue with its institutional 
Shareholders and City analysts through a planned programme of 
investor relations. The programme includes formal presentations 
of results and post-results meetings with the major Shareholders 
and other investors who request meetings. The presentations are 
made available at www.bloomsbury-ir.co.uk. The meetings and 
presentations provide an opportunity for Shareholders to ask 
questions and to meet Directors. The outcome of regular meetings 
with the main Shareholders, presentations and post-results meetings 
is reported to the Board. This includes both feedback from individual 
Directors and feedback collated from discussions by the Company’s 
corporate broker or public relations representative with the main 
Shareholders and City analysts. The Company’s corporate broker 
provides regular analysis of Shareholder holdings. Feedback from 
Shareholders and other members of the Shareholder corporate 
governance community is used to help review and develop 
Bloomsbury’s procedures. 
The Chairman writes to the significant Shareholders each year to 
provide them with the opportunity to meet and discuss corporate 
governance matters, including remuneration, and to raise any 
concerns. Following a meeting, the Chairman reports to the 
Board on the discussions held, including any feedback from the 
Shareholders.
During the year, the Chairman met with one significant Shareholder 
and discussed governance and strategy.
Training and development of the Directors 
The Board evaluation, including Director appraisals by the 
Chairman, considers whether each Director has refreshed their 
skills and knowledge sufficiently and provides an opportunity for 
Directors to identify where training and development can assist 
them in the performance of their duties. Development may include, 
for example, meetings with senior managers to gain an improved 
understanding of the business. 
Directors are provided with extensive Director knowledge checklists 
to help them self-assess their personal learning needs and they 
have access to numerous relevant publications by Bloomsbury. 
Formal training is provided to the Board by the External Auditor and 
external remuneration consultants, who assign time in meetings 
to provide updates on and to explain topical areas of corporate 
governance, remuneration, auditing and financial reporting. 
The Board is progressively refreshed, bringing in new skills and 
experience to the pool of knowledge on the Board from which each 
Director on the Board can learn. 
Nomination Committee 
The Committee comprises the Non-Executive Chairman of the Board, 
who chairs the Committee, the three Independent Non-Executive 
Directors and the Chief Executive.
The Committee operates under terms of reference agreed by the 
whole Board, which are available on the Company’s website  
www.bloomsbury-ir.co.uk. Its role is to review the composition of the 
Board, consider succession planning and nominate to the Board, 
for approval, candidates to fill Board vacancies. The Committee 
determines the Directors who should stand for re-election at the 
AGM in accordance with the Articles of Association of the Company. 
The Board formally approves the appointment of all new Directors 
on the recommendation of the Committee.

Board appointment process
The Board adopts a formal and rigorous approach to the 
appointment of Directors. The following outlines the Board 
appointment process typical to that followed: 
 ✷ the need to appoint a new Director is identified by an existing 
Board member retiring or by a review by the Nomination 
Committee of the Board’s structure, balance, succession planning 
and the need for progressive refreshing which may take account 
of the findings of the annual Board evaluation of the skills and 
capabilities of Board members; 
 ✷ the Nomination Committee considers the strengths and 
weaknesses of the Board and the senior management team and 
the needs of the business in order to define the experience and 
capabilities required for a new appointment;
 ✷ the Nomination Committee determines the recruitment process;
 ✷ for appointing independent Non-Executive Directors, an 
independent external recruitment consultant is appointed 
and performs an extensive search to identify candidates 
meeting criteria agreed with the Nomination Committee. The 
external consultant performs initial interviews with candidates 
and carries out background research on them to formulate 
a shortlist to put forward to the Committee together with an 
evaluation of each candidate;
 ✷ several Directors separately interview each candidate and feed 
back to the external consultant on the interview evaluation of the 
candidate;
 ✷ multiple references are taken and further background checks are 
made on candidates;
 ✷ the Nomination Committee sitting together selects the final 
candidate and makes a recommendation to the Board on their 
appointment; and
 ✷ the Board makes decisions on appointments following 
recommendations by the Committee.
The Group Company Secretary ensures that new Directors receive 
a full, formal and tailored induction on joining the Board. Newly 
appointed Directors are provided with induction packs and one-to-
one meetings are arranged for them with the senior management 
team. Directors are provided with a detailed knowledge self-
assessment questionnaire to help them consider any further training 
needs they may have.
The significant Shareholders are invited to contact or meet with a 
new Chairman. Any request by a Shareholder to meet with a new 
Director would be considered by the Board. Investors will typically 
get the opportunity to meet with Directors at AGMs, at presentations 
and meetings following the announcements of the results.
Re-election of Directors 
The Board may require all Directors to retire by rotation at an AGM 
and stand for re-election.
As a minimum, per the Articles, all Directors are subject to 
reappointment by the Shareholders at the first Annual General 
Meeting after their appointment and thereafter at intervals of no 
more than three years. Starting from the 2016 AGM on 19 July 2016, 
all Directors will stand for re-election annually.
Non-Executive Directors are appointed for periods of up to four 
years upon the end of which their appointment terminates subject 
to their reappointment by the Board. A policy is followed of 
progressive refreshing of the Board and the Independent Non-
Executive Director team, aligned with the changing needs of the 
business.
The notice periods by the Company of the Directors are set out in the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report.
Board diversity
The Board aims for at least one-third, or the nearest number 
to a third, of Directors on the Board to be women. The Board 
presently comprises two women out of eight Directors. The Board 
is progressively refreshed and new appointments are selected by 
the Nomination Committee using independent search consultants 
based on merit as the best candidate for the role.
Remuneration Committee 
The Remuneration Committee comprises two Independent Non-
Executive Directors and the Non-Executive Chairman of the Board 
and is chaired by Jill Jones. The role of the Committee is set out in the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report.

Operation of the Audit Committee
The Committee comprises three Independent Non-Executive 
Directors. The Chair of the Committee is John Warren, a Fellow of the 
Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales. The Board 
is satisfied that the experience and qualifications of John Warren 
are sufficient for him to meet the experience and qualification 
requirements to be a member of the Audit Committee, with recent 
and relevant financial experience under the Code and the UK listing 
authority Listing Rules appropriate to the Company.
The Audit Committee includes at least one Independent Non-
Executive Director who is an expert in the field of publishing which 
ensures the Committee as a whole has competence relevant to the 
sector in which the Company operates.
The Committee typically invites the External Auditor, Internal 
Auditor, Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive, Finance Director 
and the other Executive Directors to attend meetings. It meets at 
least once in respect of each reporting period. There is a standing 
item on the agenda for each meeting for the External Auditor to 
meet the Committee alone without management present, which 
provides an opportunity for Committee members and the External 
Auditor to share any concerns that they may have.
The terms of reference of the Committee can be found on the 
Company’s website, www.bloomsbury-ir.co.uk, and set out the 
role and authority of the Committee. Responsibilities and matters 
reserved for the Committee include:
 ✷ to monitor the integrity of the financial statements of the 
Company and any formal announcements relating to the 
Company’s financial performance, reviewing significant financial 
reporting judgements contained in them;
 ✷ to review the Company’s internal financial controls and, unless 
expressly addressed by a separate Board risk committee composed 
of independent Directors, or by the Board itself, to review the 
Company’s internal control and risk management systems;
 ✷ to monitor and review the effectiveness of the Company’s internal 
audit function;
 ✷ to make recommendations to the Board, for it to put to the 
Shareholders for their approval in general meeting, in relation  
to the appointment, reappointment and removal of the External 
Auditor and to approve the remuneration and terms  
of engagement of the External Auditor; 
 ✷ to review and monitor the External Auditor’s independence 
and objectivity and the effectiveness of the audit process, taking 
into consideration relevant UK professional and regulatory 
requirements;
 ✷ to develop and implement policy on the engagement of the 
External Auditor to supply non-audit services, taking into account 
relevant ethical guidance regarding the provision of non-audit 
services by the external audit firm;
 ✷ to report to the Board, identifying any matters in respect of which 
it considers that action or improvement is needed and making 
recommendations as to the steps to be taken; and
 ✷ to report to the Board on how it has discharged its responsibilities.
The Committee’s annual evaluation, which forms part of the 
Board evaluation, reviews how the Committee has discharged 
its responsibilities. The findings of the evaluation and 
recommendations arising are reported to the Board. 
The Committee formally reviews the whistleblowing arrangements 
of the Company by which staff may, in confidence, raise concerns 
about possible improprieties in matters of financial reporting 
or other matters. The Committee’s objective is to ensure that 
arrangements are in place for the proportionate and independent 
investigation of such matters and for appropriate follow-up action. 
The Group’s whistleblower policy and procedures are found 
at www.bloomsbury-ir.co.uk and are available to all staff.
The Committee reviews the plans, findings and recommendations 
of the Internal Auditor, and management’s responses to internal 
audit recommendations. It ensures that the internal audit function 
is adequately resourced in light of the system of risk management 
and has appropriate standing within the Company. The Committee 
approves the appointment and removal of the Head of Internal 
Audit, who for the financial year up to the time of signing this report 
was the Group Company Secretary.
External Auditor
The Audit Committee has primary responsibility for making a 
recommendation on the appointment, reappointment and removal 
of the External Auditor.

and the Board appointed KPMG LLP as External Auditor for the Group 
and for the Company for audits for the year ended 28 February 2014 
and onwards. The detailed tender process followed is set out in the 
Annual Report for the year ended 28 February 2014.
The Committee assesses the effectiveness of the audit process as an 
item on the agenda for Committee meetings. In forming its view on 
the effectiveness of the audit process the Committee considered: 
 ✷ the quality of audit work undertaken and resulting audit findings;
 ✷ whether the Auditor’s scope has been limited and whether the 
Auditor has had sufficient resources to complete their agreed 
work programme; and 
 ✷ the independence of the External Auditor.
The annual evaluation of the Board considered the effectiveness 
of how the external audit process integrated with the business 
processes for the Group.
The Committee is satisfied that KPMG has performed an effective 
audit that provided the Committee with adequate assurance.

Internal control and risk management 
The Code requires the Directors to assess at least annually the 
effectiveness of the Group’s systems of internal control, which 
include financial, operational and compliance controls, and the 
system of risk management. This review has been carried out by the 
Audit Committee on behalf of the Board. 
The Board has overall responsibility for the Group’s system of 
internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness, for setting policy 
on internal control, and for reviewing the effectiveness of internal 
control. The role of management is to implement Board policies 
on risk and control. The system of internal control is designed to 
manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business 
objectives, and can only provide reasonable, and not absolute, 
assurance against material financial misstatement or loss. 
The Board operates both formally, through Board and committee 
meetings, and informally, through regular contact amongst 
Directors. High level decisions on such matters as strategy, financial 
performance and reporting, dividends, risk management, major 
capital expenditure, major acquisitions and disposals are reserved 
for the Board or Board committees. For its regular formal meetings, 
the Board receives appropriate information in advance from 
management. Other decisions outside of these areas are delegated 
to the Company’s management, who report to the Chief Executive. 
The Board has put in place an ongoing process for identifying, 
evaluating and managing the significant risks faced by the Company. 
This process has been in place for the year under review and up to 
the date of approval of this Annual Report. The process is regularly 
reviewed by the Audit Committee on behalf of the Board to ensure 
that the procedures implemented continue to be effective and, 
where appropriate, recommendations are made to management 
to improve the procedures. The Company’s system of internal 
financial control aims to safeguard the Company’s assets, and ensure 
that proper accounting records are maintained, that the financial 
information used within the business and for publication is reliable, 
that business risks are identified and managed and that compliance 
with appropriate legislation and regulation is maintained. 
Internal control and risk management framework 
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements of the 
Company is the responsibility of the Finance Director and is overseen 
by the Audit Committee and the Board. This includes responsibility 
for ensuring appropriate internal controls are in place over financial 
reporting processes and related IT systems. The Audit Committee 
monitors the risks and associated controls over financial reporting 
processes, including the consolidation process. 
Relevant features of the Company’s system of internal controls and 
risk management in relation to the financial reporting process and 
preparation of the Group financial statements include: 
 ✷ Organisational culture: The Company has a highly skilled, 
professional and committed workforce. The Board is committed 
to developing a culture of openness, integrity, competence 
and responsibility. The Board concentrates mainly on strategic 
and significant organisational issues, approving objectives 
and monitoring, at a high level, the financial and operational 
performance against objectives.
 ✷ Organisational structure: The One Global Bloomsbury structure 
comprises the worldwide publishing divisions supported by Group 
functions (finance, IT, production, sales and marketing) which 
provide an internal control service to the business as internal 
control pillars within the Group’s internal control framework. 
 ✷ Risk and control review: The Executive Committee (which 
comprises the divisional and Group function heads and Executive 
Directors) maintains Group level and Group function level risk 
analysis and control assessments for each risk. This ensures that 
risks and control issues from around the Group worldwide are 
reported openly to the senior management team and addressed. 
The Board has regularly reviewed the significant Group and 
functional risks to ensure appropriate action is taken to address 
the risks. The Audit Committee reviews the risks, in particular the 
financial risks and issues that could impact on reporting, when 
considering the financial statements.

Corporate Governance
 ✷ Financial internal control and risk review: The Finance Director 
formally reviews the internal financial controls, taking account of 
the risks within the financial information systems, and reports the 
findings of this review to the Audit Committee. Analytical review of 
operating results and detailed control questionnaires completed 
for the publishing divisions and overseas offices supplement 
management’s knowledge of the business for the evaluation of 
the risks and assessment of the internal financial controls. The 
Audit Committee also receives reports on the internal controls 
and risks provided by the Internal Auditor. The Audit Committee 
receives other reports from management relevant to the internal 
financial controls such as reports on the progress of key projects. 
 ✷ Authority levels: The Board maintains a detailed register of 
delegated authorities and sets the level of authority required, 
before Board approval is needed, to commit the Company or 
to undertake transactions. It also approves budgets and other 
performance targets. The publishing divisions and Group 
functions operate within these authority levels and budgets.  
The Executive Directors determine the authority to be delegated 
to individual managers.
 ✷ Financial management reporting: The Board approves the 
annual Group budget. Sales are reported daily, weekly and 
monthly. Financial results of the business operations are reported 
monthly and compared to budget and forecasts. Detailed 
forecasts for the Company are updated regularly and reviewed  
by the Board. 
 ✷ Book title acquisition procedures: Established procedures, 
such as the review and approval by an Executive Director of 
acquisition proposals of rights to new books, are operated within 
set authority limits and used for transactions in the ordinary 
course of business. Acquisitions exceeding delegated authority 
limits require approval by the Board. Significant acquisitions of 
companies and businesses are approved by the Board. The Board 
has set authorised limits for the total author advances held on the 
Statement of Financial Position as a percentage of net assets and 
for the total value of committed but unpaid advances.
 ✷ Accountability: The Company has clearly defined lines of 
responsibility headed by the Chief Executive and Executive 
Committee to control the publishing divisions and business 
functions. Detailed operational and financial performance 
data are monitored by supervisory management to ensure the 
performance of operations is in line with targets. The reasons for 
variances and underperformance are established by supervisory 
line management and followed up with managers and staff.
 ✷ Overseas offices: Each overseas office has a local manager 
or managing director who is responsible for operational 
effectiveness and local internal controls. Accounting for the 
Group is centralised and overseas subsidiaries hold limited cash 
balances. Senior managers and Executive Directors regularly 
visit the overseas offices and the finance function conducts 
operational review visits to review the procedures. The Board has 
implemented a Group Whistleblower Policy and an Anti-bribery 
and Corruption Policy which are communicated to all staff 
worldwide and may be found on the Company’s website at  
www.bloomsbury-ir.co.uk. 
 ✷ Internal Audit: An internal audit function uses internal control 
questionnaires (“ICQ”) comprising around 1,000 control questions 
to assess the internal controls across the Group worldwide twice 
annually. Process quality scores for each Group process are 
calculated from ICQ assessments and reported regularly to senior 
management and at each Audit Committee meeting. The Audit 
Committee considers reports from External and Internal Audit to 
ensure that adequate measures are being taken by management 
to address risk and control issues. The Group Company Secretary 
is the Head of Internal Audit and reports to the Chair of the Audit 
Committee and the Chief Executive in respect of risk management 
and internal audit work. 
Significant failings or weaknesses in the internal controls
Pursuant to provision C.2.3 of the Code, the Committee concludes 
from its review of the systems of risk management and internal 
control that the internal controls are adequate for the business of 
Bloomsbury, including all the Group companies. From this review, 
the Committee has not identified any significant internal control 
weaknesses that challenge the Group in achieving its objectives.
The One Global Bloomsbury structure of worldwide publishing 
divisions supported by Group functions ensures an effective 
internal control framework and provides a platform for integrating 
acquisitions as the Group grows and evolves.
Management assigns and monitors control effectiveness ratings 
to the internal controls across all the business processes worldwide 
based on the benefits expected from making improvements given 
the investment of resources that would be required. Based on this, 
management has identified that the Group’s information systems and 
stock management are priority process areas for improvement to help 
increase productivity and effectiveness of the business. Consequently, 
investment in improvements is being made in these areas.

Significant issues in relation  
to the financial statements 
In accordance with Code Provision C.3.8, the following are the issues 
that the Committee considers significant in relation to the financial 
statements and how these issues are addressed. 
For each item below, the Committee has reviewed the assumptions 
and judgements made and have considered the risks to the integrity 
of information reported in the financial statements. In accordance 
with the Code, the Committee has taken account of the disclosure 
of the issues when forming an opinion on the fair, balanced and 
understandable view of the Annual Report.
1. Inventories provision
The level of inventories and the inventory provision are set out in 
note 14 to the financial statements.
For each line of inventory, a provision is made against the cost of 
the inventory, where the Net Realisable Value is less than cost. Net 
Realisable Value is the estimated selling price for inventories less all 
estimated costs of completion and costs necessary to make the sale. 
The estimated selling price for each inventory line is a judgement 
based mainly on recent selling patterns for a title. A formulaic 
provision is applied to each inventory line where titles have been 
published for more than one year. The Committee considered the 
judgements applied to estimating the selling prices of inventory 
and determined that the total level of provision for all inventory 
was adequate.
2. Sales return provision
The level of sales return provision is set out in note 15 to the 
financial statements.
Printed books are normally sold on a sale-or-return basis. The timing 
of returns of unsold books is uncertain. A provision is made against 
sales for the expected future returns of books that have not occurred 
by the end of an accounting period. This provision is a judgement 
based on the assumption of the time lag following a sale before a 
return is made and the calculation of the historic returns rate. 
The Committee considered the judgements made in estimating 
the key assumptions and determined that the sales return 
provision was adequate.
3. Revenue recognition
Included within rights and services revenues are licences over 
Bloomsbury’s IP to third parties, as stated in note 3 to the financial 
statements. The revenue recognised from these licences in any 
one period mainly reflects the value of contracted performance 
obligations satisfied in that period. The revenue recognition 
treatment for more complex deals is reviewed by the External 
Auditor as soon as contracted.
The Committee considered the judgements applied to the most 
significant licences and determined that the revenue recognition 
treatment was appropriate.
4. Valuation of goodwill on acquisition of companies
The carrying value of goodwill arising on the acquisition of 
companies (or groups of companies) by the Group is set out in note 
10 to the financial statements. 
Goodwill is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. For the 
purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the 
Group’s cash generating units (“CGUs”) that is expected to benefit 
from the synergies of the combination. If the recoverable amount of 
a CGU is less than its carrying value, an impairment charge reduces 
goodwill and is recognised in the Income Statement. There is more 
detail on this process in note 2j to these financial statements. The 
recoverable amount is based on future cash flow projections based on 
a Board approved budget and the five-year plan. 
The Committee considered the judgements and assumptions made 
in selecting CGUs and performing the impairment tests for each 
CGU, to ensure that the carrying value for goodwill was adequately 
supported. In particular, the Committee reviewed the annual 
budget and five-year plan for the Group, as approved by the Board, 
which is used as the basis for forecasting future cash flows from the 
CGUs. The Committee concurred that no impairment was necessary.
5. Unearned advance provision
Trade and other receivables in the Group Statement of Financial 
Position, in note 15 to the financial statements, include net unearned 
author advances of £24.8 million (2016: £22.2 million).
A provision is made against gross advances (paid and payable) to the 
extent that they are not expected to be fully earned from anticipated 
future sales of a title. This provision is a judgement that depends on 
recent royalty earnings and known future new format releases.
The Committee considered the assumptions made for the titles 
with the largest net advances across the Group to ensure that the 
net carrying value of advances was adequately supported and 
concluded that it was.

Directors’ Remuneration Report
Annual Statement
Dear Shareholder
I am delighted to present the Directors’ Remuneration Report for Bloomsbury Publishing Plc for the year ended 28 February 2017  
(the “Report”). The Report has been prepared on behalf of the Bloomsbury Board by the Remuneration Committee (the “Committee”)  
and has been approved by the Board. 
Outline of the Remuneration Report
The Report is split into the following two sections:
 ✷ Part A, the Remuneration Policy Report, which sets out the Remuneration Policy for the Executive and Non-Executive Directors which, 
subject to Shareholders’ approval, operates from 1 March 2017 and will become formally effective from the 2017 AGM; and 
 ✷ Part B, the Annual Report on Remuneration, which discloses how the Remuneration Policy will be implemented for the year ending  
28 February 2018 and how it was implemented for the year ended 28 February 2017.
The Annual Report on Remuneration will be subject to an advisory Shareholder vote at the forthcoming AGM on 18 July 2017. The 
Directors’ Remuneration Policy Report will be subject to a binding vote at this AGM and will be renewed in three years (sooner if changes 
are made to the policy).
Performance and reward for 2016/17
Bloomsbury delivered another good performance for the year ended 28 February 2017 against the background of a publishing 
marketplace that continues to evolve. The Committee set a stretching threshold target for profit of £12 million based on the City analysts’ 
consensus forecast. Profit above the threshold accrues into a bonus pool (until the pool becomes fully funded). Pre-bonus profit in the 
year was £13 million, which resulted in a bonus pool shared by the Executive Directors and 31 staff of £0.99 million. This is equivalent to 
paying 41.8% of the maximum bonus for the participants in the bonus scheme before adjusting their bonuses for achievement  
of individual strategic and personal objectives.
The PSP awards granted on 23 December 2014 (due to vest in December 2017) is expected to lapse: for 50% of the awards with an EPS growth 
target, the target was not achieved; and for 50% of the awards with a TSR target, the formulaic underpin EPS growth target was not achieved. 
Prior to his appointment to the Board, Jonathan Glasspool was granted options under the CSOP scheme on 24 December 2014. These options 
were determined will lapse as the formulaic underpin EPS growth target was not achieved.
Remuneration plans for 2017/18
The Committee continually reviews the Executive Director Remuneration Policy to ensure it attracts, motivates and retains high quality 
executives. For 2017/18, the Committee has concluded that:
 ✷ In line with the general workforce for the Group an annual increase in basic salaries of 2.25% has been applied to the Executive Directors, 
other than for Wendy Pallot. For Wendy Pallot the increase is 5.8% to reflect the additional responsibilities which she has assumed during 
the year with respect to the US and Indian businesses. This follows Richard Charkin’s decision to reduce his time commitment to around 
two days a week at the start of the financial year.
 ✷ There will be no changes to other elements of fixed pay (i.e. benefit and pension provision).
 ✷ The structure and quantum of the annual bonus arrangement continues to work well as an incentive. Therefore, the maximum bonus 
potential will remain at 100% of salary and the structure of the 2017/18 annual bonus will be broadly similar to that operated for 2016/17 
with 70% based on profit before tax and 30% on strategic objectives. We will introduce a digital revenue target into the strategic objectives 
with an opportunity of 10% of the total bonus. This means that for 2017/18 the total weighting on financial objectives (profit and revenue) 
increases to 80%. To reflect the importance of achieving Bloomsbury 2020 milestones and other strategic objectives determined by the 
Board, the strategic bonus (i.e. 30%) will accrue separately to the financial bonus. This enables the Committee to reward executives for 
achieving key strategic objectives linked to long-term performance. The Committee will have the discretion to reduce any payment under 
the bonus if they feel payment is not merited based on the overall performance of the Group or if it is not affordable. A clawback provision 
will operate in respect of the annual bonus for the Executive Directors.
 ✷ The current long-term incentive scheme provides strong alignment between management and Shareholders and there will be no 
changes made to the quantum of awards or how the plan operates. The performance conditions attached to awards made in 2017/18 
have been amended; 50% of the awards will be continue to be based on earnings per share (“EPS”) growth relative to RPI while the other 
50% will be based on stretching targets for Return on Capital Employed (“ROCE”), replacing the previous TSR condition. To ensure a 
continued focus on Shareholder return the ROCE award will be subject to an underpin. Prior to agreeing the vesting level of an award 
the Committee will consider performance against a dashboard of measures including relative TSR and other measures the Committee 
considers to be relevant at the time of vesting. Where performance under any of these measures is considered unacceptable, the 
Committee may reduce, or cancel, an award. In line with best practice, LTIP awards will be granted subject to a two-year post-vesting 
holding period. The holding period will continue to apply should an Executive Director leave Bloomsbury.

Shareholder feedback
In applying the Remuneration Policy, the Committee’s priority is to ensure that the interests of the Shareholders and, where beneficial to 
the Shareholders, other stakeholders are served whilst ensuring the Executive Directors and senior management team are treated fairly. In 
reaching its decisions the Committee takes into consideration all the views and feedback it receives from Shareholders and other members of 
the Shareholder corporate governance community. 
In conclusion, the Committee considers that the Remuneration Policy will incentivise the sustainable delivery of the Board’s strategy, strong 
financial performance and the creation of long-term Shareholder value.

Directors’ Remuneration Report
PART A – REMUNERATION POLICY REPORT
Introduction
The Committee has adopted the principles of good governance relating to Directors’ remuneration as set out in the UK Corporate 
Governance Code issued in September 2014 (the “Code”). This Report, together with the Annual Report on Remuneration, complies with 
the Companies Act 2006 (the “Act”), the UKLA Listing Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority and Directors’ Remuneration: the Large 
and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) (Amendment) Regulations 2013. The Company has complied with the 
provisions of the Code relating to Directors’ remuneration throughout the year. 
In determining the Remuneration Policy the Committee applies the key principles that remuneration should:
 ✷ attract and retain suitably high calibre Executive Directors and ensure that they are motivated to achieve the highest levels of performance 
including delivering strategic initiatives and objectives;
 ✷ align the interests of the Executive Directors with those of the Shareholders; and
 ✷ not pay more than is necessary.
Consideration of Shareholder views
The Committee considers Shareholder feedback received in relation to the AGM each year. This feedback, plus any additional feedback 
received during any meetings from time to time, is then considered as part of the Group’s annual review of the Remuneration Policy. In 
addition, the Remuneration Committee will seek to engage directly with major Shareholders and their representative bodies should any 
material changes be made to the Remuneration Policy. Major Shareholders and representative bodies were consulted in early 2017 in respect 
of proposed changes to this policy.
Details of votes cast for and against the resolution to approve last year’s Directors’ Remuneration Report and any matters discussed with 
Shareholders during the year are set out in the Annual Report on Remuneration.
Consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the Group
The Committee considers the general basic salary increase for the broader employee population when determining the annual salary 
increases for the Executive Directors. Employees have not been consulted in respect of the design of the Group’s Executive Director 
Remuneration Policy, although the Committee will keep this under review. 
The relative increase in CEO pay for the year under review, as compared with that of the general workforce, is set out in the Annual Report on 
Remuneration. The Committee also considers environmental, social and governance issues and risk when reviewing executive pay quantum 
and structure.

Notes to the summary policy table:
1. A description of how the Company intends to implement this in 2017/18 is set out in the Annual Report on Remuneration on pages 58 
to 67.
2. Remuneration arrangements below Board level tend to be skewed more towards fixed pay with less of a focus on share-based long-
term incentive pay. These differences have arisen from the development of remuneration arrangements that are market competitive 
for the various categories of individuals.
3. The choice of the performance metrics applicable to the annual bonus or long-term incentive scheme will reflect the Company strategy 
at the time of grant. 
4. The all-employee Sharesave scheme does not have performance conditions. 
5. For the avoidance of doubt, in approving this Directors’ Remuneration Policy, authority is given to the Company to honour any 
commitments entered into with current or former Directors (such as the payment of a pension, payment of last year’s annual bonus 
or the vesting/exercise of share awards granted in the past). Details of any payments to former Directors will be set out in the Annual 
Report on Remuneration as they arise.

Discretion of the Committee
The Committee will operate the annual bonus and PSP schemes according to the respective scheme rules (or relevant documents) and in 
accordance with the applicable regulations. Executive Director incentive schemes and remuneration plans are designed to align the interests 
of management with those of the Shareholders and are kept as simple as possible. Where the outcome of incentives is not as the Committee 
intended it may use its independent discretion to intervene and modify the outcomes to align the interests of management with those of the 
Shareholders.
The Committee has adopted terms of reference based on best practice and may apply its independent discretion in a number of ways 
through its conditional approval including for:
Share-based incentives
 ✷ granting of all discretionary share awards/options and determining the participants (including for Executive Directors and below  
the Board), timing of grants, size of awards, performance conditions and how vested awards should be satisfied;
 ✷ running Sharesave to ensure that the scheme is run within applicable dilution limits;
 ✷ vesting of all discretionary share awards/options including the timing and level of vesting;
 ✷ non-routine vesting of all-employee share options in the unlikely event needed to ensure the effective operation of the schemes under  
the applicable regulations and rules;
Annual bonuses
 ✷ making annual bonus awards to the Executive Directors and determining the level of awards, targets and conditions and calibration  
of bonuses;
 ✷ the Group bonus pool and the level of bonus payouts for the Executive Directors and managers below Board level who participate in the 
Group bonus scheme;
 ✷ bonus payments to the Executive Directors to determine the level of payments following the assessment of performance measures and 
achievement against bonus objectives;
Routine payments
 ✷ all changes to Executive Director basic salaries, pensions and eligibility to benefits; and
Non-routine payments
 ✷ all non-routine payments to the Executive Directors including but not limited to leavers, to new appointees and in respect of a change  
of control.

Directors’ Remuneration Report
Wendy Pallot Jonathan Glasspool
Notes:
1. The minimum performance scenario comprises the fixed elements of remuneration only, based on salary, pension and car allowance  
as per the policy for 2017/18.
2. The target level of bonus is taken to be 50% of the maximum bonus opportunity (100% of salary), and the target level of PSP vesting 
is assumed to be 50% of the face value assuming a normal grant level (100% of salary). These values are included in addition to the 
components/values of minimum remuneration.
3. Maximum assumes full bonus payout (100% of salary) and the full face value of the PSP (100% of salary), in addition to fixed components 
of remuneration.
4. For simplicity, no share price growth has been factored into the calculations. The value of any Sharesave awards and notional dividends 
accruing on vested LTIP shares has been excluded.
Executive Director share ownership guidelines
Under the guidelines the Executive Directors are expected to build and maintain a shareholding valued at 100% of basic salary with no upper 
limit on the number of shares they may hold. A time limit is not set to accumulate the shareholding; however, Executive Directors are required 
to retain all shares arising from vested PSP awards (net of tax) or purchase shares until the shareholding guideline is met. The number of 
shares needed to satisfy the shareholding is recalculated annually at the close of the next business day following the announcement of the 
full year results taking account of changes to basic salary.
Remuneration earned by the Executive Directors from outside appointments
Significant external appointments of the Directors are given in the bibliographic details on pages 34 to 35. The Committee considers that 
the external appointments of the Executive Directors have no detrimental impact on the performance of their duties. The Committee has 
approved that each Executive Director may retain his or her remuneration earned from external appointments up to £15,000 per year.
Approach to recruitment and promotions
The remuneration package for a new Executive Director would be set in accordance with the terms of the Company’s prevailing approved 
Remuneration Policy at the time of appointment and take into account the skills and experience of the individual, the market rate for a 
candidate of that experience and the importance of securing the relevant individual.
Salary would be provided at such a level as required to attract the most appropriate candidate and may be set initially at a below mid-market 
level on the basis that it may progress towards the mid-market level once expertise and performance has been proven and sustained. The 
annual bonus potential would be limited to 100% of salary, and grants under the PSP would be limited to 100% of salary (150% of salary 
in exceptional circumstances). In addition, the Committee may offer additional cash and/or share-based elements to replace deferred or 
incentive pay forfeited by an Executive Director leaving a previous employer. It would seek to ensure, where possible, that these awards 
would be consistent with awards forfeited in terms of vesting periods, expected value and performance conditions.
For an internal Executive Director appointment, any variable pay element awarded in respect of the prior role may be allowed to pay out 
according to its terms. In addition, any other ongoing remuneration obligations existing prior to appointment may continue.

For external and internal appointments, the Committee may agree that the Company will meet certain relocation and/or incidental expenses 
as appropriate.
If appropriate the Committee may agree, on the recruitment of a new Executive Director, a notice period in excess of 12 months but to 
reduce this to 12 months over a specified period.
Service contracts for Executive Directors
Details of the service contracts of the Executive Directors, which are not of a fixed term and are terminable by either the Company or the 
Director, are set out below:
Executive Directors Date of agreement Date of expiry Notice period
Nigel Newton 24 June 2003 – 12 months
Richard Charkin 1 October 2007 – 12 months
Wendy Pallot 10 March 2011 – 12 months
Jonathan Glasspool 23 July 2015 – 12 months
At the Board’s discretion, early termination of an Executive Director’s service contract may be undertaken by way of payment of salary 
and benefits in lieu of the required notice period (or shorter period where permitted by the contract of service or where agreed with the 
Executive Director) and the Committee would take such steps as necessary to mitigate the loss to the Company and to ensure that the 
Executive Director observed his or her duty to mitigate loss. 
Annual bonus may be payable with respect to the period of the financial year served, although it will be prorated for time and paid at the 
normal payout date. Any share-based entitlements granted to an Executive Director under the Company’s share plans will be determined 
based on the relevant plan rules. However, in certain prescribed circumstances, such as death, ill-health, injury, disability, redundancy, 
retirement, sale of employing business or other circumstances at the discretion of the Committee, “good leaver” status may be applied. For 
good leavers, awards will normally vest at the normal vesting date, subject to the satisfaction of the relevant performance conditions at that 
time and reduced prorata to reflect the proportion of the performance period actually served. However, the Remuneration Committee has 
the discretion to determine that awards vest at cessation of employment and/or not to prorate awards.
The service contracts for Executive Directors are available for inspection at the Company’s registered office.
Non-Executive Directors
Each of the Non-Executive Directors (“NEDs”) has similar general terms for their agreement, which can be found on Bloomsbury’s investor 
relations website at www.bloomsbury-ir.co.uk. The agreements provide for three months’ notice by the Director or by the Company with  
the option for the Company to terminate an appointment at any time on payment of three months’ fees in lieu of notice. Termination of  
the agreements is without compensation. Details of the NED agreements are as follows:
Non-Executive Director Date of appointment Date of agreement Date of expiry Notice period
Jill Jones 23 July 2013 22 July 2013 2018 AGM 3 months
Steven Hall 1 March 2017 19 January 2017 2021 AGM 3 months 
Sir Anthony Salz 29 August 2013 29 August 2013 2017 AGM 3 months 
John Warren 23 July 2015 26 May 2015 2018 AGM 3 months 
The Board concluded in 2016 that it can best support the business as it evolves through a programme of regular new Board appointments, 
while keeping the size of the Board fixed at eight Directors. This will ensure that, at a time of continual change in our markets, there is a steady 
inflow to the Board of new insights from other businesses. We anticipate appointing one new Non-Executive Director each year and for the 
average duration of non-executive appointments to be around four years. 
The annual fees of NEDs, excluding the Chairman, are determined by the Chairman and the Executive Directors. The annual fee of the 
Chairman is determined by the Committee (excluding the Chairman) and the Executive Directors. NEDs receive a basic annual fee plus an 
extra annual amount for additional responsibilities such as chairing Board committees. The fees of the NEDs and Chairman are periodically 
reviewed against benchmark data provided by external remuneration consultants. Where NEDs and the Chairman receive an increase 
in annual fee this is normally the percentage increase in salaries for Bloomsbury employees generally. The NEDs and Chairman do not 
participate in the Company’s annual bonus or share incentive schemes including Sharesave.

Pensions
In accordance with the policy, pension contributions in 2016/17 were 15% of basic salary for Nigel Newton, Wendy Pallot and Jonathan 
Glasspool. Directors may elect to receive a cash alternative in lieu of payments by the Company into their private pension arrangements. 
There were no pension contributions made in respect of Richard Charkin.
Other benefits
Benefits comprised a car or car allowance (excluding Richard Charkin), medical cover, permanent health cover, life assurance and Company 
schemes offered to staff generally, such as buying books for private use at the staff discount rate. 
Annual bonus calculation for 2016/17
As set out in the Strategic Report, Bloomsbury delivered another good performance for the year ended 28 February 2017 achieving profit 
before taxation, bonus and highlighted items of £13 million. The Committee set a stretching threshold target for this profit of £12 million 
based on the City analysts’ consensus forecast and this resulted in a bonus pool shared by Executive Directors and 31 staff of £0.99 million 
equivalent to paying 41.8% of the maximum bonus for the participants in the bonus scheme before adjusting their bonuses for achievement 
of individual objectives.

Notes to the table:
 ✷ Each bonus objective is classed as strategic or personal, denoted respectively by a letter “S” and “P” which is preceded by a figure for the 
maximum bonus as a percentage of salary. The Committee set the criteria for each objective for “high” (stretching target for full bonus), 
“medium” (threshold target for partial bonus) and “low” (no bonus accrues) achievement. The level of achievement assessed by the 
committee is denoted respectively as “H”, “M” and “L”, e.g. “10SH” in the table indicates a strategic objective for 10% of salary for which 
the level of achievement was high so accrues the full bonus.
 ✷ Actions taken by the Executive Directors to achieve a number of the bonus objectives are commercially sensitive in respect of which the 
Committee has concluded that disclosing the details could undermine the interests of the Company. The Strategic Report in this Annual 
Report describes how various other bonus objectives have been achieved. 
Explanations of the objectives: 
1. Each Executive Director contributed to different areas of consolidating and restructuring the four previous publishing divisions into the Consumer and Non-Consumer divisions.
2. Each Executive Director contributed to different areas of developing and delivering Bloomsbury 2020 across the Group. The Strategic Report provides more details on progress with 
Bloomsbury 2020.
3. Each Executive Director was assigned a corporate process area to improve profits. The Strategic Report gives more details on each of these areas.
4. Each Executive Director was assigned process areas under their responsibility to make improvements to the processes to benefit the efficiency and effectiveness of the business.

1. The Shareholding Guideline (100% of salary) was introduced during the year ended 28 February 2013 and can be found on the Company’s website www.bloomsbury-ir.co.uk. 
The guideline requires that the Executive Director must retain shares vesting from the PSP awards net of tax until the shareholding guideline has been met. The number of shares 
needed to satisfy a shareholding is recalculated at the close of the next business day following the announcement of the full year results (the “Review Date”). The recalculation  
is based on the Executive Director’s prevailing base salary and the closing mid-market share price (171.75 pence on the Review Date).
2. Owned includes shares held directly by the Director and indirectly by a nominee on behalf of the Director where the Director has the beneficial interest. It includes the shares  
of the Director and of connected persons.

Directors’ Remuneration Report
No Director has or has had any interest, direct or indirect, in any transaction, contract or arrangement (excluding service agreements), which is 
or was unusual in its nature or conditions or significant to the business of the Group during the current or immediately preceding financial year.
The closing market price of an Ordinary share at 28 February 2017 was 170 pence (2016: 156.5 pence) and the range of closing market prices 
from  
1 March 2016 to 28 February 2017 was 145.5 pence to 178.5 pence (2016: 144.3 pence to 184.5 pence).
Implementation of Remuneration Policy in 2017/18
From 1 March 2017, the Group’s employees generally, including Nigel Newton, Richard Charkin and Jonathan Glasspool, received a pay 
increase of 2.25% in line with the market generally and given the strong underlying performance of the publishing business. Also from  
1 March 2017, Richard Charkin has reduced his hours to around two days per week and his basic salary has been adjusted in proportion to 
hours worked. The annual bonus and long-term incentives (see below) for Richard Charkin will be based on his reduced basic salary.
Wendy Pallot received a basic salary increase of 5.8% from 1 March 2017 to reflect the additional responsibilities which she has assumed 
during the year with respect to the US and Indian businesses. This follows Richard Charkin’s decision to reduce his time commitment to 
around two days a week at the start of the financial year. Her revised salary will be £270,000.
The basic salaries for the Executive Directors from 1 March are as follows:

1. As negotiated at the time of appointment, Richard Charkin’s base salary includes a modest uplift in lieu of pension and car allowance. From 1 March 2017, Richard Charkin 
has reduced his hours to around working two days per week and his basic salary adjusted in proportion to hours worked.
Pension and benefits
In 2017/18 no pension contributions will be made by the Company for Richard Charkin. Pension contributions (as a percentage of base 
salary) for other Executive Directors will remain unchanged. There will be no other changes to pension and benefits.
Annual bonus
For 2017/18, the maximum bonus potential will continue to be set at 100% of salary. The maximum bonus will be 70% on achieving profit 
targets and 30% paid on achieving strategic objectives including a digital revenue target linked to Bloomsbury 2020, which will account for 
10% of the total bonus opportunity. The strategic element will not formulaically be linked to the threshold profit target but will instead be 
subject to an affordability and performance assessment by the Committee. Both the measures and targets will be disclosed retrospectively in 
the Annual Report on Remuneration.
Long-term incentives
The annual PSP awards granted in 2017 will be subject to the following targets:
 ✷ relative EPS (50%) – 25% of this part of an award will vest for annualised growth in EPS over the performance period of RPI +3% increasing 
pro rata to 100% vesting for annualised growth in EPS over the performance period of RPI + 8%; and
 ✷ ROCE (50%) – 25% of this part of an award will vest for achieving ROCE at the end of the performance period of 9.2% increasing pro rata to 
100% vesting for ROCE over the performance period of 11.6%. In determining these targets the Committee considers that: 
 — a threshold vesting absolute target of 9.2% for the financial year ending in 2020 (the final year of the performance period) ensures 
there will be no vesting unless ROCE improves compared to the highest value for ROCE achieved in each of the financial years ended 
2017, 2016 and 2015.
 — a full vesting target of 11.6% requires management to deliver performance ahead of the stretching targets which it has set for the 
Bloomsbury 2020 digital resource growth strategy. It is estimated that full vesting, if achieved, would require operating profits for the 
year ended 28 February 2020 to be approximately 45% higher than the £10.3 million achieved in the year ended 28 February 2017.
ROCE for the recent financial years of the Company can be found in the Financial Review section of the Strategic Report.

The awards for Executive Directors will be subject to clawback provisions and to a two-year post-vesting holding period. During the 
holding period, an Executive Director (including if they stand down from the Board) may not sell their vested shares, which will remain 
subject to a clawback provision. 
The Remuneration Committee has approved that the Executive Directors may participate in the Company’s Sharesave scheme if operated.

Remuneration Committee
Responsibilities and activities of the Committee
The Committee determines the Remuneration Policy and annual remuneration plans for the Executive Directors for approval by the Board. 
In particular, the Committee approves for each Executive Director the basic salaries, pensions, other benefits, bonus awards and the awards 
made under Bloomsbury’s Long Term Incentive Plan (see above). The Committee approves all payments of bonus and the vesting and 
exercise of share-based awards before payments are made for each Executive Director. 
The Committee considers it is appropriate for the Executive Directors to determine the remuneration plans of senior management. In respect 
of employees below the level of the Board, the Committee approves the bonus pool from which bonuses are paid and approves the grant 
and vesting of all share incentives before payments are made.
Membership
For the year ended 28 February 2017 up until signing the Report, the Committee has comprised three Independent Non-Executive 
Directors as follows: 
Director
Appointed

The Group Company Secretary, Michael Daykin FCIS FCA, acts as secretary to the Committee. All meetings or business of the Committee have 
been conducted during the year with two Independent Non-Executive Directors and the Non-Executive Chairman present.
The Committee met formally on six occasions during the year, including three occasions without the Executive Directors present and three 
occasions with the Executive Directors attending part of a meeting at the request of the Committee for specific items on the agenda. New 
Bridge Street attends Committee meetings where needed to provide technical support. Examples of matters discussed at meetings of the 
Committee have included the renewal of the Remuneration Policy, LTIP and annual bonus targets and achievement, Executive Director pay 
increases and feedback from Shareholders and corporate governance analysts. The Committee Chair has a standing item on the agenda at 
each main Board meeting, which provides the opportunity for them to update and raise remuneration matters for discussion by the Board. 
Minutes of the Committee are circulated to the Board once they have been approved by the Committee.
Assistance to the Committee
During the year the Committee took advice from external remuneration consultants, New Bridge Street, which does not perform  
other services for and has no other connection with the Company (a statement to this effect is included on the Company’s website,  
www.bloomsbury-ir.co.uk). The Committee is free to choose its advisors and is satisfied that New Bridge Street continues to provide advice 
that is objective and independent. Fees paid to New Bridge Street for 2016/17 totalled £33,900.
The Committee received assistance from the Group Company Secretary and, where specifically requested by the Committee, the Chief 
Executive and Finance Director. The Committee has considered any feedback received from the major Shareholders during the year as part 
of Bloomsbury’s ongoing investor relations programme and considers the reports and recommendations of Shareholder representative 
bodies and corporate governance analysts.

Opinion and conclusions arising from our audit
1. Our opinion on the financial statements is unmodified 
We have audited the financial statements of Bloomsbury Publishing Plc for the year ended 28 February 2017, which comprise the 
Consolidated Income Statement, the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, the Consolidated and Parent Company Statement 
of Financial Position, the Consolidated and Parent Company Statement of Changes in Equity, the Group and Parent Company Statement of 
Cash Flows and the related notes. In our opinion: 
 ✷ the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the Parent Company’s affairs as at 28 February 2017 and 
of the Group’s profit for the year then ended; 
 ✷ the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted 
by the European Union (“IFRSs as adopted by the EU”); 
 ✷ the Parent Company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and as applied in 
accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and 
 ✷ the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group 
financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. 
2. Our assessment of risks of material misstatement 
In arriving at our audit opinion above on the financial statements the risks of material misstatement, in decreasing order of audit significance 
that had the greatest effect on our audit, were as follows:
The risk Our response
Revenue – £142.6m (2016: £123.7m); Returns provision – £6.5m (2016: £5.8m)
Refer to page 49 (Audit Committee Report), page 80 (accounting policy) and pages 86 to 88 and 100 (financial disclosures) Risk vs 2016 <>
The Group enters into contracts for the sale of publishing and 
distribution rights (including sales of copyright and trademarks) 
that are complex. These arrangements may include: the licensing 
or outright sale of the Group’s intellectual property; the provision 
of ongoing consultancy services; or a bundled combination of 
these. 
The complexity of the contractual terms requires the Group to 
make judgements in assessing when the triggers for revenue 
recognition have been met, particularly as to when the Group 
has sufficiently fulfilled its obligations (licensing, consultancy 
or outright sale) under the contract to allow revenue to be 
recognised. The Group also makes judgement in determining 
the deliverables in a bundled arrangement and in allocating fair 
value of the consideration to each of the deliverables, especially 
in instances where fair value of the individual deliverables is not 
observable on the open market. 
For all individually significant Rights and Services contracts signed 
during the year, our audit procedures included:
 ✷ Identifying from review of the contracts, the triggers for 
revenue recognition and assessing whether revenues had been 
recorded in the incorrect period in respect of bundled contracts 
straddling the year end.
 ✷ For revenue recognised in the year, obtaining evidence that 
the Group had fulfilled its obligations under the contract so 
as to recognise revenues, which included, where appropriate, 
evidence of customer acceptance.
 ✷ For revenue on licensing arrangements that was recognised by 
the Group on delivery of the intellectual property, considering 
whether there were any remaining contractual obligations or 
separate deliverables in the agreement which may preclude the 
recognition of revenue.
 ✷ Critically assessing the Group’s determination of fair value for 
each deliverable in a bundled arrangement by reference to 
contractual terms and other available sources of information on 
fair value. 
The Group typically sells its books on a sale or return basis. 
Estimating the level of returns from customers is subjective in 
nature due to the longer period of returns allowed in the industry 
and may have a material impact on the reported result at any 
given year end. As such this is a significant focus area for our audit. 
 ✷ For the returns provision, our procedures included assessing 
the historical accuracy of the provision by comparing historical 
returns from customers against the returns rate used in the 
underlying provision calculation. 
 ✷ Obtaining evidence of actual returns received in the current 
year and compared to prior year’s provision to further assess 
historical accuracy of the Group’s provisions. 
Independent Auditor’s Report
To the members of Bloomsbury Publishing Plc only
68 Bloomsbury Publishing Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Bloomsbury AR2017-proof 6.indd   68 6/12/2017   1:33:46 PM 25133.04    12 June 2017 1:31 PM    Proof 6
The risk Our response
Goodwill – £42.5m (2016: £42.1m)
Refer to page 49 (Audit Committee Report), page 82 (accounting policy) and pages 94 to 95 (financial disclosures) Risk vs 2016 <>
The Group has completed a number of significant acquisitions 
in the past five years, although we note there were no significant 
acquisitions in the current year. The recoverability of the goodwill 
arising on these acquisitions is dependent on individual businesses 
acquired sustaining sufficient profitability in the future and the 
Group realising synergy savings associated with the acquisitions. 
Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in forecasting future cash 
flows and selection of an appropriate discount rate, which are the 
basis of the assessment of recoverability, this is a significant risk area 
that our audit is focused on. 
 ✷ Our audit procedures included testing of the discounted cash 
flow model, challenging the judgements and assumptions used 
by management in the calculation.
 ✷ We have used our knowledge of comparable companies and 
market data to challenge the assumptions, in particular the 
inputs and methodology in determining the discount rate used 
to calculate the present value of projected future cash flows. 
 ✷ We considered the historical accuracy of key assumptions by 
comparing the accuracy of the previous estimates of revenue 
and cost growth to the actual amounts realised. We assessed 
management’s sensitivity of key assumptions, including the 
revenue growth rate and the discount rate and considered 
whether the disclosures about the sensitivity of the outcome 
of the impairment assessment to changes in key assumptions 
were adequate and properly reflected the risks inherent in the 
valuation of goodwill.
Inventory – £28.6m (2016: £27.6m)
Refer to page 49 (Audit Committee Report), page 83 (accounting policy) and page 99 (financial disclosures) Risk vs 2016 <>
The Group has significant inventory balances which could be at risk 
of obsolescence if stock levels exceed future sales volumes.
There is an inherent uncertainty in estimates of future sales volume 
and the related estimates of stock obsolescence, which may have a 
material impact on the reported result. As such this is a significant 
focus area for our audit. 
 ✷ We evaluated whether the Group’s provisioning policy was 
consistently applied and remained appropriate. 
 ✷ We have challenged any specific adjustments made to the 
provision that would have been recorded under the standard 
policy, obtaining support for changes to the assumptions used, 
such as stock turnover period.
 ✷ In addition we assessed whether inventory was recorded at the 
lower of cost and net realisable value by comparing, on a sample 
basis, the recorded unit cost of stock against the market sales 
price at the time of testing. 
Advances – £24.8m (2016: £22.2m)
Refer to page 49 (Audit Committee Report), page 83 (accounting policy) and page 99 (financial disclosures) Risk vs 2016 <>
The Group pays royalty advances to its authors prior to the delivery 
of a manuscript. The Group recovers these advances from future 
sales by deductions of royalties due to the author under the terms 
of the relevant royalty agreement. 
The advances balance is made up of a significant number of 
individual advances to authors and requires the Group to forecast 
sales to monitor recoverability of advances. 
In determining whether advances are recoverable, the Group 
makes judgements over the likely future sales of individual titles. 
Where insufficient sales are forecast by the Group, a provision is 
recorded against each advance. 
This is a significant risk area as there is inherent uncertainty 
regarding the future sales of individual titles arising from the 
changes in the economic environment, actions of competitors and 
forecasting risk.
 ✷ We have assessed management’s policy for providing against 
unearned author advances for compliance with the relevant 
accounting standards. We have verified that this policy has been 
consistently and accurately applied.
 ✷ We have challenged management’s forecasts for future 
royalty payments, which offset against the unearned advance, 
by assessing historical accuracy of forecasts across the whole 
unearned advance balance.
 ✷ We have challenged any specific adjustments made by 
management to the historical trends in arriving at the final 
provision and provided challenge on how such a position was 
derived. This involved considering specific promotions, film tie-
ins, future book releases or planned market events which could 
have a material impact on the recoverability of the advances.

3. Our application of materiality and an overview of the scope of our audit 
The materiality for the Group financial statements as a whole was set at £444,000 (2016: £500,000), determined with reference to a benchmark 
of Group profit before taxation, of which it represents 4.7%.
We reported to the Audit Committee any corrected or uncorrected identified misstatements exceeding £22,000 (2016: £25,000) in addition  
to other identified misstatements that warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.
Of the group’s four reporting components, audits for Group reporting purposes were performed at the two reporting components in the 
UK and the USA, covering 91% of total Group revenue (2016: 93%); 79% of Group profit before taxation (2016: 98%); and 96% of Group total 
assets (2016: 97%). For the remaining components, we performed analysis at an aggregated group level to re-examine our assessment that 
there were no significant risks of material misstatement within these.
The Group audit team has performed the audit of both the UK and the USA component, and has addressed the significant risk areas as 
detailed above. The Group team approved the following component materialities, having regard to the mix of size and risk profile of the 
Group across the components: 
 ✷ UK £421,000 (2016: £450,000) 
 ✷ US £207,000 (2016: £400,000)
4. Our opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006 is unmodified 
In our opinion:
 ✷ the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006; 
 ✷ the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year is consistent with the financial statements; and
 ✷ the information given in the Corporate Governance Statement set out on pages 46 to 48 with respect to internal control and risk 
management systems in relation to financial reporting processes and about share capital structures (“the specified Corporate Governance 
information”) is consistent with the financial statements.
Based solely on the work required to be undertaken in the course of the audit of the financial statements and from reading the Strategic 
Report, the Directors’ Report and the Corporate Governance Statement:
 ✷ we have not identified material misstatements in the Strategic Report, the Directors’ Report, or the specified Corporate Governance 
information; 
 ✷ in our opinion, the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report have been prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006; and
 ✷ in our opinion, the Corporate Governance Statement has been prepared in accordance with rules 7.2.2, 7.2.3, 7.2.5, 7.2.6 and 7.2.7  
of the Disclosure Rules and Transparency Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority.
5. We have nothing to report on the disclosures of principal risks 
Based on the knowledge we acquired during our audit, we have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to: 
 ✷ the Directors’ viability statement on page 22, concerning the principal risks, their management, and, based on that, the Directors’ 
assessment and expectations of the Group’s continuing in operation over the three years to 29 February 2020; or 
 ✷ the disclosures in note 2 of the financial statements concerning the use of the going concern basis of accounting. 
6. We have nothing to report in respect of the matters on which we are required to report  
by exception
Under ISAs (UK and Ireland) we are required to report to you if, based on the knowledge we acquired during our audit, we have identified 
other information in the annual report that contains a material inconsistency with either that knowledge or the financial statements,  
a material misstatement of fact, or that is otherwise misleading. 
In particular, we are required to report to you if: 
 ✷ we have identified material inconsistencies between the knowledge we acquired during our audit and the Directors’ statement that 
they consider that the Annual Report and financial statements taken as a whole is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the 
information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s position and performance, business model and strategy; or
 ✷ the Audit Committee section of the Corporate Governance Statement on page 46 does not appropriately address matters communicated 
by us to the Audit Committee.

Notes to the Financial Statements
Accounting Policies
1. Reporting entity
Bloomsbury Publishing Plc (the “Company”) is a company domiciled in the United Kingdom. The address of the Company’s registered office 
can be found on page 127. The consolidated financial statements of the Company as at and for the year ended 28 February 2017 comprise 
the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the “Group”). The Group is primarily involved in the publication of books and other 
related services.
2. Significant accounting policies
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below. These policies have been 
consistently applied to all the periods presented unless otherwise stated.
a) Statement of compliance
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) and International 
Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (“IFRIC”) interpretations adopted by the European Union (“EU”) at the time of preparing 
these financial statements and those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. 
b) Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and on a going concern basis.
c) Going concern
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position are set out in 
the Strategic Review on pages 1 to 33. The financial position of the Group, its cash flows and liquidity position are described in the Financial 
Review on pages 11 to 14. In addition, note 22 to the financial statements includes the Group’s objectives, policies and processes for 
managing its capital, its financial risk management objectives, details of its financial instruments, and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity 
risk.
The Directors believe that the Group’s diversification of product and geographical spread together with its monitoring and forecasting 
processes place the Group well in managing its business risks. The Group’s forecasts and projections, taking into account reasonable 
possible changes in trading performance, indicate that the Group is able to operate within the level of its current available facilities including 
compliance with the bank facility covenants. Details of the bank facility and its covenants are shown in note 22c).
After making enquiries of senior management and reviewing cash flow forecasts, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the 
Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence at least until June 2018, being the period of the 
detailed going concern assessment reviewed by the Board. They therefore continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in 
preparing the annual financial statements.
d) Use of estimates and judgements
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRSs requires management to make judgements, estimates and 
assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual 
results may differ from these estimates.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in 
which the estimate is revised and in any future periods affected. Critical judgements and areas where the use of estimates is significant are 
disclosed in note 2v).

e) Application of new and amended standards and interpretations
The following amendments and interpretations were introduced to accounting standards relevant to the Group during the year ended  
28 February 2017. The table below summarises the impact of these changes to the Group:
Accounting standard Description of change Impact on financial statements
Annual improvements 
to IFRSs 2012-
2014 cycle - IAS 19 
Employee Benefits
The amendment clarifies that the rate used to discount post-employment 
benefit obligations should be determined by reference to market yields at the 
end of the reporting period on high quality corporate bonds.
The amendment has not had 
any impact on the Group.
Amendments to IAS 
1 Presentation of 
Financial Statements – 
Disclosure initiative
The Group has applied these amendments for the first time in the current 
year. The amendments clarify that an entity need not provide a specific 
disclosure required by an IFRS if the information resulting from that disclosure 
is not material, and give guidance on aggregating and disaggregating 
information for disclosure purposes. 
As regards the structure of the financial statements, the amendments provide 
examples of systematic ordering or grouping of notes. 
The application of these 
amendments has not resulted 
in any impact on the financial 
position or performance of the 
Group.
Amendments to IAS 
16 Property, Plant 
and Equipment and 
IAS 38 Intangible 
Assets – Clarification of 
Acceptable Methods 
of Depreciation and 
Amortisation
The amendments to IAS 16 prohibit entities from using a revenue-based 
depreciation method for items of property, plant and equipment.
The amendments to IAS 38 introduce a rebuttable presumption that revenue 
is not an appropriate basis for amortisation of an intangible asset. 
As the Group already uses 
the straight-line method 
for depreciation and 
amortisation for its property, 
plant and equipment, and 
intangible assets respectively, 
the application of these 
amendments has had no 
impact on the Group’s 
consolidated financial 
statements.

The Group has not early adopted the following new and revised accounting standards, interpretations or amendments issued by the 
International Accounting Standards Board that are currently endorsed that are not yet effective: 
Accounting standard Description of change Impact on financial statements
IFRS 9 Financial 
Instruments 
The new standard sets out the requirements for the classification, 
measurement and recognition of financial assets and liabilities, and makes 
changes to the current disclosure framework.
The Directors are in the process 
of assessing the impact on the 
Group.
IFRS 15 Revenue 
from Contracts with 
Customers
The new standard establishes a single comprehensive model for entities to 
use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers. Under 
IFRS 15, an entity recognises revenue when (or as) a performance obligation 
is satisfied, i.e. when control of the goods or services underlying the particular 
performance obligation is transferred to the customer. 
The Directors continue to assess 
the impact on the Group. The 
implementation of IFRS 15 will 
be complex due to the number 
of different revenue streams the 
Group has. Initial assessments 
indicate there will not be a 
material impact on the amount 
of revenue to be recognised 
but there could be an impact 
on the timing of recognition 
particularly for rights and 
services income. This is due to 
enhanced guidance around 
what constitutes a performance 
obligation. This may impact the 
split of revenue between periods 
within any given year and also 
between years. 
IFRS 16 Leases The new standard details the requirements for the classification, 
measurement and recognition of lease arrangements. 
The adoption of the standard 
is likely to have an impact on 
the Group and the Directors 
continue to assess the impact.
Amendments to IAS 7 
Disclosure Initiative
The amendments require an entity to provide disclosures that enable users 
of financial statements to evaluate changes in liabilities arising from financing 
activities.
. 
The Directors do not 
anticipate the application of 
these amendments will have 
a material impact on the 
Group’s consolidated financial 
statements.
f) Basis of consolidation
 i) Business combinations
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method as at the acquisition date, which is the date on which control 
is transferred to the Group. Control is the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits 
from its activities. 
The Group measures goodwill at the acquisition date as:
 ✷ the fair value of consideration transferred; plus
 ✷ the recognised amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree; less
 ✷ the net recognised amount (generally fair value) of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
Where the excess is negative, a bargain purchase gain is recognised immediately in the income statement.
The consideration transferred does not include amounts related to the settlement of pre-existing relationships. Such amounts are 
generally recognised in the income statement.
Transaction costs, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, that the Group incurs in connection with the 
business combination are expensed as incurred.
Any contingent consideration payable is measured and recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. Subsequent changes to the 
fair value of contingent consideration are recognised in the income statement.

 ii) Subsidiaries
The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial information of the Company and its subsidiaries. 
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns 
from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. The financial 
statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date on which control commences until the 
date on which control ceases.
Accounting policies of subsidiaries are aligned with accounting policies adopted by the Group to ensure consistency.
All subsidiaries except Bloomsbury Publishing India Private Limited have a reporting period end of 28 February. Bloomsbury 
Publishing India Private Limited has a reporting period end of 31 March, which aligns with the Indian government’s financial year. 
 iii) Loss of control
When the Group loses control over a subsidiary, it derecognises the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary, and any non-controlling 
interests and the other components of equity. Any resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss. Any interest retained in the 
former subsidiary is measured at fair value when control is lost. 
 iv) Transactions eliminated on consolidation
Intra-Group balances and transactions, and any unrealised income and expenses arising from intra-Group transactions, are 
eliminated. Unrealised gains arising from transactions with equity-accounted investees are eliminated against the investment to the 
extent of the Group’s interest in the investee. Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains but only to the 
extent that there is no evidence of impairment.
g) Revenue
Revenue represents the fair value of consideration received from the provision of goods, services and rights falling within the Group’s 
ordinary activities, after deduction of trade discounts, value added tax and anticipated returns. 
(i)  Revenue from book publishing is recognised when title passes. A provision for anticipated returns is made based primarily on historical 
return rates. If these do not reflect actual returns in future periods then revenues could be understated or overstated for a particular 
period. 
(ii)  Revenue from the sale of publishing and distribution rights, including film, paperback, electronic, overseas publishing rights, and 
sponsorship, is recognised when the Group has discharged its obligations under the arrangement to deliver the associated material, 
and the Group has either received appropriately enacted contractual documentation or received payment, whichever occurs first. 
(iii)  Revenue from database contracts is recognised in accordance with the stages of completion of contractual services provided. The 
degree of completion is calculated as a proportion of the content generated against the contractually agreed milestone, for example 
number of words generated. Where the degree of completion of milestones cannot be reliably measured, revenue is only recognised 
in full on completion. 
(iv) Revenue from management services contracts is usually recognised on a straight-line basis over the period that the service is 
provided. 
(v)  Revenue from e-book sales is recognised when content is delivered.
Where contractual arrangements consist of two or more separate elements, such as access to multiple titles, revenue is recognised for each 
element as if it were an individual contractual arrangement.
h) Foreign currencies
 i) Functional and presentation currency 
Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic 
environment in which the entity operates (“the functional currency”). These consolidated financial statements are presented in 
sterling as this is the most representative currency of the Group’s operations. All financial information presented in sterling has been 
rounded to the nearest thousand except where otherwise stated.

 ii) Transactions and balances
Transactions in currencies other than the functional currency are recorded in the functional currency at the rates of exchange 
prevailing on the dates of the transactions. Assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at closing rates of 
exchange at the date of the statement of financial position. 
Exchange differences are charged or credited to the income statement within administrative expenses.
 iii) Group companies
The results and financial position of all the Group entities that have a functional currency different from the presentation currency 
are translated into the presentation currency as follows:
 ✷ Assets and liabilities for each statement of financial position presented are translated at the closing rate at the date of that 
statement of financial position;
 ✷ Income and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates over the period; and
 ✷ All resulting exchange differences are recognised in other comprehensive income and presented in the translation reserve in 
equity. On disposal of a foreign entity these exchange differences are recycled to the income statement. 
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign 
entity and translated at the closing rate. Exchange differences arising are recognised in equity.
i) Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
 i) Current tax
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income 
statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other periods and it further excludes 
items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted at the reporting date.
The Group recognises liabilities for anticipated tax issues based on estimates of the additional taxes that are likely to become due, 
which require judgement. Amounts are accrued based on the Director’s interpretation of specific tax law in the relevant country 
and the likelihood of settlement. The Directors use in-house tax experts, professional firms and previous experience when assessing 
tax risks. Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will 
impact the current tax and deferred tax provisions in the period in which such determination is made. 
 ii) Deferred tax
Deferred tax is recognised on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the consolidated 
financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit. Deferred tax liabilities are generally 
recognised for all taxable temporary differences. Deferred tax assets are generally recognised for all deductible temporary 
differences to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which those deductible temporary differences 
can be utilised. Such deferred tax assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the 
initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable 
profit nor the accounting profit. 
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, except where the 
Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in 
the foreseeable future. The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that 
it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be generated to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability is settled 
based upon tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period. 
 iii) Current and deferred tax for the year
Current and deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items credited or charged directly 
to other comprehensive income or equity, in which case the deferred tax is also recognised in other comprehensive income or equity 
respectively.

j) Goodwill and other intangible assets
 i) Goodwill
Goodwill arising on an acquisition of a business is carried at cost as established at the date of acquisition of the business  
(see note 2f) i)) less accumulated impairment losses, if any. 
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units (or groups of cash-
generating units) that is expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. 
A cash-generating unit to which goodwill has been allocated is tested for impairment annually, or more frequently where there  
is an indication that the unit may be impaired. If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than its carrying amount, 
the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other  
assets of the unit pro rata based on the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. Any impairment loss for goodwill is recognised 
directly in profit or loss in the consolidated income statement. An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in 
subsequent periods. 
On disposal of the relevant cash-generating unit, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or 
loss on disposal. 
 ii) Other intangible assets
Other intangible assets that are acquired by the Group and have finite useful lives are measured at cost less accumulated 
amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. 
Except for goodwill and assets under construction, intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis in the income statement 
over their expected useful lives by equal annual instalments at the following rates:
Publishing relationships — 7% to 20% per annum
Imprints — 3% to 10% per annum
Subscriber and customer relationships  — 7% to 17% per annum
Trademarks —   over the life of the trademark 
Product and systems development — 14% to 20% per annum
Assets under construction relate to the costs of developing a product, typically an online platform, which is yet to go live.
Amortisation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each reporting date and adjusted prospectively if appropriate.
 iii) Product and systems development
Costs that are directly associated with the purchase and implementation of systems, such as software products, are recognised as 
intangible assets. Likewise, costs incurred in developing a product, typically an online platform, are recognised as intangible assets.
Expenditure is only capitalised if costs can be measured reliably, the product is technically and commercially feasible, future 
economic benefits are probable and the Group has sufficient resources to complete development and use the asset.
k) Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment loss.
Property, plant and equipment are depreciated in order to write down their cost less residual value using the straight-line method over their 
expected useful lives at the following rates: 
Short leasehold improvements — over the remaining life of the lease
Furniture and fittings — 10% per annum
Computers and other office equipment — 20% per annum
Motor vehicles — 25% per annum

Depreciation is prorated in the years of acquisition and disposal of an asset. The estimated useful lives, residual value and depreciation 
method are reviewed at the end of each reporting period, with the effect of any changes in estimate accounted for on a prospective basis.
An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised on disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected to arise from the 
continued use of the asset. The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales 
proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in the income statement.
l) Impairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill
At the end of each reporting period the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether 
there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the 
asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are 
independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are 
discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments and the risks specific to the asset for 
which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the 
asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised immediately in the income statement. 
m) Inventories
The cost of work in progress and finished goods represents the amounts invoiced to the Group for origination, paper, printing and binding. 
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is determined using the weighted average cost method. Net 
realisable value represents the estimated selling price for inventories less all estimated costs of completion and costs necessary to make the 
sale. Provisions are made for slow-moving and obsolete stock.
n) Royalty advances to authors
Advances of royalties to authors are included within current receivables when the advance is paid less any provision required to adjust  
the advance to its net realisable value. The royalty advance is expensed at the contracted or effective royalty rate as the related revenues are 
earned. 
o) Provisions
A provision is recognised if, as a result of a past event, the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation that can be estimated reliably, 
and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. When a provision is measured using the cash 
flows estimated to settle the present obligation, its carrying amount is the present value of those cash flows (when the effect of the time value 
of money is material).
p) Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when the Group has become a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. 
The Group’s financial assets and liabilities are as below:
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are initially stated at fair value after provision for bad and doubtful debts and anticipated future sales returns and 
thereafter they are held at amortised cost. 
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents in the statement of cash flows comprise cash in hand and at bank, other short-term deposits held by the Group 
and overdrafts. Bank overdrafts are included in current liabilities in the statement of financial position.
Financial liabilities and equity
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into. An equity 
instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities.
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Trade payables
Trade payables are not interest bearing and are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost using the effective 
interest method.

q) Operating leases
Leases where a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases by the 
lessee. Payments made under operating leases (net of any incentives received from the lessor) are charged to the income statement on a 
straight-line basis over the period of the lease. 
r) Employee benefits
 i) Defined contribution plans
Pension costs relating to defined contribution pension schemes are recognised in the income statement in the period for which 
related services are rendered by the employee. 
 ii) Defined benefit plans
Until 1997 a subsidiary company operated a defined benefit pension scheme. The retirement obligation recognised in the statement 
of financial position represents the net of the present value of the defined benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets at 
the statement of financial position date. The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the 
projected unit credit method. 
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to 
equity in other comprehensive income in the period in which they arise. Net interest is calculated by applying the discount rate to the 
net defined benefit obligation and is presented as finance costs or finance income.
 iii) Termination benefits
Termination benefits are recognised as an expense when the Group is demonstrably committed, without realistic possibility of 
withdrawal, to a formal detailed plan either to terminate employment before the normal retirement date, or to provide termination 
benefits as a result of an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy.
 iv) Share-based payment transactions
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payment instruments to certain employees. Equity-settled share-based payment 
transactions are measured at fair value at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date of equity-settled share-based 
payments is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of the 
shares that will eventually vest. 
Options granted under the Company Share Option Plan and Sharesave Plan are equity settled. The fair values of such options have 
been calculated using the Black–Scholes model or a modified version of the same, based on publicly available market data. 
Awards granted under the Group’s Performance Share Plan are equity settled. Part of any award granted under the plan is subject 
to a Total Shareholder Return performance condition. The fair value of this element of the awards is calculated using the Stochastic 
model. The other part of any award granted under the plan is subject to an Earnings Per Share performance condition. The fair value 
of this element of the awards is calculated using the Black–Scholes model.
s) Employee benefit trust
The Company operates an employee benefit trust and has de facto control of shares held by the trust and bears their benefits and risks. 
The Group considers the trust to be substantially under its control and so consolidates the financial information of the trust as stated in note 
2f). The Group records the assets and liabilities of the trust as its own and shares held by the trust are recorded at cost as a deduction from 
Shareholders’ equity. Finance costs and administrative expenses are charged as they accrue.
t) Segmental reporting
Operating segments, which have not been aggregated, are reported in a manner that is consistent with the internal reporting provided to 
the Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”), regarded as the Chief Operating Decision Maker.
The CEO views the Group primarily from a nature of business basis, reflecting the divisional performance of Consumer, made up of Children’s 
Trade and, Adult Trade, and Non-Consumer, made up of Academic & Professional, Special Interest and Content Services. Segment results 
that are reported to the CEO include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis. 
Performance is evaluated based on operating profit contributions using the same accounting policies as adopted for the Group’s financial 
statements.

u) Dividends
Dividends are recognised as liabilities once they are appropriately authorised.
v) Critical accounting estimates and judgements
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including reasonable 
expectations of future events. The resultant estimates will, by definition, not necessarily equal the related actual results and may require 
adjustment in subsequent accounting periods. The estimates and assumptions that may cause a material adjustment to the carrying amount 
of assets and liabilities in the next financial year are:
 i) Revenue recognition
Certain contracts entered into by the Group may include: the licensing or outright sale of the Group’s intellectual property; the 
provision of ongoing consultancy services; or a bundled combination of both. 
The Group considers contractual terms and makes judgements in assessing when the triggers for revenue recognition have been 
met, particularly that the Group has sufficiently fulfilled its obligations under the contract to allow revenue to be recognised and the 
allocation of revenue between multiple deliverables.
 ii) Book returns
As books are returnable by customers, the Group makes a provision against books sold in the accounting period which is then 
carried forward and offset against trade receivables in the statement of financial position in anticipation of book returns received 
subsequent to the reporting period end. The provision is calculated by reference to historical returns rates and expected future 
returns.
 iii) Author advances
A provision is made by the Group against advances on published titles which may not be covered by royalties on anticipated future 
title sales or subsidiary rights receivable. At the end of each financial year a review is carried out on all published title advances. If it is 
unlikely that royalties from future title sales or subsidiary rights will fully earn down the advance, a provision is made in the income 
statement for the difference between the carrying value and the anticipated recoverable amount from future earnings.
 iv) Inventory
At the end of each reporting period a review is carried out on all published titles where inventory is held. A provision is made by the 
Group against unsold inventory on a title by title basis, with regard to historical net sales and expected future net sales, to value the 
inventories at the lower of cost and net realisable value. 
 v) Impairment reviews
IFRS require management to undertake an annual test for impairment of indefinite life assets and, for finite life assets, to test for 
impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The Group 
currently undertakes an annual impairment test covering goodwill and other indefinite life assets and also reviews finite life assets to 
consider whether a full impairment review is required. 
Intangible assets recoverability is an area involving management judgement, requiring assessment as to whether the carrying value 
of assets can be supported by the net present value of future cash flows derived from such assets using cash flow projections which 
have been discounted at an appropriate rate. In calculating the net present value of the future cash flows, certain assumptions are 
required to be made. Note 10 details the assumptions used.

3. Segmental analysis
We announced in May 2016 a reorganisation of the business into two divisions: Consumer and Non-Consumer, reflecting the core customers 
for our different operations. The Consumer division is further split out into two operating segments: Children’s Trade and Adult Trade; and 
Non-Consumer split between four operating segments: Academic & Professional, Education, Special Interest and Content Services. Education 
has been aggregated with Academic & Professional to create one reportable segment. Both operating segments share very similar products, 
customers and sales behaviours.
Each reportable segment represents a cash-generating unit for the purpose of impairment testing. We have reallocated goodwill between 
reportable segments.
These divisions are the basis on which the Group primarily reports its segment information. Segments derive their revenue from book 
publishing, sale of publishing and distribution rights, management and other publishing services.
The analysis by segment is shown below:

of the business and future profitability of the business.
All highlighted items are included in administrative expenses in the income statement. 
Restructuring costs of £881,000 have been incurred primarily as a result of strategic restructuring of the Bloomsbury US business (2016: 
£915,000 incurred as a result of the Group’s acquisition activities and the restructuring of the Bloomsbury Content Services division). 
The other cost of £31,000 relate to final costs on the historic tax enquiry with HMRC (2016: credit of £48,000 is primarily the release of penalties 
and interest relating to a historic tax enquiry with HMRC).

Non-deductable revenue expenditure mainly relates to disallowable foreign exchange. Different rates of tax in foreign jurisdictions is where 
we are paying tax at higher rates in the US and Australia.
Adjustments to prior periods primarily arise where an outcome is obtained on certain tax matters which differs from expectations held when 
the related provision was made. Where the outcome is more favourable than the provision made, the difference is released, lowering the 
current year tax charge. Where the outcome is less favourable than our provision, an additional charge to current year tax will occur.
In 2017, the £349,000 deferred tax prior year adjustment relates to improvements in timing differences on intangible assets. In 2016 the 
£1,070,000 current tax adjustment in respect of prior years relates to the carry back of double taxation relief to prior years and an adjustment 
to align the prior year Group tax charge with recently submitted tax returns, particularly for the US entities.
In 2016 subsequent to the successful First-Tier Tribunal decision on Bloomsbury Verlag, a prior year adjustment of £543,000 was recognised 
for the utilisation of previously unrecognised losses. Linked to this successful decision there was a release of a £213,000 tax provision in respect 
of prior years. This went through highlighted items in prior years and thus has been released in the same place.
We are not aware of any significant unprovided exposures that are considered likely to materialise. 
c) Factors affecting tax charge for future years
Reductions in the UK corporation tax rate from 20% to 19% (effective from 1 April 2017) and to 18% (effective 1 April 2020) were substantively 
enacted on 26 October 2015, and an additional reduction to 17% (effective from 1 April 2020) was substantively enacted on 6 September 
2016. This will reduce the Company’s future current tax charge accordingly. The deferred tax asset at 28 February 2017 has been calculated 
based on the substantively enacted rates.

Meeting, will be paid on 20 September 2017 to Shareholders on the register at close of business on 25 August 2017.

9. Earnings per share
The basic earnings per share for the year ended 28 February 2017 is calculated using a weighted average number of Ordinary shares in issue 
of 74,820,311 (2016: 74,807,436) after deducting shares held by the Employee Benefit Trust. 
The diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of Ordinary shares to take account of all dilutive 
potential Ordinary shares, which are in respect of unexercised share options and the Performance Share Plan.

Goodwill is not amortised, but instead is subject to annual impairment reviews. Any impairment losses are recognised immediately in the 
income statement. 
Management have aligned the monitoring of goodwill to how it reviews the performance of the business. Goodwill is monitored by 
management at the publishing division level. Goodwill allocation in the year ended 29 February 2016 has been restated to reflect the new 
divisional structure; see note 3. The following is a summary of goodwill allocation for each publishing division:

Impairment testing
The recoverable amount of the Group’s goodwill has been considered with regard to value-in-use calculations. These calculations use the 
pre-tax future cash flow projections of each cash-generating unit (“CGU”) based on the Board’s approved budgets for the year ended 
28 February 2017 and the Board-approved five-year plan. The calculations include a terminal value based on the projections for the final year 
of the five-year plan with a long-term growth rate assumption applied.

Discount rates
The discount rates applied to the cash flows are calculated using a pre-tax rate based on the weighted average cost of capital for the Group. 
This is adjusted for risks specific to the market in which the CGU operates. The Group has considered the impact of the current economic 
climate in determining appropriate discount rates. 
Revenue growth rates
Growth rates have been calculated based on those applied to the Board-approved budget for the year ended 28 February 2018 and five-year 
plan. They incorporate future expectations of growth in backlist revenues and identified new revenue streams. The range of growth rates 
noted above covers specific rates applied for each of the next five years.
Long-term growth rates
The five-year forecasts are extrapolated to perpetuity on the basis that the relevant CGUs are long established business units. The long-term 
growth rates is a blended rate formed from the territory-specific long-term growth rates.
Gross margin
Gross margins have been based on historic performance and expected changes to the sales mix in future periods. 
Sensitivity
The Group has not identified any reasonably possible changes to key assumptions that would cause the carrying value of goodwill of any 
CGU to exceed its recoverable amount. Academic & Professional has by far the largest goodwill and non-current assets. There is sufficient 
headroom on the goodwill valuation of Academic & Professional when increasing the discount rate by 2%.

13. Deferred tax assets and liabilities
a) Recognised deferred tax assets and liabilities
Deferred tax is calculated in full on temporary differences using the tax rate appropriate to the jurisdiction in which the asset or liability arises 
and the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the asset or liability is settled.

At 28 February 2017 411 147 61 109 (2,159) 4,014 2,583
Deferred tax assets in respect of losses are only recognised to the extent that it is anticipated they will be utilised in the foreseeable future. 
The Other deferred tax asset predominantly relates to timing differences i.e. valuation adjustments and return and inventory provisions held 
on the balance sheet recognised in the current tax calculation and tax return only when utilised. This predominantly relates to the US and 
Australia. Deferred tax assets have increased by £2.6 million for temporary differences on how stocks are valued for tax purposes in the US.  
An equal and opposite tax payable has been recognised which will be settled over three years.
b) The analysis for financial reporting purposes is as follows:
28 February
 2017
£’000
29 February
 2016
£’000
Deferred tax assets 4,808 2,988
Deferred tax liabilities (2,225) (2,675)
Total 2,583 313
c) Unrecognised deferred tax assets 
The Group had deferred tax assets not recognised in the financial statements as follows:
28 February
 2017
£’000
29 February
 2016
£’000
Trading losses 134 –
Non-trading losses 101 271
At 28 February 2017 the Group had trading losses of £0.6 million (2016: £nil) and non-trading losses of approximately £0.6 million (2016: 
£1.5 million). A deferred tax asset has not been recognised in respect of these losses carried forward as it is not clear whether sufficient 
income against which the losses may be offset will arise in the Group in the foreseeable future. 
Deferred tax is not provided on unremitted earnings of subsidiaries where the Group controls the timing of remittance and it is probable that 
the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

Non-current receivables relate to accrued income on long-term rights deals.
Royalty advances have been separated out from prepayments and accrued income to enable a user to get a better understanding of the 
business. A provision is held against gross advances payable in respect of published title advances which may not be fully earned down by 
anticipated future sales. As at 28 February 2017 £6,371,000 (2016: £5,530,000) of royalty advances are expected to be recovered after more 
than 12 months. 
Trade receivables principally comprise amounts receivable from the sale of books due from distributors. The majority of trade debtors are 
secured by credit insurance and in certain territories by third party distributors. 
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates to their fair values. The Group’s exposure to 
credit and currency risks is disclosed in note 22. The average number of days’ credit taken for sales of books by the Group was 111 days (2016: 
116 days). 
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is made with reference to specific debts, past default experience, trading history and the 
current economic environment. Movements on the Group provision for impairment of trade receivables are as follows:

Own shares held by Employee Benefit Trust
The Employee Benefit Trust (“EBT”) is an independent discretionary trust established to acquire issued shares of the Company to satisfy any of 
the share-based incentive schemes (see note 20) and plans of the Company. All employees of the Group are potential beneficiaries of the EBT. 
The results and net assets of the EBT are included in the consolidated financial statements of the Group. 
During the year ended 28 February 2017 89,513 shares held by the EBT were used to satisfy share option exercises under the Bloomsbury 
Performance Share Plan (see note 20). 9,745 EBT shares were used to satisfy the dividends due on the vested shares exercised. 5,523 EBT shares 
were used to satisfy share option exercises under the Bloomsbury Sharesave Plan (see note 20).
The market value of the 651,011 shares of the Company held at 28 February 2017 (2016: 5,792) in the EBT was £1,107,000 (2016: £9,000). Whilst 
the trustee has power to subscribe for Ordinary shares and to acquire Ordinary shares in the market or from Treasury, it is not permitted to 
hold more than 5% of the issued share capital without prior approval of the Shareholders.
As at the date of signing this Annual Report, the Trust held 651,011 Ordinary shares of 1.25 pence being approximately 0.9% of the issued 
Ordinary share capital. 
Retained earnings
The retained earnings reserve comprises profit for the year attributable to owners of the Company and other items recognised directly 
through equity as presented on the consolidated statement of changes in equity.
20. Share-based payments 
Options over shares of the ultimate parent undertaking, Bloomsbury Publishing Plc, have been granted to employees of the Group under 
various schemes. 
The total share-based payment charge to the income statement for the year was as follows:
28 February
 2017
£’000
29 February
 2016
£’000
Equity-settled share-based transactions 64 442
Cash-settled share-based transactions 9 45
Total 73 487
National Insurance contributions are payable by the Company in respect of some of the share-based payment transactions. These 
contributions are payable on the date of exercise based on the intrinsic value of the share-based payments and are therefore treated as 
cash-settled awards. The Group had an accrual for National Insurance at 28 February 2017 of £3,000 (2016: £15,000), of which none related to 
vested options.
a) The Bloomsbury Performance Share Plan 2005 (“the PSP”)
The Group operates the PSP for Directors and senior employees. Awards under the scheme are granted as conditional share awards. The 
number of Ordinary shares comprised in an award is calculated using a share value equal to either the average middle-market price of the 
Ordinary share for the five dealing days immediately preceding the award date or the middle-market price on the dealing day before the 
award date. 
The vesting period is three years and the level of vesting is subject to the achievement of Earnings Per Share (“EPS”) and Total Shareholder 
Return (“TSR”) performance conditions. For details of the performance conditions see the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 50 to 
67. Awards are not exercisable after the vesting date and awards that vest on the vesting date are automatically exercised. Except in certain 
circumstances awards lapse if the employee leaves the Group.

Expense recognised for the year (£’000) 88 456
The share awards granted in the year to 28 February 2017 have been measured by Aon Hewitt. The TSR element has been measured using 
the Stochastic model and the EPS element has been measured using the Black–Scholes model. The inputs were:
Performance condition Earnings Per Share Total Shareholder Return
Share price 160.75 pence 160.75 pence
Exercise price – –
Expected term 3 years 3 years
Expected volatility n/a 18.6 – 19.8%
Risk-free interest rate n/a 0.35 – 0.76%
Fair value charge per award 145.24 - 160.75 pence 90.01 pence
The awards for Executive Directors will be subject to clawback provisions and to a two-year post-vesting holding period, hence the range of 
values for certain performance conditions above.
For the Executive Directors the expected volatility was based on Bloomsbury’s share price volatility over the period prior to grant equal in 
length to the expected three-year performance period plus the two year holding period. Half of each award is subject to an EPS performance 
condition. Half of each award is subject to a Total Shareholder Return condition whereby performance is compared to the FTSE SmallCap 
(excluding Investment Trusts) over a three-year period from the date of grant. A median ranking results in 25% of shares subject to this 
performance condition vesting, rising to 100% for an upper-quartile ranking. The awards have a concurrent performance condition that no 
vesting occurs for Annualised EPS in excess of RPI growth below 0%. The TSR condition is calculated at the date of grant using the Stochastic 
model and discounted back to the present value using the risk-free rate of return.
All awards granted to other employees are only subject to an EPS performance condition with no post-vesting holding period. 
b) Bloomsbury Sharesave Plan 2005
The Group operates an HM Revenue and Customs approved savings-related share option scheme under which employees are granted 
options to purchase Ordinary shares in the Company in three years’ time, dependent upon their entering into a contract to make monthly 
contributions to a savings account over the period of the savings term. The Sharesave Plan is open to all UK employees.

c) The Bloomsbury Company Share Option Plan 2014 (“the CSOP”)
The Group operates the CSOP for senior employees. During the year awards under the scheme were granted at an option price per share of 
162 pence. The option price is based on the closing mid-market price of a share on 7 June 2016.
The vesting period is three years and the level of vesting is subject to the achievement of “Annualised EPS in excess of RPI” performance 
conditions. Options are exercisable by the participant after the vesting date whilst the participant continues in employment with the Group 
up to a period ending ten years after the date of grant.

21. Retirement benefit obligations
Pension costs
The pension costs charged to the income statement of £1,058,000 (2016: £827,000) relate to the Group’s defined contribution and defined 
benefit pension arrangements. 
Defined contribution plans
The Group operates defined contribution retirement benefit plans for all qualifying employees.
The total cost charged to the income statement of £1,040,000 (2016: £808,000) represents contributions payable to these schemes by the 
Group at rates specified in the rules of the schemes. At 28 February 2017 there were no prepaid contributions (29 February 2016: nil).

Defined benefit plan
A subsidiary company operates a defined benefit scheme for some staff which is accounted for in accordance with IAS 19. Accrual of benefits 
ceased in 1997, with the scheme now operated as a closed fund. There is no obligation in respect of medical costs. The scheme is actuarially 
valued every three years. The last full actuarial valuation was carried out as at 28 February 2015 and updated to 28 February 2017 by a 
qualified independent actuary.
Contributions are paid by the employer at the rate of £4,750 per month, plus expenses as and when required. Contributions paid to the 
scheme during the year were £63,000 (2016: £45,000). The Directors’ best estimate of the contributions including administration expenses 
to be paid for in the year ending 28 February 2018 is £71,000. In addition, PPF levies and other administration expenses are payable by the 
Group as and when due.
The Group’s policy is to fund the deficit in the scheme by additional contributions to meet the scheme’s commitment to members.
The financial assumptions used by the actuary for the update were as follows:
28 February 
2017
29 February 
2016
28 February 
2015
Discount rate 2.60% 3.80% 3.40%
Inflation assumption 2.40-3.40% 2.10–3.10% 2.10–3.10%
The scheme is closed and there are no active paying members, therefore no increases in payments have been applied. The assumptions 
used are estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which, due to the timescale covered, may not necessarily occur in 
practice.
The mortality assumptions adopted at 28 February 2017 are 90% of the standard tables S2P xA, year of birth, no age rating for males and 
females, projected using CMI_2015 converging to 1.50% p.a. These imply the following life expectancies:

Financial risk management
The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group’s risk management framework. The 
Group’s overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse 
effects on the Group’s financial performance from the key risks of market risk (including currency risk and interest rate risk), credit risk and 
liquidity risk. 
The Board has approved the Group Treasury policies and procedures by which the Group Treasury function is to be managed. The Group 
Treasury function is headed by the Group Finance Director and is part of Bloomsbury’s Finance Department. It operates under a delegated 
authority from the Board. 
The Treasury management policies and procedures focus on the investment of surplus operating cash likely to be needed in order to 
support Bloomsbury’s ongoing operations, foreign currency requirements and interest rate risk management. The Group does not use 
derivative contracts for speculative purposes. The policies are reviewed at least on an annual basis by the Group Finance Director and any 
amendments are approved by the Board. The Board is assisted in its oversight role by Internal Audit, who undertakes regular reviews of risk 
management controls and procedures, the results of which are reported to the Audit Committee.

a) Market risk
Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates and interest rates, will affect the Group’s income or the 
value of its holdings of financial instruments. The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures 
within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return. 
The Group’s activities expose it mainly to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates. The 
Group incurs costs in the same currencies as it earns revenue, creating some degree of natural hedging. 
The Group’s overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential 
adverse effects on the Group’s financial performance. Risk management is carried out by Group Treasury under policies approved by the 
Board of Directors. Group Treasury monitors the distribution of its cash assets so as to control exposure to the relative performance of any 
particular territory, currency or institution.
The Board provides written principles for overall risk management, as well as policies covering specific areas, such as funding, foreign 
exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk and investment of excess liquidity.
(i) Interest rate risk
The Group has significant interest-bearing assets in the form of cash and cash equivalents and as such cash flows are dependent on changes 
in market interest rates.

Fixed rate financial assets are short-term bank deposits with a maturity date range of one day to one month. Variable rate financial assets are 
cash at bank. 
Fair value sensitivity analysis for fixed rate financial instruments
The Group does not account for any fixed rate financial assets at fair value through profit or loss. Therefore a change in interest rates at 28 
February 2017 would not affect the income statement. 
Cash flow sensitivity analysis for variable rate financial instruments
The Group derived the following sensitivities to assess the impact of changes in interest rates, based on the effect of the market volatility in the 
current climate and the previous 12 months. The analysis assumes all other variables remain constant.

(ii) Currency risk
The Directors believe that in its current circumstances the Group’s risk from foreign currency exposure is limited and no active currency risk 
management by hedging is considered necessary, as a significant proportion of revenues are matched by expenditure in the same local 
currency, creating some degree of natural hedging.

No significant amounts of loans and receivables or financial liabilities are denominated in currencies other than sterling, US dollars, euros, 
Australian dollars or Indian rupees.
Foreign currency sensitivity analysis 
The Group derived the following sensitivities based on the outstanding foreign currency denominated financial assets and liabilities at the 
year end. The sensitivity analysis includes loans to foreign operations within the Group where the denomination of the loan is in a currency 
other than the functional currency of the lender or the borrower. 
The use of a 10% sensitivity rate has been determined based on the effect of the market volatility in exchange rates between the current 
and previous year end, and represents management’s assessment of the reasonably possible change in foreign exchange rates. A positive 
number below indicates an increase in profit or equity.

b) Credit risk 
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual 
obligations, and arises principally from the Group’s trade and rights income receivables. 
The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure. The amounts presented in the statement of financial 
position are net of allowances for doubtful receivables, estimated by the Group’s management based on trading experience and the current 
economic environment. An analysis of the relevant provisions is set out in note 15.
The credit risk on liquid funds is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings as assigned by international credit-
rating agencies.
The Group determines its concentration of credit risk based on the individual characteristics of its customers and publicly available 
knowledge of specific circumstances affecting those customers. The Group defines counterparties as having similar characteristics if they are 
related entities. 
The Group has a significant concentration of credit risk due to its use of third party distributors. Credit limits for the final customers are set by 
the distributors based on a combination of payment history and third party credit references. Credit limits are reviewed on a regular basis 
in conjunction with debt ageing and collection history. The distributors belong to established international groups whose business includes 
a number of publishing interests and clients. The Group’s risk is limited as significant amounts outstanding through the UK distributors are 
secured by credit insurance, and in the US credit risk for significant amounts outstanding through distributors rests with the distributor. 
c) Liquidity risk
The Directors do not consider that the Group currently has a significant exposure to liquidity risk, as the Group has limited borrowing and has 
sufficient cash deposits to meet its debts as they fall due for the foreseeable future.
Cash flow budgets and forecasts are prepared by the operating entities of the Group, aggregated for the Group and regularly reviewed 
by the Board, and the actual cash position of the Group and each entity is compared monthly against budget. This allows management to 
ensure that each operating entity and the Group have sufficient cash to meet operational needs. Surplus cash held by the operating entities 
over and above the balance required for working capital management is invested in interest-bearing accounts and money market deposits. 
The Group has an unsecured revolving credit facility with Lloyds Bank Plc. At 28 February 2017 the Group had no draw down (2016: £1.4 
million) of this facility with £12.0 million of undrawn borrowing facilities (2016: £14.1 million) available. 
The facility comprises a £10 million to £14 million committed revolving loan facility (amount dependent on time during the year to match 
Bloomsbury’s cash flow cycle), an uncommitted incremental term loan facility of up to £6 million and a £2 million overdraft facility. The 
overdraft facility is available until December 2017 and the loan facilities mature in May 2021. All facilities are subject to two covenants being a 
maximum net debt to EBITDA ratio and a minimum interest cover covenant.
The Group’s financial liabilities are trade payables, accruals and other payables as shown above. Apart from the identified other payables due 
after one year, all other financial liabilities are due within one year.

Notes to the Company Financial Statements
For Company Accounting Policies
27. Reporting entity
Bloomsbury Publishing Plc (the “Company”) is a company domiciled in the United Kingdom. The address of the Company’s registered office 
can be found on page 127. The Company is primarily involved in the publication of books and other related services.
28. Significant accounting policies 
a) Basis of preparation 
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) and International 
Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (“IFRIC”) interpretations adopted by the European Union (“EU”) at the time of preparing 
these financial statements and those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. The financial statements 
have been prepared under the historical cost convention.
The financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis as the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company 
has adequate resources to continue in operational existence at least until June 2018, being the period of the detailed going concern 
assessment reviewed by the Board.
The Company accounting policies are consistent with the Group policies set out in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. Key 
additional policies are stated below. 
b) Parent Company result
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption available under section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 not to present the Company 
income statement or statement of comprehensive income. The Company’s profit for the year was £5,270,000 (2016: £4,447,000). 
c) Use of estimates and judgements
The preparation of the Company financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the 
application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from these 
estimates. 
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the year in 
which the estimate is revised and in any future years affected. Critical judgements and areas where the use of estimates is significant are 
disclosed in note 2v) for the Group and are applicable to the Company.

d) Application of new and amended standards and interpretations
The following amendments and interpretations were introduced to accounting standards relevant to the Company during the year ended 
28 February 2017. The table below summarises the impact of these changes to the Company:
Accounting standard Description of change Impact on financial statements
Annual improvements 
to IFRSs 2012-2014 
cycle - IAS 19 Employee 
Benefits
The amendment clarifies that the rate used to discount post-
employment benefit obligations should be determined by 
reference to market yields at the end of the reporting period 
on high quality corporate bonds.
The amendment has not had any impact on the 
Company.
Amendments to IAS 
1 Presentation of 
Financial Statements – 
Disclosure Initiative
The Company has applied these amendments for the first time 
in the current year. The amendments clarify that an entity 
need not provide a specific disclosure required by an IFRS if 
the information resulting from that disclosure is not material, 
and give guidance on aggregating and disaggregating 
information for disclosure purposes. 
As regards the structure of the financial statements, the 
amendments provide examples of systematic ordering or 
grouping of notes. 
The application of these amendments has not 
resulted in any impact on the financial position 
or performance of the Company.
Amendments to IAS 
16 Property, Plant 
and Equipment and 
IAS 38 Intangible 
Assets – Clarification of 
Acceptable Methods 
of Depreciation and 
Amortisation
The amendments to IAS 16 prohibit entities from using a 
revenue-based depreciation method for items of property, 
plant and equipment.
The amendments to IAS 38 introduce a rebuttable 
presumption that revenue is not an appropriate basis for 
amortisation of an intangible asset. 
As the Company already use the straight-line 
method for depreciation and amortisation 
for its property, plant and equipment, and 
intangible assets respectively, the application of 
these amendments has had no impact on the 
Company’s financial statements.
The Company has not early adopted the following new and revised accounting standards, interpretations or amendments issued by the 
International Accounting Standards Board that are currently endorsed that are not yet effective: 
Accounting standard Description of change Impact on financial statements
IFRS 9 Financial 
Instruments 
The new standard sets out the requirements for the 
classification, measurement and recognition of financial assets 
and liabilities, and makes changes to the current disclosure 
framework.
The Directors are in the process of assessing the 
impact on the Company.
IFRS 15 Revenue 
from Contracts with 
Customers
The new standard establishes a single comprehensive model 
for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from 
contracts with customers. Under IFRS 15, an entity recognises 
revenue when (or as) a performance obligation is satisfied, 
i.e. when control of the goods or services underlying the 
particular performance obligation is transferred to the 
customer. 
The Directors continue to assess the impact 
on the Company. The implementation of 
IFRS 15 will be complex due to the number of 
different revenue streams the Company has. 
Initial assessments indicate there will not be a 
material impact on the amount of revenue to 
be recognised but there could be an impact 
on the timing of recognition particularly 
for rights and services income. This is due to 
enhanced guidance around what constitutes 
a performance obligation. This may impact the 
split of revenue between periods within any 
given year and also between years.
IFRS 16 Leases The new standard details the requirements for the 
classification, measurement and recognition of lease 
arrangements. 
The adoption of the standard is likely to have 
an impact on the Company and the Directors 
continue to assess the impact.
Amendments to IAS 7 
Disclosure initiative
The amendments require an entity to provide disclosures that 
enable users of financial statements to evaluate changes in 
liabilities arising from financing activities.
. 
The Directors do not anticipate the application 
of these amendments will have a material impact 
on the Company’s financial statements.

e) Investment in subsidiaries
Investments in subsidiaries are recorded at cost less accumulated impairment in the statement of financial position. Investments are reviewed 
at each reporting date to assess whether there are any indicators of impairment. Any impairment losses are recognised in the income 
statement in the year they occur.
f) Share-based payments
The Company issues equity-settled share-based payment instruments to certain employees of the Group. Equity-settled share-based 
payment transactions are measured at fair value at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date of equity-settled share-
based payments is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of the 
shares that will eventually vest. 
Options granted under the Company’s share option schemes and Sharesave scheme are equity settled. The fair values of such options have 
been calculated using the Black–Scholes model or a modified version of the same, based on publicly available market data. 
Awards granted under the Company’s Performance Share Plan are equity settled. Part of any award granted under the plan is subject to a 
Total Shareholder Return performance condition. The fair value of this element of the awards is calculated using the Stochastic model. The

The Company has a significant concentration of credit risk due to its use of third party distributors. Credit limits for the final customers are set 
by the distributors based on a combination of payment history and third party credit references. Credit limits are reviewed on a regular basis 
in conjunction with debt ageing and collection history. The distributors belong to established international groups whose business includes a 
number of publishing interests and clients. The Company’s risk is limited as significant amounts outstanding through the UK distributors are 
secured by credit insurance.

Policy”) in Resolutions 2 and 3 respectively, which will be proposed as ordinary resolutions.
The Directors are required to prepare the Directors’ Remuneration Report, comprising an annual report detailing the remuneration of the 
Directors and an annual statement by the Chair of the Remuneration Committee. These are set out on pages 50 to 51 and 58 to 67 of the 
Annual Report and Accounts. The Company is required to seek Shareholders’ approval in respect of the contents of this report on an annual 
basis (excluding the part containing the Directors’ Remuneration Policy). The vote for Resolution 2 is an advisory one.

Resolution 3 (ordinary resolution) – Approval of the Directors’ Remuneration Policy
The Shareholders are separately asked to approve the Directors’ Remuneration Policy, which is set out on pages 52 to 57 of the Annual Report 
and Accounts. It is intended that this will take effect immediately after the AGM and will replace the existing policy that was approved by 
Shareholders in 2014 and which is due to expire on 22 July 2017. 
It is anticipated that the Directors’ Remuneration Policy will be in force for three years although the Remuneration Committee will closely 
monitor regulatory changes and market trends and, if necessary, may present a revised policy within that three-year period.
The Directors’ Remuneration Policy has been developed taking into account the principles of the UK Corporate Governance Code and the 
views of our major shareholders.
Resolution 4 (ordinary resolution) – Final Dividend
The Board proposes a final dividend of 5.60p per share for the year ended 28 February 2017. If approved, the recommended final dividend will 
be paid on 20 September 2017 to all Shareholders who are on the register of members on 25 August 2017. Payments will be made by cheque or 
BACS (where there is an existing dividend mandate). The final dividend equates to an aggregate distribution to Shareholders of approximately 
£4.2 million, making approximately £5.0 million for the interim and final dividend together for the year ended 28 February 2017.
Resolutions 5 to 11 (ordinary resolutions) – Re-election of Directors
In accordance with best practice for issuers listed on the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange and the Articles of Association of 
the Company (“Articles”), all the Directors will retire at the AGM and, being eligible, offer themselves for reappointment. The Board has 
considered the appraisal of the performance of each Director and recommends that each Director is reappointed. 
Resolution 12 (ordinary resolution) – Reappointment of the Auditor
The Board recommends that the incumbent External Auditor, KPMG LLP, be reappointed for a further year so that they are able to audit the 
Company’s report and accounts for the year ending 28 February 2018.
Resolution 13 (ordinary resolution) – Remuneration of the Auditor
The Board proposes that it be authorised to determine the level of the Auditor’s remuneration for the year ending 28 February 2018.
The Special Business to be proposed at the 2017 Annual General Meeting.
Resolution 14 (ordinary resolution) – Authority to allot Ordinary shares
This is an ordinary resolution to replace the general authority, last given at the 2016 AGM, for the Directors to be authorised to allot Ordinary 
shares pursuant to section 551 of the Act. This resolution, if passed, would give the Directors the authority to allot up to 25,107,012 Ordinary 
shares of 1.25 pence with a nominal value of £313,838, representing approximately 33.33% of the issued Ordinary share capital of the 
Company at the date of this notice.
This authority, if granted, will expire on the earlier of the conclusion of the Company’s next AGM and 15 months from the date of passing this 
resolution. The Board has no present intention of exercising the authority granted by this resolution save in the circumstances referred to 
below. The Board intends to seek its renewal at subsequent AGMs of the Company.
As at the date of signing the Directors’ Remuneration Report for the 2017 Annual Report, the Directors had beneficial holdings of Ordinary 
shares in the Company which, in aggregate, amounted to approximately 2.3% of the Ordinary shares in issue. The Directors have been 
granted awards under the Company’s share award schemes that, if they were to fully vest, would entitle the Directors to further Ordinary 
shares which in aggregate would amount to approximately a further 2.8% of the Ordinary shares in issue. 
Resolutions 15 and 16 (special resolutions) – Disapplication of statutory pre-emption provisions
If the Directors wish to allot new shares and other equity securities, or to sell treasury shares, for cash (other than in connection with 
an employee share scheme), company law requires that these shares are offered first to shareholders in proportion to their existing 
shareholdings. 
The Statement of Principles on Disapplying Pre-Emption Rights most recently published by the Pre-Emption Group prior to the date of this 
notice supports the annual disapplication of pre-emption rights in respect of allotments of shares and other equity securities and sales 
of treasury shares for cash representing no more than 5% of issued ordinary share capital of the Company (exclusive of treasury shares), 
without restriction as to the use of proceeds of those allotments.

Bloomsbury AR2017-proof 6.indd   129 6/12/2017   1:33:54 PM 25133.04    12 June 2017 1:31 PM    Proof 6
Accordingly, the purpose of Resolution 15 is to authorise the Directors to allot new Ordinary shares pursuant to the allotment authority  
given to them by Resolution 14, or to sell treasury shares, for cash (i) pursuant to the terms of the Company’s employees’ share schemes,  
(ii) in connection with a pre-emptive offer or rights issue or (iii) otherwise up to a nominal value equivalent to 5% of the issued ordinary 
share capital (exclusive of treasury shares) without the shares first being offered to existing shareholders in proportion to their existing 
shareholdings.
The Board also intends to adhere to the provisions in the Pre-Emption Group’s Statement of Principles and not to allot shares or other equity 
securities or to sell treasury shares for cash on a non pre-emptive basis pursuant to the authority in Resolution 15 in excess of an amount 
equal to 7.5 per cent of the issued ordinary share capital (excluding treasury shares), within a rolling three-year period, other than:
i. with prior consultation with shareholders; or
ii.  in connection with an acquisition or specified capital investment which is announced contemporaneously with the allotment or which has 
taken place in the preceding six-month period and is disclosed in the announcement of the allotment.
The Pre-Emption Group’s Statement of Principles also supports the annual disapplication of pre-emption rights in respect of allotments of 
shares and other equity securities and sales of treasury shares for cash representing no more than an additional 5% of issued ordinary share 
capital (exclusive of treasury shares), to be used only in connection with an acquisition or specified capital investment in respect of which 
sufficient information is made available to shareholders to enable them to reach an assessment of the potential return.
Accordingly, and in line with the template resolutions published by the Pre-Emption Group, the purpose of Resolution 16 is to authorise the 
Directors to allot new shares and other equity securities pursuant to the allotment authority given by Resolution 14, or sell treasury shares, for 
cash up to a further nominal amount equivalent to 5% of issued ordinary share capital (exclusive of treasury shares) only in connection with 
an acquisition or specified capital investment which is announced contemporaneously with the allotment, or which has taken place in the 
preceding six-month period and is disclosed in the announcement of the issue. If the authority given in Resolution 16 is used, the Company 
will publish details of the placing in its next annual report.
If Resolutions 15 and 16 are passed, the authority will expire on the earlier of the conclusion of the Company’s next AGM and 15 months from 
the date of passing the resolutions.
The Board considers the authorities in Resolutions 15 and 16 to be appropriate in order to allow the Company flexibility to finance business 
opportunities or to conduct a pre-emptive offer or rights issue without the need to comply with the strict requirements of the statutory pre-
emption provisions. The Directors have no current intention to exercise the authorities granted by Resolutions 15 and 16. The Company has 
not allotted Ordinary shares or sold treasury shares for cash on a non-pre-emptive basis in the previous five years.
Resolution 17 (special resolution) – Authority for the Company to purchase Ordinary shares
This is a resolution to replace the general authority, last given at the 2016 AGM, for the Company to purchase its own Ordinary shares and 
either to cancel them or to hold them as Treasury shares. The Company would be authorised to make market purchases of up to 7,532,857 
Ordinary shares with a nominal value of £94,161, being equivalent to 10% of the issued Ordinary share capital (excluding treasury shares) at 
the date of this notice.
Treasury shares are not taken into account in calculations of earnings per share and may only be transferred pursuant to an employee 
share scheme, cancelled or sold for cash. Shares would only be purchased if the Directors consider such purchases are in the best interests of 
Shareholders generally and can be expected to result in an increase in earnings per share. The authority will only be used after considering 
the prevailing market conditions, other investment opportunities, appropriate gearing levels and the overall financial position of the 
Company. Any purchases would be market purchases through the London Stock Exchange. The upper and lower limits on the price which 
may be paid for those shares are set out in the resolution itself.
This authority would, if granted, expire on the earlier of the conclusion of the Company’s next AGM and 15 months from the date of passing 
this resolution.
The Directors believe it is prudent to seek this general authority to be able to act if circumstances arise in which they consider such purchases 
to be in the best interests of Shareholders generally. The Directors have no current intention to exercise the authority granted by this 
resolution. The Company has not purchased its own Ordinary shares in the previous five years and holds no shares in treasury as at the date 
of this notice.

Notes:
1. You may vote your shares electronically at www.signalshares.com 
2.  Only the holders of Ordinary shares are entitled to attend the meeting and vote. A member entitled to attend and vote may appoint one or 
more proxies to attend, speak and vote on his behalf. A proxy need not be a member of the Company. A Form of Proxy is enclosed for your 
use. Further copies of the Form of Proxy may be obtained from the registered office of the Company or from www.bloomsbury-ir.co.uk.
3.  If a member wishes his proxy to speak on his behalf at the meeting, he or she will need to appoint his/her own choice of proxy (who is not 
the Chairman) and give instructions directly to the proxy. The completion and return of a Form of Proxy will enable a Shareholder to vote at 
the Annual General Meeting without having to be present at the Annual General Meeting, but will not preclude him/her from attending the 
Annual General Meeting and voting in person if he/she should subsequently decide to do so.
4.  A member may appoint more than one proxy provided each proxy is appointed to exercise rights attached to different shares. A member 
may not appoint more than one proxy to exercise rights attached to any one share. To appoint more than one proxy, please sign and date 
the Form of Proxy and attach a schedule listing the names and addresses (in block letters) of all your proxies, the number of shares in respect 
of which each proxy is appointed (which, in aggregate, should not exceed the number of shares held by you) and indicating how you wish 
each proxy to vote or abstain from voting. If you wish to appoint the Chairman as one of your multiple proxies, insert “Chairman of the 
Meeting” in the box which is used to identify the name of the proxy on the relevant proxy card.
5.  To be valid, the enclosed Form of Proxy must be lodged with the Company’s Registrars, Capita Asset Services, not later than 48 hours before 
the time appointed for the holding of the Annual General Meeting.
6.  Shareholders included on the register of members (in relation to Ordinary shares held in CREST, pursuant to Regulation 41 of the 
Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001) at close of business on 16 July 2017 will be entitled to attend and vote at the Annual General 
Meeting in respect of the number of Ordinary shares registered in their name at that time. Changes to the register of members after that time 
will be disregarded in determining the rights of any person to attend or vote at the meeting.
7.  Any person to whom this notice is sent who is a person nominated under section 146 of the Act to enjoy information rights  
(a “Nominated Person”) may, under an agreement between him/her and the Shareholder by whom he/she was nominated (“Relevant 
Member”), have a right to be appointed (or to have someone else appointed) as a proxy for the Annual General Meeting. If a Nominated 
Person has no such proxy appointment right or does not wish to exercise it, he/she, under any such agreement, may have a right to 
give instructions to the Relevant Member as to the exercise of voting rights. Your main point of contact in terms of your investment in 
the Company remains the Relevant Member (or, perhaps, your custodian or broker) and you should continue to contact them (and 
not the Company) regarding any changes or queries relating to your personal details and your interest in the Company (including any 
administrative matters). The only exception to this is where the Company expressly requests a response from you.
8.  The statement of the rights of Shareholders in relation to the appointment of proxies does not apply to Nominated Persons. The rights 
described in this regard can only be exercised by Shareholders of the Company.
9.  Shareholders should note that it is possible that, pursuant to requests made by Shareholders of the Company under sections 527 to 531 of 
the Act, the Company may be required to publish on a website a statement setting out any matter relating to: (i) the audit of the Company’s 
accounts (including the Auditor’s Report and the conduct of the audit) that are to be laid before the Annual General Meeting; or (ii) any 
circumstance connected with an Auditor of the Company ceasing to hold office since the previous meeting at which annual accounts and 
reports were laid in accordance with section 437 of the Act. The Company may not require the Shareholders requesting any such website 
publication to pay its expenses in complying with sections 527 or 528 of the Act. Where the Company is required to place a statement on 
a website under section 527 of the Act, it must forward the statement to the Company’s Auditor not later than the time when it makes the 
statement available on the website. The business which may be dealt with at the Annual General Meeting includes any statement that the 
Company has been required under section 527 of the Act to publish on a website.
10.  A corporation which is a member can appoint one or more corporate representatives who may exercise, on its behalf, all its powers as a 
member provided that no more than one corporate representative exercises powers over the same share.
11.  In the case of joint registered holders, the signature of one holder will be accepted and the vote of the senior who tenders a vote, whether in 
person or proxy, shall be accepted to the exclusion of the votes of the other joint holders. For this purpose, seniority shall be determined by 
the order in which the names stand on the register of members in respect of the relevant joint holding.
12.  Copies of the following documents will be available for inspection at the Company’s Registered Office, 50 Bedford Square, London WC1B 
3DP, during usual business hours on any weekday, Saturdays and public holidays excepted, from the date of this notice until the date of the 
Annual General Meeting and at the place of the Annual General Meeting for 15 minutes prior to and during the meeting:
