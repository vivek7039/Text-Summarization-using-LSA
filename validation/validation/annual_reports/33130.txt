4.2p RESULTS
I am pleased to report a record set of results for
the financial year 2002, a period marked by the
most challenging trading conditions in the
global IT industry for a long time. Group
turnover for the year to 30 June 2002 was up
7% to £149.5m (2001: £140.3m). Acquisitions
contributed 1% of turnover growth. Operating
profit before exceptional items amounted to
£9.2m (2001: £8.1m), an increase of 14%. 
Operating profit before goodwill amortisation
and exceptional items increased by 14% to £ 11.3m
(2001: £9.9m). Profit before tax, goodwill amor-
tisation and exceptional items was £10.9m
(2001: £9.6m), up 13%. After tax and minority
interests basic earnings per share is calculated
at 3.5p (2001: 27.9p), down 87%. Adjusted
earnings per share, earnings being adjusted for
goodwill amortisation and exceptional items,
rose 10% to 36.9p (2001: 33.4p).
During the year the core EDC (Electronic
Document Capture) Division continued to bene-
fit from its position as the leading global
partner for EDC products and services with a
significant level of new contract gains. In the
face of very challenging global IT market condi-
tions EDC continued its growth record and
expanded its market position by new product
launches and additional partnership
agreements.
The SGA (Samsung General Agency) Division
experienced declining turnover rates in difficult
trading conditions, but maintained an
acceptable, albeit lower, level of operating profit
contribution.
FINANCIAL POSITION
Due to its cash generative business model the
Group generated cash flow from operations of
£14.0m (2001: £8.4m) and ended the year with
net funds of £3.8m (net debt of £0.7m at 30
June 2001). The Group spent £1.7m in cash on
acquisitions and other investments during the
year .
OPERATING REVIEW
The EDC Division is DICOM Group’s largest
division, representing 82% of profits. It
develops and sells software and electronic
components, provides a broad range of EDC
services and distributes key related products to
over 1,000 system integrators and software
houses in more than 60 countries world-wide.
EDC solutions offer end users high returns on
investment by allowing data and document
intensive organisations to reduce business
transaction costs and improve their level of
customer service.
EDC achieved organic sales growth in local cur-
rency terms of 12%. Acquisitions contributed an
additional 1% in sales. In total, EDC contributed
68% (2001: 63%) of the Group’s turnover in the
year to 30 June 2002. The provision of services
and sales of products developed by the Group
now account for 56% of EDC turnover (2001:
51%). The sale of complementary third party
products, primarily high-speed document
scanners, accounted for 44% (2001: 49%).

Turnover in £m
CHAIRMAN’ S
S TA TEMENT The EDC Division contributed £9.3m (2001:
£7 .0m) operating profit, an increase of 33%.
This represents 82% of DICOM Group’s total
operating profit before goodwill amortisation
and exceptional items. During the year EDC also
launched a number of new products and
entered new partnership arrangements, which
will enable the Group to address new areas of
the EDC market.
The SGA Division continued to experience
difficult trading conditions, particularly in
Austria. Turnover fell by 8% to £47.5m (2001:
£51.5m), but SGA contributed 18% of DICOM
Group’s total operating profit before goodwill
amortisation and exceptional items.
EXCEPTIONAL CHARGES
As previously announced DICOM Group has
incurred certain costs during the year, which
have been treated as exceptional charges.
Following the default on 1 April 2002 of a
scheduled consideration payment DICOM Group
has reviewed its overall exposure in relation to a
non-core investment disposed of in early 2000.
A provision of £4m (with no adverse future cash
flow implications) is considered necessary. This
sum is treated as an exceptional item. The
residual exposure is secured by 450,000
DICOM Group shares, currently held in escrow. 
DICOM Group had to write off a trade debt owed
by a US distributor, which discontinued business
activities in early December 2001, resulting in
an exceptional charge of £1.2m. 
DICOM Group’s business prospects in the US
have not been materially adversely affected by
the discontinuance of the US distributor. DICOM
Group markets its products and services
through an extensive network of ISV’s
(Independent Software Vendors) and resellers
and is therefore not overly dependent on any
specific distributor. DICOM Group has appointed
four distributors in the US and has authorised
more than 1,000 resellers worldwide to
integrate and market its products. 
MANAGEMENT CHANGES 
We announced in late 2001 that after 11 very
happy years as CEO of DICOM Group I would be
retiring with effect from 1 July 2002 to take up
the post of Non-executive Chairman. I want to
take this opportunity to thank all our
employees, business partners and shareholders
for their outstanding contribution in building
DICOM Group into a great company.
The Group Board has committed significant
resources into the planning of our  management
succession. We are very pleased to have elected
Arnold von Büren to succeed me as CEO from 1
July 2002. Arnold has been with the Group
since 1994 and recently managed the successful
integration of Kofax since February 2000.
Before that he was responsible for the Europe-
based EDC operations. Urs Niederberger was
promoted to the position of Chief Operating
Officer, while retaining his function as Group
Finance Director.
During the last two years a strong executive
team has been built up including the heads of
each of the principal business units and the
executive board members.
STAFF
Staff numbers grew from 718 to 773 during the
year, principally due to the acquisition of a
majority stake in DICOM Asia. DICOM Group’s
future prosperity is in large measure dependent
on the ability, energy and loyalty of our staff,
whose specialist knowledge, training and
Annual Report 2002

experience is key to the successful provision of
the Group’s value-added services. Staff turnover
has remained at low levels and we continue to
attract high calibre people around the world. I
would like to record my personal appreciation to
all staff for their commitment and contribution
during the year.
DIVIDEND
The Directors propose the payment of a final
dividend of 2.8p per ordinary share, to be paid
on 29 November 2002 to those shareholders on
the register as at 1 November 2002, which when
added to the interim dividend of 1.4p per
ordinary share, makes a recommended total
dividend for the year of 4.2p per ordinary share
(2001: 3.66p). This represents an increase of
15% over the previous year.
ACQUISITIONS
On 27 June 2002 DICOM Group announced it
had increased its holding in DICOM Asia
Holdings Pte Ltd from 40% to 80% by
purchasing the balance from local management.
The consideration paid was S$2.4m (£0.9m) in
cash. The local management team, who will
continue to run the Asian operation, holds the
remaining 20%. DICOM Asia, founded in 1996, is
headquartered in Singapore and active in 10
countries throughout Asia and Australia. Its
subsidiaries in Malaysia, the Philippines,
Indonesia and in Australia are the EDC market
leaders in their respective territories. Recently
DICOM Asia also expanded into new growth
markets in the Greater China region with sales
outlets in Hong Kong, Taipei and Beijing.
On 13 September 2002, DICOM Group increased
the holding in PDS S.r .l., its principal EDC sales
organisation in Italy, from 60% to 100% by
purchasing the balance from local management.
The purchase price consisted of E4.3m (£2.7m)
payable in cash on completion and a deferred
consideration of up to E1.9m (£1.2m), dependent
on performance over the financial years 2003-
2005.
LISTING INFORMATION
In January 2002 DICOM Group became a
constituent of the techMARK100 index,
comprising the 100 largest UK technology
companies on the London Stock Exchange. In
July 2002 DICOM Group applied for a de-listing
from the Neuer Markt segment of the Deutsche
Börse in Frankfurt, while retaining its listing on
the main board (“Geregelter Markt”). These
changes became effective on 1 August 2002. On
19 August 2002 it was announced that DICOM
Group was re-classified under the ‘Computer
Services’ FTSE UK sub sector on the London
Stock Exchange.
APPOINTMENT OF NEW ADVISOR AND
BROKER
In April 2002 DICOM Group announced the
appointment of HSBC Investment Bank plc,
London, as its Financial Advisor and Corporate
Broker.
PROSPECTS
The Group is well positioned in its core EDC
market, which continues to show good growth
in contrast to the difficult general trading
conditions in the IT market. We are excited by
recent product launches and partnership
agreements that will support our expansion into
segments of the EDC market not previously
covered by the Group. The EDC division's
current trading performance and good growth
prospects enable the Directors to view the
Group's outlook with optimism.
Otto Schmid
Chairman 10 October 2002 Annual Report 2002
9
I am delighted to provide a review of the trading
companies in my new position as Chief
Executive of DICOM Group. Since being founded
11 years ago and as a result of the vision and
leadership provided by my predecessor Otto
Schmid, the Group has shown an exceptional
development. We were established as a Swiss
company trading IT peripherals and have gone
through a substantial evolution since. Today, we
are recognised as the worldwide leader in our
target markets, active in over 60 countries
around the globe.
In the past most enterprises have heavily
invested in a broad range of IT solutions that
automate their business transactions and
support decision making. However connectivity
between input devices and applications is
frequently inadequate or absent resulting in
data and document access being imprecise,
slow and hence expensive.
The EDC solutions offered by DICOM Group
solve this dilemma at an attractive cost to
benefit ratio. We have been able to grow the
EDC Division by approximately 30% year over
year since our flotation in 1996, through our
technological leadership and strict adherence to
our successful sales channel concept.  Building
on this success it is my goal to improve the
Group’s market position in the EDC market,
whilst also adding businesses that are
complementary to our core area of activities.
DICOM Group achieved excellent results in its
core EDC Division last year in contrast to
further deteriorating conditions in the IT
industry. Our business partners and customers
have continued to report that IT budgets remain
under tight scrutiny. EDC investments, however,
were broadly saved from this development as
they allow quick payback periods to be
achieved.
EDC now contributes more than 68% to total
Group turnover. Turnover with own products
and services showed substantial growth during
the year and contributed 39% and 17%
respectively of sales. Third party products sold
by the EDC Division accounted for the balance.
It is our strategy to leverage our position in the
EDC market to make DICOM Group’s products
available to the high and low end of the EDC
market. As a result we have allocated
significantly more funds to research and
development.  Last year we increased spending
by 41% to £7.4m (2001: £5.3m). This
commitment has allowed us a high rate of
product innovations for existing products and
the launch of entirely new products at the same
time.

CHIEF EXE C UTIVE’ S
REVIEW which is underscored by the successful
participation in a rising number of large EDC
projects. Consequently the number of Ascent
Capture software licences sold to date has
increased significantly to 32,500 (30 June 2001:
22,500). 
EUROPE
DICOM Europe, our European sales and service
operations, provided solid growth and better
margins. In the Group’s major territories an
improved performance was achieved in contrast
to the general slow-down in the IT industry. The
drive to provide consulting and other services
continues to improve the quantity and quality of
the Group’s service revenues.
ASIA
In June we announced that our stake in DICOM
Asia was increased from 40% to 80%. This
acquisition strengthens our involvement in
South East Asia, the Greater China region and
Australia and reinforces the Group’s ongoing
strategy to grow both organically and by
acquisitions. During the past four years, DICOM
Asia has successfully managed to expand its
reach, customer base and capabilities in very
challenging market conditions. We are currently
increasing our activities in the Greater China
region and also intend to exploit fully our leading
position in the high growth Asian market.
DICOM Group is better placed than ever to
capitalise on its increased global presence, with
sales and support services in every major
market in the world and a product range which
is the most comprehensive in the industry, at the
cutting edge of today’s technology in EDC
software.

The software version of VRS (v2.1) now supports
more than 40 document scanner models with
real time image enhancement features. Several
larger projects were secured. The ASIC version
of VRS, which is being sold on the basis of OEM
agreement for use in document scanners, is
being sold to both new scanner manufacturers
and for new scanner models thereby increasing
its future sales prospects significantly. In May
2002 we were awarded an US patent for VRS.
Ascent Capture 5.5, a major release of the award
winning capture application, was launched in
May 2002 offering broader product functionality
and improved support for high performance
databases. With these improvements Ascent
Capture has been able to gain further market
share in the high end sector of the EDC market.
In June 2002, we launched Ascent Ricochet. It is
the first software product on the market that
extends professional EDC features to every
desktop in an enterprise, government
organisation or not for profit organisation. It
permits Multifunctional Products and digital
copiers to be used as document scanners.
Almost all organisations have copiers and
scanner in use.  This new product brings added
efficiency and features to these equipment
investments.
Blue chip software houses and system
integrators have continued to integrate Ascent
Capture products and VRS into their solutions as
a result of ongoing focused sales and marketing
initiatives. Ascent Capture, also described in the
EDC market as “The Operating System of
Capture”, continues to move upmarket – a trend Annual Report 2002

ACQUISITIONS AND INVESTMENTS
At the end of our financial year, DICOM Group
increased its holding in DICOM Asia from 40%
to 80% by purchasing the balance from local
management. The consideration paid was
S$2.4m (£0.9m) in cash. The local management
team, who will continue to run the Asian
operation, is retaining the remaining 20%. 
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT 
EXPENDITURE
DICOM Group continues to invest in the ongoing
research and development of its market leading
products. Such expenditure on research and
development is charged to the profit and loss
account as incurred. Such costs totalled £7.4m
(2001: £5.3m).
TAXATION
The pre-goodwill and pre-exceptional tax charge
for the year ended 30 June 2002 was £3.2m,
giving an effective tax rate of 30% (2001: 29%).
A tax credit of £0.4m was attributable to
exceptional items.
GROUP PERFORMANCE
Operating profit before goodwill amortisation
and exceptional items increased by 14% to
£11.3m (2001: £9.9m) on sales of £149.5m (2001:
£140.3m). In the first six months, operating
profit before goodwill amortisation and excep-
tional items was £5.5m, a margin of 7.2% on
sales of £75.6m. The second half results
contributed £5.8m or 7.8% on sales of £73.9m.
Overall gross margin increased to 36.4% (2001:
restated to 33.5%). The increase is due to the
change in business mix (high growth in high
margin business and low/negative growth in
lower margin business). 
During the year operating expenses before
goodwill amortisation and exceptional items
increased from £37.1m to £43.1m, up 16%.
Goodwill amortisation included under operating
expenses increased to £2.1m (2001: £1.8m).
Adjusted earnings per share increased 10% to
36.9p (33.4p). Adjusted earnings per share is
shown exclusive of exceptional items and the
impact of goodwill amortisation. Basic earnings
per share are at 3.5p (27.9p). Diluted earnings
per share decreased to 3.5p (27.6p).

ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The figures for the previous year have been
restated due to the introduction of FRS 19
”Deferred tax”. Additionally the Group changed
its accounting of direct costs for its increased
income from professional services. While those
costs have been included under operating
expenses in previous periods, the board
considered that it should be shown as direct
costs of sales as from this year on. Thus the
accounting change has only an impact on Gross
profit and Operating expenses while Operating
Profit remains unchanged.

BALANCE SHEET
Net funds as per 30 June 2002 amounted to
£3.8m (30 June 2001: net debt of £0.7m).
Shareholders’ funds increased from £65.0m to
£65.5m. At year-end committed but undrawn
working capital facilities amounted to £24.7m
(2001: £22.1m). The Group’s balance sheet
therefore remains strong.
CASH FLOW
During the year the operating activities of the
Group have generated positive operating cash
flows of £14.0m (2001: £8.4m), representing
125% of operating profit before goodwill
amortisation and exceptional items. 
DIVIDEND
A final dividend of 2.8p has been proposed,
making a total dividend payable on ordinary
shares for the year of 4.2p (2001: 3.66p), up
15%. Dividends on ordinary shares will absorb
£0.9m (2001: £0.8m) of the group’s after tax
earnings. These are covered 0.8 times (2001: 7.6
times) by profit attributable to ordinary share-
holders, and 8.8 times (2001: 9.1 times) by profit
before goodwill amortisation and exceptional
items.

documentation is eliminated. In many cases an
almost immediate pay back can be demonstrated
in introducing EDC solutions.
In close co-operation with our world-wide
network of 1,000 authorised business partners
we have helped more than 10,000 blue chip
companies to achieve substantial commercial
benefits in introducing EDC to their IT systems.
We have brought them closer in accomplishing
the vision of having all information at “the user’s
fingertips”.
THE OPPORTUNITY
On average front and back office workers are
only able to retrieve less than 10 per cent of their
documents electronically. The balance are stored
and delivered in formats that do not allow the
user to search and find terms or content within
them. Opportunities missed and the time wasted
in accessing information relevant for business
transactions and decision making is substantial.
In addition, the cost involved in manually
capturing documents is huge. Cases where
companies and government organisations need
to capture thousands of documents each day is
high and rising, yet often the cost saving potenti-
al for automating the process has been
neglected.
The advent of electronic forms and the increased
use of multimedia files make it an increasingly
difficult task to retrieve embedded data in such
documents.
THE SOLUTION
Electronic Document Capture products provided
by DICOM Group solve the dilemma. Our
solutions manage and automate the capture
process. They allow many enterprise
organisations to achieve high return on
investment by cutting costs for collecting,
processing, interpretation, distribution and
export of data and documents.
In addition time spent incurred in searching for
information and the problem of lost

CHASE MANHATTAN MORTGAGE HELPS
MILLIONS OF AMERICANS TO REALISE THE
DREAM OF PROPERTY OWNERSHIP
The company is one of the largest mortgage
originators and servicers and is a key
component of JP Morgan Chase, the nation’s
third-largest bank. Chase Manhattan Mortgage
chose Kofax Ascent Capture software and
Adrenaline scanner controller boards, and now
scans more than 2.5 million documents per
month. Automated indexing was changed from
hand-print recognition to Adrenaline bar code
recognition and the enhancements dropped the
manual correction rate from nearly 50 percent
to less than 1 percent.
Further, Chase is able to automatically accept
input from other applications with new polling
features. Since Chase buys and services a high
volume of mortgages from other financial
institutions, this integrated approach means
Chase can quickly and easily assign loan
numbers to mortgages from any source.
As a result of cost improvements and reduced
staff requirements, Chase reduces scanning
charges from 10 cents to 6 cents per page and
has been able to scan 40 percent more
documents using the same equipment.
DIGITISING THE LAW, SPEEDING UP JUSTICE
Ever wondered how the mass of correspondence
and summary documents and files that pass
through a courthouse on a daily basis are
managed? 
The District Court System in Rotterdam, that
DICOM Group plc
14
falls under the Dutch Ministry of Justice,
realised that there had to be another way in this
brave new technological world.
When in full production, the system will be able
to scan 20,000 pages per day, including letters,
faxes and all other documents, black and white
or colour, legal or otherwise, related to the
administration of justice. Documents are
converted to pdf files and an Annotation
Summariser summarises all remarks per file
with direct links to the individual documents
contained in the file. The Kofax products allow
easy integration and across the board imaging
functionality.
REGISTER OF COMPANIES (ROC),
MALAYSIA
In line with the nation’s creed “Malaysia Boleh”
(Malaysia Can Do It!) the ROC commissioned a
system to capture, store and retrieve its daily
volume of up to 60,000 documents. They also
required a system which would establish a
collaborative working network between its Kuala
Lumpur headquarters and 11 regional centres
using existing communication infrastructure. A
third challenge was to transform its decades old
paper mountain of documents into easily
retrievable electronic format. 
OUR
CU ST OMERS The system implementation and staff training,
using the entire range of DICOM Group EDC
products, was done in stages at the Kuala
Lumpur HQ, followed by the regional centres.
The Ascent Capture Internet Server helped
regional centres capture and transmit
documents via internet connections, eliminating
the physical transportation of documents by
truck, saving time and costs as well as the
potential loss of documents. In addition the
Ascent Capture Web Validation Server (WVS)
enabled work sharing capability. With the WVS,
a regional centre could scan and upload
documents making them available on a server
for a less busy centre to index and validate
them. As a result productivity rates soared.
Eliminating the paper mountain through
conversion into electronic format led to a
substantial reduction in physical storage space.
At the end of the project, the ROC Malaysia had
a system in place which allows documents to be
viewed online and available 24 hours from
receipt throughout the nation, with a retrieval
time reduced to a maximum 15 minutes once a
document is online. Phase 2 projects immediate
public access at all ROC centres as well as
through online services.

high-profile initiative to gain new customers.
Halifax installed an Ascent Capture based
production capture system to process new
current account applications. The system
ensures compliance with legislation introduced
Annual Report 2002
15
earlier this year that imposes strict time limits
for the account transfer process.
Demonstrating a true commitment to customer
service, this back-office facility allows retail cus-
tomers to switch to the Halifax with minimum
delays.
VOLKSWAGEN - PASSPORT TO SUCCESS
Volkswagen introduced a sophisticated quality
control procedure whereby each finished car
received its own “passport”. This document can
be viewed at any given moment during and
after the production process. About 1,100 cars a
day are manufactured at Volkswagen Belgium
and the passport which contains between 8 and
22 pages is instantaneous digitised. With this
system it is easy to retrieve the required
documents. 
TAKING OFF WITH INVOICE CAPTURE
Aero-Dienst currently has well over 1,000
suppliers, who send a total of several tens of
thousands of incoming invoices and credit notes
per year to the accounting department.  For a
service company it is indispensable to have its
invoices promptly available. The capture
solution was able to achieve an identification
and classification rate of 90 - 95% for the top DICOM Group plc
16
20 main suppliers. Kofax Ascent Capture 5 was
selected as the capture solution, in conjunction
with DICOM Invoice123. Scanning takes place on
3 stations, using Fujitsu M3093DE scanners with
Kofax VRS. 
WHERE E-GOVERNMENT BECOMES BEST
PRACTICE
The Office of the Public Guardian (OPG) in
Scotland was set up to meet the demands of
“The Adults with Incapacity Act“. They establis-
hed a revolutionary IT system which includes a
range of technologies such as Relational
Database for storing of authorised data, Word
Indexing for fast and easy retrieval of data,
EDM, electronic document management for
electronic generation and storing, and for lin-
king to cases, also ensuring that all incoming
items are stored and linked simultaneously. A
customised bar code system tracks down physi-
cal files and sensitive information sent via e-
mail is automatically encrypted. Incoming paper
documents are digitised thanks to several Kodak
scanner stations equipped with Kofax Ascent
Capture software. This process not only
streamlines the workflow but also ensures the
accessibility and the security of all documents.

ASCENT CAPTURE®
Ascent Capture is a highly customisable
software platform for capturing information in
many different formats, from many locations
and introducing it into critical business
applications. It highly automates the capture
process, including capturing both scanned and
electronic documents and forms, validating the
extracted data, indexing it for later retrieval,
and connecting it to a wide variety of electronic
business systems. Ascent Capture is recognised
as the “Operating System of Capture” – the
most widely used capture software in the world.
More than 32,500 Ascent licenses have been
sold to date and installed at over 10,000 sites.
In 2002, Ascent Capture V5.5 was introduced
with a powerful new OCR engine and additional
support for XML capture.
ASCENT RICOCHET™
High volume document capture used to require
a dedicated scanner and scanner operator. With
Ascent Ricochet, transactions can be easily
captured and indexed by the front-office
workers who know the most about the
documents. By enabling capture on the office
desktop, Ascent Ricochet amplifies the benefits
of distributed capture: business workflows can
be triggered in minutes, and indexing by the
content expert results in accurate classification
of mission-critical documents. Ascent Ricochet
leverages standard office equipment such as
digital copiers and multifunction peripherals
and no investment in new special-purpose
hardware has to be made. Ascent Ricochet
supports both paper and e-documents, enables
visual checking of scanned documents, and
provides detailed delivery notification, all
helping to extend the power of the Operating
System of Capture to every desktop in an
organisation.

ASCENT CAPTURE INTERNET SERVER®
When an organisation needs to capture a large
volume of documents at its outlets, the Ascent
Capture Internet Server is the proven way to
extend batch capture to those remote sites.
Remote offices can directly capture paper or 
e-documents, saving time and shipping costs
and eliminating the possibility of lost
documents. The captured documents are
transmitted to the central site via the Internet,
where they are released to back-end systems
for immediate retrieval. 
ASCENT CAPTURE WEB VALIDATION SERVER®
The Ascent Capture Web Validation Server
extends Ascent’s indexing and validation
capabilities to anyone equipped with a standard
Web browser. Indexing can be performed by
part-time workers at home or by subject-matter
experts in their offices or other time zones. The
Ascent Capture Web Validation Server can be
easily added to the Ascent Capture workflow so
documents can be automatically sent to
authorised remote operators for indexing.
Ascent Capture User Profiles control what
documents go to which operators, and all
activity is recorded for centralised tracking and
reporting.
VIRTUALRESCAN (VRS)
Since its introduction in 1999, VRS has become
the de facto standard for image processing and
scanning productivity. This unique technology
continues to win major awards, including
Product of the Year 2001 from Transform
magazine, and it was a key component of the
FedEx distributed imaging system that was
named Best Document/Data Capture
Application in the 2002 RealWare awards. VRS
makes using a document scanner as easy as
using a point-and-click camera. It automatically
improves image quality and provides the
unprecedented ability to produce perfect scans
without costly rescanning. As quickly as images
pass through the scanner, VRS checks and
adjusts for alignment (skew), brightness,
contrast, and image clarity. Any image problems
are immediately corrected by VRS, producing
the straightest, most readable images possible.
VRS shines on the toughest documents, such as
carbon copies, colour or tinted documents or
pages which combine very light and very dark
areas. VRS is available for a range of scanners,
from software versions for low-volume scanners
to OEM hardware in production scanners.
ADRENALINE
Adrenaline is a complete family of image-
processing accelerators and software engines
designed to offer the best support possible for
professional document scanning. The
Adrenaline product family provides certified
compatibility with document scanners,
unrivalled technical support, dependable
installation and operation, sophisticated image
processing and advanced recognition features
such as bar code and patch code recognition,
page registration, and form recognition.

Borrowings are negotiated locally after
consultation with Group directors. Any funds in
excess of local working capital requirements are DICOM Group is committed to high standards of
corporate governance. Having reviewed its
compliance with the Combined Code the Board
confirms that the Company has, throughout the
year , complied with all aspects of the Code, except
that the role of chairman and chief executive was
combined and that the chief executive was a
member of the remuneration committee as well as
there was no absolute requirement for each
Director to retire at least every three years. 
The roles of non-executive chairman and chief
executive are now split. The remuneration
committee now only comprises non-executive
directors. The proposed changes to the Articles of
association ensure compliance with the Combined
Code in relation to the re-election of directors. 
This statement explains how the Board has set out
to ensure that the Group has an effective system
of corporate governance and provides details of
the procedures the Board has established to apply
the principles set out in the Combined Code.
BOARD OF DIRECTORS
The Board leads and maintains full and effective
control over the Company’s activities. The
Company has now separate posts of Chairman and
Chief Executive and, in addition, the Board
currently comprises three other Executive
Directors and four independent Non-executive
Directors. Short biographies of all of the directors
are set out on pages 27 to 28 of this report. The
Board considers that the balance of its constitution
brings both independence and an appropriate
balance of experience in judging matters of
strategy, performance, resources, investor
relations, internal controls and corporate
governance.
The Board meets at least eight times each year ,
either physically or by conference call, with
additional meetings and contact between the
meetings as necessary. The Board has a schedule
of matters reserved for its consideration. These
Annual Report 2002
31
include the Group's strategic plans and annual and
mid term operating plans, business acquisitions
and disposals of companies, major litigation and
employee share schemes.
All directors have access to the services of the
Company Secretary for any information or advice
they may require. In addition they may take
independent professional advice if necessary at
the Company’s expense.
When new members are appointed to the Board,
they are provided with advice from the Company’s
solicitors in respect of their role and duties as a
public company director .
The key functions of the Chairman are to conduct
Board meetings and meetings of shareholders, to
ensure that all directors are properly briefed for a
full and constructive part in Board discussions, to
develop and lead business strategies and
processes. There is a clear distinction between the
Chairman’s role and that of the Chief Executive
who is responsible for managing the Group’s day
to day business. 
This separation of responsibilities, together with
the ratio of board membership between executive
and non-executive directors, ensures there is a
balance of power and authority at the head of the
Company. The views of all directors are taken into
account in the decision-making process.
Bruce Powell has been designated the senior Non-
executive director . Any concerns relating to the
executive management of the Company or the
performance of the other Non-executive Directors
may be raised with him. 
To enable the Board to function effectively and
directors to discharge their responsibilities, full and
timely access is given to all relevant information. In
the case of Board meetings, this consists of a
comprehensive set of papers, including regular
business progress reports and discussion
documents regarding specific matters. 
C ORPOR A TE GO VERNANCE
S TA TEMENT Appointments to the Board of both Executive and
Non-executive Directors are considered by the
Nomination Committee. The Remuneration
Committee considers any remuneration package
before it is offered to a potential Board appointee. 
The provisions of the Company’s Articles of
Association require that the number of Directors
nearest to, but not greater than, one third retire
by rotation each year and seek re-election at the
Annual General Meeting. The directors required to
retire are those in office longest since their
previous re-election. The amended Articles of
Association requires that no director shall
continue to hold office as a director after the third
Annual General Meeting following his election or
re-election without submitting himself for re-
election at the said third Annual General Meeting.
BOARD COMMITTEES
The Board has delegated certain responsibilities
to Board committees which operate within defined
terms of reference, reporting regularly to the
Board and include:
Audit Committee: assists the Board in fulfilling its
overview responsibilities, primarily reviewing the
reporting of financial and non-financial
information to shareholders, the system of
internal control and risk management, and the
audit process. The Committee consists of Bruce
Powell (Chairman), Otto Schmid and John
Incledon and meets at least four times a year . The
meetings are normally attended by the Finance
Director and the external auditors. The Committee
also keeps under review the independence and
objectivity of the external auditors. The
Committee reviews further the nature and
amount of non-audit work undertaken by BDO
Stoy Hayward (BDO) each year to satisfy itself
that there is no effect on their independence. BDO
are also subject to professional standards which
safeguard the integrity of the auditing role they
perform on behalf of the shareholders. 
DICOM Group plc
32
Remuneration Committee: ensures the executive
directors and the Executive management team
are appropriately rewarded. The Committee
comprises Paul Gerny (Chairman), Otto Schmid
and John Incledon and meets at least three times
a year . The Committee does not retain
remuneration consultants but seeks professional
advice as required. 
Nomination Committee: keeps under review the
Board structure, size and composition; selects and
proposes to the Board suitable candidates for
appointment as directors of the Group, and
considers Board successional plans. The
Committee comprises all Non-executive Directors,
is chaired by Otto Schmid, and meets as required. 
DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION 
Full details of Directors' remuneration and a
statement of the Company’s remuneration policy
is set out on pages 34 to 35. The Chief Executive
attends meetings of the Remuneration Committee
to discuss the performance of the other Executive
Directors and make proposals as necessary, but
takes no part in deliberations when his own
position is being discussed.
Each Executive Director abstains from any
discussion or voting at full Board meetings on
Remuneration Committee recommendations
where the recommendations have a direct
bearing on his own remuneration package. The
details of each Executive Director’s individual
package are fixed by the committee in line with
the policy adopted by the full Board.
COMMUNICATIONS
The Company is committed to ongoing
communication with current and prospective
shareholders through regular annual and interim
reports, quarterly financial statements and other
trading statements, as well as via the AGM.
The Company’s website at
http://www.dicomgroup.com contains both Annual Report 2002
33
corporate and customer information, updated on
a regular basis. Regular dialogue and
presentations take place with both institutional
and private shareholders through the Company's
investor relations programme.
INTERNAL CONTROL AND RISK MANAGEMENT
The Board has overall responsibility for the
Group’s approach to assessing risk and the
systems of internal control, and for monitoring
their effectiveness. This includes financial,
operational and compliance controls and risk
management procedures. This process, regularly
reviewed by the Directors, is carried out in
conjunction with business planning and is
documented in a risk register . 
Because of the limitations that are inherent in any
system of internal control, this system is designed
to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure
to achieve business objectives and can only
provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance
against material misstatement or loss. 
The Group has well established procedures which
have been developed over many years for
identifying, evaluating and managing the
significant risks faced by the Group. A key control
procedure is the day-to-day involvement of
executive members of the Board and Group
management in all aspects of the business and
their attendance at regular management
meetings of the operating companies at which
performance against plan and business prospects
are reviewed. Additionally, the Board seeks to
continually strengthen the internal control system
where this is consistent with improving the
relationship between risk and reward.
Other key features and the processes for
reviewing effectiveness of the internal control
system are described below: 
• Board approved medium term strategy and
budget plans for each operating company.
• terms of reference for the Board and its
subcommittees, including a schedule of matters
reserved for the Board and an agreed annual
programme of fixed agenda items for Board
approval.
• an established organisational structure with
clear lines of responsibility and rigorous
reporting requirements for each operating
company.
• managers for each operating company being
clearly accountable for establishing and
maintaining internal controls within their
respective companies.
• reviews of monthly management reports,
quarterly reviews of business re-forecasts and
reviews of performance indicators by the Board
following approval of the annual group budget.
• operational controls in human resources
management, information technology and asset
security.
• appropriate monitoring of key suppliers to the
Group. 
The Directors each year considers the need for a
full time internal audit function in light of the
nature of its business and the complexity of
transactions. At present, the size of the business
is at a scale that does not justify the need for a
full-time internal audit function. Group Executives
perform periodic internal audits on main areas of
activity at subsidiaries, which are reported to the
Directors to provide assurance that the system of
internal control is functioning as intended.
GOING CONCERN
The directors believe, after making enquiries
which they consider to be appropriate, that the
Group has adequate resources to continue in
operational existence for the foreseeable future.
For this reason they continue to adopt the going
concern basis in preparing the financial
statements. DICOM Group plc

The remuneration package for Executive
Directors presently consists of a fixed salary,
variable pay, benefits comprising car and other
personal expense allowances and payments to
defined contribution pension schemes. The
performance-related element forms a
significant proportion of the total package and
is linked to both individual and business
performance such as growth of profits and cash
flow generation. Each Executive Director has a
service agreement, which specifies a 12 months
notice period.
Salary and benefits are competitive and are
reviewed annually. In making recommendations
on rewarding the Executive management team,
the Remuneration Committee reviews the total
reward package, making use of published
surveys. Where necessary, specific work is
commissioned to supplement published
As well as complying with provisions of the
Combined Code as disclosed in the Corporate
governance statement, the Company has
applied the principles relating to directors’
remuneration as described below.
The Remuneration Committee of the Board
presently consists of Paul Gerny (Chairman),
Otto Schmid and John Incledon. Arrangements
for the Non-executive Directors are approved at
meetings of the full Board. 
The Remuneration Committee considers that, in
order to motivate, attract and retain Executive
Directors and senior management of sufficient
calibre, it is necessary for the Group to provide
a remuneration package, which is competitive,
reflects individual experience and performance,
and takes account of local market practice.

The Remuneration Committee also considers
that share ownership and the award of options
are key components in the overall remuneration
package for Executive Directors and senior

objective that all Executive Directors and senior

Company law requires the Directors to prepare
financial statements for each financial year
which give a true and fair view of the state of
affairs of the Company and the Group as at the
end of the financial period and of the profit or
loss for that period. 
In preparing those financial statements, the
directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then
apply them consistently;
• make judgements and estimates that are
reasonable and prudent;
• state whether applicable accounting standards
have been followed, subject to any material
departures disclosed and explained in the
financial statements, and
• prepare the financial statements on the going
concern basis unless it is inappropriate to
presume that the Company and the Group will
continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping
proper accounting records which disclose with
reasonable accuracy at any time the financial
position of the Company and the Group and to
enable them to ensure that the financial
statements comply with the Companies Act
1985. They are also responsible for
safeguarding the assets of the Company and
the Group and hence for taking reasonable
steps for the prevention and detection of fraud
and other irregularities.
Financial statements are published on the
Company's website in accordance with
legislation in the United Kingdom governing the
preparation and dissemination of financial
statements, which may vary from legislation in
other jurisdictions. The maintenance and
integrity of the Company's website is the res-
ponsibility of the Directors. The Directors' res-
ponsibility also extends to the ongoing integrity
of the financial statements contained therein.

RE SPONSIBILITIE S Annual Report 2002

We have audited the financial statements on
pages 40 to 61 which have been prepared under
the accounting policies set out on pages 43 to 44. 
RESPECTIVE RESPONSIBILITIES OF
DIRECTORS AND AUDITORS
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the
annual report and the financial statements in
accordance with applicable law and United
Kingdom Accounting Standards are set out in
the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial state-
ments in accordance with relevant legal and
regulatory requirements, United Kingdom
Auditing Standards and the Listing Rules of the
Financial Services Authority.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the
financial statements give a true and fair view
and are properly prepared in accordance with
the Companies Act. We also report to you if, in
our opinion the Directors’ report is not
consistent with the financial statements, if the
Company has not kept proper accounting
records, if we have not received all the
information and explanations we require for our
audit, or if information specified by law or the
Listing Rules regarding directors’ remuneration
and transactions with the Company and other
members of the Group is not disclosed.
We review whether the corporate governance
statement on pages 31 to 33 reflects the
Company’s compliance with the seven provisions
of the Combined Code specified for our review
by the Listing Rules, and we report if it does not.
We are not required to consider whether the
Board’s Statement on internal control cover all
risks and controls or form an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Group's corporate
governance procedures or its internal controls.
We read other information contained in the
annual report and consider whether it is
consistent with the audited financial statements.
This other information comprises only the
Directors’ Report, the Chairman’s Statement,
the Operating and Financial Review and the
Corporate Governance Statement. We consider
the implications for our report if we become
aware of any apparent misstatements or materi-
al inconsistencies with the financial statements.
Our responsibilities do not extend to any other
information.
BASIS OF OPINION
We conducted our audit in accordance with
United Kingdom Auditing Standards issued by
the Auditing Practices Board. An audit includes
examination on a test basis, of evidence
relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. It also includes an
assessment of the significant estimates and
judgements made by the directors in the
preparation of the financial statements, and of
whether the accounting policies are appropriate
to the Group’s circumstances, consistently
applied and adequately disclosed. 
We planned and performed our audit so as to
obtain all the information and explanations
which we considered necessary in order to
provide us with sufficient evidence to give
reasonable assurance that the financial state-
ments are free from material misstatement,
whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or
error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated
the overall adequacy of the presentation of
information in the financial statements.
OPINION
In our opinion the financial statements give a
true and fair view of the state of affairs of the
Company and of the Group at 30 June 2002
and of the profit of the Group for the year then
ended and have been properly prepared in
accordance with the Companies Act 1985.

3,750 Annual Report 2002
43
The following accounting policies have been
consistently applied in dealing with items which are
considered material in relation to the Group’s
financial statements:
• Basis of accounting
The financial statements have been prepared under
the historical cost convention and in accordance
with applicable United Kingdom accounting
standards.
During the period, FRS 18 “ Accounting Policies” and
FRS 19 “Deferred tax” have been implemented.
These standards had to be applied retrospectively
which resulted in a reduction of the tax charge for
financial year ending June 2001 of which £391,000
was debited to deferred tax asset and of which
£609,000 was debited to corporation tax. In
addition exchange differences of £30,000 arose.
There was no material effect on the current year tax
charge.
• Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial information includes the
financial information of DICOM Group plc and all
subsidiary undertakings. Intercompany balances and
transactions have been eliminated on consolidation. 
The acquisition method of accounting has been
adopted. Under this method, the results of subsidia-
ry undertakings acquired during the relevant period
are included in the consolidated profit and loss
account from the date of acquisition.
• Subsidiary undertakings
The investment in subsidiary undertakings is stated
in the parent company balance sheet at cost, less
provision where appropriate for permanent
diminution in value. Cost comprises any cash
consideration, the fair value of shares issued as
consideration and any expenses of these
acquisitions.
• Associated undertakings
Those undertakings, not being subsidiary
undertakings over which the Group exercises
significant influence, are treated as associated
undertakings.
The Group includes its share of associated
undertakings’ profits or losses in the consolidated
profit and loss account. The investments in
associated undertakings are stated in the
consolidated balance sheet at the Group’s share of
the underlying net asset value.
• Goodwill and amortisation
Goodwill arising on acquisitions is capitalised in the
consolidated balance sheet in the year of acquisi-
tion. Goodwill is amortised on a straight line basis
over its expected useful life.
The principal annual rates used for this purpose are:
5-33%. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment at the
end of each reporting period if there are indications
that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Purchased goodwill in respect of acquisitions before
1 July 1998, when UK Financial Reporting Standard
10 was adopted, was eliminated against reserves in
the year of acquisition. When a subsequent disposal
occurs, any related goodwill previously eliminated
against reserves is written back through the profit
and loss account as part of the profit or loss on dis-
posal.
• Impairment of fixed assets and goodwill
The need for any fixed asset impairment write down
is assessed by comparison of the carrying value of
the asset against the higher of net realisable value
or value in use.
• T urnover
T urnover represents the value of goods supplied,
commission and other services provided to third
Parties, excluding V A T and similar taxes. Long term
projects are assessed on a project by project basis
and are reflected in the profit and loss account by
recording turnover according to the degree of com-
pletion.
• Depreciation
Depreciation of fixed assets is provided on a straight
line basis to write off the cost of the assets over
their expected lives. The principal annual rates used
for this purpose are:
Buildings 3%
Leasehold improvements 10-20%
Machines and equipment 20-50%
Motor vehicles 20%
F urniture and fixtures 20%
Accounting policies DICOM Group plc

• Research and development
Research and development costs are charged to the
profit and loss account in the period in which the
expenditure is incurred.
• Ta xation
The charge for taxation is based on the profit for the
relevant period and takes into account taxation
deferred because of timing differences between the
treatment of certain items for taxation and
accounting purposes. Deferred tax is provided in full
on timing differences which result in an obligation at
the balance sheet date to pay more tax, or a right to
pay less tax, at a future date at rates expected to
apply when they crystallise, based on current tax
rates and law . Timing differences arise from the
inclusion of items of income and expenditure in
taxation computations in periods different from
those in which they are included in the financial
statements. Deferred tax is not provided on
unremitted earnings of subsidiaries and associates
where there is no commitment to remit these
earnings. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the
extent that it is regarded as more likely than not
that they will be recovered. Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are not discounted. 
• Fixed assets
Fixed assets are included in the financial statements
at cost less accumulated depreciation.
• Stocks
Stocks and work in progress are stated at the lower
of cost and net realisable value.
• Leased assets
Assets acquired under hire purchase contracts and
finance leases are capitalised in the balance sheet.
The corresponding leasing commitments are shown
as amounts payable to the lessor . Depreciation on
the relevant assets is charged to the profit and loss
account. Expenditure on operating leases is charged
to the profit and loss account on a straight line basis
over the lease period.
• Pensions
The Group makes payments to various defined
contribution pension schemes, the assets of which
are held separately in independently administered
funds. The amount charged to the profit and loss
account represents employer contribution payable
in respect of the accounting period. 
• Foreign currency and financial instruments
Exchange profits and losses resulting from trading
are accounted for in the results for the period.
Assets and liabilities expressed in foreign currencies
are translated into Sterling at the rates of exchange
ruling at the end of the financial year , or at forward
rates where covered by forward exchange contracts.
Results of foreign subsidiary undertakings are
translated at the average rate of exchange for the
relevant period. Currency exchange differences
arising from the translation of the net assets, of the
results of those subsidiary undertakings and of long
term intra group loans as permanent as equity are
taken directly to reserves.
The Group does not trade in derivative financial
instruments. Sales and purchases which occur in
other currencies than the local currency are hedged
where such transactions are material. This is carried
out primarily by entering into short term forward
exchange contracts to match cashflows. Where the
instrument is used to hedge a committed or
probable future transaction, gains and losses are
deferred until the transaction occurs. 
• Employee share ownership plan
The Group operates an Employee share ownership
plan for all employees (full-time and part-time
working at least 50% of full time hours). Shares in
the Company held by the T rustees of the Employee
Share Ownership T rust are stated at cost less
provision for any permanent diminution in value.
The difference between book value and residual value
of the granted shares is charged as an operating
cost over a three-year period. Any financing and
administrative costs are charged to the profit and
loss account in the period in which the expenditure
is incurred. Annual Report 2002

9 • EARNINGS PER SHARE
Basic earnings per share of 3.5p (2001: 27.9p) for the year to 30 June 2002 have been calculated based
on the profit attributable to shareholders of £733,000 (2001: £5,775,000) using the weighted average
number of ordinary shares in issue totalling 20,821,701 (2001: 20,716,446) during the period.
The results of the previous period have been restated due to the required retrospective introduction of
FRS 19 “Deferred tax”. This resulted in a reduction of the tax charge for the year ended 30 June 2001
amounting to £1,000,000 of which £391,000 was debited to deferred tax asset and of which £609,000
was debited to corporation tax.
Adjusted earnings per share of 36.9p (2001: 33.4p) for the year to 30 June 2002 are based on profit of
£7,673,000 (2001: £6,911,000), being adjusted by the amortisation of goodwill in subsidiaries of
£2,058,000 (2001: £1,802,000), amortisation of goodwill in associates of £84,000 (2001: £47,000) and
exceptional items amounting to 4,798,000 being reported net after tax benefits  (2001: £287,000) using
the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue totalling 20,821,701 (2001: 20,716,446) during
the period. The restatement of the previous year tax charge was not taken into account in the calcul-
tion of adjusted earnings per share.

9 • EARNINGS PER SHARE (Continued)
Diluted Earnings per share of 3.5p (2001: 27.6p) for the year to 30 June 2002 is based on 20,959,654
(2001: 20,901,787), the difference to the basic calculation representing the additional shares that would
be issued on the conversion of all the dilutive potential Ordinary Shares. Share options with an exercise
price below the average share price during the year ended 30 June 2002 are considered as dilutive
potential Ordinary Shares. There is no material difference to earnings if all the dilutive potential
Ordinary Shares were converted. 
10 • INTANGIBLE ASSETS
Goodwill has arisen during the year on the Group’s acquisition of the majority holding in DICOM Asia of
which it previously held 40%. In addition the Group acquired the business of Doxcan AB in Sweden and
Proscan Oy in Finland. Further details are shown in note 13.

which it operates. These facilities are negotiated annually and are normally repayable on demand. The
benchmark is linked to libor. They are primarily for the purpose of providing additional working capital.
At 30 June 2002 committed but undrawn working capital facilities amounted to £24.7m (2001: £22.1m).
There are no material differences between book values of financial instruments and fair values.

1. Resolution 7 asks shareholders to renew the Directors' general
authority to allot unissued shares, should it be desirable to do
so. In accordance with corporate governance best practice
recommendations, if approved, this authority is limited to a
maximum of 6,948,960 shares, equivalent to one-third of the
Company's issued share capital as at 10 October 2002. The
Directors have no present plans to issue shares using this
authority, which will expire at the next Annual General Meeting
or 15 months from the date of the resolution, whichever is the
earlier .
2. Resolution 8 asks shareholders to renew the Directors'
authority to allot shares for cash to persons other than
existing shareholders up to a maximum of 5% of the
Company's issued share capital. This authority, which will
expire at the next Annual General Meeting or 15 months from
the date of the resolution, whichever is the earlier , gives the
Directors flexibility to take advantage of business opportunities
as they arise and the 5% limit ensures that existing
shareholders' interests are protected.
3. Resolution 9, if approved,  will make certain changes to the
Articles of Association of the Company which the Directors
consider are in the best interests of the Company and
shareholders.
The proposed changes seek to:
• update the Articles by, inter alia, deleting references to the
1996 Placing and reflecting the provisions relating to
uncertificated shares in the light of the Uncertificated
Securities Regulations 2001
•facilitate electronic communications. The Electronic
Communications Act 2000 allows companies to use electronic
communications in relation to the transmission to
shareholders of reports, accounts, notices of meeting and the
appointment of proxies. The provisions of this Act do not
require either companies or shareholders to use electronic
communications but will make it possible for them to do so
where this is appropriate and where both the Company and
the relevant shareholder agree. Shareholders will be notified
with full information when the Company proposes to allow
electronic communications. This will not occur until the
Company's registrars have the necessary systems in place
• ensure compliance with the Combined Code in relation to the
re-election of directors
The proposed changes are set out in the Appendix
4. In certain circumstances it may be advantageous for the
Company to purchase its own shares. Resolution 10 asks
shareholders to give the Company authority to purchase its
own shares in the market subject to a maximum of 10% of the
issued ordinary share capital of the Company and specified
maximum and minimum prices. This authority will expire at the
next Annual General Meeting or 15 months from the date of
the resolution, whichever is the earlier . The Directors intend to
exercise this power only if and only when, in light of market
conditions prevailing at the time, they believe that the effect of
such purchases will be to increase earnings per share and is in
the best interests of the shareholders generally. Other
investment opportunities, appropriate gearing levels and the
overall position of the Company will be taken into account
before deciding upon this course of action. Any shares
purchased in this way will be cancelled and the number of
shares in issue will be accordingly reduced. Annual Report 2002

are references to that share being a certificated unit of a
security provided that any reference to a share in
uncertificated form applies only to a share of a class which is,
for the time being a participating security, and only for so long
as it remains a participating security.
2.12  Subject as aforesaid, any word or expression to which a
meaning is assigned by the Act or the Regulations has the
meaning so assigned to it on the date on which this article 2.12

doubt, a class of share shall not be treated as two classes by
