SCISYS PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 05
EARLIER OPTIMISM JUSTIFIED 
In my report for 2016, I advised that, given the 
strength of our then current order book and 
short-term pipeline, we anticipated that the 
growth we were seeing would continue into 
at least the first half of 2017. We also noted 
that, in keeping with the pattern over previous 
years, we anticipated that our second half-
year financial performance in 2017 would be 
substantially stronger than the first half.
This was, indeed, the case and I am pleased 
to report that our optimism and guidance was 
well placed. The Group delivered a strong 
overall performance in 2017, with results for 
full-year revenues and adjusted profits being 
comfortably in line with guidance. It is also 
pleasing to report a positive advance on net 
margins, which is in line with our strategic 
objectives.
Going into 2018 the outlook continues to be 
very encouraging.
The positive news flow across the year on 
new business wins was crowned by the 
announcement in late October of the award 
of a €18m contract with OHB System AG 
to deliver the ground station control and 
communications infrastructure for Heinrich 
Hertz, the German national satellite-
communications mission. Further contract 
wins across the Group in the last quarter of 
2017 also meant that we entered 2018 with a 
record order book of £91.3m.
Operational cash flows were very healthy 
across the year, resulting in further reductions 
in net debt and underpinning a healthy 10% 
uplift in the recommended final dividend 
payment. With the acquisition of the ANNOVA 
Systems GmbH (“Annova”) business our 
income streams (which are predominantly in 
£ sterling and €) are well balanced, providing 
an internal hedge against exchange-rate 
movements. We do not anticipate any major 
impact on profitability in 2018 from currency 
fluctuations or hedging adjustments.
Further detail on the performance of each 
division is given below. However, it is worth 
noting the overall healthy organic growth and 
impressive contract wins that contributed to 
our strong operating cash flows. Our Space 
division in particular deserves a specific 
mention for its extraordinary achievement, 
with 18% year-on-year growth in revenues 
and a 17% growth in contribution.
Of strategic note is the performance of our 
Annova division. A primary focus going into 
2017 was the integration of Annova into the 
Group. We have started a programme to align 
Annova’s internal processes with SCISYS’ 
high standards. Solid, on-going progress can 
be reported here. Its performance is closely 
aligned with the Group’s expectations at the 
time of acquisition. Delivery of a key milestone 
on Annova’s BBC newsroom contract was 
achieved in late summer, with the system now 
on air in the West Midlands and in Salford. 
Significant contract wins with MDR, ARD’s 
national news programme in Germany and 
Corus in Canada have strengthened its 
geographic footprint. Synergies with our Media 
& Broadcast (M&B) division resulted in a major 
new win for M&B with RTL in France, where 
our dira! system is already on air. 
In addition to winning the Heinrich Hertz 
project, our Space division has extended 
its footprint in the Galileo project while our 
Enterprise Solutions and Defence (ESD) 
division has seen key wins late in the year 
with Public Health England, and the Forestry 
Commission, as well as new work with a 
major defence prime contractor.
The strength of the order book within both 
our Space and ESD divisions is resulting in a 
significant expansion of their teams – with an 
associated recruitment drive. Similar growth 
has resulted in the Group opening a new 
office in Dortmund to house our M&B division. 
Strategically we are well positioned and 
confident in our ability to deliver further 
progress in 2018. 
Contingency planning is in hand to protect 
the Group from any potential adverse 
operational consequences resulting from the 
negotiations between the UK and the EU, in 
respect of the UK’s withdrawal from the EU.

OUR 
MISSION
SCISYS PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 06
We believe that SCISYS is well positioned in 
the short to medium term and that our ESD 
division might even gain from the situation. 
Any impact is likely to be felt by our Space 
division, albeit that the division has continued 
to win contracts in this current period of pre-
Brexit uncertainty which extend beyond the 
proposed Brexit date, which is encouraging. 
The Board continues to explore a wide 
range of Brexit options. While we very much 
welcome the UK government’s strong support 
for the UK’s continued participation in EU-
funded space programmes (EGNOS, Galileo 
& Copernicus) and hope to see further clarity 
on this position during the negotiations for 
the transition-stage arrangements, we are 
nevertheless preparing a range of tactical 
options (including the option of re-domiciling, 
while retaining our AIM listing and associated 
UK tax benefits) to mitigate the possible 
effects of Brexit on our Space business post-
March 2019 should negotiations not prove 
favourable.
Key financials reflect the success
In the year ended 31 December 2017, 
SCISYS posted overall revenues of £57.2m, 
which were up 25% on last year (2016: 
£45.7m). Within this figure, professional fees 
were 28% higher at £48.0m (2016: £37.6m). 
The Group delivered an adjusted operating 
profit of £4.6m (2016: £3.2m), a 44% uplift on 
2016. The operating profit was £4.7m (2016: 
£2.8m). A reconciliation between the adjusted 
and statutory operating profit measures 
appears in the Finance Director’s Report. 
Adjusted basic earnings per share were 10.0p 
(2016: 9.2p); basic earnings per share were 
11.5p (2016: 7.6p). Cash generation remained 
healthy and this resulted in a net inflow of 
£4.5m (2016: £2.1m). The Group’s net-debt 
position was £5.9m at year‘s end (2016: 
£10.2m). At 8% (2016: 7%), our adjusted 
operating margin has improved. The year-end 
order book was at a record level at £91.3m 
(2016: £64.6m).
Our people are the key to our success
As always, our thanks rightly go to all of 
our staff within the divisions, who actively 
implement our corporate core values of 
trust, respect and openness, combined 
with prudence and balanced growth. Their 
hard work and ability to deliver the business 
solutions that our customers need, within 
tight budgets and timescales, is the key factor 
to the on-going relationships that SCISYS 
enjoys with its many and varied long-standing 
customers. Our thanks also go to all of our 
staff within the Group’s central functions, 
who provide essential services and valued 
support to the Group and who have made an 
important contribution to these results.
Dividend
An interim dividend of 0.59p per share was 
paid on 9 November 2017. The Directors are 
now proposing a final dividend of 1.57p per 
share, subject to approval by shareholders at 
the Annual General Meeting on 28 June 2018. 
The proposed final dividend will be paid on 27 
July 2018 to shareholders on the register at 6 
July 2018. The shares will go ex-dividend on 
5 July 2018. This would make the dividend for 
the full year to 31 December 2017 2.16p per 
share (2016: 1.96p) and maintains our stated 
strategy of progressive dividend growth.
Governance matching our needs
We are committed to high standards of 
corporate governance. We have strong 
governance frameworks in place throughout 
the Group in balance with our risks. 
SCISYS is currently compliant to the extent 
appropriate for a company of its size with 
the UK Corporate Governance Code, and 
is looking to adopt the QCA Corporate 
Governance Code during the course of 2018. 
LOOKING TO THE FUTURE
The key elements of the Group’s strategy 
remain unchanged. We continue to focus 
on balanced revenue growth and margin 
improvement, as well as management/control 
of risk and succession planning. 
Outlook
We are pleased with the healthy organic 
growth in revenues achieved in 2017. Our 
strong second-half trading performance, 
combined with steadily reducing levels of 
net debt and a record year-end order book 
provides a solid platform to deliver further 
progress in 2018 and beyond.
Based on current performance on projects 
and our order pipeline across the entire 
Group, the Directors remain fully confident in 
the prospects of the Group’s future organic 
growth. We will also continue to look for 
opportunity, where there is a good market, 
product and cultural fit, to grow through 
acquisition. 

2017: A STEP CHANGE FOR SCISYS 
TOWARDS ITS MEDIUM-TERM 
STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES
In last year’s report I expressed my confidence 
based on the progress achieved in 2016 that 
we would be able to continue our sustainable, 
resilient and balanced growth in 2017.
I am delighted to confirm that we have ended 
the period with record revenues of £57.2m (up 
25%), an adjusted operating profit of £4.6m 
(up 44%) and adjusted operating margin of 
8%. This is a step change in our performance 
and it brings us closer to our medium-term 
objectives of £60m in revenues and a double-
digit margin. Two major elements have 
contributed to this improved performance:
•  Annova, the Munich-based newsroom 
solutions specialist, has contributed its first 
full year to the Group’s results.
•  The other divisions have contributed a 
very healthy 9% organic revenue growth 
during 2017, based on a strong second half 
year, which is in line with our expectations 
expressed in September 2017.
Across all of our divisions we have seen major 
new contract wins, which in aggregate have 
lifted our order book to more than £91.3m – 
another record achieved in 2017. The sales 
success story was epitomised late in 2017 by 
the notable win by our Space division, which 
secured a contract worth €18m to deliver the 
complete ground-control infrastructure for the 
German Heinrich Hertz mission. 
Of this total order book value, £36.5m is for 
delivery in 2018. This underpins our optimistic 
outlook for the year ahead and strongly 
reinforces the confidence that our medium-
term objectives are within reach.
Enterprise Solutions & Defence (ESD) 
The ESD division delivered a strong second 
half, with its contribution up by 35% and 
revenues up by 9% on the first six months 
and thus making up for a slower first half. The 
division achieved robust overall results that 
were just short of its excellent accomplishment 
in 2016. It delivered full-year revenues of 
£16.5m and a contribution of £4.2m, equating 
to a margin of 25% for the division.
ESD has spent significant effort during the 
year preparing for further growth, including 
recruiting additional sales effort and new staff. 
These initiatives have begun bearing fruit, with 
the order intake exceeding £8m during the 
fourth quarter of 2017.
To maximise its potential for future growth 
the division has started to reorganise its 
internal structure to serve three focal units 
targeting specific sectors: Defence, Security 
and Maritime; Government and Emergency 
Services; and Commercial. 
 
All three business units have benefited from 
their respective healthy mix of recurring 
revenues and repeat business based on 
long-standing customer relationships, as 
well as new business wins in established or 
adjacent application domains. Contract types 
across ESD range from fixed-price contracts, 
managed budget contracts and time & 
materials-based contracts. During 2017, 
the division experienced a move towards a 
larger proportion of time & materials-based 
contracts (60%, compared with 47% in 2016), 
frequently delivering services at customer 
sites. This trend is expected to continue as 
clients increasingly move towards an agile 
project methodology. 
Activities in the Defence, Security and 
Maritime unit were dominated by ongoing 
projects for electronic architectures for 
vehicles and vessels, bespoke development 
of business systems and long-term on-
site time & materials contracts in the 
intelligence sector. In all of these realms, 
new opportunities evolved during the year 
through both new and established customer 
relationships. Some of these occurred in late 
2017, including: an extension of a research 
programme for the Royal Navy’s Maritime Air 
Defence Command; a new strategic project 
in the maritime defence area; and a newly 
established engagement with another major 
prime contractor for a large defence software 
and electronics programme.

business unit continued its frequently 
recurring long-term business with

customers such as London’s Metropolitan 
Police (the Met), The Coal Authority and the 
Environment Agency. Testament to these 
proven relationships, the Met awarded one 
of seven places on its Solution Provider 
Framework to our ESD division. In addition, 
the unit extended its reach by winning initial 
contracts with Defra, Public Health England 
and both parts of the newly re-organised 
Forestry Commission.
The Commercial business unit is well 
established and maintains a core of blue-
chip clients, including Vodafone, UK Power 
Networks, Siemens, Arqiva and Transport 
for London. During 2017 the unit renewed 
its focus on the transport and logistics 
sector. This saw a significant increase in its 
business with Siemens and the team secured 
initial contracts with Angel Trains and Govia 
Thameslink Railway. 
For some of these activities, ESD has 
benefited from joining forces with Xibis, a 
separate SCISYS PLC subsidiary based in 
Leicester, as illustrated by the joint delivery of 
an award-winning charting app to Imray.
On the technology and innovation front, 
significant effort has gone into reusable 
software platforms, including MACSYS 
for maritime applications and Cartosys for 
OpenGIS-based solutions. The sales team 
has positioned ESD on major framework 
contracts, which boosts the division’s 
opportunities going forward. Divisional 
management and their growing teams are 
settling into the new structure providing well-
grounded optimism for 2018 and beyond. 
Media & Broadcast (M&B)
In 2017 our M&B division once again 
delivered a strong performance, with 
revenues of £8.7m (up 9%) and a contribution 
of £2.6m (up 4%). With a margin of 30%, its 
more product-biased business model delivers 
a level of profitability ahead of the Group 
average. Much of the success was secured 
during an impressive upturn in the second 
half year, which was predicted and in line 
with the outlook given in our interim results 
(revenues and contribution up 46% and 162% 
respectively on the first half year, with margin 
up to 37% from 21%).
During 2017 the M&B division relied on its 
strong recurring revenues from maintenance 
contracts and repeat business from its long-
established customer base in Germany and 
the UK. This provided a sound foundation for 
its strong performance. 
In line with its growth objectives, the 
division also focused on opportunities in 
new territories. This led to an initial win for a 
radio pilot project with the Malaysian public 
broadcaster RTM. The ongoing project with 
the South African Broadcasting Corporation 
(SABC) successfully concluded the proof-of-
concept phase and moved into deployment 
despite experiencing some delays to roll-out 
due to organisational changes at SABC later 
in the year. The M&B division won its first 
client in France with commercial broadcaster 
RTL. This contract was signed in April and the 
first programme, RTL Fun Radio, successfully 
went live in November, followed swiftly by 
RTL2. 
DIGITAL MAPPING EXCELLENCE
An app by Xibis and SCISYS has won 
a ‘Commended Award’ from the British 
Cartographic Society for excellence in 
digital mapping. The project involved 
an international marine chart plotter for 
smartphones and iPads, for our client 
Imray, Laurie, Norie and Wilson Ltd.

The M&B team has worked to position 
the division for the medium-term future by 
further advancing its product innovation. 
The recent cloud-based products dira! 
More and dira! Scotty both went live in 
customer environments in 2017. dira! Medox 
is a cloud-friendly, SaaS-ready multimedia 
asset management solution. It was first 
presented to the public at the IBC convention 
in Amsterdam in September 2017 as the first 
member of the next major product generation 
called dira! Dimension, with positive 
feedback. 
The joining of forces with Annova has 
started to bear fruit. At the BBC, the 
software integration of Annova’s OpenMedia 
installation and dira! is underway. The 
German broadcaster MDR, which chose 
OpenMedia in August 2017 and has been a 
M&B customer since 1995, bought additional 
dira! licences late in the year ahead of the 
planned tight integration of both systems. 
Annova’s relationship with the RTL group 
goes back over 10 years – as an OpenMedia 
customer – and RTL is now operating both 
SCISYS products after an order for dira!.
The M&B division is settling in at its new 
premises in Dortmund and has built a strong 
starting position for 2018. It is preparing for 
future success by making the investments 
needed to maintain its leading product 
offering and to prepare and exploit further 
synergies with Annova.
Annova
2017 is the first year of Annova’s 
contribution to the Group’s results. Its 
overall performance has been robust and 
closely aligned with our expectations at the 
time of its acquisition, although this did not 
reach the levels anticipated by the vendors’ 
forecasts on which a significant proportion of 
contingent consideration was dependent. As 
a result the deferred consideration expected 
to be paid for Annova has reduced from 
€3.9m to €2.0m.
In June, Annova secured its first contract in 
North America with Corus Entertainment, 
which is Canada’s largest media-content 
company. Corus is using Annova’s 
OpenMedia newsroom product for its 
extensive Global News operation. The initial 
project phase successfully concluded in 
November and subsequent deliveries of 
this multi-year, multi-phase programme are 
already being discussed with the customer. 
In August, Annova met an important 
commercial milestone in its flagship 
project with the BBC by concluding the 
implementation phase of the project and 
starting the subsequent transition phase. By 
the end of the year, OpenMedia was deployed 
in the BBC’s major news operations centres 
in Salford and the West Midlands.
Also in August, German public broadcaster 
MDR joined Annova’s customer portfolio as a 
new OpenMedia client when it signed a multi-
million contract to, over time, replace the 
existing newsroom system across its entire 
operation. It is worth reiterating that MDR has 
been a key dira! customer of our M&B division 
since 1995.
Annova’s innovative new NewsBoard 
product for editorial cross-media planning 
– complementing OpenMedia – was 
successfully sold to ARD-Aktuell, the national 
news programme of the influential German 
public broadcaster ARD. This project win was 
particularly important because it positions 
NewsBoard as a bellwether system for other 
public broadcasters. The German public 
broadcaster Radio Bremen became a new 
customer for Annova and its OpenMedia 
product in late 2017, adding to the impressive 
list of important new contracts that it 
managed to secure during the year.
Measures have been taken to continuously 
improve Annova’s internal disciplines and 
governance regime in accordance with the 
demanding internal standards at SCISYS. This 
process will continue in 2018 and beyond.

WHAT OUR  
CUSTOMERS SAY
“ SABC did a thorough evaluation of the existing systems on the market and SCISYS 
delivered the most convincing offer. Beside the technical requirements, SCISYS’ 
experience with large systems was of great importance to us in choosing them.”
            - -  Dennis Herold, SABC General Manager Radio Broadcast Facilities 
“ OpenMedia clearly is leading in this space and we’re delighted to be their first  
major North American partner.” 
            - -  Gerry Belec, Dir. of Operations & Technology, Global News, part of Corus Entertainment Inc
“ We are very excited about the partnership with SCISYS Space UK as this is an 
important step bringing us closer to building the operations of a full constellation of 
nanosatellites. This partnership will further boost our technological capabilities and 
help us build a satellite communications network infrastructure which is considered 
state-of-the-art in the industry.”

SCISYS PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 13

Initial steps have been taken to bring Annova 
and M&B closer together. This involves 
cooperation on a regular basis between 
respective divisional management as well as 
day-to-day synergies, such as cross-selling 
and co-selling activities, joint trade shows, 
product and innovation as well as product 
delivery and support. 
The divisions will gradually intensify these 
joint activities. This will complement 
Annova’s growth initiatives, which centre on 
continued product innovation and an even 
stronger focus on securing new international 
business. Overall, Annova’s outlook looks 
very strong, with revenues from secured 
orders and recurring revenues from ongoing 
maintenance contracts amounting to three 
quarters of its 2018 revenue target. 
Space
Our Space division has delivered a truly 
stellar performance in 2017. Revenues 
grew year-on-year by 18% to £23.5m and 
the contribution grew by 17% to £4.9m. The 
division’s order book more than doubled to 
£34.1m compared to the previous year. This is 
due in large part to the €18m contract win with 
OHB for the German Heinrich Hertz mission 
(see page 14). 
A variety of additional elements have also 
contributed to the division’s outstanding 
performance. Ongoing projects with 
institutional European space customers 
delivered results ahead of 2017 expectations 
in different application domains, including:
 
•  Scientific missions such as the European 
ExoMars mission to Mars. On this 
programme, SCISYS is responsible for the 
rover vehicle visual localisation flight software 
and the ExoMars Mission Management 
System software, which controls the 
numerous instruments on board the rover 
and manages the rover’s operations on the 
ground. SCISYS is a subcontractor to Airbus 
Defence and Space and Thales (Italy) on 
these projects, respectively, which have an 
aggregate value of €5.4m.
•  Earth-observation missions. In one 
example, SCISYS has a €3.3m contract 
with Airbus to deliver central software 
and hardware for the Payload Operations 
Centre for the French–German climate 
satellite mission, MERLIN. Secondly, 
SCISYS signed a €1.9m contract with GMV 
(Spain) early in 2017 to deliver the mission-
control system for the second generation of 
EUMETSAT’s Polar System. 
The recurring revenues from EU-funded 
Galileo projects and from the operations-
support business to the European Space 
Agency have delivered strong results during 
the year. This accomplishment is particularly 
impressive because it was made in the 
climate of Brexit uncertainty surrounding EU-
funded Space programmes. 
SCISYS is, and will continue to be, a 
pan European group and as noted in 
the Chairman’s Statement, the Board is 
exploring a wide range of Brexit contingency 
plans. Participating conditions apply to 
certain EU-funded work, such as the Galileo 
satellite-navigation programme, which 
require that the participant be EU based (and 
that the ultimate controlling company of any 
participant be an EU-based company) or 
require appropriate waivers to be obtained, 
for it to participate in the programme. While 
we could plan our Galileo activities to be 
carried out by our German subsidiary, which 
clearly satisfies the requirement of being an 
EU based company, SCISYS PLC, which 
is the ultimate holding company, will not 
automatically satisfy this test upon Brexit 
taking effect.
Detailed contingency plans are being 
prepared to affect a group restructure, so that 
the ultimate parent company of the SCISYS 
Group is re-domiciled and based in the EU 
following Brexit. The overarching objective of 
these plans is to protect shareholder value. 
The conclusion of the current negotiations 
between the UK Government and the EU in 
respect of the Brexit transition arrangements 
is expected to be known by late summer  Strategic Report / Chief Executive’s Review
2018. At that juncture the Board, if necessary 
to protect its continued participation in the 
Galileo programme, will seek the necessary 
formal shareholder resolution(s) for the group 
restructure, as part of this restructuring 
procedure. It has every confidence that all 
necessary approvals will be forthcoming and 
thereby eliminate any risk to its continued 
participation in EU-funded programmes. 
The Board also intends to arrange early 
shareholder consultation and seek support 
for pursuing this strategy ahead of the 
SCISYS AGM in June 2018. Other options 
that are being actively considered include 
obtaining appropriate waivers and security 
ring-fencing arrangements. 
The above well-established revenue streams 
were complemented by further new business 
wins, as the growth initiatives pursued by the 
Space division increasingly bears fruit.
Based on our proprietary PLENITER 
software suite for the planning, 
implementation, control and operation of 
complete satellite missions, the division has 
secured an €18m contract with OHB System 
AG to deliver the ground station control 
and communications infrastructure for the 
German national satellite-communications 
mission, Heinrich Hertz. This is significant 
because it positions SCISYS as the sole 
supplier of a complete ground segment for 
a satellite mission and this raises our profile 
further as a supplier of related technologies. 
 
The division’s initiatives into the 
commercial, so-called “New Space”, sub-
sector progressed well, as evidenced by 
the continuation of a PLENITER-based 
project with US-based WorldVu Satellites 
LLP (trading as OneWeb). Late in 2017, 
SCISYS added to this momentum with 
a contract from Sky and Space Global 
UK to deliver a simulator for its Pearls 
Constellation mission. This mission will 
operate approximately 200 autonomous 
communication nanosatellites in carefully 
selected orbits by 2020, giving equatorial 
coverage of the Earth to create an 
affordable global communication network 
and deliver voice, data and instant 
messaging to more than 3 billion people 
who are currently without mobile coverage.
The Space team has grown by 32 staff to a 
total of 200 at year’s end. The successes of 
2017 mean that the division is well positioned 
for sustained organic growth in the medium 
term.
Xibis
Xibis, our SCISYS PLC subsidiary for mobile 
apps and website development based 
in Leicester with a 17-strong team, has 
performed broadly in line with expectations, 
often working in collaboration with the ESD 
division. With effect from 1 January 2018, 
Xibis will be reported as a business unit 
within the ESD division rather than as a 
stand-alone entity. 
On track for further growth
At SCISYS we believe in the opportunities for 
innovative software systems to benefit our 
customers’ operations. We are dedicated to 
achieving our customers’ goals by creating 
and delivering quality software solutions. Our 
overarching commitment is to run a resilient, 
well balanced business that promotes 
sustained commercial success. 
Our strategy has always been to invest in 
innovation and acquisition for long-term 
growth. The 2017 financial year has delivered 
in this respect and facilitated a step change 
in financial performance that provides a 
platform for SCISYS’ continued success. 
We have strengthened our position in 
established niches and have moved 
into adjacent markets on the back of our 
expert know-how, versatile skills and our 
commitment to innovation. Our sales people 
have opened up new territories and started 
to explore new sectors. We are continuously 
investing in our proprietary products and 
reusable software platforms. 
Integration between Annova and M&B has 
already brought immediate successes. For 
2018 we expect that Annova will benefit from 
the major contract wins secured during the 
second half of 2017 and will increasingly 
meet SCISYS’ high internal process and 
governance standards. As the integration 
activities continue we are confident that 
additional synergies will evolve and 
strengthen SCISYS’ profile further in the 
growing segment of system automation and 
control solutions for the media and broadcast 
industry.
SCISYS is a people business and much of 
our success is attributable to our exceptional 
team. A significant number of both highly 
talented graduates and more experienced 
staff have recently been welcomed into the 
fold. During 2017, our staff headcount grew

SCISYS PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 14 Corporate Governance Financial Statements Strategic Report
Strategic Report / Chief Executive’s Review
Executive Directors and divisional 
directors meet at divisional board and 
subsidiary board meetings, as well 
as interacting frequently informally, 
to review the risks and opportunities 
facing the business, the controls 
established to reduce those risks and 
the effectiveness of these controls 
in operation, on an on-going basis. 
The aim of these reviews is to provide 
reasonable assurance that material 
risks and problems are identified and 
appropriate action is taken at an early 
stage. The SCISYS PLC Board confirms 
that procedures to identify, evaluate 
and manage any significant risks 
faced by the Group have been in place 
throughout the year.
The annual strategic and financial plan 
is reviewed and approved by the Board. 
Financial results with comparisons 
between planned and forecast results 
are reported on at least a monthly 
basis by the divisions and subsidiaries 
and discussed at the corresponding 
board meetings, together with a report 
on sales, operational achievements, 
objectives and issues encountered. 
These reports are supplemented by 
interim monthly financial information 
as appropriate. Significant variances 
from plan are discussed and actions 
set in place to address them, and also 
discussed at Board meetings. Approval 
levels for authorisation of expenditure 
are at levels set and cascaded 
throughout the management structure, 
with any expenditure in excess of 
predefined levels requiring approval 
from one or more Executive Directors 
and selected senior managers.
Accordingly the Directors confirm 
that they have carried out a robust 
assessment throughout the year of 
the principal risks facing the Group, 
including any that would threaten its 
business model and future financial 
performance and liquidity. It follows 
that the Directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the Group will continue 
in operation and to meet its liabilities as 
they fall due throughout the next, and the 
following two, accounting periods.
by 28% across the Group -- 8% across the 
UK, 16% in Germany (not including Annova) 
and 52% including Annova. 
It is a fundamental strength of our business 
that we maintain an emphasis on our core 
corporate values of mutual trust, respect 
and openness. This is hugely important 
for fostering and evolving our corporate 
culture in line with our values, as well as 
for our strategic objectives as the business 
continues to grow. This applies equally to 
the envisaged integration of Annova, on 
which we will keep working during 2018. We 
are pleased that the sound cultural fit with

Solid foundation and firm trajectory
Our record order book of £91.3m, in 
combination with a strong and growing 
stream of recurring revenues, is testimony to 
the robustness of our business model. We 
anticipate that organic revenue growth will 
continue in 2018 and beyond. Progressing 
from this solid foundation, we will take all 
required measures – including additional 
central requirements (e.g. for cyber security 
and business continuity) – to ensure the 
high level of sustainability that we owe our 
shareholders, customers and staff. 
Once again my sincere thanks go 
to our shareholders, our customers, 
our management, staff and all other 
stakeholders, who have strongly supported 
SCISYS in 2017. The Group has continued 
to make excellent progress during the 
year and we are confident in our ability to 
deliver further progress in 2018: expanding 
the business in a sustainable, resilient, 
balanced way for the benefit of our 
shareholders, customers and staff. 

Report
SCISYS PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 16
I am pleased to report that the rally in trading 
that we predicted in our Interim Report came 
to fruition in the second half of 2017, lifting 
the first-half figures to produce an admirable 
full-year result.
Both revenues and underlying operating 
profits reached historic highs and strong cash 
flows have made a significant dent in the net-
debt position that peaked in December 2016 
with the injection of additional borrowings to 
fund the ANNOVA Systems GmbH (Annova) 
acquisition.
REVENUES
Total revenues for the year were 25% higher 
at £57.2m (2016: £45.7m), of which the 
component relating to professional fees was 
£48.0m (2016: £37.6m). 48% of total revenue 
was from Eurozone customers (2016: 49%). 
Following a welcome gain in value against the 
pound in 2016, the euro strengthened again 
in 2017, which boosted the Group’s revenue 
figures.
PROFITS
Since 2007 the Board has gauged the 
underlying performance of business using 
an adjusted operating profit measure that 
excludes the costs of the Group’s long-
term share incentive schemes, exceptional 
items and any amortisation of intangible 
assets arising on business acquisition. 
Internal reporting is exclusively based on 
adjusted performance measures to facilitate 
comparison between financial years and 
publicly available research notes on SCISYS 
published by financial analysts focuses on 
these same measures. Adjusted operating 
profit was up 44% on 2016 at £4.6m (2016: 
£3.2m), while statutory operating profit was 
£4.7m (2016: £2.8m). The adjusted and 
statutory operating profit measures reconcile 
as follows: 
2017 exceptional items totalled £2.1m and 
reflect the combination of a credit arising 
from the reassessment of contingent 
consideration payable under the Annova 
earnout arrangement and accrued UK 
Research & Development (R&D) tax credits. 
These exceptional items are explained in 
further detail later in this report. By contrast, 
2016 exceptional items represented charges 
of £0.4m for non-capitalisable legal and 
professional fees relating to the Annova 
acquisition.
 
On the acquisition of Annova on 31 December 
2016, IFRS 3 required SCISYS to make 
fair-value consolidation adjustments to the 
Annova balance sheet. Intangible assets 
for fair-value recognition comprised the 
2016 year-end order book and the internally 
developed intellectual property rights in 
Annova’s OpenMedia product. Recognition 
of these assets in the 2016 consolidated 
Group balance sheet resulted in non-cash 
amortisation charges to the 2017 income 
statement of £2.0m (2016: £nil).
Share-based payment charges were 
immaterial following the lapse of option 
awards granted in 2015, owing to the 
failure to achieve the associated three-year 
performance criteria.
The Group’s results were less adversely 
impacted by variations in the euro–pound 
exchange rate than in previous years for 
two reasons. First, the funding structure 
for the Annova acquisition and the sterling-
based cash flows of its contract with the 
BBC served to bring the Group’s overall 
currency requirements more into balance, 
whereas in previous years the Group 
generated substantial surplus euro income 
from its German operations and UK-based 
space market activities. Second, although 
the currency-hedging contracts taken out in 
2016 to convert anticipated surplus euros 
in 2017 into pounds went significantly out of 
the money following the EU referendum vote 
in June 2016, the devaluation was largely 
reflected in the 2016 accounts.
The Group has not entered into any external 
currency-hedging contracts for 2018 and 
beyond. Intra-Group hedging contracts will 
be used to balance the Group’s currency 
exposures across its subsidiary companies.
While revenues benefited from a stronger 
euro, the same foreign-exchange rate 
movement increased the sterling value of 
our euro-denominated costs in Germany. 
However, on a constant-currency basis, 
and excluding exceptional items, Group

overheads – representing the costs for 
provision of shared business services to the 
divisions – were 4% lower than in 2016 at 
£8.0m (2016: £8.2m).
EPS
Adjusted basic EPS, calculated on the profit 
for the year before post-tax exceptional items, 
share-based payments and amortisation of 
acquisition-related intangible assets, were 
9% higher at 10.0p (2016: 9.2p). Basic EPS 
were 11.5p (2016: 7.6p).
CASH AND DEBT
The Group closed the year with bank deposits 
(net of overdrafts) of £8.0m (2016: £6.7m), 
while Group borrowings amounted to £13.9m 
(2016: £16.9m). This resulted in net debt of 
£5.9m (2016: £10.2m).
Cash flow in 2017 was particularly strong for 
two reasons. First, anomalies in timing of two 
2016 year-end receipts reversed in the first 
half of 2017 and did not recur, boosting bank 
balances by £1.9m. Second, the first earnout 
payment to Annova’s former owners of 
£1.7m in September was more than covered 
by receipt from the BBC of a significant 
milestone payment in August.
Unutilised working capital facilities at the 
year-end totalled £4.3m (2016: £4.4m).
ANNOVA SYSTEMS
Annova contributed to Group earnings for the 
first time in 2017 following completion of its 
acquisition at the end of 2016. Strategically 
the acquisition remains highly favourable. 
The order book is building as sales success 
expands Annova’s geographical footprint and 
cross-fertilisation of the customer base with 
our Media & Broadcast division continues to 
gain momentum. 
Pre-acquisition due diligence identified 
that governance and management controls 
procedures were not as mature as those in 
the wider SCISYS Group, so during 2017 
the Board conducted a thorough review of 
Annova’s financial disciplines and reporting 
processes. Annova management’s financial 
forecasts for 2017 proved over-optimistic 
as we had anticipated because they were 
flagged as a specific risk area during due 
diligence. This prompted SCISYS to adopt a 
purchase consideration structure that placed 
significant emphasis on performance during 
the three-year earnout period, 2016 to 2018.
The total purchase price payable for 
the Annova acquisition is linked both to 
average profitability and achievement of key 
commercial milestones in its flagship contract 
with the BBC. Annova successfully obtained 
customer acceptance for a critical phase of 
this project in August, three months earlier 
than had been provided for in the acquisition 
balance sheet. This triggered payment 
of a first earnout instalment of €2.0m in 
September 2017, of which 10% was satisfied 
in new SCISYS PLC shares, with the balance 
paid in cash from existing Group resources.
Annova’s over-performance in the first 
earnout year of 2016 raised expectations 
in the 2017 Interim Report for the level 
of contingent consideration that would 
eventually be payable by SCISYS to Annova’s 
former owners. Since publication of the first 
half-year results, Annova management has 
been included in the detailed Group business 
planning process for 2018–21. Application of 
planning and forecasting policies consistent 
with those across the rest of the Group has 
resulted in scaled-back expectations for 
Annova in 2018. This led to a reduction in 
the Group’s anticipated liabilities for earnout 
payments and resulted in an exceptional 
credit to 2017’s Income Statement of £1.6m.
The fair value of remaining contingent 
consideration for earnout payments included 
in the consolidated financial statements is 
£nil (2016: £3.3m). This compares with a 
contractual cap of £12.9m (2016: £14.6m).
TAX
The effective Group tax rate for the year was 
15% (2016: 15%). 
SCISYS continues to benefit from the tax-
credit system for UK expenditure on R&D in 
SMEs, receiving credits in the form of cash 
rebates from HM Revenue & Customs. Up to 
and including 2016, these were incorporated 
into the net tax charge. An accounting 
standard change requires R&D tax credits 
from 2017 to be treated as deductions from 
operating expenses. SCISYS anticipates 
that it will no longer qualify under the SME 
tax credit scheme in 2018 as it expects to 
exceed the headcount-eligibility threshold, 
lifting SCISYS into the scheme for Large 
Enterprises, where credits are significantly 
less generous. Accordingly, the above-the-
line tax credit of £0.5m in 2017 is treated as 
an exceptional item.
The 2017 tax charge reflected the benefit of 
an adjustment to prior-year credits in respect 
of UK tax. A conservative estimate of £0.5m 
for receipt of R&D tax credits was included 
in the 2016 accounts, whereas the amount 
actually received was £0.7m. 
ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
No material changes in accounting standards 
have impacted the Group accounts for 2017. 
The next significant change affecting SCISYS 
will be in 2018, when IFRS 15: Revenue from 
contracts with customers will be adopted. 
Detailed analysis by the SCISYS Board has 
established that implementation of the new 
standard will have a negligible impact on 
the phasing of anticipated operating profits, 
although reported revenues will be depressed 
compared with previously applied treatment. 
The reduction reflects provisions in the 
standard whereby only the mark-up on third-
party costs can be recognised as revenue in 
situations where SCISYS acts in the capacity 
of an Agent, simply passing the third-party’s 
goods and services to customers through its 
books. If IFRS 15 had been applied in 2017, 
revenues would have been £5.5m lower than 
reported and operating profits would have 
been unaffected. 
SHARE OPTIONS
During the year a total of 0.4m share 
options were exercised, of which 0.3m 
were granted in 2008 under the Enterprise 
Management Incentive scheme for which 
the exercise window closed at the end of 
2017. All 0.3m outstanding options under the 
2015 CSOP award lapsed during the year 
due to the failure to achieve the three-year 
performance criteria as a consequence of the 
disappointing results in 2015. Option awards 
in 2016 and 2017 remain in the money and on 
track to vest in full.
ORDER BOOK
Boosted by the October contract award from 
OHB Systems for the Heinrich Hertz satellite-
communications mission ground segment 
infrastructure, the year-end order book was at 
a record level, 41% ahead of the prior-year at 
£91.3m (2016: £64.6m). Of this total, £36.5m 
(2016: £31.2m) is invoiceable within one year 
and £51.8m (2016: £38.4m) within two years. 
The longer-term balance principally reflects 
Annova’s contract with the BBC, which runs 
to at least 2027. 57% (2016: 34%) of the 
total order book value was denominated in 
euros. 

long-term and on-going. All of these factors 
result in an ability to win contracts when 
bidding against larger companies.
Key markets, segments & relationships
The market-facing divisions within the 
SCISYS Group drive their businesses with 
a high degree of autonomy, positioning 
themselves as experts and recognised 
thought leaders in their respective markets. 
Each one of our divisions focuses on a variety 
of vertical markets, in which they have been 
active for many years. They excel using their 
specialised, in-depth sector-specific domain 
knowledge and their proven technical and 
programmatic capabilities. 
The majority of our customers across all 
sectors are blue-chip organisations. Many 
of them are in the public sector, such as 
the European Space Agency, major public 
broadcasters, non-government institutions 
and government departments, although the 
balance of work with commercial customers 
is increasing. 
Long-term relationships with our customers 
and business partners are fundamental 
to our business, and we strive to maintain 
these relationships over many years, if not 
decades. Frequently and increasingly we 
work directly for the end customer but we 
also engage with business partners on 
various levels. Large system integrators act 
as our prime contractors when we work as 
a sub-contractor, particularly in the space 
and defence sectors. Wherever needed, we 
complement our own capabilities by involving 
specialists, premium suppliers of standard 
hardware and software products and reputed 
research institutes. Local agents also support 
our sales team in certain international 
markets.
Our diversity is what gives us a high level 
of resilience against changing market 
trends and we also benefit from sharing 
divisional expertise internally to innovate with 
customers. 
Our revenue streams & outcomes 
Our activities span the entire software 
lifecycle: engaging with customers leads to 
innovative concepts that we translate into 
high-quality, robust software solutions. We 
integrate these solutions on a system level 
in the customer’s environment, where they 
typically become part of the customer’s 
core infrastructure. In addition we frequently 
maintain and support – and even operate –

systems on behalf of our customers using 
Cloud and other infrastructure providers. 
As a consequence, the revenue streams 
for each of our divisions range from fixed-
price contracts to time & material-based 
services, as well as multi-year maintenance 
and support contracts. In general – and 
particularly with Annova now being part of 
the Group – we increasingly add licence and 
royalty-based revenues as we progressively 
create portfolios of reusable software that 
allow us to employ our solutions in similar 
environments or in adjacent markets.
All of our divisions generate a large 
proportion of recurring revenues that add to 
the underlying strength and reliability of our 
business and provide us with a solid basis for 
future revenue, profit and margin growth. 
Being a successful business that excels at 
generating value for our customers makes 
us attractive for highly qualified staff, which 
in turn supports our objective to develop and 
retain a team that can deliver excellence. 
Key resources, activities and partners
Our key resource is a team of more than 
580 highly qualified staff, working in 7 major 
offices across the UK and Germany. This 
committed team provide us with in-depth 
domain knowledge and superior technical

expertise. We achieve this by working to keep 
and recruit highly motivated, talented and 
skilled employees. Strong financial resources 
complement our team’s excellence. We benefit 
from our strong balance sheet, a number of 
substantial freehold properties, long-term 
relationships with our financial partners and 
our robust working capital facilities.
Re-invest for growth
Our objective is to grow the business on 
a steady basis. We therefore continue to 
re-invest in the areas that we see are the 
main drivers for our business success. 
We constantly develop our sales team to 
establish new and to foster existing customer 
relationships and to expand into untapped 
regions. Permanent technical innovation, 
including the development of proprietary 
software and regular staff development, allows 
us to maintain our reputation as leading-edge 
technology experts. We invest in acquisitions 
to complement our organic growth aspiration; 
always thoroughly assessing the business 
benefit and cultural fit.
STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES &  
KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS
Balanced evolution, sustainable growth
Our strategic objective is to grow our 
business in terms of revenues, operating 
profit and operating margin so that we 
deliver sustainable long-term value to our 
shareholders, our customers and to our entire 
team. This is done in line with corporate 
values that are reflected in the SCISYS 
culture of being committed, honest, customer-
focused, respectful and supportive to all of 
our stakeholders.
The divisions continuously broaden their 
pipelines of prospective clients, building on 
the positive reputation gained with existing 
clients and seeking to extend their business 
development and sales activities to new 
territories. They are also moving into adjacent 
areas by evolving the range of their services 
and products.
Our strategy for growing SCISYS also 
incorporates identifying acquisitions that 
help us to accelerate progress. We continue 
to select opportunities carefully and aim to 
acquire companies that expand our customer 
base, geographical reach or add unique 
expertise – and, most importantly, are a good 
cultural fit to ensure successful integration.
Progress in 2017
The key objective in 2017 for the Board was 
to grow the business on a year-on-year basis 
compared with the strong recovery made 
during 2016, and reflecting the acquisition 
of Munich-based ANNOVA Systems GmbH 
(Annova), which completed on 31 December 
2016. Total revenue grew by 25% and the 
adjusted operating profit was up 44%, 
compared with 2016. 
Taking market expectations  as a guideline 
these targets were overachieved by 6% for 
revenue and 2% for adjusted EBITA.
In addition to the year-on-year comparative, 
the performance delivered in 2017 shows 
compound growth rates of 7% for revenue 
and 10% for adjusted EBITA over a 4-year 
term starting in 2013, compared with 4% and 
5% respectively for the period 2012–2016. 
The results include the step change from the 
Annova acquisition. The directly comparable 
compound growth rates on an organic basis 
are 4% for revenue and 6% for adjusted 
EBITA.
This highlights the success of our strategic 
approach of balanced evolution and 
underpins sustainable growth in a demanding 
business environment.
As for our overall financial performance, we 
have been able to make very good progress 
against our strategic priorities for 2017 across 
all of our divisions.
Our year-end order-book position has 
reached a record high for the second 
consecutive year. It benefited from the 
Heinrich Hertz contract which added €18m 
to the order book for the Space division, and 
was bolstered by Annova’s strong order book. 
The strength of the order book quantifies the 
progress we have made with respect to our 
medium-term aspirations.
We have taken action to implement the 
complex contract assessment process as 
mandated by the new IFRS 15 standard 
which becomes applicable from 1 January 
2018. The way we implement this process in 
SCISYS adds to the continuous measures we 
take to harmonise contract review and risk 
management procedures across all divisions. 
(See pages 32 to 35).
Another priority was to improve utilisation of 
the Group’s property. We took the initiative to 
market the Chippenham property assets of 
the Group more effectively back in 2016 and 
currently have 3 tenants at Chippenham.  Corporate Governance Financial Statements Strategic Report
Strategic Report / Business Strategy & Model
SCISYS PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 21
• Operating profit (adjusted) up 44% 
• Operating margin (adjusted) up 13%
• Revenues up 25%
• Earnings per share (adjusted basic EPS) up 9% 
In 2016 we set our medium-term strategic objectives with a 3- to 5-year term in mind.
•  With total revenues we are already close to the medium-term target, much earlier than initially 
aspired.
•  We ended 2017 with an adjusted operating margin of 8%, slightly lower margin growth than 2016. 
The reason is that the accelerated revenue growth is partly at the expense of additional costs and 
therefore slower margin growth. We therefore anticipate the medium-term margin target to be 
delivered later than the revenue target but still within a 2- to 4-year timeframe from now.
•  EPS: This has increased by 9% for adjusted basic EPS and basic EPS increased to 11.5p.
First successes from cross-selling synergies crystallised in 2017:
•  Annova won MDR as a new customer which was aided by the well established long-term 
relationship between SCISYS and MDR, and the M&B division secured a 6-figure licence contract 
with MDR to integrate dira! and OpenMedia.
•  M&B secured its first contract with French commercial broadcaster RTL, which was supported by 
RTL’s established relationship with Annova and their resources in the Paris-based branch office.
•  Integration of dira! and OpenMedia is progressing in the BBC alongside the roll-out of OpenMedia.
Various other activities have started despite the ring-fencing, ranging from regular management level 
meetings, joint showcases at trade shows and various day-to-day contacts on working level.
•  The Space division has delivered a very strong performance during the year. Strong revenues from 
the growing satellite navigation business were instrumental to this success, despite frequently aired 
Brexit risks.
•  The pipeline of future opportunities was proactively grown, covering the current Galileo 
constellation, EGNOS and also for early study work in the Galileo Second Generation programme. 
•  The €18m contract with OHB for German Heinrich Hertz mission is a huge success to the 
PLENITER business as it adds a reference for a complete satellite ground control system entirely 
based on SCISYS proprietary product suite. 
ESD has successfully implemented the internal structure with three different business groups in 
order to strengthen its sales focus and awareness in the respective markets.
•  In the defence, security and maritime unit, another very promising relationship was established 
with a major defence system integrator which already in 2017 has contributed to ESD’s revenues. 
An ongoing research project in the maritime defence domain was extended for a second phase in 
2018 and beyond. 
•  ESD secured one of 7 places on the Metropolitan Police’s Solution Provider framework, which 
has a total value of £320m over 4 years in total; first call-offs are expected in 2018.
•  ESD has managed to grow into adjacent niches in transport, partly supported by Xibis, as it 
significantly increased its engagement with Siemens and won initial contracts with Angel Trains 
and GTR.

at least £60m.
•  Anticipate a corresponding 
increase in SCISYS’ EPS Strategic Report / Business Strategy & Model
SCISYS PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 22
OBJECTIVES GOING FORWARD 
In principle, our main strategic objectives for 
the medium-term remain largely unchanged. 
We will remain focused on our growth 
aspiration for operating profit, operating 
margin, revenues and also our earnings per 
share. With Annova being part of SCISYS 
from 2017 onwards, and the healthy growth 
we are seeing organically, we expect to 
benefit from the current momentum going 
forward. 
 •  Objective: increased margins 
We aim to increase our operating margin to 
at least 10%.
•  Objective: top-line growth 
We aim for revenues to grow to at least 
£60m. 
Our strategic objectives of £60m revenues 
and double-digit operating margin in the 
medium term was reinstated last year. We 
are now increasingly confident the revenue 
objective is achievable within a couple of 
years. We also anticipate our operating profit 
will grow largely in line with our revenues 
but we expect to reach the operating margin 
threshold of 10% somewhat later than our 
revenue target.
Our expectation also includes a 
corresponding increase in SCISYS’ EPS. 
Based on our track record of sustainable 
cash generation we plan to maintain our 
progressive dividend strategy.
We note that, due to the nature of our 
business model, we may experience half-
year on half-year or year-on-year variability 
to a degree and therefore use compound 
annual growth rates as a better measure of 
achievement. We also retain the concept of a 
set of baseline targets that is complemented 
by a set of more aspirational targets by which 
we may meet our objectives earlier than 
assumed for the baseline.
As stated in previous reports these 
targets can be impacted by exchange-rate 
movements that are beyond our control and 
also continued order intake deferrals. Also 
the transition to the new revenue recognition 
accounting standard IFRS 15 in 2018 will 
introduce a revised approach to revenue 
reporting. Accordingly the exact quantification 
and timing of targets may be subject to 
externally induced changes. 
Although the acquisition of Annova will 
continue to attract a significant amount of 
the Board’s attention during the next years, 
growth through further acquisition remains 
a key element of our strategy. Again, the 
fundamental approach will not change: we 
will continue to look for opportunities that add 
value to the business by complementing our 
current activities. 
STRATEGIC PRIORITIES 2018
For 2018 the Board will be focused on a set 
of key measures that will help to progress our 
medium-term strategy:
•  The integration of Annova into the SCISYS 
group so that synergies with our Media & 
Broadcast division and other parts of our 
business are explored early on, so that 
preparations are in place for the post ring-
fencing era.
•  Further growing the space business, 
particularly focusing on satellite navigation 
and a re-use of the newly established 
PLENITER product suite for satellite  
ground-segment solutions. 
•  Further raising awareness for SCISYS’ 
expertise in the defence, security and 
maritime sector, and extending the footprint 
of our ESD division.
Building on the initiatives started in 2015 as a 
response to the issues that we experienced 
we will continue to optimise our risk-
management processes so that the inherent 
business risks are managed. Continued focus 
will be spent to bring Annova up to speed with 
the high standards within the SCISYS group. 
This forms part of our continual improvement 
approach which also covers succession 
planning, corporate structure, regular process 
improvement with respect to cyber security 
and improved forecasting as focal areas. 

OUR POSITION
The SCISYS Space division enjoys a solid 
reputation in the space sector for delivering 
projects on time and to budget. With 200 
highly qualified staff, it has grown into a 
substantial player in the space industry 
and become a long-term supplier to large 
space-industry prime contractors, as well as 
operating as a prime contractor itself. The 
space market consists broadly of the larger, 
traditional institutional/national arena, as well 
as the smaller, emerging commercial arena 
– known as “Open Space” or “New Space”. 
We operate in both arenas. We target these 
different markets from our offices in the UK 
and in Germany. 
SCISYS Space has established itself over 
30 years as a reliable and trusted partner 
to large system integrators (Airbus, Thales, 
OHB), satellite operators and European 
space institutions such as the European 
Space Agency (ESA), EUMETSAT, the UK 
Space Agency (UKSA) and the German 
Space Agency (DLR). We bid successfully 
to these customers for framework contracts 
for recurring work and foster long-term 
relationships with them. SCISYS seamlessly 
combines work for space institutions in 
specialist research and development 
with bespoke software solutions for 
commercial space operations. Our unique 
selling proposition remains a high level of 
professionalism, close and cooperative 
partnerships with customers and a 
successful track record. 
Satellite- and space-based systems are 
the backbone of global communications, 
weather products, precision navigation and 
timing, next-generation intelligent transport 
systems, climate research and security. Our 
sector-relevant expertise spans a wealth of 
experience, encompassing high-integrity 
onboard flight software, data systems,  
ground-control solutions and engineering 
services. The division covers the broader 
space sectors, such as human space-flight, 
navigation, telecommunications, Earth 
Observation (EO) and exploration missions, 
including Artificial Intelligence (AI) and 
robotics, as well as related ground-system 
infrastructures. SCISYS is well positioned 
to exploit these sectors using its proprietary 
PLENITER software for space operations, 
together with its in-depth expertise,

capabilities and experience in key areas 
of satellite missions. SCISYS is also at the 
forefront of developments in EO systems, 
including the “down-stream” sector, giving it 
the opportunity to re-use proven solutions for 
the benefit of its customers. 
THE YEAR IN REVIEW
Our divisional goals have been achieved 
in terms of revenue, as well as in growing 
the order book impressively. We have 
consolidated and extended our position in the 
institutional and commercial markets.
We have been tracking the sales 
opportunities that have resulted in some 
of our 2017 key contract wins for a number 
of years and 2017 was the year to reap the 
rewards of this investment. The key milestone 
is certainly the Heinrich Hertz ground-
segment contract, where SCISYS takes 
on the responsibility of implementing the 
ground station control and communications 
infrastructure for the German national 
satellite-communications mission, as 
a ground segment prime contractor to 
Germany’s OHB. 
SCISYS Space this year signed a contract 
with GMV for the design and implementation 
of a mission control system to support the 
EUMETSAT Polar System EO programme. 
This relates to the second generation of 
polar-orbiting satellites that will provide 
weather-prediction data to national 
meteorological services for the next two 
decades. 
Other milestones include: winning the 
Mission Management System (MMS) for the 
ExoMars 2020 mission to Mars; the payload-
operations centre for the Merlin mission; and 
the continuation of Galileo activities.
A new commercial customer, Sky and Space 
Global UK, selected SCISYS for the delivery 
of a network management simulator for their 
Pearls Constellation of nanosatellites (image 
above) in 2017. We also continued our close 
co-operation with OneWeb for its high-profile 
satellite programme, the world’s largest 
satellite constellation.
All areas of the Space division have 
contributed to secure the business and 
to support the growth. Main contributors 
were navigation-related projects (Galileo, 
EGNOS), the GOF9 frame contract for 
ESOC, various EO projects, but also onboard 
software has been growing with the project 
for the ExoMars MMS.
TRENDS AND OUTLOOK
We continue to explore the opportunities 
in commercial and institutional markets 
for our unique and highly integrated 
PLENITER software suite for the planning, 
implementation and operation of complete 
satellite missions. There are growing 
opportunities for SCISYS to demonstrate that 
our PLENITER suite provides substantial 
benefits for commercial space missions 
and adds efficiencies through increased 
automation. The win of the Heinrich Hertz 
mission control system, the extension of 
the cooperation with OneWeb and the win 
of the Pearls Constellation Simulator to Sky 
and Space Global UK are all evidence of the 
progress we are making in this area. 
Our mid-term strategy stands for balanced 
growth, focusing on both our existing and 
new markets worldwide. In line with this, we 
continue to foster long-term relationships 
with European institutional space customers 
while building new partnerships and 
capturing market share in the up-and-coming 
commercial space sector.
SCISYS Space, based on a substantial list of 
prospects for 2018 and beyond, plans to grow 
its business further. These plans are based 
upon the delivery of the large contracts won 
this year and further exploiting the business 
in navigation, operations, New Space and 
capitalising on opportunities in the vibrant UK 
space market. 

Divisions  
ENTERPRISE 
SOLUTIONS  
& DEFENCE (ESD)
OUR POSITION
ESD has a reputation as leading experts 
in the UK for bespoke software innovation 
and systems integration. We have a team of 
around 140 staff, all based in the UK. Across 
the division we specialise in robust software 
systems applicable to three broad business 
sectors: the government and emergency 
services; defence, security and maritime; and 
the commercial sector. The common thread is 
creating software solutions and using them in 
innovative ways, by drawing on reusable and 
proven software technology. 
The division has structured its three units to 
maximise focus and growth. Our commercial 
team covers a wide spectrum of projects 
for a variety of commercial customers. The 
government team develops mainly business 
systems and creates engineering solutions. 
The largest of the three, the defence team, has 
a strong reputation for engineering solutions 
and continues to consolidate its position in 
providing software solutions particularly for 
military vehicles and vessels. It also has a 
strong footing in the maritime sector. 
We are seen as experts in the risk 
management of leading-edge advanced 
technology projects. Our independence and 
experience means that we can draw on this 
when tackling new areas. We have a strong 
track record in generating systems that use 
robust software and are less dependent 
upon hardware. Our expertise is a key 
factor in maintaining our many multi-decade 
relationships. 
Overall, we have a strong market position in 
the UK. Size-wise we occupy a sweet-spot 
because we can combine the twin benefits 
of being both robust and agile at the same 
time. Our customers tell us that this balance 
translates as a lower risk for their projects. 
THE YEAR IN REVIEW
The division’s revenues achieved 
expectations and divisional goals with top-line 
sales remaining stable. The year was the mid-
point of a five-year strategy of establishing 
our three business units as independent 
entities, with all groups investing in sales with 
growth in mind. This year we generated new 
work from existing customers, gained new 
customers and achieved contract extensions 
and footholds on several frameworks.

HOW WE SUCCEEDED  
ACROSS THE GROUP IN 2017 Corporate Governance Financial Statements Strategic Report
A closer look at our Enterprise Solutions & Defence division
SCISYS PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 27
The main trend has been gaining new 
work and contract extensions from existing 
customers and having more technical staff 
working on customer sites on a time & 
materials contract basis, particularly with the 
UK Ministry of Defence and with Siemens. 
We gained work and extensions with the 
Coal Authority, UK Power Networks and the 
Forestry Commission. All of the business units 
have seen growth. We have ongoing work with 
TfL, Vodafone, Lockheed-Martin, Northrop 
Grumman and the Environment Agency.
Commercial
We have a long history of providing value 
through our software to the commercial 
sector. New work this year includes 
projects gained from Siemens on software 
engineering of automatic train controls 
and signalling systems. This has helped 
consolidate our position in the rail sector 
where we also won contracts for a prototype 
mobile solution from Angel Trains and work 
on a mobility app and help-point solutions for 
train platforms for Govia Thameslink Railway 
(GTR). Included in these projects have 
been elements of mobile app development 
by Xibis. We have been able to use their 
capabilities to produce both mobile and web 
apps for these projects as well as working 
with customers such as Pets at Home and 
Imray. Conversely, we have been able to 
bring our capabilities and skills to Xibis also.
Government and Emergency Services
Contracts from central government 
departments and agencies continue to be 
a rich source of business. We received 
substantial new contracts from the 
Department for Environment, Food & Rural 
Affairs, Defra, Public Health England and the 
Forestry Commission to provide software 
services. The Metropolitan Police framework 
(SPF), secured in 2017, has offered some 
limited bidding opportunities to date in the UK 
policing arena. However, our relationship with 
the Metropolitan Police goes from strength 
to strength and the number of potential 
opportunities on the SPF Framework is 
encouraging. 
Defence, Security and Maritime
The defence sector remains the lynchpin 
of the division and we continue to make 
inroads into the marine and vehicles sectors. 
The Waterguard project continued in 2017, 
successfully providing software solutions 
to enable the MoD to be tax efficient and 
compliant with HMRC regulations for 
military equipment. We have ongoing work 
for the RNLI through our flagship MACSYS 
product, an integrated vessel management 
system, providing situational awareness 
and navigational control. This is used in the 
RNLI’s Shannon class of lifeboats and we 
received fresh orders for additional craft at 
the end of the year – we have delivered and 
commissioned 26 boats at the time of writing. 
SCISYS and Xibis successfully upgraded 
Imray’s international marine chart plotter, 
enabling the reproduction of charts on iOS-
compatible mobile devices. Xibis received an 
award from the British Cartographic Society 
in respect of its innovative app, for excellence 
in digital mapping, with SCISYS involvement.
TRENDS AND OUTLOOK
Entering into 2018 our strategic investments 
in 2016–17 are set to contribute towards 
continued growth across all three business 
units. We are well positioned to extend 
our footprint in the armoured vehicles 
sector, following from previous work on the 
Warrior upgrade and ongoing research and 
development contracts. Military vehicle 
programmes are key to the MoD and as an 
internationally recognised specialist in this 
area we aim to win more work in the coming 
years. Our MACSYS system is a strong basis 
from which to secure additional maritime 
business. We see further opportunity in 
the fields of cybersecurity, defence and 
communications. 
Having secured coveted places on key 
framework agreements, such as SPF and 
G-Cloud 9, we aim to reap the benefits in 2018 
and beyond. Opportunities for substantial 
growth abound in the defence and niche 
maritime sector. In addition, we plan further 
expansion of our functionally rich family of 
GIS products including Cartosys, which is 
used by the Coal Authority, for example. We 
will continue to work on innovative technology 
in the Internet of Things arena, involving 
monitoring, tracking and automation, including 
in the rail sector, where we were successful 
with Siemens and GTR. 

Divisions  
MEDIA &
BROADCAST (M&B)
OUR POSITION
The Media & Broadcast (M&B) division of 
SCISYS has a 20-year reputation for being a 
reliable supplier of robust, premium software 
solutions primarily to the institutional public 
broadcast market. Our core business is radio 
and our core product is the dira! software 
suite. This is a reliable and flexible suite of 
radio, newsroom and news-media production 
and playout applications, supporting the core 
workflows that any broadcaster needs.
SCISYS is one of the biggest operators in 
Europe in the radio domain and a smaller 
player in the global broadcast and multimedia 
platforms market. We specialise in the large 
public-service broadcast market but are 
gaining ground in the commercial arena. 
The division has a team of 77 based in 
Dortmund and is structured into three profit 
centres that correspond to areas of geographic 
focus, namely the German-speaking region 
(Germany, Austria and Switzerland), the UK 
and the International segments. We continually 
invest in improving, enhancing and expanding 
our dira! suite in line with customer feedback 
and technological innovation.
THE YEAR IN REVIEW
Our divisional targets have been achieved for 
2017. The focus at the start of the year was 
in line with our strategy of continuing to look 
after existing customers and contracts while 
also pursuing new work. 
Although the M&B division has moved to 
a new, larger location in Dortmund this 
year, there have been no major operational 
restructures. Business from the German-
speaking countries remains the strongest, 
accounting for roughly half, while the UK 
is the second largest market. Additionally 
our ongoing project with the South African 
Broadcasting Corporation successfully 
moved into its deployment phase. Our sales, 
project implementation and support services 
are all maintained from our Dortmund Office, 
as is our core product development team. 
The first half of the year saw several projects 
from 2016 completed and new customers 
acquired in the international domain. We 
have won new work in France, the United 
Arab Emirates and Malaysia. These include 
RTL, the French commercial network, and 
RTM, a public broadcaster in Malaysia. 
The project for RTL in France required

Scotty @ BBC:  
The BBC chose M&B to modernise its multimedia 
news delivery system with a cloud-hosted service 
for journalists to securely and quickly deliver 
multimedia news items to the BBC. This service 
is provided to the BBC by using the cloud-based, 
proprietary upload system dira! Scotty.
OHB SYSTEM AG:  
Space won a €18m contract by OHB System AG to 
deliver the ground station control and communications 
infrastructure for the German national satellite-
communications mission, Heinrich Hertz, as ground 
segment prime contractor, supplying OHB direct.
investment in adapting our dira! suite for 
the French market and a certain amount 
of product development specifically for 
commercial broadcasters. The contract for 
the Malaysian public-service broadcaster 
RTM is an exciting proof-of-concept 
newsroom system for producing, editing and 
playing out news stories for radio. 
One of the new software products launched 
this year was dira! Medox, which is a 
multimedia content management system 
(CMS) that works with all file types natively. 
It has remodelled the traditional concept 
of a CMS into being more search-engine-
like – which is new in the market and was 
launched at the International Broadcasting 
Conference in Amsterdam.
Collaboration with the Group’s December 
2016 acquisition, Annova, has been close 
this year, with joint workshops and strategy 
meetings taking place regularly. This 
includes knowledge exchange between 
the different organisational units, project 
implementation, sharing of expertise 
and making introductions to respective 
customers. We are already working 
together with respect to our own roadmap 
development and our latest solution, dira! 
Medox, has already been integrated into the 
new OpenMedia NewsBoard solution as a 
joint solution. 
TRENDS AND OUTLOOK
We will continue to consolidate our position 
with existing customers while exploring new 
opportunities. 
Substantial growth potential remains in the 
international arena. Our focus this year on 
France gave us a first foothold in the French 
market, with the influential broadcaster RTL. 
From this position we will continue to look to 
pursue more work in the French-speaking 
market.
Maintaining a fresh and innovative product 
portfolio is key to our success and we 
continue to respond to customer demand 
and invest in product development and 
on-air applications. The main demand from 
the market has been for a new generation 
of content management system (CMS) that 
can treat all file types equally. Customers are 
expecting more systems based in the cloud, 
which means that solutions are increasingly 
becoming web-based. We have addressed 
this with our dira! Dimension software, the 
6th and most recent generation of dira! This 
has also meant investing in cybersecurity. 
One tool within dira! Dimension, the dira! 
Medox tool, also offers improved online 
content management functionality to meet 
customer expectations. Another area of 
demand is for greater integration between 
the playout and the mixing desk, which we 
have responded to by producing a touch-
screen solution. 
We expect further collaboration between 
SCISYS’ M&B division and Annova. We 
foresee joint work, knowledge exchange on 
the development side, as well as joint support 
activities. In the future we are likely to see 
complementary workshare between SCISYS 
and Annova to create jointly enhanced 
versions of our respective products; we 
can combine our strength in the content 
management area with Annova’s lead in the 
planning area.  30 SCISYS PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017

Divisions  
ANNOVA 
SYSTEMS
OUR POSITION 
Annova became part of the SCISYS group 
on 31 December 2016 and is known for 
newsroom systems, focusing on improving 
journalistic workflows. We have a reputation 
for high-quality product performance and 
service. Lastly, we are known for creating 
trend-setting newsroom products and cross-
media solutions for TV, radio and online 
news. 
We achieve this by understanding 
journalism, knowing the media market 
and the needs of broadcasters. Annova 
has served this sector for over 20 years. 
Importantly, we are not just a raw software 
provider; we are a solutions provider 
delivering turn-key solutions – from the very 
first consultancy via project management 
and project engineering right up to 24x7 
support. Our OpenMedia software product 
is a centralised solution sitting at the heart 
of these processes. It includes several 
modules and is scalable to meet the needs 
of large and small networks alike. 
We are split into three teams across 
Germany, France and the UK, with a total 
staff of 76 at the year end. The UK team 
manages the project side for the BBC and 
other UK customers; the team in France 
covers all of the French-speaking countries 
and a selection of strategic customers in 
Northern Europe; and the German team 
covers the important German-speaking 
countries, Eastern Europe and Rest of World. 
All product development is covered from our 
Munich headquarters.
THE YEAR IN REVIEW
While our revenues were not in line with 
our ambitious targets we were pleased to 
see new strategic contract wins. We also 
embarked on a comprehensive programme 
of aligning our processes with those of the 
SCISYS group and commenced the process 
of increasing sales staff. 
From the customer side, 2017 was very 
much focused on completing a key project 
milestone in respect of our long-term contract 
with the BBC. Working in close collaboration 
with the customer we successfully delivered 
the critical software implementation and 
live pilot milestones in the summer. We then 
entered the phase to deploy OpenMedia in all 
BBC newsrooms.

JAPAN METEOROLOGICAL AGENCY:  
The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) has 
renewed its client relationship with Space, which 
will deliver a combined satellite-data reception 
system for the prediction of satellite track and 
reception of satellite imagery.
METROPOLITAN POLICE FRAMEWORK:  
The Metropolitan Police SPF framework, 
secured in 2017, is set to see exciting projects in 
the UK policing arena. ESD’s relationship with 
the Met Police goes from strength to strength. 
The second area of focus was winning new 
customers to replace incumbent’s existing 
products and solutions. We won a key 
customer, MDR, in Germany. This is important 
because of its size and because it is part of the 
leading ARD group of German broadcasters. 
The ARD Group are key players and seen 
as innovators across the German speaking 
countries. Selecting us for MDR is an 
indication of their confidence in our solutions. 
In this case we are replacing fully their existing 
editorial newsroom systems.
Also part of the ARD group is Radio Bremen, 
which subsequently became our customer 
this year. Other new customers include 
public broadcaster Czech Radio, who have 
contracted us to work on their news rundown-
management systems. 
We have seen key contract wins in 2017 
both in new markets and across existing 
customers. Annova gained its first customer 
in Canada – a strategic gateway to North 
America – Corus Entertainment Global TV, 
a private broadcaster and one of the largest 
in the country, with 39 channels operating in 
TV and online news. They have contracted 
us to equip their news and radio division 
with our innovative newsgathering system 
to 20 Canadian markets, as well as their 
London and Washington bureaux. In 2017, 
we completed the first phase of four.
We also won a strategic win with ARD-Aktuell 
for a cross-media planning portal for its 
national prime news programmes. Annova 
was chosen over the competition for a new 
planning system based on our latest product, 
NewsBoard, which is being added to their 
current installation of OpenMedia. We are 
delivering a solution using an agile approach 
for them and this major project has high 
visibility across the ARD network. 
We continuously seek to innovate and 
develop new products. Our new product this 
year has been NewsBoard, a tool for online 
research and social media monitoring for 
journalists. This sits on top of our OpenMedia 
solution, which remains the core software 
solution product. NewsBoard is generating a 
lot of interest from existing and potential new 
clients alike. 
Annova felt comfortable being part of the 
SCISYS group from day one, not only gelling 
with the M&B teams but also with the Space 
and ESD divisions. Extensive collaboration 
and knowledge sharing across the two 
businesses, helped by our common cultures, 
assisted our contract wins within the ARD 
group. 
TRENDS AND OUTLOOK
We have a desirable software product-
based solution and a lot of untapped market 
potential, particularly for increasing market 
share and sales in new territories. Having 
established ourselves in the German 
markets our business model is now focused 
internationally, and we will continue to pursue 
new work in North America. Annova is one 
of the main players in the worldwide market. 
We will seek to continue to win market share 
and to consolidate our position. We see 
plenty of potential for our existing portfolio 
to cover a wider market share as we access 
new territories. Our sales strategy continues 
to extend our scope with the existing client 
base, win new customers and to expand into 
new markets. 
As for responding to market trends, there 
is high demand for web-based solutions 
in addition to local installations in order to 
achieve independent working via a multitude 
of mobile teams and devices. This is very 
much the direction of travel and remains a 
priority in the radio market. Our proprietary 
NewsBoard solution meets these trends 
head-on. In collaboration with our customers, 
we will continue to invest in enhancing and 
extending our products through innovation.
We also expect to continue to focus on project 
deliveries for existing customers throughout 
next year, as well as investing in recruitment, 
to consolidate and grow the business.  Strategic Report / The key risks we manage
SCISYS PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 32
The management of risks clearly goes 
hand in hand with the opportunity to create 
value for shareholders. The Group and 
its subsidiaries strive to identify the risks 
associated with the day-to-day operational 
businesses, as well as risks associated in the 
Group’s wider business context. 
SCISYS operates both a bottom-up and a 
top-down approach to risk management, 
which provides visibility and accountability 
throughout the Group.
The key challenges, risks and uncertainties 
facing SCISYS primarily arise from the highly 
competitive and rapidly changing nature of 
its markets. The following is a description 
of those key risks that could impact on the 
Group’s ability to achieve its strategic goals. 
These are also provided as a residual risk 
distribution matrix on page 34.
SALES & COMPETITIVE RISKS
The Group makes sales within its markets 
and, at any one time, there may be markets 
that have longer sales cycles than others or 
that have fewer sales opportunities. This can 
impact our ability to sell our services. Failure 
to achieve sales targets because of sales 
pipeline deferrals or diminishing markets will 
lead to lower revenues being achieved.
The sales pipeline is monitored regularly 
and we maintain close contact with our 
customers seeking to anticipate issues in the 
sales pipeline. Where possible, we prefer to 
contract with major customers through long-
term agreements that provide certainty to 
both parties. 
The Group undertakes a number of 
customer support, business development 
and sales activities to foster continued 
strong relationships with its customers to 
ensure that we are considered by them when 
sales opportunities arise. In addition, new 
customers are being sought in existing or new 
markets through acquisitions.
The Divisional and Subsidiary Boards 
will always consider any move into a new 
territory recommended by a Director and 
will request that a risk assessment be made 
concerning such territory, considering risks 
such as political, regulatory, financial, local 
competition and reputation. The respective 
Board will then decide whether such a move

PROCESS Corporate Governance Financial Statements Strategic Report

represents an acceptable risk to achieve the 
strategic goals of the Group.
Each of our divisions operates in highly 
competitive markets and changes in relative 
competitiveness could have a material impact 
on business growth and profitability. As a 
medium-sized company, any consolidation 
in our markets by our competitors, as 
well as changing procurement patterns 
or repercussions from changes to the 
macroeconomic environment, can impact on 
the Group’s competitiveness.
Changes in relative competitiveness, 
including those implied by foreign currency 
exchange rates could result in lower sales 
revenues or force pricing strategies that 
deliver lower margins.
Mitigation here is based on ensuring the 
sales pipeline is closely monitored against 
actual margins being achieved to identify any 
downward trends. The business development 
teams also ensure customer facing meetings 
are held and market intelligence is obtained. 
The risk of reduced relative competitiveness, 
as induced by foreign currency effects, is 
primarily mitigated by means of financial 
instruments (see below).
COMMERCIAL & DELIVERY RISKS
The Group is engaged in a number of large, 
complex Information and Communication 
Technology (ICT) projects. The successful 
delivery of many of these projects is 
dependent on a number of factors including 
availability and management of Group 
resources, subcontractor performance and 
infrastructure.
SCISYS generally provides its customers with 
unique, tailor-made solutions with varying 
amounts of its own or third-party commercial 
off-the-shelf software (COTS) and hardware. 
The complexity and uniqueness of these 
solutions varies significantly, from off-
the-shelf solutions – such as the 2met! 
meteorological and earth observation satellite 
data acquisition and visualisation solution 
– through to completely bespoke business 
solutions for major government departments.
Failure to manage or deliver against 
contracted customer requirements on a 
timely basis could result in contract disputes, 
claims for damages or cost overruns that 
could adversely affect profitability and the 
reputation of the Group.
SCISYS has policies and procedures in 
place for reviewing projects associated 
with customer contracts with an objective 
assessment of the risk inherent within a 
contract in addition to its size. Together, 
the size and risk level are used to escalate 
the review and sign-off level of the sale 
and to dictate the project management 
review approach to be followed. Similar risk 
management principles apply during the 
bidding stage of a project, to align with project 
risk management procedures.
The failure of a subcontractor to perform to an 
appropriate standard or a supplier to deliver 
products could result in delays to a project 
and adversely affect the Group’s capability to 
meet contractual requirements and damage 
its reputation with customers. SCISYS has 
subcontractor assessment procedures in 
place to ensure that a risk-based approach 
is adopted with subcontractors that can 
adversely impact the Group with these being 
assessed in more detail than well established 
COTS suppliers.
Customer projects are managed to 
recognised project management standards. 
Monthly reports are compiled covering 
variances to plan and cost to complete, and 
regular project progress meetings are held. 
The reports are then discussed at monthly 
senior management meetings where the 
projects at risk are further assessed and 
mitigation actions are defined and monitored. 
Escalation mechanisms are in place to 
involve senior managers increasingly for 
more risky projects. The Divisional and 
Subsidiary Boards receive updates from the 
divisional directors on sales at a high risk/
impact level and any problematic projects so 
that actions can be taken to rectify issues.
ECONOMIC RISKS
Future economic downturns affecting the 
eurozone and the UK economies may cause 
the Group’s customers to cancel, postpone 
or reduce spending on existing or future ICT 
projects. This is particularly relevant where 
our customers are in the public or regulated 
sectors. The proportion of Group business 
outside the European Union is low and so 
economic issues in Africa and the Middle 
East would have little impact.
Significant changes as to timing or extent 
of customer spending or future investment 
planning could adversely impact the Group’s 
order book. Failure of a customer could result 
in non-collection of amounts owed. Failure 
of a subcontractor or supplier would result 
in the Group having to find a replacement or 
undertaking the task itself, which could result 
in delays and additional costs. Attrition of 
customer base due to economic difficulties 
could cause corporate failures.

Shared business 
services
A layered approach to risk management is taken 
at SCISYS where risks and their impacts are 
identified and managed at the various levels 
within the business. Responsibility is delegated 
to the management and staff who are authorised 
to take appropriate actions. 
Principal risks are identified that have a 
potentially high level of impact and have a 
reasonably high likelihood of occurrence, 
which are then escalated to senior levels of 
management. The SCISYS PLC Board is 
ultimately responsible for being aware of these 
risks and monitoring how the relevant parts of 
the Group are managing and mitigating them. 
Each division and/or subsidiary holds regular 
meetings with the PLC Directors that are a forum 
for identifying, discussing and agreeing the risk 
mitigation strategy. In some cases risks cannot 
be mitigated or there is a remaining residual risk 
in which case contingency plans and monitoring 
for occurrence are undertaken.
 Strategic Report / The key risks we manage
SCISYS PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 34
economic and political developments to 
assess their potential impact on the Group 
prospects. Monthly assessments of sales 
pipelines and feedback from sales teams are 
used to assess underlying developments. 
The split of subsidiaries across UK and 
Germany has reduced this risk by providing 
a mixture of geographic revenue sources 
in members of the European Union with 
stronger economies.
FINANCIAL RISKS
The Group is exposed to a number of 
potential financial risks:
•  Credit risks – Our customers do not pay us 
on time.
•  Liquidity risk – The Group operates 
through cash generated by the business and 
by bank lending facilities.
•  Foreign-currency risk – The Group has 
foreign-currency denominated earnings 
that may not be fully hedged so adverse 
currency fluctuations between sterling and 
the euro have an impact on the Income 
Statement.
Details of various risks and the strategies in 
place to mitigate them are described in note 22 
to the financial statements on pages 81 to 86.
The Group’s customers are predominantly 
blue chip and governmental organisations, 
so our credit risk is relatively small. We 
continue to monitor overdue payments closely 
and undertake regular credit checks where 
appropriate.
The Group’s treasury operations are 
robust. The risk of lending facilities being 
curtailed or withdrawn is managed by 
ensuring our bankers are regularly well 
informed throughout the year on the Group’s 
performance.
The Group has a reasonable balance (a 
natural hedge) between its sterling/euro 
earnings and sterling/euro cost base. To the 
extent required (which was not the case in 
2017) it mitigates short-term currency risk 
by taking out exchange rate cover on the 
anticipated net surplus of euro to working 
capital requirements in Germany. Where 
possible it will contract with customers in the 
same currency as its cost base.
HUMAN RESOURCES RISKS
The Group’s performance and its ability to 
mitigate significant risks within its control 
depend on its employees and management 
teams. Future success depends on its ability 
to recruit and retain the best people with 
appropriate competencies.
If the Group loses the services of key 
personnel or is unable to attract and retain 
employees with the right capabilities and 
experience it would be likely to have an 
adverse effect on the Group’s ability to 
implement its business plans and impact on 
delivering the strategy. The Group uses a 
variety of ways to attract, retain and motivate 
its staff. These include regular review of 
remuneration packages, share incentive 
schemes and share option plans. Reviews 
with employees are undertaken at least 
annually and consider their performance.  
Remuneration policy is regularly reviewed 
and incentives are in place to assist with the 
retention and recruitment of key employees. 
Equally important, the Group offers a culture 
where each individual is encouraged to 
achieve their full potential through regular 
reviews and discussions.
Removal of free movement of staff between 
UK and EU as a result of Brexit might 
introduce additional bureaucracy since this 
is currently a common practice for SCISYS 
divisions.

important facilities that could cause 
disruption to operations impacting revenues. 
Comprehensive business continuity plans 
are in place that cover offices, as well as 
computing and other facilities. The risk of a 
significant loss of all or part of an office is 
mitigated by having alternative facilities in 
different locations and being able to utilise 
the computing facilities in these locations 
remotely.
The key applications are on virtualised 
platforms to ensure they can be redistributed 
to another location or, ultimately, to the Cloud 
if necessary in the event of a significant 
outage at an office location. Staff are also 
able to operate effectively from alternative 
locations including from home to ensure 
business continuity.
SCISYS is a people business so it is highly 
dependent on talented and motivated 
individuals. As a consequence, succession 
plans are regularly discussed to ensure that 
the impact of the loss of a key staff member 
is reduced. 
INFORMATION SECURITY & CYBER-
SECURITY RISKS
Information Security is high on most 
customers’ agendas especially when it 
comes to managing their own customers’ 
or citizens’ data. This is being accentuated 
by the introduction of the EU General Data 
Protection Regulation 2016 (679) (GDPR) 
(see below). Many of the solutions SCISYS 
delivers need to store and manage this data 
securely and customers need to be assured 
that SCISYS can manage their data properly. 
SCISYS operates comprehensive information 
management policies and procedures to 
ensure that the appropriate protections are 
in place.
While policies and procedures can ensure 
the appropriate measures are adhered to, the 
risk of a deliberate, malicious cyber attack is 
always a serious possibility. SCISYS actively 
protects its networks and computing facilities 
against all of the common forms of cyber 
security vulnerabilities. SCISYS in the UK is 
now certified to the UK Government Cyber 
Essential Plus standards and the controls 
imposed by these standards are being 
adopted across the Group. 
GDPR RISKS
GDPR will come into force in May 2018 and 
is likely to be retained by the UK government 
for regulating the control and processing 
of personal data after Brexit. GDPR 
introduces more stringent guidelines on the 
management, recording and processing of 
personal data and infringement could result 
in substantial fines. SCISYS is well under 
way at implementing improvements to its 
current policies, processes and procedures 
across the Group to ensure compliance 
in all countries. SCISYS is also assessing 
its exposure due to customer contracts 
where it is a data processor under the new 
regulations.
ORGANIC GROWTH
SCISYS is currently seeing substantial 
organic growth, which is generally achieved 
by recruiting talented staff as a result of 
actual or pending contract awards. This 
can introduce risks associated with the 
introduction of new staff to fulfil new and 
existing contracts. All staff undergo extensive 
induction into SCISYS’ processes and are 
generally allocated to pre-existing rather than 
new teams to mitigate the new-starter risk. 
New contracts can introduce new risks to the 
business but these are dealt with in line with 
and as set out in the Commercial & Delivery 
Risks section (page 33).
EXPANSION VIA ACQUISITION
The Group, in seeking to fulfil its strategic 
objectives, may need to look to inorganic 
growth through business acquisitions. 
Acquisitions are generally risky because they 
can fail if the assumptions made at the time of 
acquiring are not fulfilled.
Failure to achieve the expected benefits from 
an acquisition and integration of the acquired 
business into the Group processes could 
result in an adverse impact on the Group’s 
prospects, strategic goals and profitability. It 
can also lead to significant financial loss and 
damage to Group reputation.
Acquisition opportunities are initially reviewed 
by the Chief Mergers & Acquisitions Officer 
and the M&A Committee who report to the 
PLC Board. If the PLC Board approves its 
continued interest then an offer may be made 
subject to contract and undertaking detailed 
due diligence. 
It is essential that any acquisition matches 
Group values and culture. When a business 
is acquired detailed integration plans 
are developed and monitored to ensure 
successful integration of the business so that 
the internal control processes of the Group 
are achieved.
Clearly, the acquisition of Annova is a 
substantial one and there has been a 
considerable amount of detailed planning 
regarding the acquisition and the integration 
approach following acquisition. This project is 
under the full scrutiny of the PLC Board on a 
day-to-day basis. 
A NOTE ON BREXIT
The Board continues to explore a wide 
range of Brexit options. Participating 
conditions apply to certain EU funded 
work, such as the Galileo satellite-
navigation programme, which require 
the ultimate controlling company to 
be an EU-based company, or require 
appropriate waivers. While our German 
subsidiary satisfies the requirement of 
being an EU based company, current 
options include a re-structure and 
re-domicile for SCISYS PLC, so that it 
remains based in the EU following Brexit. 
Other options include consideration of 
appropriate waivers and security deed 
arrangements. Please also see note on 
Brexit in the Chief Executive’s Review on 
page 13. Strategic Report / Corporate Social Responsibility
SCISYS PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 36
OUR VALUES 
SCISYS recognises that values stem from our 
principles and that these shape our internal 
behaviours and culture across the Group. We 
believe in the values of openness, integrity, 
honesty and being supportive. We are also 
committed to the principles of inclusion, 
flexibility, enthusiasm, commitment and above 
all being genuine, open and accountable. 
These are the foundations of good conduct 
and ethical behaviours.
We also understand that company values and 
purpose are set from the top – by the Board 
and senior management – and they can only 
be embedded in company culture when staff 
are led by example. SCISYS expects that all 
of its business is conducted in compliance 
with high ethical standards and good 
business practice. We seek to apply these 
standards to all dealings with employees, 
customers, suppliers and other stakeholders. 
This is reflected in our governance policies 
and we expect professionalism and integrity 
from all employees and operations. 
OUR CULTURE 
Culture is what drives performance. Strong 
growth and value creation can be achieved 
only when purpose and values are embedded 
and aligned with company culture. We 
understand that this must be done with 
openness because of the integral role that it 
plays in the future of our business.
We know it is important for our employees 
to value their work, trust their colleagues 
and feel empowered to work together. For 
these reasons we invest in making SCISYS a 
desirable place to work. Not only does doing 
so demonstrate that we care about their long-
term futures it also gives staff a high level of 
reassurance that they are trusted, valued and 
supported. This also comes from listening 
to feedback. These endeavours are good 
for the Company because we also know that 
our staff perform better when they feel their 
voices are heard right at the top. 
We support our long-term aims by creating 
close ties between our business values with 
company culture, as well as ensuring that 
all appraisals, incentives and rewards are 
equally aligned in this way. We believe that 
this has a positive impact on growth and 
greater performance. Our HR teams in both 
the UK and Germany recruit not just for skills 
and excellence but also seek cultural fit. 
This fosters a diverse and healthy company 
culture, which is evident in our commitment 
to inclusiveness, as well as our opportunities 
for professional development and skills 
training.

QUALITY, ENVIRONMENT &  
SAFETY POLICIES
SCISYS has the objective of continuously 
improving the quality of the products and 
services we provide our customers. Across 
the Group we are certified with various 
ISO benchmarks. In SCISYS UK Ltd, we 
maintain the following: Quality (ISO 9001), 
Environment (ISO 14001), IT Service 
Management (ISO 20000-1) and Information 
Security (ISO 27001). In SCISYS Deutschland 
GmbH, we hold: Quality (ISO 9001), 
Environment (ISO 14001) and Occupational 
Health & Safety (OHSAS 18001). Annova 
is currently working towards certification to 
ISO 9001 and ISO 27001. With the exception 
of health & safety, the Technical Director is 
the Director appointed by the Board to have 
responsibility for these areas of governance 
and certification. 
The Finance Director is appointed by the 
Board to be responsible for the health & 
safety performance across the Group. The 
Group policy places responsibility for the 
management of health & safety matters 
on local subsidiary management who are 
supported by Group representatives and local 
external advisers where necessary.
The nature of our business means that we do 
not inhabit a high-risk working environment. 
Policies and procedures are nonetheless in 
place to ensure that risks remain minimal. We 
are committed to maintaining a safe working 
environment for all employees, customers 
and suppliers. Our staff have experienced 
only infrequent minor accidents causing 
injuries, such as sprains, cuts, abrasions, etc. 
There have been no major accidents in our 
three-decade Group history. 
A clean environment and well-being both 
contribute to our company performance and 
reputation. We promote a culture of health, 
well-being and fitness by providing our staff 
– where possible – access to subsidised 
facilities for cyclists, fitness rooms and on-
site cafés that provide healthy food choices. 
In addition, staff receive regular training 
on health & safety procedures, such as fire 
safety, throughout the year.
COMMITTED TO THE ENVIRONMENT
Good environmental practice and 
consideration of the impact that our 
operations have on the environment 
are of great importance to SCISYS. Our 
business cannot exist in isolation from the 
community and the environment. Therefore, 
our environmental policies aim to adopt 
responsible practices and comply with local, 
state and national environmental legislation 
in all jurisdictions that we operate in. This 
involves continual improvement over time. 
Our office sites operate to meet ISO 14001 
certified environmental management 
systems. This is an internationally agreed 
standard that sets out criteria for an 
environmental management system. We 
expect SCISYS companies to implement 
policies designed to proactively mitigate their 
environmental impact rather than policies just 
for carbon offsetting. 
The Company uses this framework for 
measuring and improving its environmental 
impact. We recognise that these have many 
sources: heating, cooling and powering offices 
and equipment; electricity for computing 
equipment; gas for heating; travel by air, 
road and rail to visit clients, suppliers and for 
internal meetings; water in offices used for a 
variety of purposes; consumable resources 
such as paper; waste including paper, 
plastic and IT consumables (e.g. toner). 
Other environmental measures also include, 
promoting cycling to work, car sharing/pooling, 
video conferencing, recycling and cutting down 
on our usage of printer paper, etc.
We have an ongoing programme to reduce 
CO
2
 production across our UK sites. This has 
proved successful and we strive to continue 
minimising CO
2
 wherever possible. We seek 
to improve our environmental performance 
further annually. This year we engaged in an 
extensive LED lighting replacement scheme 
across our UK sites that has already seen a 
vast reduction in our energy consumption. In 
addition, we have commenced refurbishment 
to create new efficiencies as well as begun a 
plant-replacement programme, which includes 
replacing legacy air-conditioning units with 
modern, efficient units to further reduce 
energy usage. In the first half of 2017, our UK 
sites managed to achieve a 6% reduction in 
overall energy consumption year on year. 
Our subsidiaries monitor their energy 
consumption closely and, where viable, they 
have introduced energy-efficiency measures. 
SCISYS Deutschland GmbH, too, has a 
programme of CO
2
 reduction. For instance, 
its premises in Bochum use ground-source 
heating and cooling systems and solar panels 
that reduce the consumption of grid-electricity. 
We produce few physical products and 
therefore have little end-of-life recycling 
and disposal obligations. Our businesses 
comply with the Waste Electrical and 
Electronic Equipment Regulations (“the 
WEEE Regulations”) and we either return 
our redundant IT hardware to the original 
equipment manufacturer or distribute it for 
reuse by the local community wherever 
possible.
COMMUNITY
SCISYS strives to be a responsible partner in 
the local communities in which we operate. We 
encourage all our subsidiaries to support the 
needs of their communities by contributing to 
charities and community initiatives.
SUPPORTING LOCAL CHARITIES
SCISYS PLC, SCISYS UK Ltd and SCISYS 
Deutschland GmbH are proud to continue to 
support several national and local charities in 
the UK and Germany, for example fundraising 
for Children in Need and other local charities. 
Additionally SCISYS has this year made 
donations and raised funds for:
Alzheimer’s Society – The UK’s leading 
dementia support and research charity for 
people living with dementia, their families and 
carers.
British Heart Foundation – The nation’s 
leading heart charity and the largest 
independent funder of cardiovascular research.
Macmillan Cancer Support – Macmillan’s 
ambition is to reach and improve the lives 
of everyone living with cancer and to inspire 
millions of others to do the same. They provide 
information and support that helps people take 
back control of their lives.
Children’s Hospice South West – Children’s 
Hospice South West provides hospice care 
for life-limited children and their families from 
across the South West of England. 
Dressability – A small charity that provides 
a clothing-adaptation service for people who 
need tailored clothes that fit and are easy to 
take on or off. They help those with physical 
disabilities, learning difficulties, over-65s, etc.
Friedensdorf International – Friedensdorf 
International helps victims in areas of war 
and crisis. They offer medical help and 
support international aid schemes on-site. 
Furthermore, Friedensdorf International 
provides an educational establishment 
available to all citizens to promote peace.

WE VALUE OUR PEOPLE
There cannot be innovation or robust solutions 
without the people who create and contribute 
to them. In order to attract the right people, 
SCISYS strives to be an employer known for 
providing attractive careers and interesting 
work opportunities. For those who are part 
of the SCISYS family, we seek to develop 
them in a way that helps them realise their full 
potential while also meeting the company’s 
business needs. We also offer flexible working 
arrangements where we can support this. 
SCISYS makes it a part of its corporate culture 
to respect individuality: we present ourselves 
as we are.
The Company strives to ensure that staff 
understand the company they work for, 
the role they play and that they are valued 
stakeholders. We issue regular news bulletins 
on the Group’s intranet sites and internal 
newsletters highlighting the valuable work 
being done across the Group. The divisions 
also have regular meetings to discuss what 
is happening within that division. We conduct 
regular all-staff meetings and presentations to 
discuss the performance of all companies in 
the SCISYS Group. 
We encourage staff to invest in continuous 
learning and keeping their skills up to date. 
Training needs throughout the year are 
determined at either company, division, 
project, customer or individual levels. These 
are typically available for boosting technical 
and management skills, as well as for personal 
and developmental skills. We provide staff 
with a range of training resources, including 
inductions, self-paced training materials as 
well as a library of books and journals. 
A FAIR AND DESIRABLE WORKPLACE
We have a long-term outlook and are 
committed to providing meaningful and 
challenging roles for all of our employees. In 
order to attract and retain the right people, we 
try hard to be a great company to work for. It 
is critical to our success to foster a working 
environment that encourages innovation and 
supports a culture of entrepreneurship and 
partnership. Our HR teams not only look for 
skills and talent, but also seek out drive and 
the motivation to develop and succeed.
Appropriate career paths and internal 
recognition programmes are developed for 
all staff. A variety of technical, support and 
managerial courses and training materials are 
available to employees. These employment 
development opportunities are structured to 
align with both the Group and divisions’ goals 
and objectives. Our leadership-development 
and succession-planning processes are 
equally important to the business. These 
are regularly discussed and updated as the 
competition for talented employees increases 
and as the leadership needs of our business 
grow. Formal performance reviews are 
conducted and are linked to the values of the 
organisation. It goes without saying that we 
respect equality of opportunity to all existing 
and prospective employees without unlawful 
or unfair discrimination, regardless of age, 
gender, background or ethnic origin.
WORK EXPERIENCE, PLACEMENTS & 
STEM AMBASSADORS
In the UK there is an overall skill shortage in 
the areas of science, technology, engineering 
and mathematics (STEM) and computing. 
SCISYS recognises that it has a role to play in 
CASE STUDY – BREXIT IN THE UK
SCISYS recognises that the ongoing Brexit 
negotiations and associated changes in 
immigration policies resulting from Britain’s 
leaving the EU are likely to be of concern to our 
UK employees from the EU, as well as British 
employees with partners or children who are EU 
nationals. Although there have been minimal 
concrete or direct changes in the year 2017, SCISYS PLC and its UK human resources 
teams felt that it was important to support all staff who believed they were affected by 
the changes. We have kept a close eye on progress and communicated with staff. We 
also brought in an external consultant to deliver a Brexit workshop that outlined the 
latest options for staff. At the end of the year we ran a survey with EU staff in the UK 
and they told us that they gained a lot from the workshop, as well as indicating where 
they required additional support. Overall, all staff said that they felt supported by the 
company, making them feel valued and appreciated. Corporate Governance Financial Statements Strategic Report

SCISYS PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 39
mitigating these challenges. Gender equality 
is encouraged at SCISYS but there is an 
under-representation of women in university 
computing and STEM courses. 
In line with this, SCISYS helps promote and 
encourage careers in the IT and computing 
sector by offering a limited number of 
opportunities each year for enthusiastic 
school-age people and undergraduates 
either as part of or in addition to their studies. 
These range from mentorships, meaningful 
work experience, summer placements and 
graduate opportunities. Our experience is 
that those who have been through these 
programmes with us come away with new 
skills and enhanced interest in the STEM 
fields.
In the UK, SCISYS has taken a number of 
apprentices into its internal IT support team 
under the Government’s Apprenticeship 
scheme during 2017. This not only helps 
to bring valuable opportunities to school-
leavers or those seeking to change their 
skills that can lead to university degrees but 
it also make use of funding under the UK 
Government’s Apprenticeship Levy. Further 
apprentices have already been recruited in 
2018. In Germany we have 4 apprentices 
in total, 2 at Annova and 2 at SCISYS 
Deutschland.
Another way that SCISYS endeavours to 
counteract the widespread shortage of 
skills in the areas of science, technology, 
engineering and mathematics is to promote 
these subjects at all levels of the national 
curriculum. These subjects are essential to 
a digitally connected world and are therefore 
critical for developing a deep knowledge of 
software development techniques, as well 
as hardware and network technologies. 
SCISYS has a vested interest in encouraging 
school children to take up and excel in STEM 
subjects. In the UK, SCISYS does this by 
having a number of staff who are STEM 
Ambassadors. They are active in helping 
local schools and colleges by bringing STEM 
career opportunities to life. 
We are national participants in the STEMNet 
programme (www.stemnet.org.uk), which is 
a network aimed at creating opportunities 
for young people and teachers of STEM 
subjects. We attend events organised by 
STEMNet, especially those that support 
engineering and software development. Our 
ambassadors are great role-models who 
motivate and inspire young people, advising 
them how they can build a career in the 
software industry by using examples of real 
case studies.

INTRODUCTION
We believe in good corporate governance 
and accountability and we make robust 
corporate governance part of our culture and 
business values.  
SCISYS PLC (the “Company”) complies 
with the Financial Reporting Council’s UK 
Corporate Governance Code (the “Code”) 
to the extent proportionate and practicable. 
In doing so, we take into account our size, 
resources and AIM-quoted status. Where we 
do not comply with the Code, we provide an 
explanation to shareholders and review our 
position regularly. 
LEADERSHIP AND  
GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE 
The Board
The Board exercises full and effective control 
over the Group. There is a formal schedule of 
matters reserved specifically for its decisions, 
relating to strategy, finance, risk, operations 
and governance. 
There were no personnel changes during 2017.
The Chairman is responsible for the effective 
and proper running of the Board, while the 
Chief Executive Officer is charged with 
managing the Group’s business. The roles of 
the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer are 
distinct.
The Code requires an appropriate 
combination of Executive and Non-Executive 
Directors. The split is between five Executive 
and two Non-Executive Directors (including 
the Non-Executive Chairman). 
The Board believes the current split between 
Executive and Non-Executive Directors is 
appropriate. This composition continues to 
provide the expertise, breadth of experience 
and independence of thought needed, while 
maintaining efficient Board meetings.
The Board reviews its composition against 
the requirements of the Code, and the need 
for any additional independent Non-Executive 
Directors and/or senior independent Directors 
is monitored.
 
The composition of the Board (paragraph 
B.1.2 of the Code), its Audit Committee (C.3.1) 
and Remuneration Committee (D.2.1) does 
not meet the Code’s recommendations.

Nevertheless the Board considers its composition appropriate for an 
AIM-quoted company of its size and its individual circumstances. 
Currently one third of the Board submits itself for re-election at each 
AGM as part of the Company’s formal retirement by rotation policy. 
Under the current Articles every Director must offer himself for re-
election every three years. As the Non-Executive Chairman is subject 
to re-election every three years, rather than annually, we do not 
comply with paragraph B.7.1. We consider a re-election every three 
years appropriate for all Directors. 
All Directors are given full and timely access to all relevant 
management and accounting information. All Directors are able to 
seek independent professional advice in the course of their duties, 
at the Company’s expense. If any Director has concerns regarding 
unresolved business issues, they are entitled to require the Company 
Secretary to minute their concerns. 
All Directors are inducted and kept abreast by the Company Secretary 
of material changes to laws and regulations affecting the Group’s 
business. She advises the Board on legal developments, regulatory 
matters and Board procedures.
The Board considers itself sufficiently diverse when considering the 
background, knowledge and experience that each individual member 
brings to the Board. Where Board appointments are made, the Terms 
of Reference of the Nomination Committee set out the factors to be 
taken into account. Due regard is given to diversity. Specifically, the 
Nomination Committee is required to “consider candidates on merit 
and against objective criteria, and with due regard for the benefits 
of diversity on the Board, including gender” when identifying and 
recommending candidates. No member of the Board is female. Board 
appointments are made solely on merit and independent of gender.
The Nomination Committee will continue to recommend appointments 
to the Board based on the existing balance of skills, knowledge and 
experience on the Board, as well as the merit and capabilities of the 
nominee. It will look at the amount of time that any nominee is able to 
devote to the role.
The Chairman 
He is responsible for leading an effective Board. In particular, the 
Chairman is tasked with:
•  Chairing Board meetings and setting the agenda;
• Ensuring adequate time is available for all agenda items;
• Encouraging discussion of agenda items;
•  Ensuring that accurate and comprehensive management information 
is distributed to the Board members in a timely manner;
•  Ensuring compliance with high standards of corporate governance 
and ethical behaviour; and
• Facilitating a two-yearly evaluation of the Board.
As one of the original founders of the Company and a significant 
shareholder, the Non-Executive Chairman contributes relevant 
experience and expertise. He has regular discussions with the 
independent Non-Executive Director to review Board matters without 
the Executive Directors specifically from shareholders and other 
stakeholders’ perspectives. He also provides support and advice to 
the Chief Executive Officer and the Finance Director.
The Chairman was not independent on appointment and is not 
considered independent now in accordance with the Code. The other 
Non-Executive Director is considered independent in accordance 
with the Code. Both provide constructive challenges during Board 
meetings and have the experience and gravitas to do so.
BOARD EFFECTIVENESS
The approximate time spent by the Board discussing a variety of 
agenda items during the year to 31 December 2017 was as follows:
•  Strategy 40%
• Finance and risk 35% 
• Operations 15% 
• Governance 10%
The Board reviews trading and operational performance regularly. 
Divergences from expected performance are followed up promptly 
and rigorously. 
BOARD ATTENDANCE
The Board held four scheduled Board meetings during the year, 3 at 
its head office in Chippenham and 1 in Bochum, Germany. For details 
of the attendance by Directors at Board and Committee meetings for 
the year ended 31 December 2017, see the table on page 42.
In 2017 the Board evaluated its own performance internally based 
on questionnaires against key areas of its responsibility including: 
adherence to Group strategy; operational performance; cash flow 
and net assets; budgetary control; value created through acquisitions; 
and the share price. It also internally evaluated its balance of skills, 
experience, independence and knowledge of the business, as well as 
its diversity. The Board does not undertake an annual independent 
evaluation as recommended by paragraph B.6 of the Code. A two-
yearly internal evaluation is considered appropriate given the smaller 
size of the Board and regular day-to-day contact between Board 
members. 
BOARD COMMITTEES OVERSIGHT
We have three main Board Committees; an Audit Committee, a 
Nomination Committee and a Remuneration Committee. The Chairmen 
of these Board Committees will be available to answer questions at the 
2018 AGM. A description of their activities is available on the SCISYS 
website (www.scisys.co.uk/who-we-are/corporate-governance.html).

from the Company Secretary and will be available for inspection at 
the forthcoming AGM. Each Committee generally invites Directors to 
attend Board Committee meetings, to the extent appropriate.
The Board Committees’ terms of reference are reviewed annually. 
Any necessary changes are recommended to the Board. The 
minutes of the Committee meetings are available to all Directors and 
verbal briefings are given at Board meetings. A smaller Mergers and 
Acquisitions Board Committee considers acquisitions and mergers on 
an on-going basis, headed by Klaus Meng, reporting to the Board.
Divisional board meetings, Xibis Ltd and Annova Systems GmbH 
•  Monthly Divisional board meetings These are led by the Chief 
Executive Officer, and oversee the operational and financial 
performance of each individual division (Space, Media & Broadcast 
and Enterprise Solutions & Defence). Commercial issues, sales 
opportunities and risk management are discussed, and day-to-
day management decisions are made. Divisional board meetings 
provide a forum for the Directors and senior managers to assess 
performance and, if necessary, to expedite any remedial steps. Each 
division operates as a separate profit and loss centre on the basis 
of a 1–3-year business plan, with agreed short- and medium-term 
targets consistent with PLC strategy. Divisional board meetings 
therefore perform a key risk-management function. The Chief 
Executive Officer, Finance Director and Technical Director are 
members of, and attend, most divisional board meetings. Members 
of the divisional board also have regular interaction when carrying 
out their work. 
•  Xibis Limited Xibis is a separate subsidiary of SCISYS PLC and 
its board now reports through ESD. During 2017, Xibis had monthly 
board meetings in Oadby of the Directors, Neil Morjaria, Ian Newson, 
Fiona Holder, Steve Brignall and Andy Whitehead. These meetings 
also assessed the operational and financial performance of Xibis, its 
sales opportunities and strategies, and risk management.   
•  Annova Systems GmbH During 2017 Annova had monthly board 
meetings in Munich between the Directors, Michael Schüller, Silvio 
Klötzig, Klaus Heidrich and Chris Cheetham. These meetings also 
assessed the operational and financial performance of Annova, its 
sales opportunities and strategies, and risk management.
SCISYS UK Limited board meetings
During 2017 SCISYS UK Limited held monthly board meetings 
between its Directors, Steve Brignall, Dave Gawthorpe and Chris 
Cheetham. Spencer Ziegler, Klaus Heidrich and Andy Whitehead 
also attended by invitation. During these monthly board meetings a 
range of regulatory, strategic, management and operational matters 
were discussed and resolved. Natasha Laird attended as Company 
Secretary of SCISYS UK Limited and provided legal updates. 
SCISYS Deutschland GmbH board meetings 
During the course of 2017 SCISYS Deutschland GmbH held regular 
board meetings, to deal with regulatory matters and strategic 
decisions affecting SCISYS Deutschland GmbH. In 2017 the 
Directors of SCISYS Deutschland GmbH were Klaus Meng (Chair), 
Sandra Krewerth, Karl-W Pieper and Horst Wulf. 
SCISYS Deutschland Holding GmbH
SCISYS Deutschland Holding GmbH was an acquisition vehicle for 
the purchase of Annova Systems GmbH and is the holding company 
of Annova Systems GmbH and the majority shareholder of SCISYS 
Deutschland GmbH. Its Directors are Klaus Heidrich, Chris Cheetham 
and Klaus Meng.
Accountability and Internal Controls Governance
The Board undertakes a regular and robust assessment of the 
effectiveness of the Group’s systems of risk management and internal 
financial controls, which is set out within the Director’s strategic report 
on pages 32 to 35.  
Internal Governance
Comprises senior managers across the Group who consider and make decisions on 
aspects of the Group’s activities that impact on its governance at operational levels. Its 
remit therefore covers health and safety, environment and quality, as well as information 
security and cyber security. It is responsible for establishing policies and procedures 
across the Group, and ensuring compliance with these policies. It ensures that SCISYS 
remains compliant with current and future legislation relevant to health and safety, 
environment and information security. It reviews security risks including particularly 
those identified by ISO 27001 compliance, and the response of the business to 
managing those risks. It meets quarterly. 
A separate GDPR Committee met throughout the year, headed by Steve Brignall, the 
Technical Director, and attended by the General Counsel, Natasha Laird, to implement 
appropriate technical and organisational measures and update data-protection policies 
in view of the forthcoming GDPR.
During the course of 2018 a processes board will meet, and senior managers will 
discuss and establish the internal governance processes needed across the business. 
Management Meetings
CIT meets on a two-monthly basis to address and review operational issues, financial 
issues and the security performance of our IT infrastructure. 
The UK MM meets on a monthly basis and addresses day-to-day UK management and 
operational issues, legal and regulatory developments. 
HR and the General Counsel meet quarterly to discuss developments in employment 
law. 
In Germany the MTM meets to discuss day to day operational, management and legal 
issues, these meetings are chaired by a Director of SCISYS Deutschland GmbH. 
Other Management Committees
Audit Committee
 
Oversees the Group’s financial reporting, internal financial controls, their effectiveness, 
and risk-management processes. It also oversees the external audit process.
The Committee met twice during the year – details are contained in the report on page 
47. Membership is David Coghlan as Chairman with Mike Love.
Nomination Committee
Deals with appointments to the Board, monitors potential conflicts of interest and 
reviews and considers the recommendations for independent Non-Executive Directors. 
It meets when required and addresses recommendations to the Board on policy and 
strategy with respect to succession planning.
The Committee did not meet during 2017. Membership is Mike Love as Chairman with 
David Coghlan.
Remuneration Committee
Sets the remuneration of the Directors, including basic salary, bonuses and other 
incentivisation payments and awards. It also ratifies policy proposals in respect of the 
remuneration of senior executives within the Group.

Gender Pay Gap Reporting 2018
SCISYS UK Limited will publish its gender pay gap report in April 2019. 
It will have met the employee threshold for gender pay gap reporting 
on the snapshot date in April 2018. The Group did not need to publish a 
gender pay gap report for the snapshot date in April 2017 as we had not 
at that stage exceeded the required minimum Group employee count.
Diversity policy
SCISYS UK Limited has an equality and diversity policy in place 
and the Group aims to create a workforce that is diverse and 
positive, regardless of the age, gender, ethnicity, background or 
other characteristics of our employees. Equality and diversity is 
encouraged throughout the Group. 
Risk of bribery, facilitating tax evasion by others and modern 
slavery statement 2017
The Group has an anti-bribery policy in place. Each of its subsidiaries 
has implemented this policy and has appropriate procedures required 
by the Bribery Act 2010 to prevent bribery. It has procedures in place 
aimed at preventing the facilitation of tax evasion by third parties. The 
Chief Executive Officer is the Board member responsible for the Group’s 
compliance. The Group’s anti-bribery policy is reviewed regularly. 
The Group is also fully committed to eradicating human trafficking 
and modern slavery. The Company publishes annual modern slavery 
statements pursuant to the Modern Slavery Act 2015, which can 
be found at www.scisys.co.uk/who-we-are/corporate-governance/

AIM Rule Compliance Report
SCISYS PLC is quoted on AIM. We have complied with AIM Rule 31 
during 2017 by:
•  having sufficient procedures, resources and controls in place to 
enable compliance with the AIM rules;
•  seeking advice from our Nominated Adviser (“NomAd”) regarding 
compliance with the AIM Rules whenever appropriate and taking 
that advice into account;
•  providing the Company’s NomAd with any information reasonably 
requested for our NomAd to carry out their responsibilities under the 
AIM Rules for Nominated Advisers;
•  ensuring that each of the Company’s PLC Directors accepts full 
responsibility, collectively and individually, for compliance with the 
AIM rules; and  
•  ensuring that each PLC Director discloses without delay all 
information which the Company needs in order to comply with AIM 
Rule 17 (Disclosure of Miscellaneous Information) and AIM Rule 
11 (General Disclosure of Price-Sensitive Information) insofar as 
that information is known to the Director or could with reasonable 
diligence be ascertained by the Director.
Relations with shareholders
The Board recognises its primary role of representing and promoting 
the interests of the Group’s shareholders. The Board is accountable 
to shareholders for the long-term performance and success of the 
Company.
Being an AIM-quoted company, the Non-Executive Chairman, 
Finance Director and Chief Executive Officer continue to hold 
regular meetings with institutional shareholders and private client 
brokers to discuss and review the Group’s activities, strategies and 
performance. This provides a dialogue with current (and potential 
future) shareholders, brokers, and an opportunity to explain the 
Group’s strategy and performance. 
The Annual General Meeting (AGM) is our main forum for meeting 
private shareholders. The Board is available to answer questions and 
shareholder participation is encouraged. We sent out our INSCIGHT 
newsletter once during 2017, which updates shareholders and other 
stakeholders on activities and progress. The Company website (www.
scisys.co.uk/who-we-are/investors.html) has a section for investors 
which contains all publicly available financial information and news 
concerning the Company and provides details of how shareholders 
can directly discuss particular issues with the Company.

In conjunction with the Company’s Nominated Advisor (NomAd) and 
other financial advisers we distribute news in a timely fashion through 
appropriate channels to ensure that shareholders are able to access 
material information about the Company’s progress. 
The Chief Executive Officer and the Finance Director are available 
to meet shareholders during the year. The Chairman and the 
Independent Non-Executive Director make themselves available to 
discuss any issues or concerns that shareholders may have on a 
case-by-case basis.
Other key stakeholders: how we engage with employees, 
customers, suppliers and lenders. 
Our approach to corporate social responsibility is set out on page 36. 
Our staff are key to the business and the Directors recognise the 
need for engagement with employees. Executive Directors meet staff 
formally by providing twice-yearly results presentations at all office 
locations and for larger groups of off-site employees. Management 
staff meet the Directors through regular meetings (such as the 
meetings mentioned above). Our smaller size means that Directors 
and management staff are relatively accessible to all employees. We 
encourage staff engagement, and our size allows our management 
structures to be relatively flat. 
Our customers are clearly essential to our business. We maintain 
long-term relationships with our customers. SCISYS operates a 
system of key account managers whose role is to communicate 
with them and ensure close liaison, in addition to the day-to-day 
communication that occurs with every customer contract.
Our bankers are a key constituent of the Company’s on-going ability 
to maximise profitability. We develop long standing relationships with 
our bankers and keep them regularly updated as to how the business 
is performing. We also seek to maintain long-term relationships with 
suppliers, and seek to engage suppliers on industry-standard terms 
and conditions. 
When Board decisions are taken, the Board takes into account its duty 
to promote the success of the Company, the interests of shareholders 
as well as the interests of and relationships with suppliers, customers 
and employees. The Board is aware of, and complies with, its 
obligations under section 172 of the Companies Act 2006. 
The impact of the Company’s operations on the community and the 
environment is also considered carefully.  Corporate Governance Financial Statements Strategic Report

Audit 
Committee 
Report
David Coghlan
PLC
Annual statement made by the  
Audit Committee Chairman
The Audit Committee’s role is to assist the 
Board with the discharge of its responsibilities 
in relation to internal and external audits 
and financial controls. I chaired the Audit 
Committee which met twice during 2017. 
I have the requisite recent and relevant 
financial experience to do so. Meetings are 
planned around the financial calendar for 
the Company. The Finance Director and 
Chief Executive Officer and other senior 
management attend meetings by invitation 
only and the Committee also meets the 
external auditors without any SCISYS 
Executive Directors being present. On behalf 
of the Audit Committee I report to the Board 
on how it has discharged its responsibilities. 
During the year the Audit Committee, 
operating under its terms of reference, 
discharged its responsibilities, including 
reviewing and monitoring:
•  the financial-reporting process in 
the Company’s interim and annual 
reports, including consideration of the 
appropriateness of accounting policies 
and material assumptions and estimates 
adopted by management;
•  developments in accounting and reporting 
requirements;
•  the external auditors’ plan for the year-end 
audit of the Company and its subsidiaries;
• its own effectiveness;
• the composition of the Audit Committee;
•  the systems of internal financial 
control and risk management and their 
effectiveness, reporting and making 
new recommendations to the Board and 
receiving regular updates on key risk areas 
of financial control;
•  the policy on whistleblowing, whereby staff 
may raise concerns in confidence about 
possible improprieties;
•  the audit fees charged by the external 
auditors;  
•  considering the performance and formal 
engagement terms entered into with the 
external auditors and their appointment, 
re-appointment or removal and concluding 
that there will be a competitive audit-
tender process during 2018 (which did not 
take place in 2017 as proposed) for the 
appointment of the external auditor; and
•  considering whether there is a need for 
an internal audit function and concluding, 
due to the current size and complexity 
of the Group, that a formal internal audit 
function was not required and making a 
recommendation to the Board to that effect. 
Given the nature of the Company’s business, 
the Audit Committee pays particularly 
close attention to reviewing (directly and in 
discussion with the external auditors) the 
management’s judgements on the application 
of SCISYS’ revenue-recognition policies in 
relation to material projects.
Audit independence
The Audit Committee and the Board 
place great emphasis on the objectivity 
of the external auditor in its reporting 
to shareholders. The audit partner and 
senior manager are present at Audit 
Committee meetings as required to ensure 
full communication of matters relating to 
the audit. The overall performance of the 
auditor is reviewed annually by the Audit 
Committee, taking into account the views of 
management, and feedback is provided when 
necessary to senior members of the audit firm 
unrelated to the audit. The Audit Committee 
also has discussions with the auditor, 
without management being present, on the 
adequacy of controls and on any judgemental 
areas. The scope of the forthcoming year’s 
audit is discussed in advance by the Audit 
Committee, and will involve the need for 
compliance with IFRS 15. Preparations in 
this regard have been ongoing throughout 
2017. Audit fees are approved by the Audit 
Committee. 
The review of the performance, 
independence and objectivity of the external 
auditors concluded in a recommendation 
to the Board on the re-appointment of the 
auditors by shareholders at the Annual 
General Meeting (subject to the stage 
reached in the retendering process). The 
auditors provide annually a letter to the 
Committee confirming their independence 
and stating the methods they employ to 
safeguard their independence.

Remuneration 
Report
Mike Love
PLC
Annual statement made by the 
Remuneration Committee Chairman
I am pleased to introduce the Director’s 
Remuneration Report for the year ended 
31 December 2017. This report has been 
prepared by the Remuneration Committee 
and is approved by the Board.
Notwithstanding that the Company is quoted 
on AIM and is not subject to schedule 8 of 
The Large and Medium-sized Companies 
and Groups (Accounts and Reports) 
(Amendment) Regulations 2013, the 
Remuneration Committee is supportive of the 
spirit of the UK Government’s drive to improve 
transparency and clarity in the reporting 
of Directors’ remuneration and takes into 
account guidance issued by the Investment 
Association. We continue to make disclosures 
as transparent as possible. Our aim is to 
satisfy our shareholders’ desire for clarity in 
our disclosures.
The Remuneration Committee has taken the 
commitment and calibre of employees into 
account generally when setting remuneration 
awards for 2018. The responsibility for 
deciding on individual Director’s remuneration 
rests with the Remuneration Committee alone 
and no Director is involved in deciding his 
remuneration. The Remuneration Committee 
will consider the pay for senior managers in 
2018 and will have a wider remit as a result. 
There is an upper cap on all elements of 
remuneration and no bonus opportunities 
exceed 100% of salary. 
Our remuneration policy remains to attract, 
retain and incentivise high-quality individuals 
in order to implement our business strategy. 
The Committee considers that salary 
increases for 2018 are justified by the 
performance of the Group and the continuing 
increased executive commitments required 
as a result of integrating Annova with the 
Group and organic growth. Full retrospective 
disclosure has been provided for the 2017 
executive targets and performance. We 
recognise that remuneration policies need 
to be designed with the long-term success 
of the Group in mind and we note that larger 
listed companies are required to implement 
withholding and claw-back provisions for 
variable pay. Against this backdrop we 
believe that our remuneration policy promotes 
the long-term success of the Group, although 
we do not implement any claw-back or malus 
withholding provisions. We believe that 
performance related elements should be 
transparent and stretching. The remuneration 
of each Director is linked to the performance 
of the individual and the Group performance 
through base salary and performance-related 
pay, together with other benefits. All bonuses 
are capped. The Committee and the Board 
continues to balance reward with restraint. 
I look forward to your support for the 
resolution seeking approval of the 
Remuneration Report at the forthcoming 
Annual General Meeting.

Role of the Remuneration Committee
The Committee has responsibility for making recommendations to the 
Board on the remuneration packages of the Executive Directors, as 
well as monitoring the level and structure of remuneration for senior 
management, which includes:
•  making recommendations to the Board on the Company’s existing 
remuneration policy for Directors and senior staff, and to oversee 
long-term incentive plans (including share option schemes);
•  ensuring remuneration is both appropriate to the level of 
responsibility and adequate to attract and/or retain Directors, senior 
management and staff of the calibre required by the Company; and
• ensuring that remuneration is in line with current industry practice.
The Remuneration Committee has sole responsibility for deciding 
the Executive Directors’ remuneration and, from 2018, divisional 
directors, Directors of subsidiaries and managers of profit centres. It 
is sensitive to possible conflicts of interests when receiving views from 
Executive Directors about its proposals. No Director is involved in 
deciding his own remuneration. 
Remuneration policy
The table below shows how the remuneration policy is linked to overall 
Group strategy.

Base salary is set annually on 1

Salary levels are reviewed on 
an annual basis by reference to 
comparable positions in similarly sized 
AIM-listed companies.
 
We do not depend on formulaic 
methods for determining this salary.
When considering any increases to base salaries in the

increases being given in comparable groups, pay and

Cash payments. Executive Directors 
participate in an annual performance-
related payment scheme.
For short-term targets quarterly 
payments are made based on an 
assessment of progress towards 
the annual target. 25% is retained 
until the year-end accounts are 
completed to allow for any downturn 
in trading later in the year. Payments 
are made once the accounts for a 
quarter have been approved by the 
Board (i.e. Q1 payment is paid in 
May payroll, Q2 in Sep, Q3 in Nov 
and Q4 in Mar). Entitlements are 
assessed cumulatively so that under-
performance in earlier quarters, which 
is subsequently recovered, will result 
in a catch up of payments. There is no 
claw-back or malus withholding if the 
quarterly payments on account already 
made exceed the total due for the year. 
Variable pay linked to medium targets 
will be paid after the audited statutory 
accounts of SCISYS PLC for the last 
year of the respective medium-term 
period have been published.
During 2017 the split of total variable pay between 
payments related to Company profitability (Performance 
Related Pay “PRP”) and personal Key Performance 
Indicators (KPI) was 70:30.
 
During 2017, 50% out of the 70% PRP element related to 
a short-term adjusted EBITA and to a medium-term target 
for average Group-adjusted EBITA performance between 
2016 and 2019.
The short-term adjusted EBITA target for 2017 was £4.56m. 
The remaining 20% of the PRP was split between two 
targets, namely a short-term total revenue target (10%) and 
a medium-term total revenue target (10%). 
The short-term revenue target for 2017 was £55.12m.
Additionally a bonus of up to £40,000 each for Chris 
Cheetham, Klaus Heidrich and Steve Brignall is payable in 
March 2019 if an average target surplus increase in Group 
adjusted EBITA is met during the period 2016 to 2018. 
Klaus Meng will receive a bonus of up to £10,000 if this 
ambitious surplus increase is met.
Personal KPI-based payments represented a maximum 
of 30% of the variable pay total for Executive Directors. 
Performance was reviewed in May/June and December by 
the Executives’ peers.
Profitability linked to a 
target-adjusted EBITA 
being achieved. 
Revenue performance 
was related to a total 
revenue target. 
KPI tied to individual 
objectives set for each 
Executive Director 
to achieve during the 
year.
Long-term 
incentive
Long-term incentives 
are awarded to align the 
interests of the Executive 
Director with shareholders 
and drive long-term 
performance.
Executive Directors received an annual 
allocation of share options. These are 
subject to performance conditions to 
be met over a period of three years. 
The performance conditions have been 
chosen to align the long-term incentive 
to the performance of the business. 
Options awarded during 2017 were set at an option price of 
£101.50. The maximum potential benefit is therefore linked 
to the upward movement in the share price at the time the 
Executive Director elects to exercise the option should the 
performance conditions be achieved at the end of the three-
year holding period. The Option may be exercised between 
3 and 10 years from the date it was granted, subject to 
performance conditions being met.
During 2017 the 
performance 
condition was tied 
to the long-term 
financial performance 
of the group based 
on growth in EPS and 
average earnings over 
a three-year period.
Pension To provide competitive 
levels of retirement 
benefit.
The UK-domiciled Executive Directors 
are entitled to a Company pension 
contribution at a rate from 6.75% to 
8.5% of pensionable pay to be paid 
into the defined contribution pension 
scheme open to all of the Company’s 
permanent employees. Pensionable 
pay is set at basic salary plus 10%. 
During 2017 Klaus Heidrich, as a 
German-domiciled Executive Director, 
received a pension contribution.

SERVICE CONTRACTS
The Company’s policy on Directors’ service contracts is that they 
should be on a rolling basis without a specific end date. Klaus 
Heidrich’s and Klaus Meng’s service contracts are under German 
law and consequently while they provide for termination on 12 
months’ notice they would be compensated based on 24 months’ 
salary unless the termination was due to the individual’s default. To 
align the service contracts of the UK resident Directors with those 
of the DE resident Directors, following a change of control causing 
the termination of their service contracts they are entitled to the 
equivalent of 24 months’ salary (unless such termination resulted 
from their default or the previous poor performance of the Company, 
as decided in the sole discretion of the Remuneration Committee). 
Under their letters of appointment the Chairman and Non-Executive 
Director are entitled to receive 6 months’ notice of termination of their 
employment.

SCISYS PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 53
SHARE SCHEMES 
Share Incentive Plan
The Group operates an all-staff HMRC approved Share Incentive Plan 
(‘SIP’) which was set up in 2001. The UK Directors may participate 
in this scheme. During the year, eligible staff were able to invest up 
to £1,800 per annum out of pre-tax pay in purchasing Partnership 
Shares. At certain times the Company may award Free Shares to 
eligible employees under the SIP. 
As at 31 December 2017 the trust set up to administer the Free and 
Partnership shares held: 843,652 ordinary shares (2016: 894,087 
ordinary shares) in SCISYS PLC.
Share Option Schemes
The Company continues to operate share plans for senior executives 
and managers as a combined reward and incentive for those who 
have made a major contribution to the business and will continue to 
play a key role in helping the Group achieve its strategic objectives. 
Additionally, awards are made to key staff with high potential or in 
recognition of significant achievements. 
Enterprise Management Incentive (EMI) Scheme
All EMI share options have been exercised and this scheme 
terminated on 31 December 2017.
Company Share Option Plan (CSOP)
SCISYS adopted a CSOP approved by HMRC in January 2009. 
Options may be exercised between 3 and 10 years following grant, 
provided that the performance conditions have been met. 
During 2017 SCISYS awarded 202,500 options under the CSOP 
granted to Directors, senior managers and staff at an issue price 
of 101.50 pence per share. The total number of CSOP options that 
remain capable of being exercised at the year end was 912,500. The 
number of CSOP options granted to Directors is reported on page 51 
to 52.
Unapproved Share Option Scheme
The CSOP scheme provides tax benefits for recipients providing 
they are resident in the UK. For our senior managers in Germany 
this would be inappropriate so since January 2008 we have awarded 
options to them under an unapproved scheme but in accordance with 
similar rules to the CSOP. 
During 2017 SCISYS awarded 137,500 options under the Unapproved 
scheme granted to Directors, senior managers and staff at an issue 
price of 101.5 pence per share. The total number of these options 
that remain capable of being exercised at the year-end was 549,000. 
Options may be exercised between 3 and 10 years following grant, 
provided that the performance conditions have been met. The number 
of unapproved options granted to Directors is reported on page 51 
to 52.
Share Option Performance Conditions
The Remuneration Committee sets performance conditions each 
time an award of options is made under the CSOP and Unapproved 
schemes. The EPS growth and average earnings growth are the 
two key performance measures currently applied. Both EPS growth 
and average earnings growth remain substantially within the control 
of Directors and management and therefore the Remuneration 
Committee continues to consider them to be appropriate measures of 
the underlying financial performance of the Group.
Options exercised during the year
Directors exercised a total of 177,416 share options during 2017. The 
total number of options held by Directors is reported on pages 51 
to 52.
Dilution
Awards granted under the CSOP and unapproved schemes are 
satisfied either with treasury shares or with a new issue of shares 
which is subject to an informal 10% dilution limit in any 10-year 
period. The current potential dilution is below this level. The total of 
share options awarded and remaining exercisable at year end was 
1,461,500. The Company’s current commitment as at 31 December 
2017 in respect of its option grants (assuming all performance 
conditions are met and all option and award holders remain in 
employment to the final date of exercise under the scheme rules) 
could be satisfied by issuing this number of new shares. 
Share Price
The closing mid-market price of the Company’s shares on 29 
December 2017 (the last business day in 2017) was 115.5 pence per 
share. The high and low share mid-market prices during 2017 were 
136.5 pence and 92.0 pence, respectively.
The report of the Remuneration Committee has been approved by the 
Board of Directors for submission to shareholders for their approval at 
the Annual General Meeting.  Corporate Governance / Directors’ Report
SCISYS PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 54
The following matters are reported by the Directors in accordance 
with the Companies Act 2006 requirements in force at the date of 
these Annual Report and Financial Statements.
For the year ended 31 December 2017
The Directors present their Annual Report and the audited financial 
statements for the year ended 31 December 2017.
Principal activities
The principal activities of SCISYS PLC (the ‘Company’) and its 
subsidiary companies (the ‘Group’) are set out within the Strategic 
Report which comprises the Chairman’s Statement and the Strategic 
Review on pages 5 to 23.
Review of business and future developments
The Consolidated Income Statement for the year ended 31 December 
2017 is set out on page 62. A review of the Group’s business activities 
during the year and its prospects for the future can be found in the 
Strategic Report on pages 5 to 39. These reports together with the 
Corporate Governance Statement, the Remuneration Committee 
Report and the Audit Committee Report, are incorporated into this 
report by reference and should be read as part of this report.
Key performance indicators
The Directors measure the Group’s performance principally using the 
financial indicators (as reflected in this Annual Report) as stated on 
page 22.
Principal risks and uncertainties
Details of the principal risks and uncertainties considered by the 
Board to affect the Group, and the related risk mitigation actions, are 
given on pages 32 to 35.
Group results and dividends
The Group’s consolidated accounts show an adjusted operating profit 
before tax for the year of £4.6m (2016: £3.2m) on revenue of £57.2 
(2016: £45.7m). The Company paid an interim dividend 0.59 pence 
per share on 9 November 2017 and the Directors are recommending 
the payment of a final dividend of 2.16 per share. 
Financial instruments
Details of financial instruments to which the Group is a party are 
shown in note 22 to the financial statements.
Capital structure
The share capital of SCISYS PLC, issued and unissued, is comprised 
entirely of one class of ordinary share of 25 pence each. Each share 
ranks equally and carries the same rights to vote and receive dividends 
and other distributions declared, made or paid by the Company. 
Restrictions on transfer of securities
There are no specific restrictions on the transfer of securities in 
the Company, which is governed by the Articles of Association and 
prevailing legislation. Nor is the Company aware of any agreements 
between holders of securities that may result in restrictions on the 
transfer of securities or that may result in restrictions on voting rights. 
Treasury shares
As at 1 April 2018 the Company held 18,167 shares in Treasury to 
support the trustee of the SCISYS Share Incentive Plan (SIP) in the 
event that the SIP trust is unable to procure sufficient shares in the 
market to fulfil the monthly purchase requirements of staff members 
of the SIP. In such circumstances the Company would sell sufficient 
shares from Treasury at the prevailing market price. Treasury shares 
are also used to fulfil the exercise of share options by employees. All 
such transactions are announced in accordance with the AIM rules.
Directors
The names of the current Directors and their biographical details 
are set out on page 42. Details of the interests of the Directors in 
the Company’s shares at year end are set out in the Remuneration 
Report on pages 48 to 52. David Jones, Klaus Meng and Klaus 
Heidrich are required to stand for re-election at the Annual General 
Meeting in 2018. The names of the current divisional directors are 
set out on page 45, together with Annova’s Directors. The powers 
of the Company’s Directors and rules that apply to changes in the 
Directors are set out in the Company’s Articles of Association (the 
‘Articles’). Any changes to the Articles would require the consent of 
the Company’s shareholders.
Directors’ and Officers’ Insurance
The Group maintains insurance cover for all Directors and Officers 
of Group companies against liabilities that may be incurred by them 
while acting as Directors and Officers.
Directors’ indemnity provisions
As permitted by the Articles, each of the Directors has the benefit of 
an indemnity which is a qualifying third-party indemnity as defined by 
section 234 of the Companies Act 2006. The indemnity was in force 
throughout the financial year, and is currently in force. No indemnity is 
provided for the Company’s auditor.
Directors’ conflicts of interest
The Company has procedures in place for managing conflicts of 
interest. Should a Director become aware that they, or their connected 
parties, have an interest in an existing or proposed transaction with 
SCISYS PLC or any Group company, they should notify the Board of 
the Group company in writing or at the next Board meeting. Internal 
controls are in place to ensure that any related party transactions 
involving Directors, or their connected parties, are conducted on an 
arm’s length basis. Directors have a continuing duty to update any 
changes to these conflicts.

Employee policies
The Group has established employment policies that comply with 
current legislation and codes of practice, including in the areas of 
health and safety, diversity and equal opportunities. The Group 
consults employees on developments and changes to take account of 
their views when making decisions that may impact on their interests. 
The Group makes effort to recruit and continue the employment, 
training and promotion of those persons who are or become disabled. 
From 2018 the Remuneration Committee will have oversight of any 
employment policy issues, notified to it by local Human Resources 
centres.
Employee engagement
The Group engages with its employees regularly through various 
media: email alerts, bulletins, newsletters, team briefings and twice-
yearly all-staff presentations. Details of the performance of the Group 
are shared with all employees at the appropriate time using these 
methods.
The Company operates a HMRC-approved share incentive plan 
to encourage employees to take a greater interest in the Group’s

Political donations
No political donations were made (2016: £nil) and it is Company policy 
not to make such donations.
Going concern
The financial statements have been prepared on a going-concern 
basis. The Directors have reviewed the Group’s objectives, policies 
and processes for managing its capital, financial risk management, 
financial instruments, exposure to credit and liquidity risk, as well 
as financial forecasts. As a result of this review the Directors have a 
reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to 
continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. For this 
reason the Directors continue to adopt the going-concern basis in 
preparing the financial statements.
Post balance sheet events
There are no post balance sheet events to report.
Annual General Meeting
The Company’s Annual General Meeting will be held at its offices 
located at Methuen Park, Chippenham, Wiltshire, SN14 0GB on

General Meeting and an explanation of the business to be put to the 
meeting is contained in the separate circular sent to shareholders and 
on the website at www.scisys.co.uk/who-we-are/investors.html.
Audit information
In the case of each of the persons who are Directors of the Company 
at the date when this Annual Report was approved: 
•  So far as each of the Directors is aware, there is no relevant audit 
information of which the Company’s auditor is unaware; and  
•  Each of the Directors has taken all the steps that he ought to have 
taken as a Director, to make themselves aware of any relevant audit 
information and to establish that the Company’s auditor is aware of 
that information. 
This confirmation is given and should be interpreted in accordance 
with the provisions of section 418 of the Companies Act 2006.
Auditor
In accordance with the Company’s policy of periodically reviewing 
its relationships with its professional advisers, the Company intends 
to undertake a tendering process for the provision of audit services 
in the second quarter of 2018. The current auditor, KPMG LLP, 
has indicated its willingness to continue in office and will be invited 
along with a shortlist of other firms to submit a proposal for its re-
appointment. 

Corporate Governance / Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities  
in respect of the Strategic Report, the Directors’ Report and the Financial Statements
The Directors are responsible for preparing 
the Annual Report, Strategic Report, the 
Directors’ Report and the Group and parent 
company financial statements in accordance 
with applicable law and regulations. 
Company law requires the Directors to 
prepare Group and parent company financial 
statements for each financial year. As 
required by the AIM Rules of the London 
Stock Exchange they are required to prepare 
the Group financial statements in accordance 
with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and 
applicable law and have elected to prepare 
the parent company financial statements in 
accordance with UK Accounting Standards 
and applicable law (UK Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice), including FRS 101 
Reduced Disclosure Framework.
Under company law the Directors must not 
approve the financial statements unless they 
are satisfied that they give a true and fair 
view of the state of affairs of the Group and 
parent company and of their profit or loss for 
that period. In preparing each of the Group 
and parent company financial statements, the 
Directors are required to: 
•  select suitable accounting policies and then 
apply them consistently; 
•  make judgements and estimates that are 
reasonable and prudent;
•  for the Group financial statements, state 
whether they have been prepared in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the 
EU;  
•  for the parent company financial statements, 
state whether applicable UK Accounting 
Standards have been followed, subject 
to any material departures disclosed and 
explained in the financial statements; and  
•  prepare the financial statements on 
the going concern basis unless it is 
inappropriate to presume that the Group 
and the parent company will continue in 
business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping 
adequate accounting records that are 
sufficient to show and explain the parent 
company’s transactions and disclose 
with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the parent company 
and enable them to ensure that its financial 
statements comply with the Companies Act 
2006. They have general responsibility for 
taking such steps as are reasonably open to 
them to safeguard the assets of the Group 
and to prevent and detect fraud and other 
irregularities. 
The Directors are responsible for the 
maintenance and integrity of the corporate 
and financial information included on the 
Company’s website. Legislation in the UK 
governing the preparation and dissemination 
of financial statements may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions.
Signed on behalf of the Board.

1. Our opinion is unmodified 
We have audited the financial statements 
of SCISYS plc (“the Company”) for the year 
ended 31 December 2017 which comprise 
the Consolidated Income Statement, 
Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive 
Income, Consolidated Statement of Financial 
Position, Consolidated Statement of Changes 
in Equity, Consolidated Statement of Cash 
Flows, Company Balance Sheet, Company 
Statement of Changes in Equity, and the 
related notes, including the accounting 
policies in the Principal Accounting Policies 
section.
In our opinion:
–  the financial statements give a true and 
fair view of the state of the Group’s and 
of the parent Company’s affairs as at 31 
December 2017 and of the Group’s profit for 
the year then ended;
–  the group financial statements have been 
properly prepared in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards 
as adopted by the European Union;
–  the parent Company financial statements 
have been properly prepared in accordance 
with UK accounting standards, including 
FRS 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework; 
and
–  the financial statements have been 
prepared in accordance with the 
requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance 
with International Standards on Auditing 
(UK) (“ISAs (UK)”) and applicable law. Our 
responsibilities are described below. We have 
fulfilled our ethical responsibilities under, and 
are independent of the Group in accordance 
with, UK ethical requirements including 
the FRC Ethical Standard as applied to 
listed entities. We believe that the audit 
evidence we have obtained is a sufficient and 
appropriate basis for our opinion.

The risk Our response
Revenue recognition – estimation 
of costs to complete on contracts 
(£48,042k ; 2016: £37,578k)
Refer to page 67 (accounting policy) and 
note 1 (financial disclosures)
Subjective estimate
The Group recognises revenue on fixed- 
price development projects by reference to 
the degree of completion of each project. 
The degree of completion is measured by 
reference to costs incurred at the balance 
sheet date as a percentage of the total 
estimated costs to complete the project.
The assumptions underlying the cost to 
complete estimates involve judgement, 
and any changes in the assumptions could 
have a material impact on the revenue 
recognised in relation to these projects.
Our procedures included:
–  Control design: Evaluated and tested the Group’s key processes and 
controls in place over revenue recognition and forecast cost estimation. 
We performed controls testing over the Project Budget Forecast (PBF) 
reports produced by the Openplan IT System used in calculating 
revenue to be recognised;
–  P e r s on n el i n t e r v i e w s : Discussed the performance of the projects 
with the Group’s project managers, particularly focussing on cost 
forecasting and contingencies, in order to corroborate the judgements 
made;
–  Historical comparisons: Challenged the Group’s key assumptions 
in the percentage of completion calculation, based on a retrospective 
review of the accuracy of the Group’s previous estimates, movements 
in margins on certain projects or types of project over time, and 
considering the actual historical outturn in relation to each type of 
project;
–  Tests of details: Agreed a sample of costs from PBF reports back to 
supporting timesheets or other documentation;
–  Assessing transparency: Assessed the adequacy of the Group’s 
disclosures in relation to the risks and steps taken to mitigate those 
risks in the judgements made in the financial statements.
Carrying value of goodwill
(£15,913k; 2016: £15,593k)
Refer to page 68 (accounting policy) and 
note 13 (financial disclosures).
Forecast-based valuation
The recoverable amounts of the Group’s 
Cash-Generating Units to which goodwill 
is allocated are determined from value in 
use calculations, which represents a key 
judgement area as errors in assumptions, 
particularly relating to forecast cash 
flows and discount rates, could result in 
a material misstatement of the goodwill 
balance.
Our procedures included:
–  Control design: Evaluated the Group’s budgeting procedures upon 
which the forecast cash flows are based by assessing whether the 
forecasts (including growth rate) were consistent with the Group’s 
current business strategies;
–  Historical comparisons: Assessed the reasonableness of the budgets 
by considering the historical accuracy of the previous forecasts;
–  Benchmarking assumptions: Challenged the Group’s selection of 
discount and growth rates by using external data (including competitor 
analysis) to determine an appropriate range and comparing the actual 
rate used to that range;
–  Sensitivity analysis: Performed analysis to assess the sensitivity of 
the impairment reviews to changes in the discount rate, growth rate and 
the forecast cash flows;
–  Assessing transparency: Assessed whether the Group’s disclosures 
about the sensitivity of the outcome of the impairment assessment to 
changes in key assumptions reflected the risks inherent in the valuation 
of goodwill.
Parent Company: Carrying value of 
investments (£17,029k; 2016:
£17,030k)
Refer to parent company note 1 
(accounting policy) and parent company 
note 5 (financial disclosures).
Forecast-based valuation
The recoverable amounts of the parent 
Company’s investments are determined 
from value in use calculations, which 
represents a key judgement area as errors 
in assumptions, particularly relating to 
forecast cash flows and discount rates, 
could result in a material misstatement of 
the goodwill balance.
Our procedures included:
–  Assessing forecasts: The work on the Group’s forecasts as described 
in the goodwill impairment risk above.

2. Key audit matters: our assessment of risks of material 
misstatement
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional 
judgment, were of most significance in the audit of the financial 
statements and include the most significant assessed risks of material 
misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) identified by us, including 
those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the 
allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the 
engagement team. These matters were addressed in the context of 
our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our 
opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these 
matters. In arriving at our audit opinion above, the key audit matters, 
in decreasing order of audit significance, were as follows (unchanged 
from 2016): Independent Auditor’s Report to the members of SCISYS PLC 
SCISYS PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 60
3. Our application of materiality and an overview of the scope of 
our audit
Materiality for the group financial statements as a whole was set at
£530,000 determined with reference to a benchmark of group total 
revenue of which it represents 0.9% (2016: 1.0%). We consider total 
revenue to be the most appropriate benchmark as it provides a more 
stable measure year on year than group profit before tax.
Materiality for the parent company financial statements as a whole 
was set at £350,000 (2016: £325,000), determined with reference to 
a benchmark of company total assets, of which it represents 1.5% 
(2016: 1.3%).
We agreed to report to the Audit Committee any corrected or 
uncorrected identified misstatements exceeding £25,000, in addition 
to other identified misstatements that warranted reporting on 
qualitative grounds.
Of the group’s 6 (2016: 5) reporting components, we subjected all 
of these to full scope audits for group purposes. The work on 2 of 
the 6 components (2016: 1 of the 5 components) was performed 
by component auditors and the rest, including the audit of the 
parent company, was performed by the Group team. The Group 
team instructed component auditors as to the significant areas to 
be covered, including the relevant risks detailed above and the 
information to be reported back. The Group team approved the 
component materialities, which ranged from £28,000 to £400,000 
(2016: £25,000 to £325,000), having regard to the mix of size and risk 
profile of the Group across the components.
4. We have nothing to report on going concern
We are required to report to you if we have concluded that the use of 
the going concern basis of accounting is inappropriate or there is an 
undisclosed material uncertainty that may cast significant doubt over 
the use of that basis for a period of at least twelve months from the 
date of approval of the financial statements. We have nothing to report 
in these respects.
5. We have nothing to report on the other information in the 
Annual Report
The directors are responsible for the other information presented in 
the Annual Report together with the financial statements. Our opinion 
on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, 
accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion or, except as explicitly 
stated below, any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
Our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, 
consider whether, based on our financial statements audit work, 
the information therein is materially misstated or inconsistent with 
the financial statements or our audit knowledge. Based solely on 
that work we have not identified material misstatements in the other 
information.
Strategic report and directors’ report
Based solely on our work on the other information:
–  we have not identified material misstatements in the strategic report 
and the directors’ report;
–  in our opinion the information given in those reports for the financial 
year is consistent with the financial statements; and
–  in our opinion those reports have been prepared in accordance with 
the Companies Act 2006.

6. We have nothing to report on the other matters on which we 
are required to report by exception
Under the Companies Act 2006, we are required to report to you if, in 
our opinion:
–  adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent 
Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received 
from branches not visited by us; or
–  the parent Company financial statements are not in agreement with 
the accounting records and returns; or
–  certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are 
not made; or
–  we have not received all the information and explanations we 
require for our audit.
We have nothing to report in these respects.
 
7. Respective responsibilities
Directors’ responsibilities
As explained more fully in their statement set out on page 56, 
the directors are responsible for: the preparation of the financial 
statements including being satisfied that they give a true and fair 
view; such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable 
the preparation of financial statements that are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; assessing the Group 
and, parent Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, 
disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern; and using 
the going concern basis of accounting unless they either intend to 
liquidate the Group or the parent Company or to cease operations, or 
have no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditor’s responsibilities
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the 
financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error, and to issue our opinion in an auditor’s 
report. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but 
does not guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with 
ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. 
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered 
material if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be 
expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the 
basis of the financial statements.
A fuller description of our responsibilities is provided on the FRC’s 
website at www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities.
8. The purpose of our audit work and to whom we owe our 
responsibilities
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in 
accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. 
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the 
Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them 
in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent 
permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone 
other than the Company and the Company’s members, as a body, for 
our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

Statement of compliance
SCISYS PLC (the “Company”) is a public company incorporated, 
domiciled and registered in England in the UK. The registered 
number is 3426416 and the registered address is 2 Methuen Park, 
Chippenham, Wiltshire SN14 0GB UK. 
The group financial statements consolidate those of the Company 
and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the “Group”) and equity 
account the Group’s interest in associates. The parent company 
financial statements present information about the Company as a 
separate entity and not about its group.
The group financial statements have been prepared and approved 
by the Directors in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards as adopted by the EU (“Adopted IFRSs”). The Company 
has elected to prepare its parent company financial statements in 
accordance with FRS 101; these are presented on pages 93 to 94.
Basis of preparation 
The accounting policies have, unless otherwise stated, been 
applied consistently to all periods presented in these group financial 
statements and on a historical cost basis, with the exception of 
derivative financial instruments, which are recognised at fair value.
The following standards have been adopted for the first time in 2017. 
None have a significant effect on the consolidated results or financial 
position of the Group:
T he Group has adopted the following IFRSs in these  
financial statements:
Amendments to IAS 7: Disclosure Initiative. 
A mendments to IAS 12: Recognition of Deferred Tax  
Assets for Unrealised Losses. 
There are no new standards or interpretations endorsed by the EU 
during the year that impact on the financial results or presentation 
in 2017. The following Adopted IFRSs have been issued but have 
not been applied by the Group in these financial statements. Their 
adoption is not expected to have a material effect on the financial 
statements unless otherwise indicated:
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (effective date 1 January 2018). 
IF RS 15 Revenue from Contract with Customers (effective 
date 1 January 2018). 
IFRS 16 Leases (effective date 1 January 2019).
IF RIC 22 Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance 
Consideration (effective date to be confirmed). 
IF RIC 23 Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments (effective 
date to be confirmed). 
A nnual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2014-2016 Cycle 
(effective date to be confirmed). 
A mendments to IFRS 2: Classification and Measurement of 
Share-based Payment Transactions (effective date to be 
confirmed). 
Of the above standards and interpretations in issue but not yet 
effective, only IFRS 15, “Revenue from contracts with customers”   
and IFRS 16, “Leases”, are anticipated to have any potentially material 
impact on the results and financial position of the Group.
From 1 January 2018 there are changes as per IFRS 15 Revenue 
from contracts with customers. IFRS 15 deals with revenue 
recognition and establishes principles for reporting useful information 
to users of financial statements about the nature, amount, timing 
and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from an entity’s 
contracts with customers. The Group will take into account principal v 
agent considerations. Where considered an agent, only the mark-up 
element will be disclosed as revenue, currently the full contract value 
is considered and when recognised disclosed in other revenue. This 
may result in additional segmenting of contracts based on individual 
performance obligations to ensure the various revenue streams are 
recognised in line with the new standard. IFRS 15 processes are 
being implemented now in preparation for 2018.
Implementation of the new IFRS15 standard will have a negligible 
impact on the phasing of anticipated operating profits, although 
reported revenues will be depressed when compared with previously 
applied treatment. The reduction reflects provisions in the standard 
whereby only the mark-up on third-party costs can be recognised as 
revenue on situations where SCISYS acts in the capacity of an Agent, 
simply passing the third-party’s goods and services to customers 
through its books. The assessment made by the entity is preliminary 
as not all transition work requirements have been finalised and 
therefore may be subject to adjustment. 
IFRS 16 is expected to be effective from 1 January 2019 and may 
require all leases to be reflected on-balance sheet. The potential 
impact of IFRS 16 on the Group is minimal.
The group financial statements are presented in pounds sterling and 
all values are rounded to the nearest thousand (£000) except when 
otherwise indicated. 
The Directors consider that it is appropriate to prepare the financial 
statements on a going concern basis due to the healthy position of 
the order book and the availability of committed borrowing facilities 
that provide adequate headroom over forecast working capital 
requirements for 2018.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRSs 
requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions 
that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets 
and liabilities, income and expenses. The estimates and associated 
assumptions are based on historical experience and various other 
factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, 
the results of which form the basis of making the judgements about 
carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent 
from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. 
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an 
ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in 
the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only 
that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the 
revision affects both current and future periods.

SCISYS PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 67
Consolidation 
The group financial statements comprise the financial statements of 
the Company and its subsidiaries made up to 31 December each year. 
The financial statements of subsidiaries and associates are prepared 
for the same reporting period as the Company, and adjustments are 
made where necessary to align accounting policies across the Group.
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is 
transferred to the Group and cease to be consolidated from the date 
on which control is transferred out of the Group. 
Associates are those entities in which the Group has significant 
influence, but not control, over the financial and operating policies. 
Significant influence is presumed to exist when the Group holds 
between 20 and 50 per cent of the voting power of another entity. 
Associates are accounted for using the equity method (equity 
accounted investees) and are initially recognised at cost. The 
Group’s investment includes goodwill identified on acquisition, net 
of any accumulated impairment losses. The consolidated financial 
statements include the Group’s share of the total comprehensive 
income and equity movements of equity accounted investees, from 
the date that significant influence commences until the date that 
significant influence ceases. When the Group’s share of losses 
exceeds its interest in an equity accounted investee, the Group’s 
carrying amount is reduced to nil and recognition of further losses is 
discontinued except to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or 
constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of an investee.
Intra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealised income 
and expenses arising from intra-group transactions, are eliminated. 
Unrealised gains arising from transactions with equity-accounted 
investees are eliminated against the investment to the extent of the 
Group’s interest in the investee. Unrealised losses are eliminated in 
the same way as unrealised gains, but only to the extent that there is 
no evidence of impairment.
Business combinations
The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the purchase 
method. For all acquisitions prior to 1 January 2010, the cost of the 
acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values, at the 
date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed and 
equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the 
acquired subsidiary, plus any costs directly attributable to the business 
contribution. Since that date, IFRS 3 (2008) applies and all acquisition 
costs are expensed as incurred unless related to the raising of finance. 
The acquired subsidiaries’ identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent 
liabilities that meet the requirement for recognition under IFRS 3 are 
recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date.
Goodwill arising on acquisition is recognised as an asset and initially 
measured at cost, being the excess of the cost of the business 
combination over the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the 
identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised. If, 
after reassessment, the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the 
acquired subsidiary’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent 
liabilities exceeds the cost of the business combination, the excess is 
recognised immediately in profit or loss.
Revenue 
Revenue from consultancy and other professional services rendered 
on a fixed-price project is recognised, as the services are performed, 
by reference to the degree of completion of the project. The degree 
of completion is measured by reference to own labour costs incurred 
by the balance sheet date as a percentage of the total estimated own 
labour costs to completion for each project. Provision is made for all 
foreseeable losses as soon as they are identified. 
Revenue from projects billed on a time and materials basis is 
recognised in line with performance of the services.
Revenue for software licences is recognised when the product to 
which the revenue relates is used by the client to process live data 
in any location, typically at the end of an implementation project. 
Revenues are not recognised unless their receipt can be predicted 
with a high level of certainty. Where Configuration services required 
to create the customer’s unique solution and without which the 
customer obtains no benefit from the licences. The licences and 
services are combined in a single Performance Obligation with 
revenues recognised over time on a % of completion basis (subject 
to a contractual termination for convenience clause and our right to 
cost-plus payment).
Revenue from the sale of third-party products is recognised on 
transfer to the customer of the significant risks and rewards of 
ownership and when:
•  it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the 
transaction will flow;
•  the amount of revenue can be measured reliably; and
•  the costs incurred or to be incurred in respect of the transaction can 
be measured reliably.
In practice, this is typically on delivery of the third-party product to the 
customer.
All revenues are stated net of discounts, VAT and other sales related 
taxes.
Maintenance revenue is recognised evenly over the term of a contract. 
Deferred income comprises the element of maintenance revenues 
invoiced for which the period of maintenance extends beyond the year 
end.
Leases 
Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and 
benefits of ownership of the asset are classified as operating leases. 
Operating lease rentals are recognised as an expense in the Income 
Statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Benefits 
received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating 
lease are also spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Exceptional items
Items which are both material and considered by the Directors to be 
unusual in either nature or size are separately disclosed on the face of 
the Consolidated Income Statement.

SCISYS PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 68
Foreign currency translation 
The presentation currency of the Group is pounds sterling (£), which 
is also the functional currency of the UK-based group companies. 
The functional currency of the German subsidiaries is the euro (€). 
Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded at the foreign 
exchange rate prevailing on the dates of the transactions. Monetary 
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance 
sheet date are translated to sterling at the rate of exchange ruling at 
that date. All differences are recognised in the Consolidated Income 
Statement. 
Assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries, including goodwill and 
fair value adjustments arising on consolidation, are translated into 
sterling at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. 
Revenues and expenses are translated at the weighted average 
exchange rate for the year. The exchange differences arising on the 
retranslation of the opening net investment in subsidiaries, and from 
the translation of the results of those subsidiaries at average rate, are 
taken directly to a separate component of equity. 
The Group has taken advantage of the exemption available under 
IFRS 1 to deem the cumulative translation differences for all 
investments in foreign operations to be zero at 1 January 2006, the 
date of transition to adopted IFRS. Exchange differences arising after 
1 January 2006 from the translation of the net investment in foreign 
operations are taken to a translation reserve. They are released into 
the income statement on disposal.  
Pensions
The Group operates defined-contribution group personal pension 
plans, the assets of which are held separately from those of the Group 
in independently administered funds. The amount charged against 
profits represents the contributions payable to the schemes in respect 
of the accounting period.
Taxation 
Tax on profits or losses for the year comprises current and deferred 
tax and is recognised in the Income Statement except to the extent 
that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is 
recognised in equity.
The tax currently payable is based on the taxable profit for the 
year and calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is 
calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period 
when the asset is realised or the liability is settled.
Deferred tax is provided, using the balance sheet liability method, 
for temporary differences at the balance sheet date between the tax 
bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial 
reporting purposes. 
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable 
temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the 
extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against 
which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such assets 
and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises 
from the initial recognition of goodwill or the initial recognition (other 
than in a business combination) of an asset or liability in a transaction 
that affects neither the accounting nor taxable profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary 
differences arising on investments in subsidiaries unless the timing 
of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled by 
the Group and it is probable that the temporary differences will not 
reverse in the foreseeable future. 
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each 
balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer 
probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or 
part of the deferred tax asset to be utilised.
Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated 
depreciation and any impairment in value. Depreciation is calculated 
on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset as 
follows: 
 Freehold land   Not depreciated
 Freehold buildings  16 to 50 years
 Long leasehold property    Lower of the lease term  
or 50 years
 Short leasehold property  Over the lease term
 Plant & machinery  5 to 20 years
 Office equipment   3 to 13 years 
 Motor vehicles    5 years
 Computer equipment  2 to 7 years
Goodwill 
Goodwill on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of 
acquisition over the Group’s interest in the fair value of the identifiable 
assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired at the date of 
acquisition. Following initial recognition, goodwill is measured at 
cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is reviewed 
for impairment, annually or more frequently if events or changes in 
circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired. 
Impairment charges are deducted from the carrying value and 
recognised immediately in the Income Statement. For the purpose 
of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Group’s 
cash-generating units (CGUs) expected to benefit from the synergies 
of the combination. An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not 
reversed in a subsequent period.
Other intangible assets
The amortisation periods for the intangible fixed assets below are 
based on their estimated useful lives as follows:
 Software licences   3 to 5 years
 Annova order book (not straight-line basis) 11 years   
 Annova acquired software solution  3 years
Impairment of non-current assets 
At each reporting date, the Group assesses whether there is any 
Principal accounting policies (continued) Corporate Governance Financial Statements Strategic Report
Principal Accounting Policies
SCISYS PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 69
Principal accounting policies (continued)
indication that an asset may be impaired. If such an indication exists, 
the Group makes a formal estimate of the recoverable amount. Where 
the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount the 
asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable 
amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair 
value less disposal costs and its value in use. It is determined for an 
individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows 
that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of 
assets. 
Impairment losses recognised in respect of cash generating units 
are allocated first to reduce the amount of goodwill allocated to the 
applicable CGUs and then to reduce the carrying amount of the other 
assets on a pro-rata basis. A CGU is the smallest identifiable group of 
assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the 
cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying 
amount of the asset (CGU) is increased to the revised estimate of its 
recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does 
not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined 
had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset (CGU) in prior 
years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised as income 
immediately.
Inventories
Inventories are valued at the lower of purchase or production cost 
and net realisable value. Purchase or production cost is based on 
weighted average values and includes direct costs and attributable 
indirect costs required by the production process. Net realisable 
value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs 
of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and 
distribution.
Financial instruments
Trade and other receivables 
Trade and other receivables are stated at their fair value on initial 
recognition and subsequently at amortised cost, i.e. less any 
impairment losses.
Trade and other payables
Trade and other payables are stated at fair value at initial recognition 
and subsequently at amortised cost.
Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet comprise cash at 
bank and in hand and short-term deposits with an original maturity of 
three months or less. 
Derivative financial instruments 
Derivatives are used by the Group to reduce or eliminate exposure to 
foreign exchange risk. Instruments used include forward exchange 
deals, cylinder options and currency swaps. The Group does not use 
derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments are 
recognised in the Income Statement as they arise.
Provisions 
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation 
as a result of a past event, it is probable that the Group will be required 
to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the 
amount of the obligation. Provisions are measured at the Directors’ 
best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the 
balance sheet date and are discounted to present value if the effect of 
the time value of money is material. 
Employee benefits 
The Group makes provision for employees’ holiday pay. The expected 
cost and associated liability is measured as the additional amount the 
Group expects to pay as a result of the unused entitlement that has 
accumulated at the balance sheet date. 
Share-based payment transactions 
Employees (including Executive Directors) of the Group receive 
remuneration in the form of share-based payment transactions, 
whereby employees render services in exchange for shares or rights 
over shares (‘equity-settled transactions’). 
The fair values of the share option schemes in operation have been 
assessed using Black-Scholes and similar models, as are appropriate 
to each scheme at the date of grant. The fair values of the schemes 
are expensed evenly over the period between grant and vesting to the 
extent expected to vest. Notes (forming part of the financial statements)  
for the year ended 31 December 2017
SCISYS PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 70
In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, management 
has made the following judgements and estimations that have the most 
significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements.
Revenue recognition
The revenue and profit of fixed-price contracts is recognised on a 
percentage of completion basis when the outcome of a contract 
can be reliably estimated. Management exercises judgement in 
determining whether a contract’s outcome can be reliably estimated. 
In addition, management estimates the remaining costs to completion 
of contracts. These are used in determining the percentage of 
completion and the value of amounts recoverable on contracts. 
Using a risk-basis selection, Directors perform an independent review 
of key contracts.
IFRS 15
The next significant change affecting SCISYS will be in 2018, when 
IFRS 15: Revenue from contracts with customers will be adopted. 
Detailed analysis by the SCISYS Board has established that 
implementation of the new standard will have a negligible impact 
on the phasing of anticipated operating profits, although reported 
revenues will be depressed when compared with previously applied 
treatment. The reduction reflects provisions in the standard whereby 
only the mark-up on third-party costs can be recognised as revenue 
on situations where SCISYS acts in the capacity of an Agent, simply 
passing the third-party’s goods and services to customers through 
its books. If IFRS 15 had been applied in 2017, revenues would have 
been £5.5m lower than reported and operating profits would have 
been unaffected. The assessment made by the entity is preliminary as 
not all transition work requirements have been finalised and therefore 
may be subject to adjustment.
Impairment of goodwill
Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis based on 
management’s estimation of the value in use of the cash generating 
units (CGUs) to which the goodwill has been allocated. The value in 
use calculation is dependent on management’s estimate of future cash 
flows expected to arise from the CGU and a suitable discount rate.
Cash flows are based on approved detailed operating budgets for the 
forthcoming year, updated as appropriate, for actual performance 
since the year end. Annual growth rates are based on independent 
research analysts’ market commentaries.
The discount rate represents the weighted average cost of capital of a 
market participant, based on management’s estimate of the following 
input parameters for the capital asset pricing model.
 •   Risk free return: adopted as the yield on 30-year UK Treasury 
Bonds.
 •   Market risk premium: derived from academic research by the 
London Business School.
 •   Beta factor: approximate market participant value is determined 
from statistics quoted by Bloomberg for SCISYS PLC and a 
sample of comparable competitor companies.
 •   Alpha factor: derived from the return on equity applied by the 
Group’s professional advisers.
 •   Gearing: approximate market participant value is determined 
from statistics quoted by Bloomberg for SCISYS PLC and a 
sample of comparable competitor companies.
 •   Cost of debt: based on current borrowing rates from the Group’s 
bankers.
Factors also considered:
 •  Country risk: the Group monitors country risk and carefully 
considers both the level of provisions against such risk and 
whether the risk disclosures provide the market with a clear 
picture of actual and potential exposures,
 •  Forecasting risk: the use of statistics and modelling to determine 
future performance based on current and historical data, taking 
factors such as revenue and economic indicators into account.
The same discount rate has been used for different markets and 
geographies. The Group’s divisions all deal with governments or 
pseudo-government bodies and considers the risk profile of these 
contracts to be broadly comparable. Taken together with euro cash 
flows, the derivation of the discount rate is applicable for the different 
currency flows. A portfolio of multiple contracts allow the groups 
divisions to be treated with the same cost of capital, which reflects the 
Group’s aggregated portfolio risks. The only exception is the discount 
rate used for goodwill impairment testing of the Xibis CGU, which is 
higher than for the other subsidiaries to reflect the higher perceived 
risk attaching to smaller entities. 
 
Capitalisation of development expenditure
Development costs associated with the development of software 
products or enhancements and their related intellectual property 
rights are expensed as incurred until management judges that all 
of the following criteria can be demonstrated, in which case it is 
capitalised as an intangible asset:
 •  The technical feasibility of completing the tangible asset so that 
it will be available for use or sale.
 • An intention to complete the intangible asset and use or sell it.
 • Ability to use or sell the intangible asset.
 •  How the intangible asset will generate probable future economic 
benefits. Among other things, the Group can demonstrate the 
existence of a market for the output of the intangible asset or the 
intangible asset itself or, if it is to be used internally, the usefulness 
of the intangible asset.
 •  The availability of adequate technical, financial and other 
resources to complete the development and to use or sell the 
intangible asset.
 •  An ability to measure reliably the expenditure attributable to the 
intangible asset during its development.

Since 2007 the Board has gauged the underlying performance of business using an adjusted operating profit measure that excludes the costs 
of the Group’s long-term share incentive schemes, exceptional items and any amortisation of intangible assets arising on business acquisition. 
Internal reporting is exclusively based on adjusted performance measures to facilitate comparison between financial years and publicly 
available research notes on SCISYS published by financial analysts focuses on these same measures. 
Contingent consideration payable for the ANNOVA acquisition is linked both to average profitability over a 3-year earn out period and 
achievement of key commercial milestones. ANNOVA outperformed the first-year expectations that were reflected in projected amounts 
payable in the acquisition balance sheet. The anticipated total contingent consideration payable for ANNOVA was reassessed at 31 December 
2017, resulting in the exceptional credit.
Up to and including 2016 R&D tax credits were incorporated into the net tax charge but from 2017 these are to be treated as deductions 
from operating expenses. SCISYS anticipates that it will no longer qualify for the SME tax credit scheme in 2018 as it expects to exceed the 
headcount eligibility threshold so the above-the-line tax credit in the current period is treated as an exceptional item.
The 2016 acquisition costs represent fees paid to professional advisors and statutory charges relating to the acquisition of ANNOVA that do 
not qualify for capitalisation as costs for issuing debt or equity instruments.

The standard rate of tax for the year, based on the UK standard rate of corporation tax is 19.25% (2016: 20.00%). The actual effective tax rate 
for the current year is lower (2016: lower) than this standard rate.
A reduction in the UK corporation tax rate from 20% to 19% (effective from 1 April 2017) and to 18% (effective 1 April 2020) were substantively 
enacted on 26 October 2015, and an additional reduction to 17% (effective 1 April 2020) was substantively enacted on 6 September 2016. 
This will reduce the company’s future current tax charge accordingly. The deferred tax assets and liabilities at 31 December 2017 have been 
calculated based on these rates. Corporate Governance Financial Statements Strategic Report

The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations. The key assumptions for the value in use calculations 
are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs during the period. Management 
estimates discount rates using post-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the 
CGUs. The growth rates are based on industry growth forecasts. Changes in selling prices and direct costs are based on past practices and 
expectations of future changes in the market.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets approved by the management for the forthcoming 
financial year. Anticipated growth rates for contribution and overheads for the subsequent two years are based on current market and business 
forecasts. Cash flows are then assumed to continue to perpetuity with a constant growth rate in contribution or overheads. With the exception 
of Annova and Xibis, annual contribution of the CGUs is assumed to grow at 4.0% (2016: 4%) and central overheads at up to 2% (2016: 2%). 
For Annova the growth rate is 6%. Cash flows are discounted at 10.1% (2016: 10.5%), which the Directors believe to be an appropriate and 
prudent post-tax weighted average cost of capital (WACC) for a market participant in these segments at the year-end date. This corresponds to 
a pre-tax discount rate of 14.7% (2016: 15.3%). The WACCs for each of the Space, Media & Broadcast and Annova CGUs are not considered 
to be materially different due to the comparable nature of their operations and customer bases. For the Xibis CGU, annual contribution is 
assumed to grow at 10% (2016: 10%) and its cash flows are discounted using a post-tax WACC of 11.5% (2016: 10.5%) to reflect the higher 
perceived risk attaching to smaller entities. This corresponds to a pre-tax discount rate of 12.0% (2016: 15.3%).
The basis for the Directors’ estimates of the input parameters for calculating the discount rate is outlined in note 1. To reduce the headroom 
in the impairment calculation to nil a post-tax WACC of 12.9% (2016: 13.9%) would be required for the Space and Media & Broadcast CGUs, 
15.4% for the ANNOVA CGU and 11.5% (2016: 12.0%) for the Xibis CGU. The Annova CGU has been reviewed for impairment for the first time 
in 2017. On the basis of this analysis, the Directors consider that no impairment provision is warranted.
Amortisation is included in the income statement under operating costs.

On 11 September 2015 the Group’s German subsidiary, SCISYS Deutschland GmbH (“SCISYS DE”), acquired 33.3% of ToMM Apps GmbH 
(“ToMM Apps”), a supplier of software development services to SCISYS’ Media & Broadcast division. ToMM Apps was formed in 2014 as a 
university spin-off business in Duisburg, Germany. Trading between group companies and ToMM Apps is outlined in note 33.
In September 2017 SCISYS DE acquired an additional 16.7% of ToMM Apps for €1, increasing its investment to 50%. ToMM Apps will be 
liquidated under German law and the retained earnings distributed to its shareholders by way of dividends. SCISYS DE expects its receipts to 
materially cover the carrying value of its investment.
The following table summarises the financial information of ToMM Apps as included in its own financial statements, adjusted for fair value

The average credit period taken on settlement of sales invoices is 35 days (2016: 36). 
Due to the nature of the Group’s customer base, and in line with previous experience, the Directors consider that the level of irrecoverable 
amounts receivable is negligible. The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates their fair value.

Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash held by the Group and short-term bank deposits with an original maturity of three months or less. The 
carrying value of these assets approximates their fair value.
The Group maintains deposit accounts with a number of banks to suit local operations in Germany. In the UK, sterling and foreign currency 
cash deposit and overdraft facilities for trading operations are provided by two banking groups. The principal bankers operate a facility 
agreement that provides for netting off between deposits and borrowings such that interest is payable or receivable on the net overdrawn or 
credit balance respectively. A second bank provides an online current account with no overdraft facility.

Financial risk and treasury policies 
The Group finance department maintains liquidity, manages relations with the Group’s bankers, identifies and manages foreign exchange 
risk and controls Group treasury operations. Treasury dealings such as investments, borrowings and foreign exchange are conducted only to 
support underlying business transactions. Consequently, the Group does not undertake speculative foreign exchange dealings for which there 
is no underlying exposure.
The Group’s policies for management of the financial risks to which it is exposed are outlined below:
(a) Credit risk
The Group’s principal financial assets are cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables and amounts recoverable on contracts.
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations 
and arises principally from the Group’s receivables from customers and monies on deposit with financial institutions.
The customer base of the Group is primarily government (and quasi-government) agencies and major prime contractors and previous 
experience has indicated that no allowance for doubtful receivables is necessary.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings 
assigned by international credit rating agencies.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk. The Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is represented by 
the carrying value of financial assets, as follows:

9)   an unsecured euro-denominated loan of £7,104,000 drawn down in December 2016 to part fund the acquisition of ANNOVA Systems 
GmbH. The loan is repayable in equal quarterly instalments over 5 years and bears interest at a fixed rate of 2.9% p.a. This loan has 
been offset by £184k of capitalised deal fees;
10 ) two subordinated, euro-denominated loans of £1,598,000 and £622,000 provided as deferred consideration to part fund the   
acquisition of ANNOVA Systems on 31 December 2016. The loans bear interest at a fixed rate of 5% p.a. and are repayable in June 
2019. Interest is payable annually in December.
Loan 2 and the loan notes 8 are subject to annual interest cover and debt service covenants. 
The multicurrency UK bank overdraft facility of £2,500,000 available at the year end is subject to annual review. A covenant limits utilisation of 
the overdraft to 60% of trade receivables under 90 days old, invoiced by SCISYS UK Limited. Interest is payable at 3% over bank base rate or 
currency lending rate as appropriate. In addition, the Group has access to a foreign exchange hedging facility with a maximum exposure limit of 
£500,000. The UK working capital facilities are secured by debentures from SCISYS PLC and SCISYS UK Limited and a first legal charge over 
the Group’s long leasehold property in Bristol.
The Group’s German bankers provide unsecured working capital facilities to cover overdraft and bank guarantee requirements. Total facilities 
comprise a £1,776,000 overdraft (2016: £2,142,000) and £4,884,000 of bank guarantee lines (2016: £5,140,000). At the year end, there were 
no overdraft borrowings (2016: £nil). Utilisation of the bank guarantee facilities was £174,000 (2016: £134,000).

for the year ended 31 December 2017
SCISYS PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 82
(b) Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group’s approach to managing 
liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and 
stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group’s reputation. The Group uses a combination of 
monthly and weekly cash flow forecasts to monitor cash requirements and to optimise its return on investments.
The following are the contractual maturities of financial liabilities.
(c) Market risk
Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as currency rates and interest rates, will affect the Group’s results. The objective of 
market risk management is to manage and control risk to within suitable parameters.
(c) (i) Currency risk
The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk on transactions which are denominated in a currency other than sterling.
A proportion of the Group’s Media & Broadcast division and Annova’s contracts undertaken in Germany with costs in euros generate revenues

In addition, SCISYS Deutschland entered into a series of relatively low-value forward contracts to swap sterling receipts for euros in 2018 
and 2019. The fair value of all foreign exchange contracts that were outstanding at 31 December 2017 was an asset of £4,000  (2016: liability 
£325,000), reflected as a £nil liability (2016: £333,000) in trade and other payables and an £4,000 asset (2016: £8,000)  reflected in trade and

in sterling. This creates a natural hedge against UK-based Space division contracts denominated in euros for which costs are incurred in 
sterling. The main net currency risk for such contracts lies in the period between tender and signature of contract during which it is impractical 
to enter into committed forward foreign exchange contracts. In order to mitigate this risk, the Group’s policy is to take out euro/sterling currency 
hedging agreements to cover anticipated invoicing under existing and tendered contracts up to 18 months in the future. 
Sensitivity analysis
It is estimated that, with all other variables held equal, a change of one cent in the value of the euro against sterling would have a £38,000 
impact on the Group’s operating profit for the year ended 31 December 2017. The method of estimation, consistently applied, involves 
assessing the transaction impact of euro cash flows and the translation impact of euro profits.
It is estimated that, with all other variables held equal, a change of one cent in the value of the US dollar against sterling would have a £1,000 
impact on the Group’s operating profit for the year ended 31 December 2017. The method of estimation, consistently applied, involves 
assessing the transaction impact of dollar cash flows and the translation impact of dollar profits.
Currency hedging contracts are taken out to coincide with quarter end dates. Depending on the exchange rate of the euro at the time cash 
is received from a customer compared to the forward rates, the Group may enter into currency swaps to transfer any currency receipts into 
sterling, thereby saving sterling overdraft interest, until such time as the currency is needed to fulfil a particular forward contract at the end of 
the quarter. The Group has investments in German operations. As a result, the Group’s sterling income statement and balance sheet can be 
affected by movements in the euro/sterling exchange rates.
(c) (ii) Interest rate risk
The Group does not undertake any hedging activity in this area.
Cash deposits in sterling and foreign currencies are made at prevailing interest rates. Where rates are fixed, the fixed interest period is 
generally no more than 3 months.

(d) Capital risk management
The Group’s objective when managing share capital is to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide 
returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure. In order to maintain or adjust the 
capital structure, the Group may adjust the dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders or issue new shares.

The following summarises the significant methods and assumptions used in estimating the fair values of financial instruments reflected in the 
table above.
Derivatives
Foreign currency derivatives are valued at the year-end date on a mark-to-market basis.
Loans
For periods of fixed interest rates on outstanding loans, savings in interest compared with the application of market interest rates are 
discounted at the post-tax risk-free discount rate to derive the gain in fair value over carrying value.

For receivables/payables due after more than one year, the notional value is discounted at the post-tax weighted average cost of capital to 
reflect the fair value.
Fair value hierarchy
The Group’s financial instruments measured at fair value, fit with the following fair value hierarchy:
 •  Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1).
 •  Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly (Level 2).
 •  Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (Level 3).
The following tables illustrate the Group’s net financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value at 31 December 2017 and 31 December 
2016:
Level 1 financial instruments
The fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets (commodity futures) is based on quoted market prices at the period end date. 
A market is regarded as active if quoted prices are readily and regularly available from an exchange, dealer, broker, industry group, pricing 
services or regulatory agency, and those prices represent actual and regularly occurring market transactions on an arm’s length. The Group 
has no Level 1 financial instruments.
Level 2 financial instruments
The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market (forward foreign exchange contracts) are determined by using 
valuation techniques. These valuation techniques maximise the use of observable market data where it is available and rely as little as 
possible on entity-specific estimates.
The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts are calculated at the present value of the future cash flows based on observable inputs 
drawn from a reputable third-party source.
Level 3 financial instruments
The fair value of financial instruments is based on unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity at the statement of 
financial position dates. These inputs generally reflect the Group’s own assumptions about how a market participant would reasonably be 
expected to determine the price of a financial instrument. Notes (forming part of the financial statements)

Deferred consideration The expected payment reflects the calculated cash

The basis for the Directors’ estimates of the input parameters for

Exchange rate estimate of the input parameter of  1.2 Euros:

The deferred consideration is dependent on the EBITDA generated 
by ANNOVA over the period 2016 to 2018. The Directors have 
based their assessment of forecast EBITDA on projections 
provided by ANNOVA management, adjusted to reflect levels 
of risk contingency consistent with those used for other Group 
companies. 
Forward exchange contracts Fair value is estimated from the difference between the 
contractual forward price and the current forward price

Fair value is calculated based on the present value of 
future principal and interest cash flows, discounted at 
the market rate of interest at the balance sheet date.
For deferred consideration, in evaluating the significance of fair value inputs, the Group generally classifies assets or liabilities as Level 3 when 
their fair value is determined using unobservable inputs that individually, or when aggregated with other unobservable inputs, represent more 
than 10% of the fair value of the observable inputs of the assets or liabilities.
There have been no transfers between levels in the year (2016: no transfers in either direction).
Reconciliation of Level 3 fair value:
It is the Group’s policy to recognise all the transfers into the levels at the end of the reporting period.

The deferred tax is disclosed as follows:
The following are the major deferred tax liabilities recognised by the Group and movements thereon during the current and prior reporting period:
Unused tax losses for which no deferred tax asset has been recognised are £4,417,000 (2016: £4,417,000), giving rise to a potential deferred 
tax asset of £751,000 (2016: £751,000). Furthermore, there is an unrecognised deferred tax asset in respect of excess management expenses, 
deductible temporary differences and capital allowances of £1,902,000 (2016: £1,468,000). The total deferred tax asset not recognised, 
computed at the applicable rate of 17% is £2,653,000 (2016: £2,219,000).

Trade payables and accruals principally comprise amounts outstanding for trade purchases and ongoing costs. The average credit period 
taken for trade purchases is 39 days (2016: 40 days). Whilst the typical credit terms from suppliers require payment within 30 days, a significant 
proportion of costs for goods and third-party services in Germany are on longer contractual credit terms of between 60 and 180 days. The 
Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade payables approximates to their fair value.
The provisions represent  future charges on long-term, fixed-price customer contracts where liabilities are uncertain in either, or both, timing 
and amount. Values reflect management’s best estimate of expenditure required to settle present obligations, discounted to the balance sheet 
value using a risk-free pre-tax discount rate.

28  Acquisition of subsidiary
On 31 December 2016, the Group acquired 100% of the issued share capital of Annova Systems GmbH (”ANNOVA”) for a consideration of 
£12,878,000. ANNOVA is a leading supplier of editorial solutions for the media sector. It has a well-established customer base and a robust 
business model based on its mature OpenMedia software solution, which provides newsroom system functionality across all media segments, 
including television, radio and online solutions. This transaction has been accounted for by the purchase method of accounting. 
Fair value adjustments have been made to the acquisition balance sheet of ANNOVA to reflect the recognition of intangible assets on 
acquisition and re-measurement of amounts recoverable on contracts in accordance with the Group’s accounting policies. Intangible assets 
reflect the fair values of the ANNOVA order book at 31 December 2016 and of ANNOVA’s proprietary software solution, OpenMedia. The 
fair value of the acquired order book represents the net present value of the projected net after-tax cashflows arising from unfulfilled orders. 
Cashflows were discounted at 10.5%, which was the prevailing discount rate at the acquisition date. The fair value of the software solution 
represents the depreciated replacement cost of an asset if someone were to create it from scratch. Further information on these assets is 
provided in note 14.
The goodwill arising on the acquisition of ANNOVA is attributable to the synergies achievable from the integration of the acquired business 
The Group holds a stock of Treasury shares to satisfy maturing employee share options and to provide the trustees of the SCISYS SIP with a 
contingent source of supply of SCISYS PLC shares in illiquid market conditions. If the trustees are unable to acquire sufficient shares in the 
market with funds from employees’ monthly payroll deductions, the trustees purchase the shortfall from treasury at the prevailing market price. 
The own shares held are deducted from retained earnings. 
Other reserves
The Share Premium Account was created when the Group issued free shares to employees in 2009. It has been subsequently increased when 
new shares have been issued to satisfy maturing employee share options. The Merger Reserve reflects the difference between the nominal 
value and agreed consideration value of shares issued as part consideration for the acquisition of SCISYS DE in 2007.
The Capital Redemption Reserve arises when the Company redeems shares wholly out of distributable profits. The Translation Reserve 
comprises all foreign exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial statements of non-UK subsidiaries.
The Company has only one class of ordinary shares that carry no right to fixed income. 
Shares issued during the year principally represented part-payment of deferred consideration relating to the ANNOVA Systems GmbH 
acquisition on 31 December 2016. The balance of shares were issued to satisfy maturing employee share options when there was an 
insufficient stock of Treasury shares available for the purpose.

29  Operating lease arrangements
At the balance sheet date, the Group had outstanding commitments for future minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating 
leases, which fall due as follows:
 2017 2016
£’000 £’000
Minimum lease payments under operating leases recognised as an expense in the year 331 260 
Minimum sub-lease payments received during the year recognised as income in the year 313 293 
28  Acquisition of subsidiary (continued)
with the rest of the SCISYS Group operations. These include the benefits of increased resilience from diversification into the wider media 
& broadcast sector, extension of delivery capability into new technologies and cross selling opportunities for related services and products 
into the broadened, overlapping customer base. In addition, SCISYS’ mature infrastructure will provide a more stable platform to support 
ANNOVA’s geographical expansion plans.
The deferred payments comprise incremental earn-out payments capped at €16,480,000 (£14,117,000) in total, calculated by reference to 
multiples of between 8.5 and 10.5 times ANNOVA’s average EBITDA performance for the financial years to 31 December 2016, 2017 and 2018 
less, in each case, an amount equal to €12,500,000 (£10,708,000) plus aggregate earn-out payments already paid at the relevant point in time. 
All of the earn-out payments are conditional on the achievement of certain key commercial milestones in respect of the BBC Contract and are 
payable in cash or newly issued SCISYS PLC ordinary shares. The extent to which the total consideration may be satisfied in new shares is 
subject to a maximum upper limit of 24 per cent.
The fair value of contingent consideration reflects management forecasts for EBITDA achievement over the earnout period, capitalised by 
the relevant multiples, with the cash flows being risk-adjusted and discounted at the Group’s prevailing discount rate of 10.5%. This takes into 
account the associated risks on average to all the Groups’ security holders to finance its assets. 
ANNOVA has contributed to the revenues and profits after tax of the Group in 2017. 
At the balance sheet date, the Group expected to receive future minimum lease payments under non-cancellable sub-leases as follows:
2017 2016
 £’000 £’000
Within one year 1,418 1,160 
In second to fifth years inclusive 2,067 2,501

6,642 6,603 
2017 2016
 £’000 £’000
Total minimum sub-lease payments receivable 553 162 
Operating lease payments primarily represent rentals payable by the Group for certain of its office properties. Leases are typically negotiated 
for a minimum lease term of 3 to 5 years with rent reviews coinciding with the renewal dates. The balance of rentals payable are for operating 
leases on office equipment. Lease income is received from tenants of the Group’s office properties and is shown in revenue in the Income 
Statement.
30  Share-based payment charges
The Group operates a number of share options plans as set out below. The fair values of these schemes have been assessed using the Black-
Scholes model, as appropriate to the scheme at the date of grant. The fair values of the schemes are expensed over the period between grant 
and vesting. Charges for share-based payments under IFRS 2 have been recognised only for issues that were made after 7 November 2002 
and had not vested at the transition date as prescribed by IFRS 2 for first-time adoption.
Enterprise Management Incentives (EMI) scheme 
The Group established an EMI scheme in April 2007 to incentivise and aid retention of key employees. EMI share options are exercisable at 
a price equal to the quoted mid-price of SCISYS PLC’s shares on the dealing day last preceding the date of grant. The vesting period for the 
options is three years. There are various performance conditions attaching to the EMI share option grants, including EPS related conditions.  Notes (forming part of the financial statements)

Company Share Option Plan (CSOP)
The Group introduced an HMRC approved CSOP scheme in January 2009 to incentivise and aid retention of key employees following changes in 
tax legislation which discontinued the favourable tax treatment for employees in the EMI scheme. CSOP share options are exercisable at a price 
equal to the quoted mid-price of SCISYS PLC’s shares on the dealing day last preceding the date of grant. The vesting period for the options is 
three years. There are various performance conditions attaching to the CSOP share option grants, including EPS related conditions. If the CSOP 
share options remain unexercised after a period of 10 years from the date of grant, the CSOP share options expire. CSOP share options are 
forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before the options vest. The credit recognised in the year was £nil (2016: £8,000).
Unapproved share options 
Those Group employees subject to German payroll tax are unable to benefit from the favourable tax treatment available to UK employees 
through the EMI and CSOP schemes. To incentivise and aid retention of these key employees, they were awarded unapproved share options. 
The unapproved share options are exercisable at a price equal to the quoted mid-price of SCISYS PLC’s shares on the dealing day last 
preceding the date of grant. 
 
The vesting period for the options is three years. There are various performance conditions attaching to the unapproved share option grants, 
including EPS related conditions. If the unapproved share options remain unexercised after a period of 10 years from the date of grant, the 
options expire. Unapproved share options are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before the options vest. The credit recognised in the

The Group results include those of the SCISYS Share Incentive Plan.
SCISYS Share Incentive Plan (SIP)
The SCISYS PLC shares held in the SIP on behalf of SCISYS Group employees comprise Partnership Shares and Free Shares. Partnership 
shares are purchased by employees under an HMRC approved plan from monthly payroll deductions. The Free Shares were issued by the 
Group in October 2009. The SIP is consolidated into the results of both the Group and the Company to the extent that the shareholding relates 
to the Free Shares in accordance with the principles of IAS 32 and the cost of the Free Shares is deducted from equity.
Administrative costs, such as stamp duty, dealing commission and legal fees, are borne by the Group. All costs are accounted for as they 
accrue.
 
32  Pensions
The Group operates a defined contribution group personal pension plan in the United Kingdom. The pension charge for the year, which 
represents contributions payable by the Group to these schemes together with the cost of retirement provision outside the United Kingdom, 
amounted to £907,000 (2016: £847,000). The balance of outstanding payments at 31 December 2017 was £154,000 (2016:£139,000).
33   Related party transactions
Transactions between the Company and its subsidiaries, which are related parties, have been eliminated on consolidation and are not

1  Significant accounting policies
The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in 
dealing with items which are considered material in relation to the 
financial statements, except as noted below.
Basis of preparation
These financial statements were prepared in accordance with 
Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework 
(“FRS 101”). The amendments to FRS 101 (2014/15 Cycle) issued in 
July 2015 and effective immediately have been applied.
In preparing these financial statements, the Company applies 
the recognition, measurement and disclosure requirements of 
International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU 
(“Adopted IFRSs”), but makes amendments where necessary in order 
to comply with Companies Act 2006 and has set out below where 
advantage of the FRS 101 disclosure exemptions has been taken. 
Under section s408 of the Companies Act 2006 the company is 
exempt from the requirement to present its own profit and loss 
account. 
In these financial statements, the company has applied the 
exemptions available under FRS 101 in respect of the following 
disclosures:  
 • A Cash Flow Statement and related notes; 
 •  Comparative period reconciliations for share capital and 
tangible fixed assets; 
 •   Disclosures in respect of transactions with wholly owned 
subsidiaries; 
 • Disclosures in respect of capital management;  
 • The effects of new but not yet effective IFRSs; and
 •  Disclosures in respect of the compensation of Key Management 
Personnel.
As the consolidated financial statements include the equivalent 
disclosures, the Company has also taken the exemptions under 
FRS 101 available in respect of the following disclosures:
 •  IFRS 2 Share Based Payments in respect of group settled 
share-based payments.
 • IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement.
 • IFRS 7 Financial Instrument.
The Company proposes to continue to adopt the reduced disclosure 
framework of FRS 101 in its next financial statements. 
The accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, 
been applied consistently to all periods presented in these financial 
statements.
Investments
Fixed asset investments in subsidiaries are shown at cost less 
provision for impairment.
Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated 
depreciation and any impairment in value. Depreciation is calculated 
on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset as 
follows:  
Freehold land   Not depreciated
Freehold buildings   50 years
Computer equipment   2 to 7 years
Share-based payment transactions
Employees (including Executive Directors) of the Company receive 
remuneration in the form of share-based payment transactions, 
whereby employees render services in exchange for shares or rights 
over shares (‘equity-settled transactions’). 
The fair values of the share option schemes in operation have been 
assessed using the Black-Scholes model, as appropriate to each 
scheme at the date of grant. The fair values of the schemes are 
expensed evenly over the period between grant and vesting. 
Where share options and free issue shares are provided to 
employees of the Company’s subsidiaries, the IFRS 2 charge is 
added to the carrying value of the investment in subsidiaries and 
recycled in equity. Recharges to subsidiaries by the Company which 
are clearly linked to the share based payment are considered to be 
capital transactions and are deducted from the cost of investment in 
the subsidiaries.
Employee share schemes/Own shares held
Own shares held in the SCISYS Share Incentive Plan (the SIP) to the 
extent relating to the issue of free shares in October 2009 are treated 
as being those of the Company and are therefore reflected in the 
Company financial statements as follows:
•  Other assets and liabilities of the SIP are recognised as the assets 
and liabilities of the Company;
•  Consideration paid or received for the purchase or sale of 
the Company’s own shares are shown in the reconciliation of 
movements in shareholders’ funds;
•  Finance costs and any administration expenses of the SIP are 
charged as they accrue;
•  Dividends on the free shares held in the SIP are paid to the 
employee owners.
The SIP has been aggregated with the results of the Company only to 
the extent that the underlying assets relate to the free share award in 
October 2009.  A further explanation is provided in note 12.
Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the exchange rate 
ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the year-end 
exchange rate and gains or losses on translation are included in the 
profit and loss account.

The Company’s loans at the year end consist of: 
 1)  a term loan of £1,530,000, being the balance remaining on a 5-year term loan of £2,450,000 taken out in May 2011 as part finance 
for the freehold purchase of the Group’s Chippenham headquarters, on which the loan is secured. Repayment is by equal monthly 
instalments on the basis of a 15-year notional term. The loan was renewed for a further 5 years in May 2016 with no variation in terms. 
Interest is payable monthly at 3.0% p.a. above LIBOR;
 2)  an unsecured director’s loan of £500,000 drawn down in May 2011 as part finance for the freehold purchase of the Group’s headquarters 
in Chippenham. Repayment is due on or before 23 May 2020. Interest is payable 6 monthly at 5.25% p.a. above bank base rate; 
 3)  a term loan of £200,000, being the balance remaining on a £1,200,000 drawn down in December 2014 to support the acquisition of 
Xibis Limited. The loan is repayable in equal monthly instalments until March 2018 and is secured by debentures granted by all three UK 
Group companies and a first legal charge over the Group’s long leasehold property in Bristol. Interest is payable quarterly at 2.5% p.a. 
above LIBOR; and
 4)  loan notes of £1,532,000, being the first tranche of notes issued under a £5 million loan note programme in December 2016 to part fund 
the acquisition of Annova Systems GmbH. The notes are repayable on the 3rd anniversary of the issue date and have second-ranking 
security behind the senior debt providers. Interest is payable quarterly at a fixed rate of 7.0% p.a..
Financial covenants attaching to loan 1 and loan notes 4 above are outlined in note 21 of the Group financial statements
Borrowings are repayable as follows:
The Company has only one class of ordinary shares which carry no right to fixed income. 
Shares issued during the year principally represented part-payment of deferred consideration relating to the ANNOVA Systems GmbH 
acquisition on 31 December 2016. The balance of shares were issued to satisfy maturing employee share options when there was an 
insufficient stock of Treasury shares available for the purpose.
The new shares issued during 2009 were awarded free of charge to Group employees and are held in trust for the employees in the SCISYS 
Share Incentive Plan (SIP). The SIP purchased the shares with funds gifted to it by the Company’s subsidiary, SCISYS UK Limited. SCISYS 
PLC is regarded as the grantor of an equity settled share based payment arrangement to the subsidiary’s employee beneficiaries. The 
provision of funds by SCISYS UK Limited is treated as a clearly linked recharge and is deducted from the cost of investment in the subsidiary.

9 Called-up share capital (continued)
The Company holds a stock of treasury shares to satisfy maturing employee share options and to provide the trustees of the SCISYS SIP with 
a contingent source of supply of SCISYS PLC shares in illiquid market conditions. If the trustees are unable to acquire sufficient shares in the 
market with the funds from employees’ monthly payroll deductions, the trustees purchase the shortfall from treasury at the prevailing market 
price. The own shares held are deducted from retained earnings.
Other reserves
The Share Premium Account was created when the Group issued free shares to employees in 2009. It has been subsequently increased when 
new shares have been issued to satisfy maturing employee share options.
The Merger Reserve reflects the difference between the nominal value and agreed consideration value of shares issued as part consideration 
for the acquisition of SCISYS DE in 2007.
The Capital Redemption Reserve arises when the Company redeems shares wholly out of distributable profits.
10 Contingent liabilities
The Company has given an unlimited bank guarantee in respect of its UK subsidiary company, SCISYS UK Limited. At 31 December 2017 the 
gross borrowings of this company were £nil (2016: £nil). 
The Company operates a number of share options plans and a free share scheme as set out below. The fair values of these schemes have 
been assessed using the Black-Scholes model, as appropriate to the scheme at the date of grant. The fair values of the schemes are expensed 
over the period between grant and vesting. Charges for share–based payments under IFRS 2 have been recognised only for issues that were 
made after 7 November 2002 and had not vested at the transition date as prescribed by IFRS 2 for first-time adoption.
Enterprise Management Incentives (EMI) scheme
The group established an EMI scheme in April 2007 to incentivise and aid retention of key employees. EMI share options are exercisable at 
a price equal to the quoted mid-price of SCISYS PLC’s shares on the dealing day last preceding the date of grant. The vesting period for the 
options is three years. There are various performance conditions attaching to the EMI share option grants, including EPS related conditions. 
If the EMI share options remain unexercised after a period of 10 years from the date of grant, the EMI share options expire. EMI share options 
are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before the options vest.
The charge recognised in the year was £nil (2016: £nil). The number of EMI options relating to SCISYS PLC employees at the year end was as 
follows:
11 Share-based payment charges

options

Exercised during the period (16,889) £0.463 £0.463
Outstanding at 31 December 2017 -  -  -  
Company Share Option Plan (CSOP)
The Group introduced an HMRC approved CSOP scheme in January 2009 to incentivise and aid retention of key employees following changes 
in tax legislation which discontinued the favourable tax treatment for employees in the EMI scheme. CSOP share options are exercisable at 
a price equal to the quoted mid-price of SCISYS PLC’s shares on the dealing day last preceding the date of grant. The vesting period for the 
options is three years. There are various performance conditions attaching to the CSOP share option grants, including EPS related conditions. 
If the CSOP share options remain unexercised after a period of 10 years from the date of grant, the CSOP share options expire. CSOP share 
options are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before the options vest.

Unapproved Share Options
Those Company employees subject to German payroll tax are unable to benefit from the favourable tax treatment available to UK employees 
through the EMI and CSOP schemes. To incentivise and aid retention of these key employees, they were awarded unapproved share options. 
The unapproved share options are exercisable at a price equal to the quoted mid-price of SCISYS PLC’s shares on the dealing day last preceding 
the date of grant. The vesting period for the options is three years. There are various performance conditions attaching to the unapproved share 
option grants, including EPS related conditions. If the unapproved share options remain unexercised after a period of 10 years from the date of 
grant, the options expire. Unapproved share options are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before the options vest.
The charge recognised in the year was £1,000 (2016: credit £1,000). The number of unapproved share options relating to SCISYS PLC employees
