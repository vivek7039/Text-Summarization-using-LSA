Dairy Crest Group plc 
Annual Report 2017
GROWING
  Dairy Crest is a leading British dairy company.
We have a well-established strategy, a clear 
vision, robust values and great people.
The company’s success is driven by a strong portfolio of market 
leading brands including Cathedral City cheese, Clover dairy 
spread, Country Life butter and Frylight, the original one calorie 
cooking spray.
The year ended 31 March 2017 marked a new chapter in our 
history as we started production of two functional ingredients, 
demineralised whey powder and galacto-oligosaccharide (‘GOS’)  
at our Davidstow facility. This brings exciting new opportunities  
in the high growth global infant formula market.
We strive constantly to innovate, bringing new products to market 
and introducing new ways of working across the business.
Our success has been built on our links to the countryside, our 
dairy heritage and our people and we continue to ensure we are 
setting the standard for responsible business practice.
Dairy Crest is very well positioned for profitable and sustainable 
growth in our added value and branded markets.

Dairy Crest produces and markets Cathedral City, the UK’s leading 
cheese brand, and the premium Davidstow cheddar brand. Our 
world-class supply chain starts with milk supplied by 360 farmers in 
the dairying heartlands of Cornwall and Devon. This top quality milk 
is made into cheddar cheese at our highly-automated creamery 
in Davidstow, Cornwall. The cheese then matures for on average 
nearly a year at our purpose-built Nuneaton facility before being cut, 
packed and distributed. We have a second packing site in Frome, 
Somerset, for more complex and innovative packaging.
 Whey is a by-product of the cheese making process. Our  
new facility at Davidstow produces demineralised whey and 
galacto-oligosaccharide (‘GOS’), a lactose based prebiotic, which 
are both ingredients for infant formula, a high-growth, high-margin 
global market.

Key performance indicators and performance 
in the year ended 31 march 2017 8 Dairy Crest Annual Report 2017
CHAirmAn’S STATemenT
r eview of the year
This year we have delivered a set of results which demonstrate 
the underlying robustness of our business. Adjusted profit before 
tax has increased by 5% to £60.6 million and profit margins have 
increased to 16.4%. This performance has been delivered despite 
a highly volatile background in global dairy markets. 
In the first half of the year, milk volumes were strong across 
the UK and falling milk and cream prices reflected this. However, 
after two years of pronounced deflation, UK and global dairy 
markets strengthened in the second half of the year as supply fell. 
In this environment, we increased the price we pay our farmers for 
milk by 38% between the summer of 2016 and March 2017. The 
impact on cream prices was even more pronounced and butter 
input costs doubled in the second half of 2016.
Despite this background, we increased profits and delivered 
a strong branded performance, especially across our butters, 
spreads and oils portfolio. Furthermore, 2016/17 saw the start 
of demineralised whey and GOS production at our Davidstow 
creamery. Sales of functional ingredients represent an important 
future growth opportunity for the business. 
Developing brands
Developing brands is at the heart of our business and 2016/17 
saw good progress across our portfolio. Cathedral City, Clover 
and Frylight have each benefited from refreshed packaging during 
the last 12 months and the level of overall marketing activity was 
increased compared to the prior year. We aired two new TV 
advertisements for Cathedral City and Frylight and supported 
a significant programme of consumer-facing and in-store 
advertising, and promotional activity across our key brands.
innovation at the core 
I am delighted that our success in innovation and product 
development was recognised this year. Clover won the spreads 
category ‘Product of the Year 2017’ award in the world’s largest 
consumer survey award for product innovation. This is testimony 
to the work undertaken to remove all artificial ingredients from the 
recipe. Furthermore, in October 2016 Frylight won the Institute of 
Grocery and Distribution ‘Health and Wellness’ award. 
Innovation is critical in order to continue to grow our business 
and 13% of the Group’s revenue in 2016/17 resulted from products 
that are less than three years old. This is well ahead of the 10% 
target we set ourselves. 
Value-added ingredients
We have now completed our investment at our cheese creamery 
at Davidstow, Cornwall. We are producing demineralised whey, 
an added value by-product of the cheese-making process. 
Demineralised whey is the base ingredient for infant formula and 
by March 2017 over 80% of production was meeting the exacting 
standards required for use in infant formula recipes. 
Furthermore, we have also started manufacturing GOS at 
Davidstow. GOS is a prebiotic which is added into premium infant 
formula to help aid digestion and growth in babies. 
Both of these products are being marketed and sold into 
global infant formula manufacturers by our partner, Fonterra. We 
also continue to research other potential applications for GOS in 
both human nutrition and animal feed. In December 2016 Dairy 
Crest announced that it had entered into a research partnership 
with Danisco Animal Nutrition, part of DuPont, to explore further 
the potential uses of GOS in poultry and swine. If successful, this 
work would help to broaden the potential market for GOS beyond 
infant formula.
our culture and values
Our success has been built on our links to the countryside, 
our dairy heritage and the people in our business. From this 
foundation we will grow through a shared passion to create 
exceptional food, loved by every generation.
Dairy Crest remains committed to doing the right thing in the 
way we conduct ourselves and do business. Following the sale of 
the Dairies business, we have refined our corporate responsibility 
agenda into 14 new pledges. These pledges set demanding 
targets across areas such as environmental impact, employee 
safety, diversity and development, delivering to our consumers 
and contributing to the communities in which we operate. We will 
measure ourselves against these pledges and report on progress 
annually.
increased dividend recommended
The Board is recommending a final dividend of 16.3 pence per 
share, making a full year dividend of 22.5 pence per share. In 
line with our progressive dividend policy, this is a 1.9% increase 
on last year. The dividend is covered 1.6 times by adjusted basic 
earnings per share. A key part of our strategy remains to continue 
to increase dividends each year, aiming for a target cover range of 
1.5 to 2.5 times.
Summary
Our performance this year is not only a result of the Group’s long-
term strategy but also a reflection of the significant contribution 
and dedication of all of our employees, for which I would like to 
thank them.
The Board remains confident in the future prospects for Dairy 
Crest. The business has a strong management team who are 
delivering against a clear business strategy of building brands,

Highlights
Summary: margin improvement despite deflation
Dairy Crest has implemented significant changes during the last 
two years. We are a much leaner, more focused organisation that 
makes predominantly branded and high value-added products. 
This allows management and the business to focus on those 
areas that will drive long-term value creation: innovation, brand 
building, efficiency improvements and cost reduction. 
I am particularly pleased that overall margins in the business 
have improved. This is despite the difficult input cost environment 
and the longer than expected commissioning period of the new 
functional ingredients facility at Davidstow. The strength of our 
brands, our well-invested supply chain and the quality of our 
people all ensure that the Company is well positioned for the 
future. This will help us to maintain our strong track record of 
rewarding shareholders with higher dividends.
market background: the return of inflation
We are a major UK buyer of milk and last year we purchased 
around 500 million litres. The past year has seen a turning 
point in dairy prices. After a prolonged period of deflation, dairy 
commodity prices have experienced strong gains. Low milk prices 
had an effect on milk volumes. They were down in most large milk 
producing countries across the world. Consequently milk prices 
rose. During the course of the year we have increased the price 
we pay farmers for milk by 38% to 30 pence per litre. Since then 
we have announced a 1 pence per litre reduction from June and a 
further 1 pence per litre reduction from July. We pay our farmers 
a fair, competitive price for their milk and our price remains one of 
the highest in the country.
However these inflationary forces do take time to work their 
way through to the prices that consumers see in the shops. In 
the first nine months of the financial year cheese retail prices fell 
or remained stable. Since Christmas, however, we have seen 
evidence of prices increasing on shelf. 
Butter has been even more affected than cheese. Cream 
prices, which determine the input costs for butter, more than 
doubled during the year. Inevitably this has impacted margins in 
our butters, spreads and oils business.
Managing volatility is a challenge for both us and food retailers, 
our principal customers. For this reason we continue to work with 
our customers to help to grow our categories through innovation, 
marketing and category merchandising.
Key brands perform robustly
Overall revenues from our four key brands were down 6%. This 
is in line with our expectations. Most of this decline was due to 
the deflationary market place that we experienced for over three 
quarters of the year. Key brand volumes were flat across the year. 
Volume growth in Frylight, Clover and Country Life spreadable was 
offset by declines in Country Life block butter, which we promoted 
less, and Cathedral City. However, as predicted, the latter made 
good progress in the second half of the year, with a return to 
volume growth.
Cheese
IRI data for the 52 weeks ended 25 March 2017 shows that the 
total cheese market grew by 3% in volume but was unchanged 
in value terms. Within this the everyday cheese market grew 
by 2% in volume but fell by 3% in value, a deflation of 5%. For 
much of the year there were high levels of cheese stocks in the 
market. In order to maintain the brand’s premium positioning 
within the category we decided against discounting aggressively. 
Consequently, Cathedral City slightly underperformed this market 
growth, with volumes down 3% for the year. However volumes 
improved in the second half and this positive momentum has 
continued into 2017/18.

During the year we redesigned the pack to emphasise its ‘no 
artificial ingredients’ credentials and this was highlighted in well 
received TV advertising in the fourth quarter. This advertising has 
driven increased growth during the final quarter with market share 
climbing to 15% and the brand will be advertised again in the first 
quarter of this year. We were delighted that during the year Frylight 
received the Institute of Grocery and Distribution (IGD) ‘Health and 
Wellness’ product award.
infant formula quality improvement
The quality targets for infant formula grade demineralised whey  
are rightly demanding. During the year we have continually 
improved our product so that by the year end we had met our 
target of 80% of our demineralised whey being of infant formula 
grade. The feedback we have received from customers so far on 
the quality of our product has been very positive. In partnership 
with Fonterra we are building our sales relationships with infant 
formula producers for both GOS and demineralised whey and 
expect strong growth in sales of these products during the coming 
year, with the majority of this growth coming in the second half of 
the year.
Long-term demand for proteins looks robust. Whey protein 
concentrate prices have risen strongly in the second half and 
demineralised whey prices are now starting to firm. We are well 
positioned to deliver improved returns in 2017/18.
An important part of the long-term future for GOS is its 
potential beyond the infant formula market, to extend its use into 
other areas such as animal and adult nutrition. The research and 
development programme for GOS in animals has broadened 
and during the year we signed an agreement with Danisco 
Animal Nutrition, part of DuPont. Trials are now underway in this 
partnership that will provide an extensive level of research into the 
benefits of GOS in the animal husbandry industry.
innovation 
The retained business is much more focused following the sale 
of the Dairies business. The pace of innovation is, and needs 
to be, an important point of difference. Future growth will be 
underpinned by innovation. 
Our Innovation Centre on the Harper Adams University 
campus, which opened in late 2015, is already helping to drive our 
ambitious target of 10% of sales each year coming from innovation 
in the previous three years. This year, helped by the re-launch of 
Clover with ‘no artificial ingredients’, we achieved 13% of sales 
from innovation during the last three years. This is an industry-
leading level of innovation.
CHIEF ExECUTIVE’S REVIEW CONTINUED
Cathedral City remains the nation’s favourite cheese brand. It 
accounts for 54% of total branded everyday cheese sales in the 
UK and almost three fifths of households bought Cathedral City 
during the past year.
Earlier in the year we successfully rolled out a refreshed 
master brand identity for Cathedral City. The new design simplifies 
the brand, improves visibility on shelf and strengthens our range. 
This allows our brand investment to work better across the whole 
of the growing cheese category. It was supported by significant 
investment including a successful new TV advertisement, ‘The 
Rules of Cheese’. We have seen a positive consumer reaction 
both to the new packaging and the marketing campaign. 
Spreads and butters 
IRI total market data for the 52 weeks ended 25 March 2017 
shows that butter volumes grew by 2% but that spreads volumes 
declined by 7%. Selling prices for spreads were down very slightly 
for the year and for butters were up slightly. However, for butter 
this full year number masks the change from heavy deflation in the 
first part of the year to price increases of 16% in the last quarter.
Our main spreads brand, Clover, had a very successful year, 
growing volumes at 1% versus a significant market decline, partly 
driven by increased promotional volumes. Our other smaller 
spreads brands, Utterly Butterly, Vitalite and Willow also performed 
well and our total volume growth in spreads, including Clover, was 
4%, 11 percentage points better than the market. This means that 
our overall spreads market share has climbed by 2 percentage 
points to 27.2%.
With Clover we continued to reinforce the ‘no artificial ingredients’ 
positioning through a marketing campaign in the first half of the year 
and launched new packaging in the second half of the year. We were 
pleased that the ‘no artificial ingredients’ recipe received external 
recognition as ‘Product of the Year 2017’ in the spreads category in 
the world’s largest consumer survey award for product innovation.
Whilst Country Life overall volumes were flat for the year, sales 
were up 2%. Country Life spreadable, which accounts for 65% of 
brand sales, grew volumes by 6% and was the best performing 
major branded spreadable product over the year. However the 
block product experienced a volume decline as we promoted less 
following the sharp rises in input costs.
Frylight: another exceptional year
Frylight, our one calorie cooking spray, has had another outstanding 
year. Volumes grew by 23% and sales by 19%, well ahead of market 
growth of 1% and 2% respectively (Kantar data for the 52 weeks 
ended 26 March 2017). Frylight has strengthened its lead as the 
UK’s number one oil brand and increased its share of the market for 
the whole year to 11%, with a household penetration rate of 23%.  Dairy Crest Annual Report 2017 11
Strategic report
GROWING
 
Innovation continues to drive our business forward. As well as 
building on the success of the new Clover product, in the year 
ended 31 March 2017, we:
•	 brought a new Frylight product to market – avocado spray oil;
•	 developed a new Frylight cap design to be launched in early 
2017/18;
•	 launched a new Cathedral City snack bar range;
•	 re-launched the Cathedral City spreadable range; 
•	 strengthened our ‘dairy free’ Vitalite range with the launch of a 
new coconut variant; and 
•	 agreed a partnership with Fowler Welch Coolchain Ltd, a logistics 
specialist, to maximise the throughput at our Nuneaton distribution 
and warehousing site.
A simpler business
Dairy Crest is a simple, lean and responsive business. We have 
five well-invested manufacturing sites and fewer than 1,200 
employees. There are opportunities to further simplify procedures 
and support structures within the business. During the year 
we embarked on a change to our core IT systems which will 
bring benefits over the next two years. This will deliver a more 
appropriate and cost effective IT infrastructure for a business of 
our scale and is also acting as a catalyst for us to simplify the 
processes that sit alongside these IT systems.
We continue to drive operational efficiency improvements. A 
particular focus is improving performance efficiency at Kirkby, 
where we successfully consolidated all our butters and spreads 
production onto one site in 2015. We are confident that all our 
sites will contribute towards further improved productivity over the 
year to 31 March 2018.
Future prospects
In the first full year since the transformational sale of our Dairies 
business, we have delivered a robust performance in a tough 
market. 
Our industry leading margins are the result of us driving long-
term value through innovation, brand building, investment in a 
world class supply chain and strong cost control. 
Our key brands continue to perform well. Cathedral City 
remains the nation’s favourite cheese and following its brand 
refresh at the start of the year, the good progress and momentum 
we have seen in the last six months has continued in the new 
financial year. Our overall spreads market share has climbed, and 
Frylight had another outstanding year with sales growing 19%, 
well ahead of the market. The ongoing investment we are putting 
behind our brands gives me confidence that we can grow market 
share. 
We have continued to make good progress in our demineralised 
whey operations at Davidstow. We are now hitting our targeted level 
of demineralised whey being of infant formula grade. Developing our 
sales of demineralised whey and GOS into the high-margin global 
infant formula market will be a key priority this year. At the same 
time we are continuing our research into other potential animal and 
human applications for GOS.
Looking forward, I am excited about the future for Dairy Crest. 
The business is well positioned to deliver profitable, sustainable 
growth and stronger cash generation, underpinning our 
commitment to growing our dividends and reducing debt.

overview
This year we have delivered a set of results which demonstrate the 
underlying robustness of our business. Revenue is lower than last 
year despite flat volumes reflecting the deflationary environment 
that existed for much of the last two years. However, milk and 
butter input costs rose significantly as the year progressed. 
Despite this highly volatile background we improved profit margins.

Revenue decreased by 1.3% to £416.6 million, although revenue 
in the second half of the year was 3.7% ahead of the same period 
last year. Despite sales volumes across our four key brands 
remaining broadly flat, the Group faced price deflation in the 
first half which only partially reversed in the second half of the 
year. Cheese and whey revenue fell by £8.9 million (3.4%) with 
decreased sales volumes and prices. Revenue in butters, spreads 
and oils fell by £1.9 million (1.2%) as price deflation across spreads 
and butter in the first half of the year more than offset the second 
half recovery and the strong value and volume growth in Frylight. 
Other revenue comprised warehousing and distribution services 
provided to third parties.

Overall total product group profit (before interest, acquired

million to £68.3 million and the profit margin increased to 16.4% 
(2016: 15.6%). This margin is after charging all central corporate 
costs and includes £3.0 million profit (2016: £3.6 million) on the 
sale of closed depots that were not disposed of as part of the 
sale of the Dairies business in 2015 to Muller UK & Ireland Group 
LLP (‘Müller’). These depot sales are expected to continue next 
year but will then cease. Their treatment as operating income 
is consistent with the treatment in previous years of the related 
closure costs. Future sales of ex-manufacturing sites such as 
Fenstanton, Cambridgeshire and Crudgington, Shropshire will be 
classified as exceptional consistent with the historic treatment of 
the related closure costs.  Dairy Crest Annual Report 2017 13
Strategic report
Cheese and functional ingredients product group profits increased 
by 17.6% and the margin increased to 16.8% (2016: 13.8%). This is 
despite lower revenue which reflected lower selling prices during 
the year. The profit and margin benefited from the reduction in milk 
costs in 2015/16 that resulted in lower cost of sales in 2016/17 due 
to the 12 month average cheese maturation cycle. 
Milk costs increased significantly in the second half of the year 
and these costs will lead to higher cost of sales in 2017/18. 
Butters, spreads and oils product group profits at £25.5 million 
(2016: £29.6 million) were £3.5 million lower than 2016 with profit 
margins of 16.9% (2016: 19.4%) reflecting the competitive butters 
and spreads market and significantly higher butter input costs. 
exceptional items
Pre–tax exceptional charges from continuing operations increased 
to £19.1 million (2016: £11.3 million). 
The Group incurred £19.0 million of exceptional costs in 
relation to the building and commissioning of the demineralised 
whey and GOS facilities at the Davidstow creamery in Cornwall 
(2016: £16.2 million). The principal elements of spend were 
duplicate running costs, stock write-offs, commissioning expenses 
and project management. In addition, there was an exceptional 
charge of £2.3 million (2016: £nil) relating to the disposal costs 
of closed manufacturing sites at Totnes, Fenstanton and 
Crudgington. The treatment of this charge as an exceptional item 
is consistent with the treatment of closure costs in prior years. 
These costs have been partly offset by the release of £2.2 million 
of an exceptional provision in relation to the settlement of historic 
claims between the Group, Farmright Limited and Quadra Foods 
Limited at £1.0 million, which was lower than the creditor balance 
held of £3.2 million. 
In 2016 an exceptional provision of £1.8 million was created for 
dilapidation costs for leased properties in the retained business, 
crystallised by the sale of the Dairies business, and provisions 
relating to the closure of the Crudgington site totalling £0.7 million 
were released. The Group also realised a gain in 2016 of £6.0 
million on its investment in Promovita Ingredients Limited at the 
point that it acquired 100% control in December 2015. 
Finance costs
Finance costs of £7.7 million reduced by £0.6 million in the year. 
This reflected the benefit from refinancing the £80 million of loan 
notes that matured in April 2016 with loan notes issued in March 
2016 at a lower interest rate. This was offset by a £0.7 million 
reduction in interest capitalised on the investment at Davidstow 
and increased interest costs on borrowings under the revolving 
credit facility, as the total level of borrowings increased. The 
interest cost will increase next year as the capitalisation of interest 
on the investment at Davidstow will cease. Capitalised interest 
costs in the year amounted to £3.1 million (2016: £3.8 million). 
Interest cover excluding pension interest, calculated on total 
product group profit was 9.0 times (2016: 8.1 times).
Other finance expenses, which comprise the net expected 
return on pension scheme assets after deducting the interest cost 
on the defined benefit obligation, increased slightly to £0.8 million 
(2016: £0.6 million). These costs are dependent upon the pension 
scheme position at 31 March each year and are volatile, being 
subject to market fluctuations. We therefore exclude this item from 
headline adjusted profit before tax.

Adjusted profit before tax (before exceptional items, amortisation 
of acquired intangibles and pension interest) increased by 5.0% 
to £60.6 million. This is management’s key Group profit measure 
because it excludes exceptional items and therefore gives a better 
indication of underlying performance. Reported profit before tax of 
£40.3 million represents a £5.1 million (11.2%) decrease from 2016 
predominantly due to the increase in exceptional items. 
Taxation
The Group’s effective pre-exceptional tax rate on continuing 
operations was 18.0% (2016: 17.5%). The effective tax rate 
is slightly below the headline rate of UK corporate tax as we 
continue to sell a small number of properties, the profits on which 
are offset by brought forward capital losses or roll over relief.
earnings per share
The Group’s adjusted basic earnings per share from continuing 
operations increased by 3.2% to 35.6 pence (2016: 34.5 pence) as 
a result of the increase in adjusted profit before tax and the lower 
tax charge. Basic earnings per share from continuing operations, 
which includes the impact of exceptional items, pension interest 
expense and the amortisation of acquired intangibles, amounted 
to 23.7 pence (2016: 27.9 pence).
Discontinued operations
The post-tax profit on discontinued operations totalled £5.2 million. 
A gain of £1.4 million relates to the disposal of the Dairies business, 
which completed in 2015/16. This gain includes: additional costs of 
£2.1 million resulting from a re-assessment of liabilities at the date of 
disposal; the final consideration reduction of £2.5 million paid back 
to Müller following determination by an independent expert; and a 
tax credit on these items of £6.0 million. 
There is a discontinued credit of £3.8 million that relates to the 
release of tax provisions held in relation to the St Hubert business 
that was sold in August 2012. These provisions are no longer 
required.
In 2016 the loss from discontinued operations was £151.5 
million. This reflected operating losses in the nine months to 
December 2015 of £33.3 million (post tax £26.4 million), post-
tax exceptional items totalling £14.4 million as the operations 
to be sold were carved out of the Dairy Crest Group and site 
restructuring continued in the Dairies business and a post-tax loss 
on disposal of £110.7 million.
Full details of discontinued operations are set out in the notes 
to the financial statements.
Group result for the year
The reported Group profit for the year from continuing operations 
was £33.1 million (2016: £38.5 million). The profit for the year 
attributable to equity shareholders was £38.3 million (2016: £113.0 
million loss). 14 Dairy Crest Annual Report 2017
Dividends
We remain committed to a progressive dividend policy and have 
continued to deliver against that policy by increasing our proposed 
final dividend by 1.9%. The proposed final dividend of 16.3 pence 
per share represents an increase of 0.3 pence per share. Together 
with the interim dividend of 6.2 pence per share (2016: 6.1 pence 
per share) the total dividend for the year is 22.5 pence per share 
(2016: 22.1 pence per share). The final dividend will be paid on  
11 August 2017 to shareholders on the register on 7 July 2017.
Dividend cover of 1.6 times is within the Board’s target range 
of 1.5 to 2.5 times (2016: 1.6 times).
Pensions
During the year ended 31 March 2017 the Group paid £13.1 million 
cash contributions into the closed defined benefit pension scheme 
(2016: £20.8 million including an £8.3 million pre-payment of future 
agreed cash contributions in relation to lease payments on three 
properties owned by the pension scheme). 
The reported deficit under IAS 19 at 31 March 2017 was 
£109.6 million; an increase of £67.1 million from March 2016. The 
principal reason for the increase was falling corporate bond yields 
which are the reference point for the discount rate used to value 
scheme liabilities.
The March 2016 actuarial valuation and corresponding schedule 
of contributions has yet to be finalised. This valuation will determine 
future cash contributions and will replace the existing funding plan 
which has cash contributions for 2017/18 of £17.2 million.
We continue to manage pension scheme liabilities and during 
the year a Flexible Retirement Option programme was undertaken 
resulting in £18.8 million of liabilities being permanently removed 
from the scheme.
Cash flow
The business generates strong operating cash flows. However, the 
year saw a number of one-off items in the form of final payments 
associated with the sale of the Dairies business and high levels of 
exceptional commissioning costs at Davidstow. 
In the year ended 31 March 2017 cash generated from 
operations was £32.8 million (2016: £31.3 million). 
Operating cash flow was impacted by a £6.1 million increase 
in working capital (2016: £14.0 million reduction). This reflected 
higher stocks of demineralised whey and lower levels of creditors. 
Exceptional cash costs of £25.6 million (2016: £17.6 million) relate 
principally to the commissioning of the demineralised whey and 
GOS plants at Davidstow. This commissioning is now substantially 
complete.
Cash interest payments amounted to £12.2 million (2016: 
£12.8 million) reflecting lower costs on the Group’s loan notes 
following the maturity of notes in April 2016. Capital expenditure of 
£25.6 million represents a £41.2 million (62%) reduction from last 
year’s £66.8 million. This reflects the completion of the projects at 
Davidstow. Capital expenditure next year is expected to be similar 
to this year. 
Proceeds from depot disposals were £4.5 million (2016: 
£5.4 million). In addition the Group received £37.9 million from 
the sale of some of the assets at Davidstow relating to GOS 
and demineralised whey, which were subsequently leased back 
on operating lease terms. During the year the Group repaid a 
total of £28.4 million to Müller including £2.5 million following an 
independent expert’s determination of final adjustments to the 
consideration. In 2016 the sale of our Dairies business resulted 
in initial cash proceeds of £54.5 million – comprising headline 
proceeds of £80.0 million less £15.0 million for the cost of the 
undertaking in lieu, £7.5 million of property sales from which the 
Group had already received the cash proceeds and £3.0 million 
in relation to pre-sale capital expenditure in the Dairies business 
FINANCIAL REVIEW CONTINUED
falling below an agreed target. Against this, the Group paid £5.5 
million in related fees reflecting the extended review undertaken 
by the UK Competition and Markets Authority (‘CMA’). The Group 
also paid £6 million for the outstanding 50% of the share capital of 
Promovita Ingredients Limited in 2015/16. 
Overall, the final payments to Müller, the commissioning costs 
at Davidstow and the adverse movement in working capital offset 
by the sale and leaseback at Davidstow have resulted in a £20.8 
million increase in net debt during the year (2016: £30.3 million 
increase) to £249.8 million (2016: £229.0 million). However, looking 
ahead, strong underlying cash generation will translate into lower 
levels of borrowing as these one-off factors fall away – the Dairies 
business is sold, Davidstow commissioning is complete and milk 
input costs are set to reduce in June 2017. We remain committed 
to reducing net debt/EBITDA to below 2.0 times. Dairy Crest Annual Report 2017 15

PrinCiPAl riSKS AnD UnCerTAinTieS
We manage risk to help us achieve our strategic objectives 
and protect our reputation. 
The Group faces a number of risks which, should they materialise, 
could affect our ability to achieve our strategic objectives. The Board 
has overall responsibility for ensuring the effective management 
of risk across the Group. It is supported by the Audit Committee 
which reviews the effectiveness of the Group’s risk management 
processes and internal controls. Responsibility for the day-to-day 
management of risk is delegated to the Executive Committee 
which reviews the business’ performance and the risks and threats 
being managed at each of its meetings. Executive Committee 
meeting minutes are routinely reviewed by the Board. All functions 
of the Group are represented at Executive Committee enabling the 
Committee to manage the Group’s risks on an on-going basis.
risk appetite: The Board believes that the assumption of informed risks 
enables the delivery of long-term success. It determines the nature and extent 
of significant risks the Company assumes to achieve its strategic objectives. The 
Directors have carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks which the 
Company faces including those that would threaten the business model, future 
performance, solvency or liquidity.
r isk management process: Each key function in the Group is required to 
prepare a risk register for its area of accountability. Functional risk registers are 
reviewed by the Executive Committee and from them the Group risk register is 
compiled. It is formally reviewed by the Board when the Group sets its budget in 
April. The Group Internal Audit function reviews the Group risk register at the start 
of each year. It is a key component of the compilation of its annual audit plan. 
All Group Internal Audit function reports are provided to the Executive and Audit 
Committees. The Audit Committee reviews the Group’s Internal Audit’s reports 
and progress against its work plan. The Audit Committee reports to the Board 
after each meeting. Group Internal Audit provides independent assurance over 
the management and mitigation mechanisms. This process explicitly recognises 
the relationship between Group Internal Audit and risk management. The Audit 
Committee is satisfied that the processes are adequate and appropriate. Further 
details of the Group’s approach to risk management and internal control are set 
out in the Corporate Governance report at pages 32 to 33.
r isks and uncertainties: Details of the principal risks and uncertainties faced 
by the Group and the associated mitigating controls are set out on this page 
and on page 17. Although the Group has an on-going process for identifying, 
evaluating and managing the principal risks and uncertainties facing the Group, 
additional risks which are not presently known to management could also have an 
adverse effect on the Group. The risks and uncertainties referred to in this Annual 
Report are not intended to be an exhaustive analysis of all risks facing the Group.
Commercial risks
r educed profitability
r isk area and potential impact
We operate in competitive markets. If we fail adequately to control our cost 
base, to compete effectively or are subject to higher input prices that cannot be 
recovered by raising selling prices without losing volumes, we could lose sales 
and profits.
mitigating controls
We set ourselves the target of continually reducing our cost base and are able to 
invest in our supply chain to help achieve this.
Despite challenging trading conditions we continue to invest in marketing our 
key brands. Our innovation programme continues to generate new products 
that reinforce our appeal to customers. We recognise the importance of strong 
customer relationships and the executive team plays an active part in maintaining 
and developing these. They are also involved in major customer negotiations. We 
conduct customer surveys to benchmark our performance and we continuously 
monitor the service and quality levels provided to our customers and consumers, 
and have procedures in place to react quickly to any issues. Our commitment to 
corporate responsibility is an important part of our overall proposition to some 
customers.
r educed demand from consumers 
r isk area and potential impact
Consumers could move away from dairy products for economic, health, ethical, 
or other reasons leading to lower sales and profits.
mitigating controls
Consumers are at the heart of our business and we regularly monitor consumer 
trends. We continue to promote the health benefits provided by dairy products 
and develop healthier products. We also continue to maintain our focus on 
developing a compelling new product development pipeline, enabling us to react 
to consumer trends, for example with more environmentally-friendly packaging, 
and healthier variants of our key brands. We have a direct involvement with 
government to understand and influence future legislation that could affect future 
consumer demand.
inadequate levels of innovation
r isk area and potential impact
We operate in markets in which our competitors are continually innovating in 
order to maintain customer and consumer interest in their products and to attract 
customer and consumer interest for new products. If we do not successfully 
innovate we may lose customers and consumers and we may fail to attract new 
customers and consumers. That would result in fewer sales, loss of profit and 
failure to meet growth targets.
mitigating controls
We have a strong new product development and innovation team who are 
based at our Innovation Centre on the Harper Adams University campus. That 
team works closely with Harper Adams University leveraging the research and 
other expertise of the University, including taking students on secondment 
into our innovation team. The innovation team’s brief includes enhancing the 
appeal of existing products, driving product and manufacturing efficiencies 
and improvements and developing new exciting products and variants of 
existing products. Continued investment in innovation enables our business to 
maintain or outstrip innovation in the rest of the market. Focusing an element of 
senior management remuneration on innovation through the use of a balanced 
scorecard including an innovation target for the Group’s share based long-term 
incentive plan helps to ensure continued focus on and drive behind innovation 
as does the publicly adopted target of achieving 10% of revenue from products 
developed in the last three years.
input cost volatility
r isk area and potential impact
Volatile milk and non-milk costs (vegetable oils, diesel, electricity, gas and 
packaging) could reduce margins unless we can manage cost risk, find other 
cost efficiencies elsewhere or increase selling prices.
Milk prices could remain volatile driven by global and European commodity 
market pressures as well as local market and environmental factors.
mitigating controls
Key input cost trends are continually monitored by our experienced procurement 
team and are regularly reviewed by the Executive Committee. Milk and vegetable 
oil are critical inputs for the Group. Milk price negotiations are conducted following 
careful review with the Executive Committee which provides the procurement 
team with a specific mandate. The use of a balancing contract with direct milk 
suppliers (introduced in the first quarter of the financial year) enables better 
balancing of milk supply and demand thereby reducing the risk of milk oversupply 
resulting in lower recoveries. The balancing contract helps to reduce our exposure 
to lower value commodity markets thereby supporting the Group’s strategy of 
focusing on branded and added value markets. Vegetable oil is reviewed monthly 
by a risk committee which monitors and hedges forward vegetable oil purchases 
as appropriate. We seek to absorb short-term cost movements through supply 
chain efficiencies. Our procurement and commercial teams have clear lines of 
communication between them to ensure customers are kept aware of changes to 
our cost base and requests for price increases can be fully justified.
entry into new product areas or territories
r isk area and potential impact
The dynamics of new categories may not be in line with our expectations resulting 
in lower than anticipated margins, lower than anticipated volumes, longer than 
anticipated payback on investment and higher than expected costs to access 
markets.
mitigating controls
We work with commercial partners who are already established in new categories 
and markets where the Group is not already operating or present. Contractual 
relationships with these established commercial partners for the sale and 
distribution of products in new categories and markets enable the Group to have 
certainty over minimum levels of returns and known costs of accessing new 
markets.
o perational risks 
inability to source milk
r isk area and potential impact
Without milk we would not have a business. Restricted milk supply could be 
caused by economic factors, weather, fuel availability or an epidemic which 
affects dairy cows. This could lead to lower sales and profits. Consumer 
confidence in dairy products could also be adversely affected.
mitigating controls
We invest significant resources in maintaining strong relationships with our milk 
suppliers by attending forums and discussing current issues and pressures that 
affect both the farms and our business. Our milk comes directly from farms on 
contracts that include a notice period of between three months and one year.  
Our experienced milk procurement team understand milk production and are 
alert to changes in supply. We aim to pay a fair, market related milk price and 
closely monitor the milk price we pay to suppliers. Significant effort is expended 
by our team of dedicated Farm Business Managers to make the Group an 
attractive purchaser of milk for our suppliers, including working closely with our 
direct supplying farmers providing valuable support to them with their businesses. 
We have contingency plans established for major incidents and work closely with 
DEFRA and industry bodies to ensure these are appropriate. These plans are 
regularly tested and reviewed by the Executive Committee.  Dairy Crest Annual Report 2017 17
Strategic report
Failure of a key supplier
r isk area and potential impact
We are dependent on key suppliers and could lose sales and face financial 
penalties from customers if a supplier’s failure leaves us unable to supply. Failure 
of key information technology suppliers could adversely affect our financial 
systems.
mitigating controls
Our procurement team regularly monitors suppliers’ ability to supply and puts 
in place alternative arrangements, including dual purchasing, if appropriate. We 
have taken specific actions to reduce our dependency on information technology 
suppliers.
Disruption to production
r isk area and potential impact
An accident, a fire, product contamination, the failure of equipment or systems, 
a deliberate malicious act, or industrial action could disrupt production, affect 
food safety, cause injury, and/or cause reputational damage with adverse 
consequences. We are also reliant on information technology and are exposed to 
losses in the event that systems fail.
mitigating controls
Plans are maintained to respond quickly to incidents and minimise any impact 
to the Group. Our business is committed to the health and safety of all our 
employees and maintains systems aimed at ensuring everyone is able to work 
safely. All of our manufacturing sites have a trained engineering resource, are 
supported by our major equipment suppliers and hold appropriate stocks of 
spare parts. They also all have fire protection systems and regular fire drills. Our 
information technology systems are regularly backed up and duplicated in the 
majority of areas. Appropriate safeguards such as firewalls are in place to thwart 
cyber attack and the robustness of those safeguards is regularly and routinely 
tested as part of our cyber security programme. We are also advised by a 
reputable insurance broker and maintain insurance cover for public and product 
liability, product recall and property damage and business interruption risks with 
reputable insurers. We maintain strong relations and communication with staff 
organisations and trade unions including at National Officer level. Established 
grievance and disciplinary procedures are well embedded in the business and 
compliance with them is managed through a strong Employee Relations function. 
Pay benchmarking processes and centrally controlled pay negotiations are in 
place to ensure pay remains competitive against the market and in line with 
the Group’s stated remuneration aims. Regular employee engagement surveys 
enable us to maintain a good on-going understanding of staff satisfaction and to 
identify emerging issues or trends and understand the effectiveness of actions 
undertaken to manage them.
major projects
r isk area and potential impact
To remain competitive we periodically undertake major transformational projects 
following strategic reviews or have to undertake major projects or works in 
response to the changing condition of our infrastructure. Successful execution 
of these projects is often key to delivering strategic objectives. At the same time 
we have to ensure that major projects do not divert from the on-going day-to-day 
delivery of products and services to our customers.
mitigating controls
We have a good track record of managing projects and use experienced and 
appropriately skilled senior managers to lead these. Supervisory governance 
structures are also put in place to help successful delivery. We are aware that 
too much change concentrated in too short a timescale can be detrimental 
and manage this by ensuring key project resource is full time with appropriate 
backfilling and use of third parties.
Product quality
r isk area and potential impact
Failure to maintain product quality could lead to reputational damage and loss  
of sales and profits. As we start to manufacture ingredients for infant formula  
this risk could increase.
mitigating controls
We have well-established supply chains and a close working relationship with our 
milk suppliers. We have an independent quality team, including experienced cheese 
graders. Customer and consumer complaints are monitored and acted upon. 
Where possible we have liability caps in our contracts and using the advice  
of a reputable insurance broker we have product recall liability insurance in place 
with reputable insurers. Our contractual relationship with Fonterra, who sell the 
infant formula ingredients we produce, allows us to utilise its experience in this field.
r isk area and potential impact
If we don’t meet stringent infant formula specifications for added value ingredients 
products we will not be able to sell those products for their intended use. That 
could lead to lower than anticipated sales volumes of infant formula grade 
products associated with which would be lower than anticipated profits; customer 
confidence may also be eroded as a result.
mitigating controls
Implementation of and strict adherence to manufacturing procedures designed 
to ensure product meets specification. Assurance over adherence to those 
procedures is provided by internal technical audit, customer audit and external 
expert audit. Our contractual relationship with Fonterra, who sell the infant formula 
ingredients we produce, allows us to utilise its experience in producing product 
which conforms to the required specification. Focus on continual enhancement 
of site team capabilities through technical training and behavioural programmes 
coupled with ensuring appropriately experienced and skilled people are recruited 
into and retained in the team. We have a short milk supply chain with good 
traceability and strict controls to ensure quality. Farm audits ensure supplier 
compliance with quality requirements.
People risks
r ecruitment and retention
r isk area and potential impact
We need to attract and retain high quality employees to provide customers and 
consumers with safe, high quality products and services.
mitigating controls
We carry out rigorous selection procedures and benchmark pay and benefits 
to ensure we can attract and retain the best people. We have a widely applied 
bonus scheme and a range of other incentives to reward good performance. 
Our share based long-term incentive plan aligns the interest of management to 
shareholders and helps to retain key senior employees. We use a performance 
review and talent management scheme to identify and develop our own people. 
We undertake regular surveys to monitor our relationship with our employees and 
their engagement, communicate with them regularly and encourage them to ask 
questions.
Financial risks 
Pension scheme
r isk area and potential impact
Despite the action we have taken to reduce the risks associated with our pension 
scheme, including closing the scheme to future accrual in 2010 and buying 
insurance to meet the liabilities associated with many of our retired members in 
2008 and 2009, the deficit could continue to increase and we may then have to 
increase our contributions. The risk of a need for higher cash contributions to the 
scheme over a longer than anticipated period may be increased by a persisting 
low gilt yield environment.
mitigating controls
We continue to work closely with the Trustee of the Pension Fund to improve the 
Fund’s financial position at an acceptable cash cost to the business. We have 
reduced the Fund’s exposure to equities and other higher-risk asset classes 
and aim to do so further. The strength of the Company’s covenant and ability 
to continue to fund contributions has been improved by the sale of the Dairies 
business.
l egal and compliance risks
Compliance with laws
r isk area and potential impact
Our sector is subject to a number of complex statutory requirements. There is a 
risk of fines or lawsuits and reputational damage if we fail to comply.
mitigating controls
We have a strong in-house legal function supported by external advisers. We 
have undertaken Group-wide training in respect of competition law and actively 
monitor and adjust to on-going legal and regulatory changes. We have Business 
Conduct and Data Protection Policies and programmes designed to ensure 
that all relevant employees understand what is and is not permissible under the 
Bribery and Data Protection Acts.
r egulatory change
r isk area and potential impact
Food safety and product specification regulations affecting the UK and other 
jurisdictions where products are sold impact the products that we manufacture. 
Regulatory authorities regularly enact changes to food safety and product 
specification legislation. Changes to legislation could result in restrictions on the 
movement and sale of the Group’s products and raw materials between territories 
or require changes to the production processes or specification of our products.
mitigating controls
We have a strong technical function which routinely monitors planned and 
implemented changes to food and ingredients legislation in the UK and other 
relevant jurisdictions which might necessitate changes to our production 
processes or product specifications. Our product development function works 
in tandem with the technical function and key supplier partners and customers 
to respond to anticipated or implemented legislative changes. The Group 
has invested in its technical and product development functions and has its 
technical and innovation centre at Harper Adams University with which we have 
a cooperation agreement providing access to state of the art academic and 
technical expertise. We are a member of recognised industry bodies who represent 
our interests, along with others in the food and dairy industries and advise and 
lobby on our behalf. We have close links with UK government and government 
representatives to help represent our interests in jurisdictions outside the UK 
together with commercial partners already established in other jurisdictions. 18 Dairy Crest Annual Report 2017
Dairy Crest produces and markets Cathedral City, the  
UK’s leading cheese brand, and the premium Davidstow 
cheddar brand.
Our world-class supply chain starts with milk collected 
from around 360 farmers in the dairy heartlands of Cornwall 
and Devon. This top quality milk is made into cheddar 
cheese at our highly-automated creamery in Davidstow, 
Cornwall. The cheese then matures for around a year at our 
purpose-built Nuneaton facility before being cut, packed 
and distributed. We have a second packing site in Frome, 
Somerset, for more complex and innovative packaging.
Whey is a by-product of the cheese making process. Our 
new state of the art facility at Davidstow demineralises this 
whey to supply the high-growth, high-margin global infant 
formula market. Additionally we produce GOS, a lactose-
based prebiotic, which is also an ingredient for infant 
formula, but has potential applications in other human life 
stages as well as in animal husbandry.
Market background
2016/17 was a turning point in the UK dairy market. Having fallen 
for three years, prices paid to farmers for milk started to rise in 
the summer and then rose quickly through the autumn and winter 
before stabilising in the spring. The price we pay to farmers for 
the milk we use to make cheese rose from a low of 21.7p per litre 
in July to 30p per litre in February, although in April 2017 we did 
announce a 1p reduction from 1 June and another 1p reduction 
from 1 July. The maturation process means we sell cheese made 
with milk purchased around a year before the sale takes place. 
Therefore the effect of these higher milk prices will not be seen 
in the profit and loss account until later in 2017/18, although the 
effect was seen in higher working capital balances for cheese at 
2016/17 year end.
Meanwhile year-on-year cheese retail prices were falling in 
2016/17 and only just started rising on a quarter-on-quarter basis 
in January. Market cheese volumes have been reasonably robust 
during the year, rising by 2%, with little change throughout the year. 
Global whey prices have also started to rise over the last six 
months.
Cathedral City: A true market leader
It is the UK’s 18th largest grocery brand, bigger than all other 
competitor cheddar brands combined and accounts for 54% of all 
branded everyday cheese sold by UK retailers. 
For much of the year there were high levels of cheese stocks 
across the market, driven by high milk supply in the preceding 
year. In order to maintain the brand’s premium positioning within

the category we decided not to discount too aggressively. 
Consequently, Cathedral City slightly underperformed the market 
and volumes were down 3% for the year. However volumes 
improved in the second half and we expect this performance to 
continue during 2017/18.
During the early part of the year we successfully rolled out 
a new master brand identity for Cathedral City. The new design 
simplifies the brand, improves visibility on shelf and strengthens 
our range. This allows our brand investment to work better across 
the whole of the growing cheese category. It was supported by 
significant investment including a successful new TV advertisement, 
‘The Rules of Cheese’. We have seen a positive consumer reaction 
both to the new packaging and the marketing campaign. 
Innovation remains at the heart of what we do and 2016/17 saw 
the relaunch of Cathedral City spreadable in three flavours: Mature, 
Extra Mature and Garlic & Herb. We have launched a new flavour, 
Lighter Mature, and towards the end of the year our new snack bar 
was launched in front of store. This is an important development 
for the long-term expansion of the brand into the on-the-go food 
section. Innovation will remain key to our future growth.
A world-class supply chain
Our farmers play a vital role in our world-class cheese supply 
chain, with 100% of the milk we buy coming direct from around 
360 farmers in the South West of England. We pride ourselves 
on the close working relationship with our farmers, through both 
our Farm Business Team and Dairy Crest Direct (‘DCD’), the 
independently elected body which represents Dairy Crest farmers. 
Thanks to our Davidstow Farm Standards, all milk supplied to us 
meets the strict international standards for the production of infant 
formula and in 2016/17 we have further developed and enhanced 
our Davidstow farm audits. 
New infant formula ingredients come on stream
During the year we completed our investment at the Davidstow 
creamery in Cornwall to make demineralised whey and GOS. The 
quality targets for infant formula grade demineralised whey are 
demanding. We have been continually improving the quality of our 
product so that by the year end we had met our target of more 
than 80% of our whey being of infant formula grade. In partnership 
with Fonterra we are building our sales relationships with infant 
formula producers in both GOS and demineralised whey and 
expect strong growth in sales of these products during the coming 
year. These added value products give Dairy Crest access to new 
sales channels in fast growing global markets.

Potentially exciting new applications for GOS
We are investigating some potential further applications for GOS. 
Promovita

 is the new brand name of our GOS for use in food 
applications. In animal nutrition, where we use the brand name 
Nutrabiotic
®
, the product may improve food uptake but also animal 
health, potentially leading to the need for lower levels of antibiotics 
in the animal husbandry industry. During the year we signed an 
agreement with Danisco Animal Nutrition, part of DuPont, which 
will provide an extensive level of research into the benefits of GOS. 
A business with huge potential
Our cheese and functional ingredients business has state of the

Dairy Crest manufactures a number of leading butters, 
spreads and oil brands in the UK. The key brands are 
Country Life (butter), Clover (spread) and Frylight (spray oil). 
Our secondary spreads brands are Vitalite, Utterly Butterly 
and Willow. All the butter and spreads brands are produced 
at a single facility in Kirkby, Merseyside, whilst Frylight is 
manufactured at our facility in erith, Kent.
Butters and spreads market remains challenging
The butters and spreads market has continued to see overall 
volume decline, but price inflation during the second half resulted 
in the market reporting some value growth. Within the category 
the long-term trend of butter gaining volume share was maintained 
and butter volumes were up 2% whilst spreads volumes declined 
7%. However, during the second half of the year there was 
considerable inflation in butter prices and this has widened the 
price gap between the two categories. Partly as a result butter 
volumes fell by 5% in the final quarter and spreads volume decline 
slowed to 5%.
Dairy Crest gaining share 
Clover is well placed to meet consumer needs within the changing 
market. Over the past eighteen months we have re-launched 
and advertised Clover with ‘no artificial ingredients’, positioning 
it as a dairy spread made with buttermilk. The improved Clover 
original recipe was introduced in late 2015 and Clover lighter 
is due to be re-formulated this year. This positioning has been 
further reinforced by the launch of new packaging in late 2016 and 
an extensive marketing campaign, which has resulted in Clover 
gaining another 1.1 percentage points of share during the year. In 
recognition of our work in launching the improved recipe, Clover 
won the spreads category ‘Product of the Year 2017’ award in the 
world’s largest consumer survey award for product innovation. 
Our other spreads brands have all performed well and 
together Dairy Crest spreads have increased share by 2.2 
percentage points. Total spreads volumes are up 4% and Clover 
volumes are up 1% in a market that has declined by 7%, a 
fantastic performance. During the year we also launched a new 
Vitalite coconut variant, which contributes to our share of the 
growing ‘dairy free’ market.
Country Life has performed well against a backdrop of high 
input cost inflation. The British themed packaging introduced 
last year resonates well with consumers and our new spreadable 
formulation has helped that product grow volumes by 6% to 
become the fastest growing major spreadable brand. Managing this 
inflation and volatility resulted in us reducing the amount of block 
butter promotions during the second half and has led to some 
share loss in this sector. Overall, Country Life volumes were flat and 
the higher input prices for butter have had a negative impact on 
margins for the business.
Frylight: another strong year
Frylight has been a phenomenal success ever since Dairy Crest 
acquired the brand in 2011 and last year was no different. During 
the year it was successfully re-launched with a new packaging 
design, which emphasises Frylight’s ‘no artificial ingredients’ 
credentials. This was supported by a new TV advertising 
campaign across the important fourth quarter period, which 
encompasses both the start of the New Year and Pancake 
Day. Sales during the campaign and around Pancake Day both 
increased by over 25%. Innovation also continued, with a new 
avocado variant launched early in 2017. This follows on from the 
launch of a coconut variant last year, which has already become 
our third biggest selling line. All this has resulted in volume growth 
of 23% and a penetration rate of 23% of UK households.
This year has already seen the launch of the new cap 
design and the business is also exploring export opportunities 
in Europe to support its medium-term growth ambitions. We are 
also delighted that Frylight has been singled out by the industry, 
winning the Institute of Grocery and Distribution (IGD) ‘Health and 
Wellness’ product award in October 2016. 
Simplified supply chain, generating cash
All our butters and spreads manufacturing has been consolidated 
on one site at Kirkby for the last two years. We are well positioned 
to continue driving efficiency and to further lower manufacturing 
costs. The simplified supply chain, combined with improvements 
in brand performance, will enable continued investment into this 
high-margin category and underpin on-going cash generation.

2017 marks the 10th anniversary of our CR strategy. During this 
time, we have enjoyed a number of CR achievements and awards; 
this strong heritage sets us up well for future success.
In the last year we have reviewed our objectives, and how 
we will approach current and emerging issues. An important 
change following this review was the simplification of our pledges 
and the introduction of four strategic pillars (Climate, Colleagues, 
Consumers and Community) which are championed by our 
Executive Committee; this means that the spirit and intent of the 
pledges within the pillars are more alive than ever before. 
In this section we report on what we have achieved in the first

included. Minor losses of refrigerants used in cooling equipment have 
been converted to tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent and are included 
for completeness.
scope 2 emissions data includes purchased electricity used in 
manufacturing, distribution and in offices. 
 We employ a ‘per tonne of throughput’ denominator as the most 
effective measure of relative performance. This measure is consistent 
with our internal target setting process and how we communicate 
relative performance.
 Consistent with the GHG Protocol emissions from biologically 
sequestered carbon are reported separately from the other Scopes. 
These comprise emissions from combustion of biomass fuel at our 
creamery in Davidstow that significantly reduce Scope 1 emissions 
from fossil fuels. Emissions from combustion of biomass fuels are not 
included in the emissions intensity ratio reported above.   
 
Scope 1 and 2 emissions reduced in 2016/17 by 71% compared to the 
previous year driven by the changes summarised in the chart below.  
Divestment and outsourcing:
– full year effect of the divestment of the Dairies business on 26 
December 2015 reducing Scope 1 emissions (fuels used in processing 
sites and depots and road fuel used for distribution and business travel) 
and Scope 2 emissions (electricity used in manufacturing sites and 
depots) compared to April – December in this reporting year
– outsourcing of primary transport for distribution of finished products 
to Fowler Welch on the 5 June 2016 reducing Scope 1 emissions from 
HGV road fuel and refrigeration for the remainder of this reporting year
o perational changes at manufacturing sites:
– the biomass boilers at Davidstow returned to high levels of utilisation 
experienced in previous years providing around 80% of the heat to the 
creamery and reducing Scope 1 emissions from the use of fossil fuels. 
In 2016/17 on-site renewable energy represented 41% of total energy 
(63% of fuel) used by manufacturing sites.  
– the carbon intensity of electricity imported from the public grid 
reduced by 11% compared to the previous year (based on annual 
emissions factors issued by DEFRA) reducing Scope 2 emissions
– changes to portfolio of production at Davidstow with the introduction 
of new functional ingredients at Davidstow and associated site 
infrastructure, such as new and enhanced assets for the treatment of 
process waste water which increased relative energy use and hence 
both Scope 1 and 2 emissions
 The overall effect of the changes described above on the emissions 
intensity metric was a year-on-year decrease of 21%.

 and waste reduction.
For our Colleagues pillar we have improved our industry 
leading health and safety performance and the well-being 
programmes for our employees.
Our commitments to health and nutrition contained in our 
Consumers pillar are supported by growth in Frylight volumes and 
additional Cathedral City Lighter product formats. Our extensive 
research programmes continue, including the exciting area of 
animal health benefits from functional ingredients such as GOS.
Finally, in delivering our Community pillar, we continue to 
support our local communities. We have been very busy working 
with The Princes Countryside Fund, Macmillan Cancer Support and 
Crisis at Christmas, and promoted employee volunteering days. Dairy Crest Annual Report 2017 23
Strategic report
r esponsible stewardship on farm
Our well-established farmer support package consists of our 
Farm Business Centre, field based Farm Business Managers, our 
farmers’ portal plus independent advisory and audit services. 
We work closely with Dairy Crest Direct (‘DCD’), our farmer 
representative body, and actively supported their successful 
application to become the first Dairy Producer Organisation in  
the UK.
Our Davidstow Farm Standards have proven an effective 
way to reflect the shared priorities of Dairy Crest and our direct 
supplying dairy farmers. These standards are designed to reflect 
best practice on farm and ensure the highest quality of milk 
supply. Each of our direct supplying farms achieves a ranking 
under the standards. Our pledge is to assist and support farmers 
in achieving the highest ranking which is currently achieved by 
around 70% of our supplying farms.
We are engaging with other stakeholders and supply chain 
partners in the South West to assess further cost effective best 
practice standards for example in relation to environmental 
controls that support local healthy eco-systems. 
l ow carbon manufacturing
We are committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions 
associated with our direct operations by reducing energy demand 
and switching to less carbon intensive forms of energy. 
Our site teams continue to make good progress in improving 
the efficiency of generation and use of energy with relative energy 
use reducing across Kirkby, Frome and Nuneaton by 4%. A wide 
range of projects included investment in low energy lighting, heat 
recovery from air compressors and efficient refrigeration systems.
At Davidstow the introduction of new processes to 
manufacture functional ingredients and the new and enhanced 
assets for the treatment of process waste water has increased 
relative energy demand. Our investment in detailed metering of 
demand patterns will help us further to optimise energy use for 
these new processes. 
Around 80% of the heat required by the Davidstow creamery 
was provided from biomass, significantly reducing energy from 
fossil fuels. Energy from the biomass boilers represented more 
than 40% of total energy use, meeting our pledge for more than 
one third of total energy to come from on-site renewables. 
The combined effect for our manufacturing sites was a lower 
than forecast increase in relative energy use of 2% with an associated 
reduction in greenhouse gas emissions of 13%. This represents 
significant progress towards our pledge to reduce emissions from 
our direct operations by 20% over the next five years.
Water stewardship
Securing sufficient, high quality freshwater is essential to 
our business strategy. We have invested in advanced water 
treatment technologies to enable the re-use of process waste 
water at Davidstow reducing long-term reliance on freshwater 
imports. Towards the end of the year, higher recovery rates meant 
that around 45% of water used came from recycled sources. 
Maintaining high water recovery rates at Davidstow is key to the 
achievement of our pledge for more than 50% of the water required 
to manufacture our products to come from recycled sources. 
Reducing demand for water also remains important to us and 
we continue to prioritise efficiency projects such as enhanced 
cleaning of process equipment and plant areas.
r educing waste
In 2016/17 we again achieved our short-term objective to send 
zero waste to landfill and acknowledged that this was an early, 
albeit important, stage of achieving our pledge to increase the 
value generated from unavoidable non-edible wastes. Our focus 
remains on reducing non-edible wastes at source, converting 
wastes into by-products and moving materials up the waste 
hierarchy.
We track the proportion of operational wastes segregated on 
site and were pleased to exceed our target of 80% segregation by 
the year end.
We have worked with WRAP as part of the Courtauld 2025 
agreement and The Grocer’s Waste Not Want Not campaign to 
reduce household food waste.
Climate
As a leading dairy manufacturer we are 
determined to play an active role in mitigating 
and adapting to the effects of climate change, 
reducing waste and looking after our natural 
resources.

CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITy CONTINUED
At Dairy Crest we continually work to improve 
the excellent safety record we have achieved, 
we engage with our people and fully utilise their 
expertise. We are developing our approach to 
Diversity and Inclusion to strengthen our skill 
base, and we continue to develop our people 
to drive our business forward.
safety is always first
We have seen over the years that a commitment to health and 
safety is key to building a great business. Our track record 
during 2016/17 shows further improvement on an already strong 
performance.
At the end of March 2017, we have reduced our Lost Time 
Accident Frequency Rate from 0.19 to 0.13 due to a 43% reduction 
in the number of reportable incidents against the 2013 baseline. 
Having set ourselves what appeared to be a challenging objective 
of a 50% reduction in Accident Incident Rate by 2018 versus the 
2013 baseline, we have achieved 69% reduction in the last year.
Encouraging employees to report near misses is key to 
achieving sustainable long-term change in safety behaviour. 
Against our target of 100:1 ratio of near miss and behavioural 
conversations versus all types of accident by 2018, we achieved a 
ratio of 423:1, an improvement on last year’s 175:1 performance.
Another important way of engaging our teams in safety is 
through our cultural change programme, encouraging employees 
to ‘Stop, Think, Assess, Review’ (‘STAR’) and complete STAR 
cards where they see safety related conditions or actions. By 
discussing and addressing these issues, we have created greater 
levels of dialogue, involvement and a safety first culture. To build 
on this programme in 2016 we introduced the STAR safe system of 
work (‘SSoW’) conversations, where front line managers initiate a 
conversation with a work colleague, based on the recognised safe 
system of working. Through this discussion better and safer ways 
of working have been identified, reducing our risks and injuries.
Well-being for our people
2016/17 has seen continued growth in free well-being checks for 
employees with 256 members of our staff receiving this valuable 
service that is open to all.
Our well-being days continue to attract high staff attendance. 
Comprised of practical health and safety advice for work and 
home, these events are run across the business and receive very 
positive feedback from our teams.
Our busy Occupational Health team also delivered 924 
mandatory health checks throughout the year.
engaging employees
Creating an environment where all employees understand they have 
a key role to play in the Company’s success is crucial to achieving 
the objectives and targets we set. 2016/17 has seen a number of 
people initiatives aimed at further engaging our employees.
An employee roadshow, presented by members of the 
Executive Committee, visited all Dairy Crest sites and offices. Over 
a 6 week period, 80% of employees attended the presentation 
which covered important topics such as our refreshed Vision 
and Values, CR pledges, our business plans and our progress to 
date. The roadshows were very well received by employees with 
structured feedback reporting high levels of engagement.
We continue to develop our other employee communication 
channels with a weekly news roundup, regular business 
performance updates and our staff intranet.
Feeling valued and part of the wider Dairy Crest team is key to 
employee engagement. We support this in three ways:
•	 All employees have the opportunity to be part of a bonus or 
incentive scheme which is linked to either personal, site and/or 
company performance;
•	 Dairy Crest runs share save schemes whereby employees can 
invest in Dairy Crest and take a real ownership role. Two share 
save schemes are currently in operation with circa 40% of staff 
investing their money, up to £500 a month; and
•	 Our Reward & Recognition scheme continues to benefit 
employees who ‘go the extra mile’. Bronze and Silver awards, that 
attract a monetary benefit, recognise excellent behaviour in line 
with our values. Silver award winners are selected by a committee 
of staff to receive one of three prestigious Gold awards. In 2016/17 
462 Bronze and Silver awards were awarded.
investing in learning
In 2016/17 Dairy Crest has maintained its focus on induction 
training and manufacturing compliance skills development. These 
now achieve consistently high levels of compliance with our 
internal targets for timing of completion, respectively 99% and 
98% at year end.
Colleagues
Through our refreshed Corporate Responsibility pledges, Dairy Crest employees 
have a volunteering day each year to help support local causes. Dairy Crest Annual Report 2017 25
Strategic report
An important emphasis this year has been on management 
development for all our team leaders, from first line to Director 
level. The training provided focussed on the skills required to 
enhance high performance from individuals and teams and included 
coaching skills, feedback, objective setting and development 
planning. This programme was attended by 150 managers from 
all disciplines within the business. We are in the process of 
evaluating the outcomes of this programme and defining next 
steps, however, initial feedback has been very positive and we 
aim to build upon this to ensure continued improvements in the 
management and development of our employees.
To enhance access to learning further, Dairy Crest has 
launched a new Learning Management System ‘mydevelopment’ 
incorporating e-learning programmes on a diverse range of 
business topics, including Dairy Crest’s specific environmental 
awareness module and ‘how to’ tool kits. This new platform allows 
Dairy Crest to drive blended and dynamic learning initiatives across 
the business.
The Dairy Crest Talent Management Review is undertaken 
annually and is the foundation of our talent assessment process and 
succession planning. As recognised in the CR pledges, there has 
been additional emphasis this year on identifying all business critical 
roles and the succession and development plans for these. This will 
continue into 2017/18 to ensure Dairy Crest is in the best position to 
secure and retain the right skills for the business.
Dairy Crest continues to invest in apprenticeship programmes 
to provide a pipeline of talent into key skill areas. Our Eden 
apprenticeships develop competence in the core areas of dairy 
processing, manufacturing and engineering. Dairy Crest currently 
supports three technology apprentices and five engineering 
apprentices. Our first two Eden engineering trainees graduated this 
year and both went straight into shift engineer and maintenance 
engineer roles within the Group.
Turnover of employees has stabilised during 2016/17 and 
now sits at 15%. Although some turnover of staff is positive in 
refreshing our skill base, the current level is higher than desired and 
Dairy Crest will be looking to the Employee Survey, undertaken in 
April 2017, to help identify any areas where we can improve on this 
key metric. With regard to absence, this now sits at 2.7%, slightly 
above last year’s level of 2.6% but in line with our objective to 
maintain absence below 3%.
Diversity and inclusion
Businesses are more sustainable and perform better when they 
attract and develop talent from the broadest possible base. It is 
this understanding that drives our Diversity and Inclusion agenda. 
We also know that people are at their most productive when they 
can achieve an appropriate balance between work and home life. 
At Dairy Crest we wish to employ and grow a diverse workforce 
who feel they are treated flexibly with regard to their ways of 
working according to business needs. 
Employees are encouraged to reach their full potential 
regardless of their age, gender, marital status (including civil 
partnerships), disability, nationality, colour, ethnic origin, sexual 
orientation or religious affiliation. Dairy Crest does not tolerate 
discrimination or harassment on any of these grounds. To help us 
achieve our aims our polices include the right to apply for flexible 
working hours, a sabbatical, support with taking time off to study, 
and we provide maternity pay above the statutory minimum and 
full pay during paternity leave.
During 2016/17 we have refreshed our Diversity and Inclusion 
programme, the objective of which is enshrined in our CR pledge 
to develop employment policies and working practices that 
encourage a diverse and inclusive workforce. Already we have 
reviewed the Diversity training and development provided and will 
look to enhance this during 2017/18. Further action will include a 
review of policies and communications.
Working with trade unions
Dairy Crest has enjoyed good relationships with the recognised 
unions, USDAW and Unite, for many years.  We acknowledge 
the positive role trade unions can play in the development of our 
business and the constructive way we have worked together.

CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITy CONTINUED
Healthier choices 
Dairy Crest has continued to invest in its portfolio of lower fat 
options. Market data shows that volumes of the lower fat variants 
of our cheese, butters and spreads brands grew by 1% from 
2015/16, and now account for 13.8% of our overall branded cheese, 
butters and spreads volumes, an increase from 13.2% in 2015/16.
Collectively, along with Frylight, our one calorie cooking spray, 
our lower fat variants reached a retail sales value of £84.0 million, 
an increase of 3.2% over 2015/16.
Cathedral City has expanded its extensive range of lower fat 
options, with the addition of two new variants – Cathedral City 
Lighter snack bar and Cathedral City Lighter spreadable. This has 
helped retail sales of lower fat options from Cathedral City to grow 
to £34.1 million.
Our lower fat spreads – Clover Light, Utterly Butterly Lightly 
and Country Life Lighter spreadable – have a collective retail sales 
value of £20.0 million, and sales of our ‘no artificial ingredients’ 
Clover have been strong, out-performing the spreads market. 
Frylight enjoyed another impressive year reaching a record 
retail sales value of £29.9 million, a growth of 19%, allowing it to 
become the UK’s biggest oil brand. It is now bought by over a  
fifth of UK households, and its contribution to healthier cooking 
was recognised in winning the 2016 IGD ‘Health and Wellness’ 
product award.
innovation and quality
Our dedicated Innovation Centre and partnership with Harper 
Adams University gives us the opportunity to develop even more 
healthy products. In 2016 we won ‘Most Innovative Contribution to 
Business-University Collaboration’ at the Times Higher Education 
Awards in recognition of numerous research-led projects that 
Dairy Crest and Harper Adams University are engaged in together.
Our colleagues take enormous pride in the quality of the food 
we produce; this is a founding principle at the heart of our quality 
agenda. Our quality management systems are regularly reviewed 
and audited by our own technical teams and third parties to 
ensure they comply with industry standards.
Demineralised Whey and Gos
Our plant at Davidstow is now producing high quality ingredients 
for infant formula manufacturers and is showing high levels of 
consistent quality. We produce demineralised whey, which forms 
the base of infant formula, and GOS, a lactose based prebiotic 
that has been shown to help aid digestive health in infants. 
In addition, we have commenced an extensive research 
programme with universities and commercial partners to illustrate 
the benefits of GOS in animal and human nutrition. GOS may 
improve animal health, as well as food uptake, potentially leading 
to the need for lower levels of antibiotics in the animal husbandry 
industry.
sustainable, ethical sourcing 
Dairy Crest works with its suppliers to exceed best practice 
around areas including quality and traceability. We can trace milk 
and raw materials from farms and suppliers through to finished 
product.
Thanks to our Davidstow Farm Standards, all milk supplied 
to us meets the strict international standards for the production 
of infant formula. In 2016 we commenced a project to review 
the Davidstow farm audits with a view to further developing and 
enhancing the standards in 2017.
Since 1 April 2016 all palm oil used in our spreads products 
comes from RSPO certified sustainable sources, more than four 
years ahead of our original committed date.
r educing our packaging impact
To avoid sending waste to landfill, we are investing in new ways 
of packaging our products so they are not only made with less 
material and more recycled material but also that the packaging 
itself is recyclable.
We are pleased to report that all of the tubs and lids used in 
our spreads business are now recyclable.
 
We are committed to providing healthier, tasty 
products that make it easier for consumers to 
choose healthier foods and to play our part in 
helping to improve the nation’s health.

Strategic report
Our community programme supports and 
enhances the communities in which we work 
and live. Our three key priorities are supporting 
rural communities working with The Prince’s 
Countryside Fund, supporting local 
communities and employee volunteering. 
supporting rural communities
Dairy Crest recognises that the countryside continues to face 
significant challenges across a wide range of complex social and 
economic issues.
Dairy Crest has a long standing relationship with The Prince’s 
Countryside Fund. The charity, set up by HRH The Prince of Wales 
in 2010, exists to improve the prospects of family farm businesses 
and the quality of rural life. The Fund’s vision is of a confident, 
robust and sustainable agricultural and rural community which is 
appreciated for its vital contribution to the UK.
Dairy Crest donated £50,000 to the Fund in 2016/17 through 
brand partnerships with Davidstow cheddar and Country Life 
butter. We are also sponsors of The Prince’s Dairy Initiative, 
launched in 2012. The initiative has brought the dairy sector 
together to take practical action to support the sustainability of a 
diverse British dairy industry.
 
supporting local communities
Dairy Crest is committed to supporting local good causes 
in the communities where we work and live that improve 
health, education, youth engagement, employability skills, the 
environment and the countryside. 
Each Dairy Crest site is allocated a community budget.  
In total, during 2016/17, we spent over £100,000 supporting over 
75 local good causes.
We are proud to have supported local schools, care homes, 
hospices, scout and girl guiding groups and health charities to 
name but a few.
During December 2016, we donated 318 cases of Cathedral 
City cheddar, 71 cases of Country Life spreadable and 3,000 
slices of Cathedral City to the 45th Crisis at Christmas. This 
enabled the homeless charity to support approximately 4,000 
homeless guests attending the ten Crisis London centres. In total 
36,000 meals were served across the eight days that the Crisis 
centres were open.
Dairy Crest also donated 40kg of Cathedral City cheddar for 
the Chelsea Pensioners Ceremony of the Cheeses to enjoy over 
the festive season. 
Dairy Crest operates a staff lottery which is open to all 
Dairy Crest employees. This year staff have supported over 30 
charitable causes through financial donations including Surrey 
Search and Rescue, Metro Blind Sport, The Stroke Association, 
MS Society, Cerebral Palsy, Lady Taverners and Macmillan Cancer 
Support.
Dairy Crest also participated in the Calling London 2016 Winter 
Coat Drive helping reach a target of 3,500 coats which were 
distributed across London.
employee volunteering
All Dairy Crest employees are encouraged to take up their 
fully paid volunteering day each year. Measured as people 
days equivalent compared to total number of employees, this 
represents more than 1,000 volunteering days per annum.
Dairy Crest staff voluntarily deliver healthy, fresh food to 
vulnerable people in our local communities through Meals On 
Wheels. We also support release time for staff to volunteer with 
the Fire Service and other services.
We host visits to our sites for local schools, The Women’s 
Institute and young Farmer Groups. Staff also volunteer at various 
local events including providing support at days out for children 
with special needs.

As I mentioned in my Chairman’s 
statement earlier in this report, 
market conditions continued to be 
challenging during the year.
Despite these, the Company 
has continued to focus on the 
on-going execution of the Group’s 
strategy of generating growth in our 
branded and functional ingredients 
businesses, particularly following the commencement of 
manufacture of our new demineralised whey and GOS ingredients.
During the year the Management Board has been renamed the 
Executive Committee and this Committee continues to execute its 
responsibilities with the same membership and terms of reference. 
Chairman’s introduction
In addition, following the implementation of the Modern Slavery Act 
2015, the Group has published its first Modern Slavery transparency 
statement for the financial year 2015/16. The statement for financial 
year 2016/17 will be published in September 2017.
The Board is committed to high standards of corporate governance 
and supports the principles laid down in the UK Corporate 
Governance Code published in September 2014 by the Financial 
Reporting Council (‘Code’). A copy of the Code can be found at 
www.frc.org.uk. The Board considers that the Group has complied 
with all relevant provisions of the Code.
The Board recognises its collective responsibility for the governance 
of the Company. Its strong governance framework is supported by a 
combination of clear values, appropriate policy, and an environment 
of transparency and accountability. The Board’s central role is to 
work alongside the executive team providing support, challenge, 
guidance and leadership. I believe that the Board is well balanced 
with a broad range of skills, diversity and experience.
Stephen Alexander Chairman

t he Board
Role: The Board is responsible for the long-term success of the 
Group, corporate governance, strategy, risk management and 
financial performance. The Board meets regularly throughout the 
year to approve the Group’s strategic objectives, to lead the Group 
within a framework of effective controls which enable risk to be 
assessed and managed, and to ensure sufficient resources are 
available to meet the objectives set. 
There are a number of matters which are specifically reserved for the 
Board’s approval; strategy and management, structure and share 
capital, corporate governance, approval of dividends, remuneration, 
approval of significant transactions, capital expenditure and 
contracts.
In addition, the Board is responsible for ensuring appropriate values, 
ethics and behaviours for the conduct of the Company are agreed 
and that appropriate procedures and training are in place to ensure 
that these are observed throughout the Company.
The work of the Board complements, enhances and supports the 
work of the Executive Committee. We believe that effective 
governance is realised through leadership and team work. 
Collaboration across all levels within the Board structure drives a 
culture of continuous improvement in standards and performance 
across our business.
The Board and its Committee structure is set out below.
Board Committees: The Board has established five Committees:
•	 Audit Committee
•	 Corporate Responsibility Committee
•	 Executive Committee
•	 Nomination Committee
•	 Remuneration Committee
The terms of reference of these Committees can be found on our 
website and the reports of each Committee are on pages 34 to 61.
The Board delegates to the Executive Committee the execution of 
the Group’s strategy and the day-to-day management and 
operations of the Group’s business. 
Board Composition: The Board consists of three Executive 
Directors and four Non-executive Directors including the Chairman. 
A list of the current Directors, their roles on the Board and its 
Committees and their experience is set out on pages 28 to 29.
Further details on the roles and responsibilities of the Chairman and 
Chief Executive are in the document entitled ‘Chairman/Chief 
Executive Division of Responsibilities’ on the Group’s website. 
Richard Macdonald is the Company’s Senior Independent Director.
independence of Directors: The Board reviews the 
independence of its Non-executive Directors as part of its annual 
Board effectiveness review. The Chairman is committed to ensuring 
that the Board comprises a majority of independent Non-executive 
Directors who objectively challenge management, balanced against 
the need to ensure continuity on the Board. The Board considers 
that all the Non-executive Directors bring strong independent 
oversight and continue to demonstrate independence. The Board 
recognises the recommended term of appointment for Non-
executive Directors within the Code. It is mindful of the need for 
suitable succession, and therefore maintains a clear framework of 
the time each Non-executive Director has served the Company and 
the skill sets that each provide.
The Chairman periodically meets individually or collectively with the 
Non-executive Directors in the absence of the Executive Directors.

hoc meetings are held as and when required. Details of the Board 
and Committee meetings held during the 2016/17 year are set out in 
the table below.

Committee meetings during the year is shown in the table below. 
The numbers in brackets show the maximum number of meetings 
Directors could have attended during 2016/17.
Board effectiveness review: Each year the performance of the 
Board and its Committees is reviewed. The last externally facilitated 
review was carried out during the 2015/16 financial year with the 
assistance of Russell Reynolds Associates. During the year, the 
Chairman oversaw the implementation of various recommendations 
arising from the last review. This year the Board and its Committees 
carried out an effectiveness review without external assistance. The 
use of questionnaires based on the framework provided by Russell 
Reynolds Associates last year ensured year-on-year consistency 
and enabled progress against the previous year to be tracked and 
assessed. They were completed by Directors in March 2017 and the 
output from the questionnaires was used to inform a review 
discussion at the Board’s meeting in April 2017. That discussion 
included an evaluation of the Chairman of the Board’s performance, 
without the Chairman present, which was led by the Senior 
Independent Director.
Evaluation questions for the Board were grouped into four key areas; 
strategy, structure & process, people & composition, and 
stakeholders. Those four key areas were sub-divided into more 
specific areas of focus including, amongst other matters, the 
performance of the Chairman of the Board, the performance of the 
Chairmen of the Committees and the performance of Directors 
individually. Directors were also asked to comment on progress 
made against specific development opportunities identified for the 
Board in the 2015/16 effectiveness review. Committee 
questionnaires, which were also based on the framework used the 
prior year to allow consistency and for progress to be tracked, were 
completed in March 2017. Each of the Committees reviewed the 
output of the questionnaires alongside their terms of reference at 
their meetings in May 2017. Committee questionnaires focussed on, 
amongst other matters; the quality of leadership, the quality of 
debate, performance against and suitability of Committee terms of 
reference, and the quality of Committee reporting.
The Board effectiveness review concluded that:
•	 All Directors perform well and all continue to make valuable 
contributions to the work of the Board
•	 Further enhancements to the skills and experience represented 
amongst the Directors in the area of FMCG marketing and/or 
international ingredients businesses would be beneficial – more 
detail of the continued work of the Nomination Committee in that 
regard can be found on pages 38 to 39 of this Annual Report
•	 The Board, initially through the work of the Nomination Committee, 
needed to ensure continued focus on the requirement in the near 
future to ensure appropriate refreshment of Non-executive Director 
appointments
The effectiveness reviews of the Committees concluded that the 
Committees continue to perform well and to fulfil their briefs against 
their terms of reference. The review process identified, amongst 
other matters, and in particular:
•	 The need for greater rigour in the reporting of all Committees to 
the Board
•	 That the importance of the Corporate Responsibility Committee 
needed further emphasis so that it is demonstrably given as much 
prominence and focus as the longer standing Audit, Nomination 
and Remuneration Committees. To that end it was decided that 
progress by the Group against the four pillars of the CR strategy 
should be added to the Executive Committee’s work programme 
for quarterly review (in addition to the existing regular reviews of 
health & safety and technical, quality & environmental 
performance). Doing so will ensure continuous rigorous 
operational focus on all of the pillars of the CR strategy. In addition, 
on days when the Board has Committee meetings, the Corporate 
Responsibility Committee meeting shall be scheduled as the first 
of the Committee meetings to ensure that it receives appropriate 
focus and that sufficient time is devoted to it, equivalent to that of 
the more established Committees. 32 Dairy Crest Annual Report 2017
Director induction and training: All new Directors undergo a 
comprehensive induction programme on appointment. In addition to 
equipping Directors with sufficiently detailed knowledge of the 
operations of the Group’s business to enable them effectively to 
carry out their duties, the induction programme is tailored to their 
experience, background and particular areas of focus. On-going 
training is provided for the Board by way of site visits, presentations 
and circulation of updates on, amongst other things, corporate 
governance, environmental, regulatory developments and investor 
relations matters.
On appointment Adam Braithwaite received one to one training on 
directors’ duties and responsibilities from the Group’s external 
solicitors, Eversheds Sutherland (International) LLP. 
During the year the Market Abuse Regulation which came into effect 
in July 2016 was a particular point of focus and the Board was fully 
briefed on the updated inside information and share dealing policies 
and procedures arising from the new regulations.
Conflicts of interest: The Company’s Articles of Association 
(‘Articles’) allow the Directors, where appropriate, to authorise 
conflicts or possible conflicts of interest between Directors and the 
Company. In addition, Non-executive Directors’ letters of 
appointment require them to obtain the prior approval of the Board 
to appointments external to the Company where those 
appointments might affect the time they are able to devote to their 
role. When considering conflicts or potential conflicts of interest, the 
conflicted or potentially conflicted Director is excluded from 
participation in the Board’s consideration of the conflict or potential 
conflict situation.
Procedures are in place for Directors to disclose conflicts or potential 
conflicts of interest. As at April 2017 the Directors all confirmed that 
they had no present or anticipated conflicts of interest. No Director 
had a material interest in any significant contract with the Company 
or any of its subsidiaries during the year.
Appointment and re-election of Directors: The Articles provide 
that the Directors or the members, by ordinary resolution, may 
appoint a Director to fill a vacancy or as an additional director. The 
Articles require all Directors to be re-elected annually. All Directors 
will stand for re-election at the Company’s 2017 Annual General 
Meeting (‘AGM’) except for Adam Braithwaite, who consistent with 
the Articles, will stand for election having been appointed since the 
last AGM. Having regard to the roles performed by each of the 
Directors, the individual input and contribution they make and their 
individual expertise and experience, the Board is satisfied that each 
Director’s performance justifies nomination for election or re-election 
by shareholders. 
Service agreements and letters of appointment: Details of the 
Executive Directors’ service agreements and the Chairman and 
Non-executive Directors’ letters of appointment are published on the 
Company’s website and appear in the Directors’ Remuneration 
report on page 47. These documents are available for inspection at 
the registered office of the Company during normal business hours 
or at the AGM.
independent advice: The Board has approved a procedure for 
Directors to take independent professional advice at the Company’s 
expense if necessary. No such advice was sought by any Director 
during the year. In addition, the Directors have direct access to the 
advice and services of the Company Secretary.
Shareholder engagement: The Company recognises its 
responsibility for ensuring that a satisfactory dialogue takes place 
with shareholders. This continued engagement is highly beneficial to 
all parties as it helps to build a greater understanding of our 
investors’ views, opinions and concerns. The Chief Executive and 
Group Finance Director have primary responsibility for investor 
relations. 
Throughout the year the Board has continued to maintain an active 
programme of engagement with investors with regular meetings held 
with key institutional shareholders to discuss strategy, financial 
performance and investment activities. This year the Chief Executive 
and Group Finance Director met with over 90 investors in eleven 
major cities in the UK, Europe, North America and Canada.
Analysts and investors are invited to our capital markets day each 
year and this year it was held at our Davidstow creamery. It focussed 
on the dairy market, the Company’s strategy and performance and 
included a tour of the new demineralised whey and GOS 
manufacturing facilities. The event was attended by the Chief 
Executive, Group Finance Director, Group Commercial Director and 
other senior management. In addition there were further shareholder 
visits to both Davidstow and our Nuneaton site.
Presentation slides are made available in the investors section of the 
Company’s website along with audio recordings, annual and interim 
reports, interim management statements, trading updates and 
company announcements. 
All the Non-executive Directors, and, in particular, the Chairman and 
Senior Independent Director, are available to meet with 
shareholders. Feedback from meetings with shareholders is 
provided to the Board to ensure that all Directors have a balanced 
understanding of the issues and concerns of shareholders. The 
Board receives feedback from the Chief Executive and the Group 
Finance Director on their meetings with shareholders, periodic 
reports on investor relations and independent feedback from the 
Company’s brokers on the views of major shareholders. 
Risk management and internal control
The Board determines the nature and extent of the significant risks it 
is willing to take in achieving its strategic objectives. It has overall 
responsibility for monitoring the Group’s risk management and 
internal control systems and the effectiveness of those systems. It is 
assisted in that task by the Audit Committee and the Group Internal 
Audit function. There is an on-going process for identifying, 
evaluating and managing the principal risks facing the Group. The 
Board has delegated responsibility for management of day-to-day 
operational risks to the Executive Committee. The Audit Committee 
conducts reviews of the internal control systems and the Board 
reviews them annually. The principal risks and uncertainties identified 
by the Group are set out on pages 16 to 17 along with the steps 
which are taken to mitigate and manage them. The Board has 
satisfied itself that its systems accord with the FRC’s Guidance on 
Risk Management, Internal Control and Related Financial and 
Business Reporting and that satisfactory internal control procedures 
and systems have been in place throughout the year and up to and 
including the date of this Report in compliance with the requirements 
of the Code. 
A rolling audit programme conducted by Group Internal Audit across 
the Group forms a key facet of the Group’s systems of internal 
control. The Head of Group Internal Audit reports independently to 
the Chairman of the Audit Committee on assurance matters. Under 
its terms of reference, the Audit Committee, amongst other matters, 
approves the appointment or dismissal of the Head of Group Internal 
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE CONTINUED Dairy Crest Annual Report 2017 33
Governance
Audit and the Audit Committee Chairman approves the 
remuneration of the Head of Group Internal Audit. It is not possible to 
eliminate risk entirely. Accordingly, although the Group’s systems are 
designed to manage risks they cannot provide absolute assurance 
against material misstatement or loss. They provide reasonable 
assurance that potential issues can be identified promptly and 
remedied appropriately. The key components of the risk 
management and internal control systems include:
•	 The adoption and communication of clearly documented values, 
policies, procedures and processes, including, amongst others, 
the Group’s Business Conduct Policy
•	 Reservation to the Board of control of, amongst other matters, all 
significant strategic, financial and organisational risks
•	 A management structure which includes clear lines of 
responsibility and documented delegations of authority with 
appropriate policies, levels and rules for, amongst other matters, 
incurring capital expenditure or divesting of the Group’s assets
•	 The operation of comprehensive financial and strategic planning, 
forecasting and review processes
•	 Exercise of oversight by the Audit Committee, with input from the 
Head of Group Internal Audit, over the Group’s control processes 
designed to ensure the integrity of internal and external financial 
reporting
•	 The preparation of monthly management accounts packs for the 
business, including KPI dashboards for each constituent part of 
the Group’s business, trading results, balance sheet and cash flow 
information with comparison against prior year and budget, all of 
which are reviewed by the Executive Committee and the Board
•	 Monthly scrutiny of performance against budget (including 
analysis of key trends, variances and key risks and plans for 
mitigation as well as the continued appropriateness of those risks) 
in monthly meetings referred to as Accounts Reviews where each 
key constituent part of the Group and key departments report 
performance year-to-date and forecast against budget to a panel 
comprising the Executive Committee and other senior managers
•	 Formal documented financial controls and procedures including 
specific procedures for treasury transactions and the approval of 
significant contracts
•	 Quarterly completion by each key constituent part of the Group of 
a self-assessment controls questionnaire that requires the 
approval of management
•	 Preparation and refreshment of risk registers which are reviewed 
by senior management, the Executive Committee and the Board 
with the assignment of individual responsibility for the ownership 
and mitigation of significant risks to members of the Executive 
Committee and independent assurance over the appropriate 
implementation and operation of mitigating activities provided by 
Group Internal Audit
•	 Review by the Audit Committee of the Group’s risk register 
processes
•	 Review and approval of the audit plan for the Group Internal Audit 
function together with progress against and revision of the plan as 
appropriate, throughout the year
•	 Receipt by the Audit Committee and the Executive Committee of 
all Group Internal Audit reports detailing audit issues noted, 
corrective action plans and progress against those plans
•	 The operation of an integrated business planning process with 
formal procedures for highlighting on a monthly cycle financial 
performance and risks to budgetary delivery together with 
associated opportunities to counteract or mitigate those risks to 
performance
f air balanced and understandable: Provision C.1 of the Code 
requires the Directors to present a fair, balanced and understandable 
assessment of the Company’s position and prospects. When the 
provision was first introduced to the Code, the Audit Committee 
adopted a detailed process to enable the Board to report against 
this principle of the Code. The resultant more structured approach 
(see table below) to the preparation of the Report and Accounts has 
been applied in the production of this Report and Accounts which 
the Board formally signed off at its meeting in May 2017.

The Board’s assessment of the fair, balanced and understandable 
nature of the Annual Report and Accounts is further assisted by, 
amongst other matters, the following:
 – The Annual Report and Accounts is drafted by senior 
management with overall coordination by the Company Secretary 
& General Counsel.
 – An internal validation process is undertaken by Group Internal 
Audit to ensure factual accuracy.
 – Comprehensive reviews of the draft Annual Report and Accounts 
are undertaken by Executive Committee members and in relation 
to certain sections by the Company’s external lawyers, the 
external auditor and other advisers.
 – The drafts of each relevant section are reviewed as they are 
prepared through an iterative drafting process by the Chairmen of 
appropriate Committees of the Board and the final draft is 
reviewed by those Committees prior to consideration by the 
Board.
At its May 2017 meeting, the Board reviewed and was satisfied that 
the Annual Report and Accounts for financial year 2016/17, taken as 
a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and the Board 
believes that the information contained therein provides the 
information necessary for shareholders to assess the Company’s 
and Group’s performance, position, business model and strategy. 34 Dairy Crest Annual Report 2017
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE CONTINUED
As Chairman of the Audit 
Committee, I am pleased to present 
the Audit Committee’s report for the 
year ended 31 March 2017.
During the year, the Committee has 
continued to play a key role within 
the Group’s governance framework 
to support the Board in matters 
relating to internal control, risk 
management and financial reporting.
Over the following pages we provide insight into the workings 
of the Committee and its activities during the year. The report 
provides an overview of the significant issues the Committee 
has assessed and the Committee’s opinion on the 2017 Annual 
Report and Accounts as a whole, including how it has assessed 
the narrative reporting in the front of the report to accurately report 
the financial statements in the back.
 Audit Committee report
The Committee members as Directors of the Company have an in 
depth understanding and ownership of the Company’s strategy. 
They receive regular updates on strategic progress together with 
insight concerning day-to-day performance through the receipt of 
the Executive Committee meeting minutes and monthly 
management accounts. This enables the Committee to determine 
areas of focus in addition to its regular work programme. During the 
year we paid particular attention to controls following the major 
reorganisation arising from the disposal of the Dairies business and 
the large scale investment programme at Davidstow.
Of specific importance this year has been the oversight of a formal 
tender process for the Group’s statutory auditor contract, following 
the retirement by rotation of the Group’s current auditor, Ernst & 
Young (‘EY’). Following the audit tender and the recommendations of 
the Audit Committee, the Board has appointed Deloitte LLP 
(‘Deloitte’) as its external auditor for the year commencing 1 April 
2017. The appointment will be subject to shareholder approval at the 
2017 AGM.
Looking forward to the next 12 months, the Committee will continue 
to focus on the audit, assurance, and risks processes within the 
business, as well as monitoring changes in EU and UK regulation, 
including the impact of Brexit. We will also implement a more formal 
appraisal process of the quality of our external audit.
I would like to thank the other members of the Committee and Dairy 
Crest’s Internal Audit and Finance teams for their on-going support. I 
would particularly like to record my thanks to EY for their contribution 
to the Committee and the Company over many years.
Andrew Carr-Locke Chairman of the Audit Committee 
17 May 2017
Summary of the more significant risks and financial 
reporting issues 
The Committee is responsible for reviewing the effectiveness of the 
Group’s framework for risk management and financial controls, and 
ensuring that the Group’s procedures are updated as and when 
required. On behalf of the Board, the Committee has carried out a 
robust assessment of the principal risks facing the Company. The 
Committee has discussed with management the key estimations 
and judgements applied to the Group’s financial statements and the 
impact of significant accounting matters arising during the year. The 
main items discussed were:
1. Revenue recognition 
The Group’s accounting policy for promotional accruals provides 
that the Group accrues for agreed promotional funding, which is 
calculated based on a number of estimates and judgements relating 
to promotions. The Committee has reviewed the levels of 
promotional accruals and considered the results of the interim 
review and the audit conducted by EY which assessed the design of 
controls around this area and tested samples to underlying 
documentation. The Committee was satisfied with the judgements 
made by management in respect of the accounting policy for 
promotional accruals and that the revenue reported for the year had 
been appropriately recognised.
2. Exceptional items 
The Group’s accounting policy on exceptional items provides that 
items of a material, one-off nature are classified as exceptional. The 
Committee considered the nature and levels of exceptional items 
associated with both the continuing and discontinued operations 
together with the results of the interim review and the audit 
conducted by EY. The Committee was satisfied that exceptional 
items had been appropriately classified and disclosed, treated 
consistently and that discussions with management were 
transparent.
3. Goodwill
The goodwill held by the Group is reviewed for impairment on an 
annual basis. This exercise requires management to make an 
estimate of future cash flows. The Committee has considered the 
impairment review completed by management and the findings of 
the external auditor; it is satisfied that the assumptions made in 
concluding that no impairment has been required are appropriate. 
4. Retirement benefit obligations
The valuation of the Group’s retirement benefit obligations is made at 
each reporting date in accordance with international financial 
reporting standards. The valuation is subject to a number of 
assumptions and estimates and the Committee is satisfied that 
those made at 31 March 2017 are appropriate. 
5. o ther income – property
The Group recognises the profit on disposal of closed depots as 
‘Other Income – Property’. The Committee has considered this 
treatment; both the Committee and the external auditor are satisfied 
that it is appropriate.
6. Non-current assets held for sale
The Group has classified some closed properties as non-current 
assets held for sale on the basis that they meet the criteria under 
international financial reporting standards. The Committee is 
satisfied that the assumptions made around the timing of the 
disposals are appropriate. Dairy Crest Annual Report 2017 35
Governance
7. Dilapidations liability
A contingent liability has been disclosed in respect of a potential 
dilapidation liability relating to Chadwell Heath, a manufacturing site 
disposed of with the Dairies business. The Committee has 
considered the Group’s position and together with the external 
auditor is satisfied that the disclosure as a contingent liability is 
appropriate.
8. Litigation liability
There are a number of contractual disputes in relation to the 
demineralised whey and GOS capital project at Davidstow. Both 
claims made by, and against, the Group remain outstanding at 31 
March 2017. The Committee has considered the Group’s position 
and both the Committee and the external auditor are satisfied that 
the disclosure as a contingent liability is appropriate.
9. o perating segments
Management has judged that the Group operates as one segment 
under international financial reporting standards. This judgement has 
remained unchanged from the prior year and the Committee is 
satisfied this is appropriate and supports the voluntary disclosure 
provided in Note 1 to the Accounts.
10. Deferred tax
The Committee has considered the recoverability of tax losses that 
have arisen from various unprofitable operations and rationalisation 
initiatives of the Group. The Committee discussed with both 
management and the external auditor the key judgements which 
had been made and was satisfied that the judgements were 
reasonable and that, accordingly, the deferred tax asset recognised 
in the accounts is appropriate.
11. f air balanced and understandable 
The Committee has considered whether the 2017 Report and 
Accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable 
and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess 
the Group’s position, performance, business model and strategy. 
The Committee was satisfied with the process which had been 
followed for the preparation of the 2017 Report and Accounts; it has 
reviewed and provided feedback on the content of the draft Report 
for consideration by the Board and the Report was amended to 
incorporate this feedback. 
Following this review, the Committee was of the opinion that the 
2017 Report and Accounts is representative of the year and 
presents a fair, balanced and understandable overview, providing 
the necessary information for shareholders.
12. Going concern 
The Committee reviewed management’s assessment of the Group’s 
ability to continue as a going concern in line with the guidance 
published by the Financial Reporting Council (‘FRC’). The 
assessment included a review of the principal risks facing the Group, 
their financial impact, how they were being managed, together with 
a discussion as to the appropriate period for assessment. The 
Group’s viability statement is included in the Directors’ report on 
page 62.
13. Effectiveness of internal Audit
The Committee engaged a third party to conduct a review of the 
effectiveness of the Group’s Internal Audit function. Overall the 
Internal Audit function substantially meets key stakeholders’ 
expectations and provides a good source of assurance for the 
Committee. The Committee supported the recommendations made 
and has worked with the Head of Internal Audit to implement them.
Membership: The Committee is composed entirely of independent 
Non-executive Directors. The current members and details of their 
attendance at meetings are set out on page 31. The Committee 
members have between them a wide range of business and financial 
experience appropriate to the sector in which the Company 
operates. The Board considers that Andrew Carr-Locke has recent 
and relevant financial experience for the purposes of the Code.
invitations to attend meetings: A standing invitation is made to 
the Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive, the Group Finance 
Director and the Group Commercial Director to attend the 
Committee’s meetings. The Group Financial Controller, Head of 
Internal Audit and representatives of the external auditor attend all 
meetings. In addition, the Committee holds private meetings with the 
Head of Internal Audit and with the external auditor.
Role: The Committee oversees and reviews the Group’s financial 
reporting processes, the consistency of the Group’s accounting 
policies, the effectiveness of the Group’s accounting and business 
risk systems and the Group’s Internal Audit function, the external 
audit process and relationship with the external auditor, and the 
Group’s process for monitoring compliance with applicable laws and 
regulations. 
t erms of reference: The Committee’s terms of reference, which 
are reviewed annually by the Committee, take into account relevant 
legislation and recommended good practice. The terms of reference 
were reviewed in March 2017 and can be found on the Group’s 
website. 36 Dairy Crest Annual Report 2017

External Auditor: 
The Committee considers that the relationship with the current 
auditor is working well and is satisfied with the effectiveness. As 
reported in the 2016 Annual Report, the Committee concluded that 
a tender for the external audit contract should take place during 
2016 to enable the appointment of a new external auditor for the 
start of the 2017/18 financial year. EY has been the Company’s and 
Group’s external auditor since 1996 and the external audit 
appointment has not been tendered competitively since EY’s 
appointment. Accordingly EY is retiring by rotation and was not 
invited to tender. 
External auditor tender process: 
Process and selection criteria
The tender process was overseen by the Chairman of the 
Committee and carried out in compliance with the provisions of the 
Competition and Markets Authority Audit Order 2014 (‘CMA Order’). 
A selection committee was appointed, comprising the Chairman of 
the Committee, a Non-executive Director who is also a member of 
the Audit Committee, the Group Finance Director and Group 
Financial Controller. The process was supported by the Group’s 
third party procurement specialists. The selection criteria adopted by 
the selection committee closely followed those detailed in the Audit 
Tender notes of best practice set out by the FRC as at July 2013 
(namely, quality and clarity of approach, understanding of the 
business and risks, appropriate geographic breadth, appropriate 
team structure and experience, cultural fit and approach to 
independence and conflict issues). 
Due to the nature and size of the Group’s business, a mid-tier 
accountancy firm was invited to tender alongside other larger firms, 
but investors’ views were not sought on the list of tender 
participants. 
Process summary from 9 August 2016 to 2 December 2016
A Request for Proposal (‘RFP’) was issued by the Chairman of the 
Committee to these firms on 9 August 2016.
Knowledge and information meetings were held between RFP firms 
and senior management from key functions as well as the Chief 
Executive, Group Finance Director and the Chairman of the 
Committee. In addition the firms all took up the opportunity to visit 
two of the Group’s factories.
The firms submitted their final written tenders on 3 October 2016 
which were measured against the selection criteria and agreed by 
the selection committee. This was followed by a formal presentation 
to the selection committee on 24 November 2016 at which each firm 
was questioned in relation to its audit approach and on issues of 
independence. 
An Audit Committee meeting was convened on 2 December 2016 to 
consider the outcome of the selection committee’s review of the 
tender responses. The selection committee recommended Deloitte 
as its preferred firm and Deloitte was invited to present to the 
Committee. On the recommendation of the Audit Committee and 
subject to shareholder approval, the Board appointed Deloitte as the 
Group’s new external auditor.
A resolution to appoint Deloitte as the Group’s external auditor is 
included in the Notice of 2017 AGM. Dairy Crest Annual Report 2017 37
Governance
Auditor’s independency policy: The Committee has an 
established policy to safeguard and support the independence and 
objectivity of the Group’s external auditor, which complies with the 
provisions of the CMA Order. The key principle of the policy is that 
the Group’s external auditor may be engaged to provide services 
only in cases where those services do not impair its independence 
and objectivity, and provided that the total annual fees for non-audit 
services are below the sum of annual fees for audit and audit-related 
services.
The external auditor may not be engaged to provide services if the 
provision of such services would result in the external auditor:
 – having a mutual or conflicting interest with any Group company;
 – being placed in the position of auditing its own work;
 – acting as a manager or employee of any Group company; or
 – being placed in the position of advocate for any Group company.
The Committee’s assessment of EY’s independence during the year 
was underpinned by the Group’s policy on the use of the external 
auditor for the provision of non-audit services. The policy contains a 
presumption against the use of the external auditor for non-audit 
services. The external auditor may only be engaged for the provision 
of non-audit services in contravention of that presumption where 
those services are expressly permitted under the policy and where 
there is a demonstrable efficiency, audit enhancement or cost 
benefit resulting from the engagement of the external auditor. 
Furthermore, before it may be engaged for the provision of such 
non-audit services, alternative providers must have been considered 
and discounted. This policy has been updated to reflect the FRC’s 
revised ethical standard 2016 and revised guidance on audit 
committees 2016, including an update to expand the list of 
prohibited non-audit services.
Services which the external auditor is prohibited from providing to 
the Group include, amongst others:
•	 Bookkeeping services and preparation of financial information
•	 The design, supply or implementation of financial information 
systems
•	 Appraisal or valuation services
•	 Internal audit services
•	 Actuarial services
A breakdown of audit and non-audit fees paid to EY in 2016/17 is 
summarised in the following table, together with a comparison with 
fees paid in 2015/16:
2016/17
£m
2015/16
£m
t otal audit fees 0.5 0.4
Non-audit fees
   Taxation services 0.1 0.1
   Other non-audit services 0.1 0.1
t otal non-audit fees 0.2 0.2
total f ees 0.7 0.6
Details of the non-audit work undertaken by EY during the year are 
set out at Note 2 to the Accounts at page 84. The Committee was 
satisfied that the overall levels of audit related and non-audit fees 
were not material relative to the income of the external auditor firm 
as a whole. It was satisfied that the objectivity and independence of 
the external auditor was maintained throughout the year.  38 Dairy Crest Annual Report 2017
In addition to considering the need for additional skills and 
experience to help us with the development of our business, on 
which I comment further below, the Committee has given 
consideration during the year to succession planning for Non-
executive Directors and to strengthening further the Executive 
Director presence on the Board. As a result, in July, the Committee 
made its recommendation to the Board that Adam Braithwaite 
should be appointed to the Board as an Executive Director.
The Committee considered the benefit of bringing new talent onto 
the Board as well as ensuring senior representation of the sales and 
marketing function at the Board now and into the future. Adam’s 
promotion to the Board recognised that in his service to Dairy Crest 
of more than 14 years, during which time he has held a variety of 
senior management positions, Adam possesses a depth of 
knowledge of the business which would not be brought to the Board 
through external recruitment. He was appointed to the role of Group 
Commercial Director in 2013 with responsibility for sales and 
marketing and his promotion to the Board recognised his deep 
knowledge of the business and his relationships with key 
stakeholders, as well as the significance of his role and his valuable 
contribution to Dairy Crest.
In addition to considering the ‘bench strength’ of the Executive 
Directors the Committee considered the need to augment further 
the experience of the wider Board. The effectiveness review 
conducted with the assistance of Russell Reynolds Associates last 
year identified that the majority of Directors believed that it would be 
beneficial to increase the number of Non-executive Directors from 
four to five.
The Nomination Committee has appointed the Zygos Partnership as 
headhunters to conduct a search for an additional Non-executive 
Director. The Zygos Partnership has been used by the Company in 
previous Non-executive Director searches but has no other 
connections with the Company. They have been asked to prepare a 
long list of candidates with international experience in either FMCG 
and/or ingredients businesses. The Committee will narrow the long 
list to a shortlist for interview and recommendation to the Board. In 
compiling a long list Zygos has been instructed to include 
candidates representing the most diverse range of backgrounds 
possible, including, but not limited to gender, ethnicity, nationality 
and personal background.
The Committee has also spent time during the year considering 
succession for Non-executive Directors in light of their length of 
service and the requirements of the Code. Andrew Carr-Locke is the 
longest serving of the independent Non-executive Directors having 
been appointed to the Board in August 2009. By the end of this year 
Nomination Committee report
he will have served 8 years on the Board and the Committee intends 
to conduct a search exercise for his replacement during late 2017/
early 2018. Andrew is an exceptionally able Audit Committee 
Chairman and the Committee will be looking for candidates with 
recent and relevant financial experience which will enable them to 
take on the role of chairing the Audit Committee. It is the 
Committee’s intention to ensure that sufficient time is allowed for an 
appropriate hand-over period from Andrew to his successor. 
Accordingly, it is the Committee’s intention to have concluded the 
search process in time to make recommendations to the Board so 
that an appointment may be made by April 2018 enabling the 
incoming Audit Committee chairman to shadow the Audit 
Committee’s activities related to the 2017/18 financial year-end 
process.
In addition to the matters referred to above, during the new 2017/18 
financial year the Committee will also be focussing on mapping out 
the succession requirements associated with other Non-executive 
Directors. In November this year, Richard Macdonald will have 
completed 7 years’ service on the Board, including 3 years as 
chairman of the Remuneration Committee. The Committee is 
conscious of the recommendation that before being appointed to 
chair a remuneration committee, individuals should have served at 
least a year on a board as a non-executive. The effect of that is to 
require even longer forward planning for the recruitment of 
remuneration committee chair successors than was previously the 
case. With that in mind, the Committee is conscious that the 
recruitment of a successor for Richard would need to have been 
concluded by November 2018. Moreover, the Committee is 
conscious that the burden associated with chairing a remuneration 
committee has increased significantly over recent years. As a result, 
the pool of individuals with the requisite experience for the role may 
not be as broad as for other roles. Accordingly, sufficient time needs 
to be allowed for a longer more challenging search process. 
Although there remains ample time to conduct a search, the 
Committee is thinking ahead and intends to start a search in mid 
2018 to allow time for recruitment of the best possible candidate.
The Committee is satisfied that it has performed its duties under its 
terms of reference, including:
Director appointments: The Committee’s primary responsibility is 
to consider and recommend to the Board candidates who are 
appropriate for appointment as Executive and Non-executive 
Directors. Its objective is to maintain an appropriate balance of skills 
and experience on the Board and to ensure progressive refreshment 
of the Board.
Processes for Director appointments: The process for the 
appointment of new Directors is rigorous and transparent. The 
Committee ensures that the recruitment exercise for Directors is 
conducted against a documented brief setting out the requirements 
of the role and the skills and experience required of the person to fill 
it. In the past, the Company has engaged the services of external 
search consultancies and as referred to above, it is anticipated, in 
the ordinary course, that it would do so in the future. Were it not to 
do so, open advertising would be used as an alternative. Prospective 
appointees are interviewed by the Committee and the Committee 
makes a recommendation to the Board. The Board makes the 
decision whether to appoint the recommended individual. The 
Committee reports the outcome of its meetings to the Board.
Director commitments: The Committee evaluates the 
commitments of individual Directors. The Board believes that it is in 
the best interests of the Company that Executive Directors take up 
opportunities to act as non-executive directors in other appropriate 
I am pleased to present my report 
for the 2016/17 financial year 
as Chairman of the Nomination 
Committee. Last year I reported 
that the Committee’s main focus 
would be on considering expanding 
the Board. The Committee’s aim, 
in particular, was to explore adding 
further relevant skills and experience 
to those of the existing Directors 
reflecting the demands of our changing business following the 
successful sale of the Dairies business and the establishment of 
our added value ingredients business.

companies. Unless the Board approves otherwise, Executive 
Directors may serve in a non-executive capacity on the board of one 
other company. Non-executive Directors may serve as directors, 
executive or otherwise, on the boards of other companies or 
appropriate organisations. Non-executive Directors’ letters of 
appointment require them to seek prior approval from the Board 
before accepting any additional commitment that might affect the 
time that they are able to devote to their role as a Non-executive 
Director of the Company. The Board has the opportunity to satisfy 
itself that Non-executive Directors’ other commitments allow them to 
devote adequate time to their commitments to the Company. The 
Board approved all new appointments of Directors during the year 
and is satisfied that all Directors continue to have sufficient time to 
devote themselves properly to their duties for the Company.
Diversity: The Committee monitors diversity on behalf of the Board. 
The Group interprets diversity in its widest sense and aims to 
achieve the best possible leadership for the Group by ensuring an 
appropriate mix of skills, backgrounds, gender, experience and 
knowledge amongst its Directors, senior managers and other 
employees. The Committee considers that first and foremost, 
appointments must be made based on an objective assessment of 
who is the best person to fill a role, with candidates drawn from a 
diverse range of backgrounds. The Company has not adopted 
targets for female representation amongst the Directors. The Group 
will continue to operate policies giving equal opportunities to all, 
irrespective of age, gender, marital status, disability, nationality, 
colour, ethnic origin, sexual orientation or religious affiliation.
Board effectiveness: The Board normally undertakes an annual 
effectiveness review. In accordance with the Code, every three 
years, it uses the services of an external facilitator to facilitate its 
effectiveness review. Last year’s review of the effectiveness of the 
Board, its Committees and of me as Chairman was conducted with 
the assistance of Russell Reynolds Associates. This year I led a 
review of the effectiveness of the Board and its Committees with the 
assistance of the Company Secretary and the Senior Independent 
Director, who led the review of my performance. Details of that 
review can be found at page 31.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE CONTINUED
During the year we have concluded our review of our corporate 
responsibility strategy resulting in the approval by the Committee 
and the adoption by the Group of a simplified strategy centred 
around four key pillars; ‘Climate’, ‘Colleagues’, ‘Consumers’ and 
‘Community’. Having previously adopted the language of Business in 
the Community’s corporate responsibility structure, we felt that our 
corporate responsibility programme was sufficiently established to 
allow us to move away from slavishly aping that structure. We also 
believed it was important to adopt language which would resonate 
better with our employees, hence the change to the four new 
strategic pillars.
We have also re-affirmed ownership of each of the pillars by a 
member of the senior management team. We felt that direct 
individual accountability for each of the pillars of our strategy would 
help to drive ownership within the business and thereby help to drive 
progress. Mike Barrington our Group Supply Chain Director owns 
‘Climate’, ‘Colleagues’ is owned by Robert Willock our Group HR 
Director, Adam Braithwaite our Group Commercial Director owns 
‘Consumers’ and finally, ‘Community’ is owned by Tom Atherton,  
our Group Finance Director. In addition to adopting new pillars for 
our corporate responsibility strategy, we have adopted new 
simplified pledges which reflect the simpler structure of our business 
following the sale of the Dairies business. We have been careful to 
ensure though that with these key pledges we remain able to track 
progress from the beginning of our new five year corporate 
responsibility programme.
More detail on our achievements and progress can be found on 
pages 22 to 27 of this Annual Report but I wanted to pull out the 
following highlights for your attention:
•	 We increased the amount of on-site renewable energy to 63% of 
fuel used by manufacturing sites in our business from 51% in the 
prior year
•	 Our focus on low carbon manufacturing has seen a 4% reduction 
in relative energy use at our Kirkby, Frome and Nuneaton sites 
compared to the prior year
•	 Around 80% of the heat required by our Davidstow creamery was 
produced from biomass with energy from biomass boilers 
representing more than 40% of the Group‘s total energy use in the 
year. This means we met our pledge that more than one third of 
total energy used should come from on-site renewables
•	 Higher water recovery rates towards the end of the year meant 
that around 45% of water used in manufacturing by our business 
came from recycled sources
I am pleased to present the report 
of the Corporate Responsibility 
Committee to shareholders. 
Full details of our corporate 
responsibility programme can 
be found at pages 22 to 27. The 
Committee oversees the Group’s 
corporate responsibility programme 
and ensures that key social, 
ethical and environmental issues 
are assessed and prioritised including reviewing the Company’s 
corporate responsibility pledges. In addition to me as Chairman, 
the Committee comprises Richard Macdonald, Mark Allen, Tom 
Atherton, Robin Miller, Robert Willock, Adam Braithwaite and 
Simon Hewitt (Group Technical Director).

•	 We exceeded our target of 80% segregation of operational waste 
on site by year end
•	 We achieved a 69% reduction in Accident Incident Rate in the last 
year versus the 2013 baseline against which we measure 
ourselves
•	 During 2016/17 we managed to achieve zero RIDDORS. We are 
particularly proud of this achievement, especially as we have 
continued to hold ourselves to account against the more 
stretching, but superseded, definition of a RIDDOR where 
incapacitation is suffered for more than 3 days rather than the 
softer definition which the HSE has adopted where an incident 
needs to result in incapacitation for more than 7 days to be 
classified as a RIDDOR
•	 80% of the Group’s employees attended a roadshow presented 
by members of the Executive Committee which covered topics 
ranging from the Group’s Vision and Values to our business plans 
and progress against them
•	 Lower fat variants of our products collectively achieved a retail 
sales value of £84.0 million an increase of 3.2% on the prior year
Last year I talked of the Committee’s recognition of the need 
continually to evolve our corporate responsibility strategy in order to 
meet the changing demands of our customers, employees and the 
consumers of the great products we make. By evolving our 
corporate responsibility strategy and pledges as we have during the 
year the Committee has demonstrated that commitment to 
evolution.
A successful approach to corporate responsibility is, we believe, an 
essential part of securing a sustainable business which thrives both 
today and in the future.

Company performance over the year
2016/17 has been the first full year following the successful sale of 
our Dairies business to Müller in December 2015. Our business is 
now almost entirely branded or added value and we have a clear 
strategy for future growth. We have delivered another good branded 
performance this year through investment in product innovation, 
promotional activity and advertising. We will continue to develop our 
portfolio. Our innovation is beginning to generate new business 
opportunities by selling demineralised whey and GOS into growing 
infant formula markets globally.
Overall, the Group has delivered increased adjusted profit before tax 
and adjusted earnings per share and is recommending an increased 
final dividend of 16.3 pence per share.
DireCtors’ remuneration report
r eview of remuneration policy
In carrying out the remuneration review this year, the Committee was 
mindful of the significant changes to Dairy Crest’s business model 
since our existing Policy was adopted, in combination with the 
evolving external executive pay environment. Over the last three 
years many shareholders have been supportive of the nature of the 
current long-term incentive plan within our existing policy, a 
performance-on-grant model called the Long Term Alignment Plan 
(‘LTAP’), in particular noting the alignment with the business strategy 
achieved through the scorecard. However, the Committee also 
recognises the challenges raised by some shareholders in relation to 
the operation of the scheme and a more general dislike of 
performance-on-grant models and that, as such, some would be 
unlikely to be supportive of it as part of Dairy Crest’s future policy. 
Therefore the last grant under the LTAP will be made this year, based 
on the assessment of performance against the scorecard which was 
disclosed in last year’s Remuneration report.  
In developing a revised long-term arrangement to be included in the 
future policy, the Committee considered the full spectrum of 
alternatives with the aim of creating the best alignment with the 
business and its strategy. We have transformed the Group into a 
high margin, added value and branded business. However, our 
operating model and sector does continue to result in potential 
earnings volatility. Our primary raw material, milk, is subject to 
significant price volatility which cannot be hedged and, as a result of 
the manufacturing process, there is a lag between when the cost of 
raw materials is incurred in manufacturing cheese and when the 
product sales are recognised on average nearly 12 months later (the 
average maturity of our cheese). This dynamic is unique to 
companies such as Dairy Crest and results in potential margin 
volatility which is not consistent with a smooth progression in 
earnings over several years. 
In light of this volatility, setting robust long-term financial earnings or 
cash targets which are appropriately stretching is extremely 
challenging, as price volatility can generate a boom or bust vesting 
outcome which is not within management’s control. The Committee 
also wanted to simplify the arrangements, increase transparency 
and maximise alignment with shareholders. As a result of these 
factors we concluded that a restricted share arrangement would be 
optimal for the business to achieve these goals. Our proposed 
approach for restricted shares included a number of trade-offs to 
reflect the increased certainty of the award for management, 
comprising a significantly reduced opportunity level, a vesting period 
of five years and the inclusion of a dividend underpin.
We consulted with our largest shareholders and shareholder bodies 
on this proposal and whilst many were supportive, a number of 
shareholders and a proxy body were not able to confirm their 
support for our proposed approach. In the current environment and 
given this uncertainty the Committee therefore determined that it 
would not be appropriate to put restricted shares forward as a 
proposal at the 2017 AGM.
Since this decision was made, the House of Commons Select 
Committee on Corporate Governance published its findings which 
included support for restricted shares in line with the approach we 
were considering. As such, we intend to continue to monitor the 
evolution of views within the market and may revisit restricted shares 
in the future as the acceptability of this model in the market evolves. 
Dear shareholder,
On behalf of the Board, I am 
pleased to present the Directors’ 
Remuneration report for the 
2016/17 financial year. The 
current Directors’ Remuneration 
Policy (‘Policy’) was approved by 
shareholders at the 2014 AGM 
and applies from 1 April 2015 until 
the 2017 AGM. We have therefore 
undertaken a process during the 
year to develop a revised Policy to be put to a shareholder binding 
vote at the 2017 AGM, which is also included within this report.
As part of the remuneration review, I met with a large number of 
our shareholders and the shareholder representative bodies to 
consult on the details of the Policy and I would like to thank them 
for their input and helpful guidance.
The revised Policy continues to be based upon a core set of 
principles which supports the strategic and financial ambitions of 
the Company:
•	 The remuneration package should support a performance 
based culture, attract and retain talented personnel and align 
executives’ and shareholders’ interests
•	 The remuneration structure should be both uncomplicated and 
transparent and we remain committed to open disclosure
•	 The measures used for incentive plans should reflect the 
strategic priorities which the Committee considers critical to 
the future success of the Company
The Committee is confident that the Policy we are proposing fulfils 
these principles to the fullest extent possible within the current 
climate and I hope we are able to depend on your support at the 
upcoming AGM.
Chairman’s statement 42 Dairy Crest Annual Report 2017
DIReCTORS’ ReMuneRATIOn RePORT COnTInueD
In light of the shareholder consultation, the Committee decided to 
revisit the possible incentive alternatives and after much deliberation, 
we are now proposing to return to the use of a traditional long term 
incentive plan (‘LTIP’). Dairy Crest had a traditional LTIP in place prior 
to the LTAP, the Long Term Incentive Share Plan (‘LTISP’), and the 
new LTIP will replicate many of the features of this plan, but with 
some amendments such that it reflects the current business strategy 
and market. normally, the maximum quantum for awards granted to 
any individual under the plan will be set at 150% of base salary per 
financial year which is the lower quartile compared to the FTSe250, 
equal to the maximum under our previous LTISP and therefore with 
an expected value equal to that of our current LTAP.
In particular, given the challenges the Company faces in setting 
long-term financial targets, the LTIP will be based primarily on 
relative Total Shareholder Return (‘TSR’) performance. TSR is a 
robust financial measure which achieves shareholder alignment 
whilst being a measure for which it is straightforward to calibrate 
targets which are acceptable to shareholders, given its relative 
nature. We believe share price and ultimately shareholder return are 
critical measures of the successful implementation of strategy and 
the performance and growth of the business and ensure that 
management is rewarded in the case where Dairy Crest’s 
shareholders have experienced a higher overall return than the 
market.
Therefore, our proposed Policy states that at least 75% of the overall 
award will be based on financial measures, with at least 50% of the 
overall award based on TSR versus a broad comparator group. The 
remaining part of the award may be based on strategic measures 
and we will retain discretion to determine the appropriate measures 
year on year based on strategic priorities at the time.
As stated, we will not be making a grant under this award until 2018. 
Taking into account business strategy and context at that time we 
will determine the specific measures for the first grant. We will 
ensure transparency on the measures set.
The plan will also incorporate elements in line with best practice, 
including malus, clawback and the addition of a two-year holding 
period post the three year vesting period, in order to align further 
management’s interests with those of shareholders.
Other than changes to the long-term incentive plan, we have made 
no other significant changes to our revised Policy.
2016/17
We were pleased to welcome the Group Commercial Director Adam 
Braithwaite to the Board on 19 July 2016. His remuneration upon 
joining the Board was fully in line with the current Remuneration 
Policy, with his salary set at £255,000, a level competitive against the 
market for similar roles in FTSe 250 companies.
As set out in last year’s report, our annual bonus has been assessed 
against three metrics; profit before tax, free cashflow and personal 
objectives. This approach was applied to all scheme participants 
across the Group.
The economic and trading circumstances faced by the business 
over the year, in particular, significant cost inflation in the second half, 
resulted in the Company achieving below threshold in respect of the 
cashflow measure albeit above threshold in respect of the profit 
measure. Whilst the reported results against the targets set would 
result in a payout under the profit element of the bonus the executive 
Committee, supported by the Remuneration Committee, determined 
that this would not be appropriate given the extended 
commissioning of demineralised whey and GOS plants at Davidstow 
which resulted in a higher than anticipated exceptional charge for the 
year. However, it was agreed that, given the profit threshold level was 
met, a payout under the personal objectives element of the bonus 
was warranted. This results in bonus outcomes of 18.75% of salary 
for Mark Allen, 18.75% for Tom Atherton and 15.63% for Adam 
Braithwaite, reflecting their achievement against challenging 
personal objectives for the year. 
u nder the LTAP, the executive Directors are measured against a 
pre-determined set of strategic performance indicators which 
determines the level of grant. The award is subject to a dividend 
performance underpin for the first 3 years of the vesting period, with 
awards vesting in two equal tranches four and five years after grant. 
The 2016/17 grant level of 67.2% was determined based on the 
performance of the Company over 2016/17 against the scorecard 
disclosed in the previous year’s report. Details of the achievement 
against each scorecard measure are included in this report and 
reflect a consistent performance in a challenging year.
2017/18
Mark Allen received an annual salary increase effective as of 
1 January 2017. This figure reflects the longer period of 18 months 
before the next salary review in July 2018. Mark received a salary 
increase of 3.6%, equivalent to 2.4% per annum over 18 months  
Salary increases for Tom Atherton and Adam Braithwaite will be 
2.6% in line with that of the general workforce. The increases will be 
effective from 1 July 2017.
n on-executive Director fees have also increased during the year. Full 
details are provided on page 60.
In light of the importance to Dairy Crest of reducing net debt over the 
short-term, the Committee has reviewed the weightings of measures 
under the bonus plan. To reflect this, the Committee decided to 
increase the proportion of bonus relating to free cash flow 
generation. The bonus quantum is unchanged.
The performance period under the one-off Transformational 
Incentive Award (‘TIA’) completes in December 2017. This award 
supported the retention and motivation of Mark Allen through the 
critical period of the sale of the Dairies business to Müller in which 
his knowledge and experience were vital to a successful outcome. 
Further details of the TIA objectives and performance against these 
to date are set out in this report.
Finally, I would like to thank my fellow Committee members and 
internal and external teams who supported us with their 
commitment and hard work over the past year. We remain 
committed to hearing your views as shareholders. If you would like 
to discuss any aspect of our remuneration further I would welcome 
your comments.

To deliver an appropriate balance between 
long-term and short-term reward, any bonus 
earned over 50% of annual salary is deferred 
into shares (see below). The remainder is paid 
as cash.
The cash element of the bonus is ordinarily 
paid three months after the end of the 
financial year to which it relates. Clawback 
applies to cash payments for 3 years from the 
date this element is paid.
Current maximum award: 100% of salary.
Target award: 50% of salary.
Threshold award: 0% of salary.
The Remuneration Committee has discretion 
to increase the maximum award to 150% of 
salary in exceptional circumstances. The 
Committee is not aware of any such 
circumstances and so does not currently 
expect to make awards above the maximum 
of 100% of salary.
Performance is measured by reference to the

requesting shareholder approval of the following remuneration policy 
at the AGM on 18 July 2017 to cover a period of three years from 
that date.

The Committee will determine the appropriate

maximum award of 150% of base salary. For 
recruitment purposes only, where there is a 
need to provide replacement awards, grants 
can be made in excess of 150% of base 
salary.
n ormally, awards will vest 3 years after the 
date of grant and the number of shares that 
vest will be determined by reference to certain 
performance conditions. Awards granted for 
recruitment purposes may vest before the 
expiry of 3 years from the date of grant and 
may not be subject to performance

Further to extensive shareholder consultation where the future acceptability of the LTAP was questioned and after subsequent consideration of 
a restricted stock plan, it has been decided to implement a traditional LTIP. To achieve shareholder alignment, the LTIP is predominantly 
financially based, with the primary measure being TSR, incorporating an extended vesting/holding period. The maximum award of 150% is set 
at the lower quartile of the FTSe250 and is equal to the maximum under the previous LTISP with an expected value equal to the current LTAP.

All employees participate in some form of bonus plan. The size of award and the weighting of performance conditions vary by grade, with 
specific measures incorporated where relevant. All employees have the opportunity to participate in a pension arrangement at levels of

Ceo one-off t ransformational incentive a ward
At the eGM held in December 2014, shareholders approved the grant of a one-off Transformational Incentive Award (‘TIA’) outside of policy to 
the CeO, connected to the key business change of the sale of the Dairies business. The key terms of the TIA are detailed below, with further 
detail in the 2016 Director’s Remuneration report:
•	 The award will vest in December 2017 to the extent that the stretching performance conditions set in relation to the award are achieved over 
the three year period December 2014-2017
•	 The award is structured as a base award over Ordinary Shares having a market value at grant equivalent to 75% of Mark Allen’s base salary. 
A multiplier of between 0 and 3 times the number of Ordinary Shares subject to the base award will be applied to it at the end of the three 
year performance period, depending on the level of performance achieved
•	 The Committee will determine the level of vesting of the TIA based on performance objectives which are intended to be demanding. In 
measuring performance in this regard, the Committee has identified three categories of objectives on which the assessment of performance 
will be based. These relate to the restructuring of the business and its future success, as follows: 
 – Managing the competition approval process relating to the sale of the Dairies business, requiring strong leadership and a high level of 
personal involvement from a chief executive officer who is an acknowledged leader in the sector, as well as managing the business as a 
whole through a period of extended uncertainty 
 – Appropriately reshaping the Group, taking account of the outcome of the competition approval process
•	 establishing a successful future business, by reference to the development of the Group and its principal business streams, including the 
delivery of value to shareholders
•	 An update on the performance against these objectives to date is provided on pages 54 to 55
statement of consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the Company
As the Committee has oversight of remuneration matters for the broader senior management population, it brings the reward of these 
individuals into consideration when discussing packages for executive Directors.
The Committee does not specifically ask employees to comment on matters related to the remuneration of executive Directors but any 
comments received are taken into account. The level of salary increases for the general Dairy Crest employee population is considered when 
setting increases for the executive Directors. In addition, salary benchmark information for companies of comparable size and complexity 
within the FTSe250 (excluding financial services) is taken into consideration.
The Committee has oversight of statutory matters in relation to wider employee pay, for example in respect of the n ational Living Wage and 
Gender Pay Gap, and receives regular updates on such matters. Dairy Crest Annual Report 2017 47

approach to recruitment remuneration
The Committee’s approach to recruitment remuneration is to pay a competitive salary as appropriate to attract and motivate the right talent in 
the role.
The following table sets out the various components which would be considered for inclusion in the remuneration package for the 
appointment of an executive Director. In respect of a promotion, any remuneration commitments made prior to such promotion will be 
honoured. Any new executive Director’s remuneration package would include the same elements and be subject to the same constraints as 
those of the existing executive Directors performing similar roles, as shown below:
Component policy and principles
Base salary and 
benefits
The salary level will be set taking into account the responsibilities of the individual and the salaries paid for similar roles in comparable 
companies.
Depending on the circumstances of any particular appointment the Committee may choose to set base salary above market median to attract 
the right talent, or below market median with increases applied over a period of time to achieve alignment with market levels for the role with 
reference to the experience and performance of the individual, all subject to the Company’s ability to pay.
Should relocation of a newly recruited executive Director be required, reasonable costs associated with this relocation will be met by the 
Company. Such relocation support could include but not be limited to payment of legal fees, removal costs, temporary accommodation/hotel 
cost, a contribution to stamp duty and replacement of non-transferrable household items. In addition, the Committee may grant additional 
support as appropriate.
Other benefits provided will be aligned to those set out on pages 43 to 45.
pension The executive Director will be able to participate in the defined contribution scheme up to the annual allowance and receive a cash supplement 
payment above this. The total benefit will not exceed 23% of Basic Salary.
annual bonus The executive Director will be eligible to participate in the annual bonus scheme as set out in the Remuneration Policy table.
The Policy maximum award under the bonus will be 100% of salary.
The Remuneration Committee has discretion to increase the maximum award to 150% of salary in exceptional circumstances. Any bonus over 
50% of salary is deferred into shares for three years as set out in the Remuneration Policy table.
Long term 
incentive awards
The executive Director will be eligible to participate in the LTIP at the Remuneration Committee’s discretion. 
The maximum annual award under this scheme is 150% of base salary and associated conditions would apply as set out in the Remuneration 
Policy table.
u nder the rules of the plan, the Committee may grant additional awards under this scheme as replacement awards (see below)
replacement 
awards
The Committee may grant additional awards under the LTIP as replacement awards. In such cases the level of award and timing of vesting 
could be different from that in the Remuneration Policy in order to replicate, as practically as possible, the value and timing of the remuneration 
forgone.
The Committee will seek to structure any replacement awards so that overall they are no more generous in terms of expected value or vesting 
period than the awards forfeited from a new recruit’s previous employer.
The Committee has the flexibility not to apply performance conditions or a holding period and to use cash and/or shares as the format for 
delivery of any replacement awards.

executive Directors may be invited to become n on-executive Directors of other companies and it is recognised that exposure to such duties 
can broaden their experience and skills which will benefit the Company. external appointments are subject to agreement by the Chairman and 
reported to the Board. Any external appointment must not conflict with a Director’s duties and commitments to Dairy Crest. Fees may be 
retained by Directors for such appointments.
t ermination policy
The Remuneration Committee’s approach when considering payments in the event of termination is to take account of the individual 
circumstances including the reason for termination, contractual obligations of both parties as well as share plan and pension scheme rules 
(including relevant performance conditions).
The table below summarises the key elements of the executive Director service contract and policy on payment for loss of office.
Component policy and principles
notice period 12 months’ notice from Company.
12 months’ notice from Director. 
Compensation for 
loss of office in 
service contracts
u p to 12 months’ salary plus an additional 3% to account for presumed salary increases from any salary review that may have taken place in 
the notice period.
Payable monthly and subject to mitigation if the Director obtains alternative employment up to 12 months after termination.
Other payments to the Director in question include medical benefits, cost of company car and a sum equivalent to 23% of annual salary 
representing pension contribution for the unexpired part of the contractual notice period.
u nder the terms of Mark Allen’s contract payments on termination are calculated as 90% of the sum of the following items – annual salary, 
benefits, pension plus 50% of maximum bonus opportunity for the notice period. This will not be the Company’s policy going forward for other 
executive Directors. Contractual provisions in respect of compensation for loss of office for Mark Allen are therefore grandfathered.
In the event of a compromise or settlement agreement, the Remuneration Committee may make payments it considers reasonable in 
settlement of potential legal claims. This may include an entitlement to compensation in respect of their statutory rights under employment 
protection legislation in the u K or in other jurisdictions. The Remuneration Committee may also include in such payments reasonable 
reimbursement of professional fees in connection with such agreements. 
The reimbursement of repatriation costs or fees for professional or outplacement advice may also be included in the termination package, as 
deemed reasonable by the Committee, as may the continuation of benefits for a limited period.
t reatment of 
unvested deferred 
bonus awards 
under plan rules
If termination is by way of death, injury, illness, disability, redundancy, retirement, or any other circumstances the Committee determines, 
deferred bonus share awards may be released in full on termination.
Otherwise, the proportion of awards released will be determined at the discretion of the Board.
t reatment of 
unvested Ltip/ 
Ltap plan awards 
under plan rules
In relation to the LTAP:
Any outstanding award will lapse at cessation of employment with the Company, unless the reason for cessation is by way of injury, ill-health, 
disability, redundancy, retirement, the business or company in which the award holder works being sold outside of the Group, or any other 
circumstances the Committee determines, when the award will vest at the normal vesting date with the underpin  and other conditions 
considered at the time of vesting, subject to pro-ration for time served. The Committee may determine not to pro-rate if deemed appropriate. 
Alternatively, the Committee may determine that a proportion of the award will vest immediately, with the proportion determined by the 
Committee taking into account satisfaction of the underpin and any other factors the Committee considers relevant.
 
In relation to the LTIP:
Any outstanding award will lapse at cessation of employment with the Company, unless the reason for cessation is by way of injury, ill-health, 
disability, redundancy, retirement, the business or company in which the award holder works being sold outside of the Group, or any other 
circumstances the Committee determines, when the award will vest at the normal vesting date with the performance conditions considered at 
the time of vesting, subject to pro-ration for time served.  The Committee may determine not to pro-rate if deemed appropriate. Alternatively, the 
Committee may determine that a proportion of the award will vest immediately, with the proportion determined by the Committee taking into 
account satisfaction of the performance conditions and any other factors the Committee considers relevant.

exercise of 
discretion
Any discretion available in determining treatment of incentives on termination of employment is intended only to be relied upon to provide 
flexibility in certain circumstances.
The Remuneration Committee’s determination will take into account the particular circumstances of the Director’s departure and the recent 
performance of the Company. Dairy Crest Annual Report 2017 49
Governance
Component policy and principles
Change of control Outstanding awards and options would normally vest and become exercisable on a change of control to the extent that any performance 
condition has been satisfied.
The proportion of awards that vest under the LTIP/LTAP will be determined by the Remuneration Committee. Deferred bonus awards would 
normally be released in full. Payments under the bonus scheme would be pro-rated for service from the start of the relevant bonus year to the 
date of the change of control. For SAYe, participants can, at the Board’s discretion, exercise options up to six months after the change of 
control. Contributions to SAYe can continue up to the date of exercise.
The Committee reserves the right to alter the performance period or the performance measures and targets of the annual bonus plan or of any 
outstanding awards under the annual bonus plan or the LTIP/LTAP in the event of a change of control, to ensure that the performance 
conditions remain relevant but challenging.
The Committee has the discretion to test performance at the point of change of control or to allow awards to continue or roll-over in any 
reasonable manner with agreement of the acquirer, taking into account the circumstances of the change of control.
There are no pre-determined special provisions for n on-executive Directors with regard to compensation in the event of loss of office.

statement of consideration of shareholders views
During 2016/17 the Committee consulted extensively with our largest shareholders as well as shareholder representative bodies on our new 
remuneration structure. We were grateful to shareholders for the level and quality of engagement, many of whom were supportive of our 
proposed approach to move to a restricted share arrangement. When the Committee decided to continue no longer with this proposed 
approach a second round of consultation took place. 
The Committee values highly the quality of input from its engagement with shareholders. Shareholder consultation helps the Committee set 
meaningful remuneration policies that achieve clear alignment of the interests of shareholders and management. The Committee looks 
forward to continuing the productive dialogue with the Company’s shareholders.

annual report on remuneration
single total figure of remuneration – subject to audit
The table below sets out the analysis of total remuneration for each Director. An explanation of how the figures are calculated follows the table. 
The total remuneration for each Director reflects the performance of the Company and the contribution each individual has made to the 
on-going success of the Company.
It is important to note that the LTAP award included in the column LTAP for 2016/17 is incorporated in the single total figure of remuneration for 
regulatory reasons with no shares vesting in the year. The 2014 LTAP vests 50% in 2018/19 and 50% in 2019/20. Therefore the actual 
remuneration earned in 2016/17 for Mark Allen, Tom Atherton and Adam Braithwaite was £805k, £501k and £261k

i For 2015/16 the values included are for the 2013 LTAP. These shares have not vested, therefore the value of the awards has been calculated using the average middle 
market price during the final quarter of 2016/17.  
  For 2016/17, the values included are for the 2014 LTAP. Awards were subject to a dividend underpin over the period April 2014 – March 2017. The conditions under 
the dividend underpin were met and the awards are not subject to any further performance conditions – they are therefore included in the single figure. The value of 
the awards has been calculated using the average middle market price during the final quarter of 2016/17. 50% of awards will vest on 16 December 2018 and 50% 
will vest on 16 December 2019. As the vesting period for this award has not yet been completed, no value will be delivered to participants until 2018/2019.
ii Pension amounts include employer’s pension contribution and salary supplement. Base salary, bonus and LTAP are defined on pages 43 to 45. 
iii Amounts shown in relation to Adam Braithwaite relate to the period since 19 July 2016, when he was appointed to the Board.
iv There has been an increase to n on-executive Director fees in the year, effective from 1 December 2016. For further details see page 60.

Taxable benefits are valued at the taxable value, and include company car/car allowance and private medical insurance.
During the year, Mark Allen held the position of non-executive Director including Audit Committee member and Remuneration Committee 
member at Howdens Joinery Group plc, with retained fees in association with this work totalling £55k (2016: £47k). From January 2017 he also 
held the position of n on-executive Director at Warburtons Limited with retained fees in association with this work totalling £9k.

performance against targets for annual bonus
Payment of the bonus is subject to the achievement of demanding short-term financial targets and personal objectives. To ensure that an 
appropriate balance is maintained between long-term and short-term reward, any bonus earned over 50% of annual salary is paid in 
Company shares and deferred for a three-year period subject to continued employment. Dairy Crest Annual Report 2017 51

A profit before tax performance of £60.6m was within the range for a payment against this bonus target. However, the executive Committee, 
supported by the Remuneration Committee, determined that a payout was not appropriate given the extended commissioning of the 
demineralised whey and GOS plants at Davidstow which resulted in a higher than anticipated exceptional charge. The Remuneration 
Committee supported this proposal and confirmed that no payment would be made for this bonus element.
The free cash flow outturn of £38.7m was outside of the bonus range and resulted in no payout. 52 Dairy Crest Annual Report 2017

Given the profit threshold was surpassed, a payment under the personal objectives component was warranted, albeit the stretching nature of 
the personal objectives resulted in partial payment.

Current position on other outstanding Ltap awards – not subject to audit
The outstanding LTAP awards are subject to a dividend underpin for three years following the award being made. The award may be reduced 
by an amount proportional to the percentage decrease in dividend in the event of a decline of up to 50%. If the decline exceeds 50%, the 
Committee will use its discretion to determine the proportion of the award that shall vest.
Dividend cover must also be maintained in the range 1.5 – 2.5 over the three-year measurement period. 
Ltap 2015: The dividend increase over the period following the award is currently 5.4%, and the dividend cover is 1.9 times. 
Ltap 2016: The dividend increase over the period following the award is currently 5.3%, and the dividend cover is 2.1 times.
t otal pension entitlements – subject to audit
Following the closure of the Dairy Crest Group Pension Fund (a defined benefit scheme) to future accruals, there is no increase in accrued 
pension during the year other than inflationary increases.
The scheme closed to future accrual at 31 March 2010. Mark Allen decided to draw benefits from 31 March 2010 and receives an annual 
pension. Mark Allen, Tom Atherton and Adam Braithwaite were members of the defined contribution scheme throughout 2016/17. The 
Company made contributions of £10,000 for Mark Allen and £6,656 for Tom Atherton incorporating both employee and employer 
contributions. For Adam Braithwaite zero contributions were made since his appointment to the Board (£10,000 of contributions incorporating 
both employer and employee contributions were made in 2016/17 but were processed prior to his promotion to the Board). Further cash 
supplements were paid such that the total of cash supplements and employer contributions amounted to 23% of basic salary for Mark Allen 
and Tom Atherton. Adam Braithwaite received contributions of 23% of salary for the period since joining the Board.

Ltap 2016 award  
The award made under the LTAP in 2016 was made on 3 June 2016. The award level is determined based on achievements over the prior 
year against the pre-grant performance scorecard, comprising measures aligned to Dairy Crest’s strategic priorities. Outcomes against the 
2016 scorecard are summarised in the second table below and detail on these outcomes against the targets set and context in which 
decisions were made is included thereafter.
The outcome against the LTAP scorecard may fall between 0% and 100%, based on assessment of performance against each measure (as 
determined by the Committee) and the weighting attributable to each in the table below. This scorecard percentage outcome then determines 
the proportion of the award that will be granted, in the range of 50% to 90% of salary for executive Directors. As set out in the approved policy, 
in any year, in the event of performance below a certain threshold or where the performance against the scorecard for that year is determined 
not to be a fair reflection of the overall performance of the business, the Committee may determine that no award will be granted. The 
maximum opportunity under the LTAP (90% of salary) is lower than the typical long-term incentive level in the market, whilst certainty of payout 
for participants is higher. Dairy Crest Annual Report 2017 53

For executive Directors

1. profit  Weighting: 30%. o utcome: 0%
eBITDA for 2015/16 was below the target threshold due to the higher than anticipated losses in the Dairies business up until the date of 
disposal. It reflected the challenges faced throughout the year versus the Group’s budget expectations in a heavily deflating dairy environment 
with the added pressure that a prolonged Dairies business disposal had on the commercial performance of the liquid milk business. 
This weaker than expected eBITDA outcome resulted in 0% pay out.
2. Balance sheet efficiency  Weighting: 20%. o utcome: 0%
The KPI is targeted ROCe (operating profit/average operating assets) with an additional requirement that gearing should be between 1.0 and 
2.0 times. With regard to ROCe, the long-term objective was to maintain this above 12% with individual targets and ranges set each year by 
reference to budget. 
The ROCe for 2015/16 (based on a post-disposal operating asset position) was 15%. This demonstrates the transformational effect on ROCe 
that the disposal of the Dairies business delivered. 
However, year-end gearing (net debt/eBITDA) was above the upper end of the target range of between 1.0 and 2.0 times. Staying within the 
range is an underpinning requirement for an award under the balance sheet efficiency measure and therefore, no award was made under this 
element.   54 Dairy Crest Annual Report 2017
DIReCTORS’ ReMuneRATIOn RePORT COnTInueD
3. Corporate activity & efficiencies  Weighting: 15%. o utcome: 15% 
The KPI is targeted full year effect of cost efficiency projects initiated in any year and delivery of synergies and returns on acquisitions. Where 
there is no acquisition activity, the cost efficiency projects can deliver the full 15% award and this was the case in 2015/16. 
In 2015/16 great success was achieved in removing costs ahead of target up until the disposal of the Dairies business. For the final quarter, 
cost saving could not be maintained at this level given that the Dairies business accounted for much of the scale of the organisation. 
Although there was no relevant delivered M&A integration activity in 2015/16, related activity that was successfully delivered included the 
acquisition of the outstanding 50% of Promovita Ingredients Limited for a consideration of £6 million (giving Dairy Crest sole control over the 
development of the GOS business) and the segmentation of the Dairies business from the combined Group.  
The Remuneration Committee recognised the cost savings achieved ahead of target up to the point of sale of the Dairies business and the 
successful business split along with the long-term strategic importance of the acquisition of the balance of ownership of Promovita Ingredients 
Limited. On the basis of this performance it decided that a 15% payout for this element was merited.
4. Brand growth  Weighting: 20%. o utcome: 15%
Key brand performance was strong in a deflationary marketplace. The Remuneration Committee considered robust quantitative IRI and 
Kantar Worldpanel data for all brands in reviewing this element. Cathedral City, Country Life and Frylight all grew share over 12 months. Over a 
three year timeframe Cathedral City, Clover and Frylight have all grown value share.
On this basis the Remuneration Committee considered an award of 15% was appropriate.
5. innovation  Weighting: 10%. o utcome: 10% 
The Group’s target for innovation is that 10% of revenue should be from product innovation over the last three years. In the year ended 31 
March 2016 a number of new innovations were brought to market including re-launched Clover with no artificial ingredients and new coconut 
and rapeseed variants of Frylight which helped drive the percentage of key brand revenue from innovation in the preceding three years to 11%.
In addition the Remuneration Committee recognised innovation in other areas of the business including the opening of the new innovation 
centre at Harper Adams u niversity, new supplier arrangements for spreadable cheese with Hochland who are helping us to develop further a 
stronger cheese n PD pipeline, and the arrangement with Fowler Welch Coolchain Ltd that gives us the opportunity to grow warehousing 
volumes whilst planning for the completion of the distribution agreement with Müller.
On this basis an award of 10% was made.
6. Corporate responsibility  Weighting: 5%. o utcome: 4% 
Our 2015/16 safety record has been better than was targeted. Customer complaints generally have been low and any quality issues have 
been addressed fully to investigate root cause and implement improved procedures. energy usage was 6% below budget and carbon 
emissions were better than target and 13% below last year. n o employee survey was conducted during 2015/16 due to the sizeable people 
impact of the sale of the Dairies business. However, considerable effort was put into maintaining employee engagement via enhanced 
communications and the inclusion of a sale related component in the bonus scheme for all Hay employees.
The Remuneration Committee felt that corporate responsibility performance had generally been better than target and a payout of 4% was 
agreed. 
Dividend underpin
The level of vesting of this award may be reduced to the extent that a dividend underpin over the period April 2016 – March 2019 is not met.
The award may be reduced by an amount proportional to the percentage decrease in dividend in the event of a decline of up to 50%. If the 
decline exceeds 50%, the Remuneration Committee will use its discretion to determine the proportion of the award that shall vest. In such 
circumstances not more than 50% of the award will vest.
Dividend cover must be maintained in a specific range over the three-year measurement period. The Committee retains discretion to reduce 
the vesting of awards as appropriate should dividend cover be outside this range. 
Ceo o ne-off t ransformational incentive a ward – update on objectives and performance against objectives 
This year also marked the final full financial year of performance under the one-off TIA related to the sales of the Dairies business, granted to 
Mark Allen in December 2014 and which is due to vest later this year.
This award supported the retention and motivation of Mark Allen through this critical period in which his knowledge and experience were vital 
to a successful outcome. In line with the commitment made by the Committee in the 2014/15 Remuneration report and following the 
comprehensive update provided in last year’s report, we have set out detailed information on the performance against the objectives set under 
this plan over the past year, which were split into three categories as shown below. Dairy Crest Annual Report 2017 55
Governance
1. managing the competition approval process relating to the sale of the Dairies business
The sale of the Dairies business required strong leadership and a high level of personal involvement from a chief executive officer who is an 
acknowledged leader in the sector. Mark Allen was set a number of objectives relating to the success of negotiations and discussions with 
Müller and the u K Competition and Markets Authority (‘CMA’) whilst managing the business as a whole through a period of extended 
uncertainty.
Mark Allen performed exceptionally in securing the successful completion of the sale to Müller in December 2015, positioning Dairy Crest as a 
branded and added-value business, focussed on growth, cash generation and enhanced shareholder value. In 2015/16 the Committee 
determined that all objectives in this category had been successfully completed. Full details are disclosed in the 2015/16 Remuneration report.
2. appropriately reshaping the Group
A number of TIA objectives were built around a strategic review of the Group following the sale of the Dairies business, implementation of 
associated structural changes and the delivery of significant cost savings.
Mark has led the organisational review process carried out over the past year covering all areas of the Group and his leadership was 
instrumental in identifying both immediate cost savings and opportunities for the business to leverage from this and facilitate further cost 
savings in the future.
The initial part of this work was an organisational design activity which was undertaken immediately post the sale of the Dairies business, 
covering all functions, that streamlined the Group and delivered a management and administrative structure template appropriate for a smaller 
business. Mark’s leadership of this work and the principles he established on which it was built, were integral to its success. He personally led 
the review of outputs and ultimately sanctioned the agreed changes which were critical to delivery and implementation in this area throughout 
2016/17.
In addition, recognising the need to build a systems and process infrastructure suited to the post Dairies business, Mark established a major 
project under the title ‘evolve’ that commenced in 2016 and has already set a clear roadmap for systems and process development for all 
parts of the business over the next 2 years. Starting with financial systems, this project will deliver change within supply chain, demand, 
business systems and HR, resulting in highly effective systems, improved processes and reduced costs. 
As a consequence of the above, the Company is on-target to achieve savings of £5m and will be in excellent shape to deliver continued value 
to our customers and shareholders through streamlined, improved ways of working and further cost reductions.
3. establishing a successful future business
The TIA performance period is three quarters complete and considerable progress has been made across the business.
Brands continue to develop through product innovation (Cathedral City spreadable and snack bar, Frylight avocado), packaging changes 
(Clover, Cathedral City and Frylight all had packaging refreshes), advertising (Cathedral City and Frylight were both advertised on TV and other 
brands were advertised through other channels) and promotional activity.
Mark’s objectives also required the delivery of new product streams to enhance the profitability of the business and develop shareholder 
returns. He led the project that has made significant progress in delivering both the highly demanding demineralised whey infant formula 
quality standard and the necessary quality and tonnage targets for GOS. Mark has overseen the governance process, maintained focus and 
control over a highly complex, multi-dimensional project, whilst also leading the key commercial relationships with our partner Fonterra. 
2016/17 has also seen further investment in the research into the uses of GOS outside the infant formula market. The research partnership 
with Danisco Animal n utrition, part of DuPont, will help the Company understand the beneficial effects of GOS on poultry and swine 
production, building on the positive academic research already undertaken earlier in the year.
In respect of succession planning, Mark has identified the critical roles for which there may be potential future gaps and overseen a thorough 
succession planning process to secure the future skills required by the business. In addition, he has conducted a full review of executive 
Director development, adopting a range of development processes and engaging specialist independent support, using the output of this to 
inform development discussions and plans for the Directors. Mark has also reviewed the senior management population more generally, 
developing plans to refresh the talent pool where necessary.
Mark has sponsored and personally led an intensive employee engagement process including a full Group roadshow to which every employee 
was invited and a refresh of the Group’s Vision and Values. This was a key activity post the sale of the Dairies business in ensuring employees 
were engaged throughout this period of significant change but, more importantly, remained informed and committed to the future plans and 
growth of the Company.
Mark Allen has delivered outstanding progress to date with regard to the objectives set under the TIA. Mark’s exceptional performance in 
delivering the sale of the Dairies business and his subsequent work in transforming Dairy Crest has resulted in the Company delivering 
industry leading margins of 16% compared to c.5% before the disposal of the Dairies business. Dairy Crest is in a strong position to deliver 
sustained future growth.
In the view of the Remuneration Committee, Mark has delivered on, and in some cases exceeded, the targets set to date. A significant 
proportion of the business transformation that the TIA was designed to engender and recognise has now been implemented and delivered. 
Given the level of positive progress and achievements against the TIA objectives, vesting at the maximum end is currently anticipated. 56 Dairy Crest Annual Report 2017

shareholder dilution 
In accordance with the guidelines set by the Investment Association (‘IA’), the Remuneration Committee can satisfy awards under all its share 
plans with new issue shares or shares issued from treasury up to a maximum of 10% of its issued share capital in a rolling 10 year period to 
employees under all its share plans. Within this 10% limit, the Company can only issue (as newly issued shares or from treasury) 5% of its 
issued share capital to satisfy awards under discretionary or executive plans. Currently, awards over shares equalling 7.9% of the issued share 
capital have been made under share plans during a rolling 10 year period, with awards over shares equalling 2.7% under discretionary or 
executive schemes.   
statement of Director’s shareholdings and share interests – subject to audit
executive Directors are required to build a shareholding in the Company equivalent to 200% of salary and to this end are required to retain 
50% of net proceeds from share plans and deferred bonus share awards until that shareholding is achieved. Shareholdings exclude unvested 
options under the LTISP and include unvested deferred shares granted to executive Directors as part payment of bonuses and unvested LTAP 
awards. Mark Allen and Tom Atherton have satisfied the shareholding requirement. Adam Braithwaite has not met the requirements and will 
continue to grow his shareholding.

Ltap 2017 award
The award to be made under the LTAP 2017 is based on achievements over the prior year against the pre-grant performance scorecard, 
comprising measures aligned to Dairy Crest’s strategic priorities. This award will be granted later in 2017. Outcomes against the 2017 
scorecard are summarised in the second table below and detail on outcomes against the targets set and the context in which decisions were 
made is included thereafter. 
The outcome against the LTAP scorecard may fall between 0% and 100%, based on assessment of performance against each measure (as 
determined by the Committee) and the weighting attributable to each in the table below. This scorecard percentage outcome then determines 
the proportion of the award that will be granted, in the range of 50% to 90% of salary for executive Directors. As set out in the approved 
Policy, in any year, in the event of performance below a certain threshold or where the performance against the scorecard for that year is 
determined not to be a fair reflection of the overall performance of the business, the Committee may determine that no award will be granted. 
The maximum opportunity under the LTAP (90% of salary) is lower than the typical long-term incentive level in the market, whilst certainty of 
payout for participants is higher.

1. profit  Weighting: 30%. o utcome: 0%
eBITDA for 2016/17 was below the target threshold due to an extended commissioning period in relation to the demineralised whey and GOS 
plants at Davidstow.  
2. Balance sheet efficiency  Weighting: 20%. o utcome: 0%
The KPI is targeted ROCe (operating profit/average operating assets) with an additional requirement that gearing should be between 1.0 and 
2.0 times. With regard to ROCe, the long-term objective is to maintain this above 12% with individual targets and ranges set each year by 
reference to budget.  Dairy Crest Annual Report 2017 59
Governance
For 2016/17 a stretching vesting target of 15.8% ROCe was set. A ROCe of 15.4% was achieved which was just below the vesting level but 
above the ROCe outcome in 2015/16. In addition, year-end gearing (net debt: e BITDA) was above the upper end of the target range of 
between 1.0 and 2.0 times. Given both the ROCe target and the gearing range were not met, no award was made under this element.
3. Corporate activity & efficiencies  Weighting: 15%. o utcome: 15%
The KPI is targeted full year effect of cost efficiency projects initiated in any year and delivery of synergies and returns on acquisitions. Where 
there is no acquisition activity, the cost efficiency projects can deliver the full 15% award and this was the case in 2016/17. 
In 2016/17 success was achieved in removing costs with corporate costs below budget and procurement savings ahead of budget. Overall 
there was a reduction in Group administrative expenses of £5.4m.
With regard to efficiency projects, considerable progress has been made in defining a revised IT strategy which will deliver cost savings and 
improved ways of working.
On the basis of this performance it was decided that a 15% payout for this element was merited.
4. Brand growth  Weighting: 20%. o utcome: 14%
Key brand performance was broadly strong in the year. The Remuneration Committee considered robust quantitative IRI data for all brands in 
reviewing this element. Clover and Frylight grew share over 12 months as did Country Life spreadable. Cathedral City lost value share but 
strengthened in the second half of the year. Over a three year timeframe, Cathedral City, Clover and Frylight have all grown value share.
On this basis an award of 14% was agreed.
5. innovation  Weighting: 10%. o utcome: 10%
The Group’s target for innovation is that 10% of revenue should be from product innovation over the last three years. In the year ended 31 
March 2017 product innovation drove the percentage of key brand revenue from innovation in the preceding three years to 13%. The 
development of Cathedral City spreadable, launch of cheese snack bars and the continued growth of Clover with no artificial ingredients all 
supported this result.
The Remuneration Committee decided on this basis an award of 10% should be made.
6. Corporate responsibility  Weighting: 5%. o utcome: 4%
Our 2016/17 safety record achieved the best performance yet with zero reportable accidents in the year. Customer complaints generally have 
been low across our brands, albeit we did see some increase in cheese complaints. With regard to energy usage, this improved and better 
than target performance was achieved as did carbon emissions which were 13% below last year’s level. n o employee survey was conducted 
during 2016/17 however, considerable effort was put into maintaining employee engagement via enhanced communications including a full 
employee roadshow to which all employees were invited.
The Remuneration Committee assessed that corporate responsibility performance had generally been better than target, especially in the 
area of health and safety and a payout of 4% was merited. 
Dividend underpin
The level of vesting of this award may be reduced to the extent that a dividend underpin over the period April 2017 – March 2020 is not met.
The award may be reduced by an amount proportional to the percentage decrease in dividend in the event of a decline of up to 50%. If the 
decline exceeds 50%, the Remuneration Committee will use its discretion to determine the proportion of the award that shall vest. In such 
circumstances not more than 50% of the award will vest.
Dividend cover must be maintained in a specific range over the three-year measurement period. The Committee retains discretion to reduce 
the vesting of awards as appropriate should dividend cover be outside this range. 
statement of implementation of policy in the following financial year
The Directors’ Remuneration Policy will be implemented for the 2017/18 financial year as follows:
Base salary – £’000s
Director 2016 2017
mark allen 540 560
t om atherton 340 349
adam Braithwaite 255 262
Mark Allen’s base salary increased on 1 January 2017 and he will not be eligible for a further increase until 1 July 2018. Base salary increases 
for Tom Atherton and Adam Braithwaite will be in line with increases across the general workforce and will be effective from 1 July 2017. 60 Dairy Crest Annual Report 2017
DIReCTORS’ ReMuneRATIOn RePORT COnTInueD
n on-executive Directors’ fees – £’000s
role pre 1 December 2016 effective 1 December 2016
non-executive Chairman 155 155
non-executive Director (base) 38 50
audit Committee Chair +5 +10
Corporate responsibility Chair +5 +10
remuneration Committee Chair +5 +10
senior independent Director +5 +10
The Board noted that n on-executive Directors’ fees had not been increased since 2008 and were below the level of comparable roles within 
companies of similar size and complexity. Further to a review of market levels and recognising the need to recruit appropriately skilled and 
experienced new n on-executive Directors, the Chief executive recommended to the Board that the fees were increased as above. It was 
therefore determined that the fees be increased, effective from 1 December 2016. 
Bonus measures
Maximum opportunity for executive Directors under the 2017/18 bonus remains at 100% of salary.
Recognising the importance of reducing debt, the weightings under the bonus plan have been reviewed and the proportion of 2017/18 bonus 
relating to free cash flow generation will increase. Performance will therefore be assessed against the following measures:
•	 Profit before tax – 50% of award
•	 Free cash flow – 25% of award
•	 Personal objectives – 25% of award
The targets for the 2017/18 annual bonus measures are considered commercially sensitive because of the information that this provides to the 
Company’s competitors. The targets and payout against them will be disclosed in the 2017/18 report. Categories in respect of the personal 
objectives include establishing new revenue streams and acquisition opportunities for Mark Allen, further managing pension liability, delivering 
systems change projects and managing the debt position for Tom Atherton and brand development, sales growth and establishing new sales 
channels for Adam Braithwaite. 
Malus and clawback provisions will operate in respect of the 2017/18 bonus. The malus provision will apply to the deferred share awards up to 
vesting. The clawback provision will apply to the cash award for three years from the date of payment. Clawback may be operated in the event 
of gross misconduct on the part of the employee and/or material misstatement in Company or Group financial statements. 
Long term incentive plan
n o grant of LTIP will be made in 2017. The first grant under this new incentive structure will be made in 2018, subject to approval of the Policy 
and to approval by shareholders of the LTIP. 
sharesave scheme 
The Sharesave Scheme is open to all eligible employees and full time executive Directors. employees enter into an approved savings contract 
over a three year term to make monthly contributions up to an overall maximum of £500 per month. At the end of the term, members have the 
right to buy ordinary shares in the Company at a price fixed at the time of the option grant. Options may not be granted at less than 80% of the 
market price at the time of grant.
Consideration by the Directors of matters relating to remuneration
members of the r emuneration Committee
The Board has appointed a Remuneration Committee of independent non-executive Directors of the Company. During the year the 
Committee consisted of:
•	 Richard Macdonald (Chairman)
•	 Andrew Carr-Locke
•	 Sue Farr
Stephen Alexander in his capacity as Company Chairman and Mark Allen, Chief executive attended the Remuneration Committee by 
invitation. Members of the Remuneration Committee have no potential conflicts of interest arising from cross-directorships and they are not 
involved in the day-to-day running of the Company.
t he Committee’s activities during the financial year
The Remuneration Committee is responsible for the broad Policy with respect to senior executives’ salary and other remuneration. It 
specifically determines, within remuneration principles agreed with the Board, the total remuneration package of each executive Director and 
reviews with the Chief executive the remuneration packages for other senior executives. A copy of the terms of reference of the Committee 
can be found on the Company’s website, www.dairycrest.co.uk Dairy Crest Annual Report 2017 61

advisers to the r emuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee has appointed PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (‘PwC’) to provide advice on executive remuneration. PwC has 
provided such advice historically and was originally appointed through a competitive tendering process. 
Work undertaken by PwC for the Committee included updates to the Remuneration Committee on remuneration and governance trends and 
market practice, providing remuneration benchmarking information for executive Directors and advice in respect of the review of the 
Remuneration Policy. In this financial year, PwC was paid £99,000. This is based on an agreed fee for business as usual support with 
additional work charged at hourly rates.
During the year, PwC also provided other consultancy services to the Group, including tax, pensions, network security and structuring work.
The Remuneration Committee reviews the independence and objectivity of the advice it receives from PwC at a private meeting held in May 
each year. It is satisfied that PwC is providing objective and robust professional advice. PwC is a member of the Remuneration Consultants 
Group and has signed up to that group’s Code of Conduct.
The Remuneration Committee also received materials, assistance and advice on remuneration policy from Robert Willock, the Group HR 
Director of Dairy Crest. The Chief executive attends all meetings by invitation, but is not present at any discussions relating specifically to his 
own remuneration.

17 May 2017 62 Dairy Crest Annual Report 2017
Directors’ report
Dairy Crest Group plc (‘Company’) is the holding company of the 
Dairy Crest Group of Companies (‘Group’). The Directors’ report 
for the year ended 31 March 2017 comprises the Strategic report 
found at pages 2 to 27, the details of Directors at pages 28 to 29 
and the Corporate Governance report at pages 30 to 61. The 
above-mentioned sections are expressly incorporated by reference 
into this, the Directors’ report. 
Going concern: The Group and Company’s business activities, 
together with factors likely to affect future development, 
performance and position are set out in the Strategic report from 
pages 2 to 21. The financial position, cash flows, liquidity position 
and borrowing facilities are described in the financial review on 
pages 12 to 15 (which also form part of the Strategic report). In 
addition, Notes 31 and 32 to the Accounts include the Group and 
Company’s objectives, policies and processes for managing its 
capital; its financial risk management objectives; details of its 
financial instruments and hedging activities; and its exposures to 
credit risk and liquidity risk. As highlighted in Note 31, the 
Company and Group meet day-to-day working capital 
requirements through syndicated revolving credit facilities and cash 
to ensure that forecast net borrowings plus reasonable operating 
headroom are covered by committed facilities which mature at 
least 12 months after the year end. At 31 March 2017, effective 
headroom was £112.0 million. There were no breaches of bank 
covenants in the year ended 31 March 2017 and projections do not 
indicate any breaches in the foreseeable future. Having reviewed 
and taken into account Going Concern and Liquidity Risk: 
Guidance for Directors of UK Companies 2009, published by the 
Financial Reporting Council in October 2009, the Directors are 
satisfied that the Company and the Group have adequate 
resources to continue operating for the foreseeable future. For this 
reason they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing 
the financial statements.
Viability statement: In accordance with provision C.2.2 of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code 2014, the Directors have assessed 
the viability of the Group over a three year period. The Directors 
have determined that a three year period to 31 March 2020 is an 
appropriate period over which to provide its viability statement. 
This is the period reviewed by the Board in the strategic planning 
process where assumptions are made around future growth for the 
existing business, new market opportunities, investment needs 
and funding requirements of the Group. A robust financial model of 
the Group is built by product and the metrics for the Group’s KPIs 
and bank covenants are reviewed.
Taking into account the Group’s current position and potential 
impact of the principal risks documented on pages 16 and 17 of 
the Annual Report and Accounts, the Directors confirm that they 
have a reasonable expectation that the Company will be able to 
continue to operate and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the 
period to 31 March 2020.
In making this statement the Board carried out a robust 
assessment of the principal risks facing the Group, including those 
that would threaten its business model, future performance, 
solvency or liquidity. The Board considers all of the principal risks, 
the likelihood of crystallisation, the potential net profit impact and 
the mitigating controls. In assessing the impact of a risk on the 
viability of the Group, the Board has considered the potential 
impact that the crystallisation of a severe but plausible risk may 
have on the Group meeting its bank covenants. 
The assumption has been made that the Group will be able to 
source an appropriate level of funding following the cessation of 
the £80 million bank facility in October 2018.
Future developments: Future developments are described in the 
Strategic report at pages 2 to 21.
Group results: The Group’s consolidated income statement is  
set out on page 70 and shows a profit for the financial year of 
£38.3 million compared with a loss of £113.0 million in 2015/16.
Dividends: The Directors are recommending a final dividend of 
16.3p (2015/16: 16.0p) per ordinary share which, if approved, will 
be paid to members whose name appears on the register at the 
close of business on 7 July 2017. Together, the final dividend and 
interim dividend (6.2p per ordinary share paid on 28 January 2017) 
make total dividends for the year of 22.5p per ordinary share 
(2015/2016: 22.1p).
Directors: Details of the Directors of the Company are set out at 
pages 28 to 29.

Company maintains liability insurance for its Directors and officers 
and those of its subsidiaries. The Directors, Company Secretary 
and other officers of the Company and those of its subsidiaries are 
indemnified by the Company to the extent permitted by company 
law. That indemnity provision has been in place during the year 
and remains in force. 
Disclosure of information to the Auditor: Each Director 
confirms that as far as he or she is aware, there is no relevant audit 
information of which the Company’s external auditor, EY, is 
unaware and that each Director has taken all steps he or she ought 
to have taken as a Director to make himself or herself aware of any 
relevant audit information and to establish that the external auditor 
is aware of that information.

Executive Committee have held roadshows and employee lunches 
at each site during the year. All employees are invited to attend 
these forums to receive an update on the business’s performance 
and its priorities and to ask any questions.  Dairy Crest Annual Report 2017 63
Governance
The Group’s principles of equal opportunities mean that the 
training, career development and promotion of disabled persons, 
should as far as possible, be the same as for other employees.
The Group has well-established consultation and negotiating 
arrangements with established trade unions.  
Share schemes are a long established and successful part of our 
total reward package, encouraging and supporting employee share 
ownership. Details of the savings-related share option scheme 
(‘Sharesave Scheme’) are set out in Note 27 to the financial 
statements on pages 106 to 107.

the Company together with details of movements in the Company’s 
issued share capital during 2016/17 are shown in Note 25 to the

report there were 141,072,297 ordinary shares of 25 pence each in 
issue, all of which are fully paid up and quoted on the London 
Stock Exchange with an aggregate nominal value of £35,268,074.
r ights and obligations attaching to shares: The holders of 
ordinary shares are entitled to receive the Company’s Report and

effective, electronic and paper proxy appointments and voting 
instructions must be received at the Company’s registered office, 
or such other place in the United Kingdom specified in the relevant 
notice of meeting, not later than 48 hours before a General 
Meeting. None of the shares carry any special rights with regard to 
control of the Company. There are no known arrangements under 
which financial rights are held by a person other than the holder of 
the shares and no known agreements on restrictions on share 
transfers or on voting rights. Shares acquired through company 
share schemes and plans rank pari passu with the shares in issue 
and have no special rights.
purchase of shares: The Directors have the authority to 
purchase up to 14,072,690 million of the Company’s ordinary 
shares. The authority remains valid until the AGM in 2017.
t ransfer of shares: Subject to applicable laws and regulations, 
there are no restrictions on transfer or limitations on the holding of 
any class of shares and no requirements for prior approval of any 
transfers.
s hare schemes: Details of the employee Sharesave Scheme are 
set out in Note 27 to the financial statements. The Company has a 
discretionary employees’ benefit trust, The Dairy Crest Employees’ 
Share Ownership Plan Trust (‘ESOPT’) funded by gifts to acquire 
shares for the potential benefit of employees. Details of shares held 
by the ESOPT at 31 March 2017 are set out on page 106. During 
the year shares have been released by the ESOPT in respect of 
share schemes for employees. The trustee of the ESOPT has the 
power to exercise all voting rights in relation to any investment 
(including ordinary shares) held within the ESOPT.
issue of shares: At the AGM on 19 July 2016, shareholders 
renewed the authority for the Board under the Articles to exercise 
all powers of the Company to allot relevant securities up to an 
aggregate nominal amount of £23,454,480.
purchase of own shares: At the AGM on 19 July 2016, 
shareholders granted the Company authority to make market 
purchases of up to 14,072,690 of its issued ordinary shares of 25 
pence each, provided that (i) the minimum price which may be paid 
for any such ordinary share is 25 pence (exclusive of expenses and 
appropriate taxes) and (ii) the maximum price (exclusive of 
expenses and appropriate taxes) which may be paid for any such 
ordinary share shall be not more than 5% above the average of the 
middle market prices for an ordinary share in the Company, as 
taken from the London Stock Exchange Daily Official List for the 
five business days immediately preceding the date of purchase. 
The Company did not exercise this authority during the year and 
made no market purchases.

only holder of more than 3% of, or 3% of voting rights attributable 
to, the Company’s issued ordinary share capital on 31 March 2017,

to 17 May 2017.
Articles of association: Changes to the Articles must be 
approved by the shareholders in accordance with applicable 
legislation. The Articles are available on our website.
significant agreements – change of control: There are a 
number of agreements to which the Company or its subsidiaries is 
a party that take effect, alter or terminate upon a change of control 
of the Company following a takeover bid. Details of the significant 
agreements of this kind are as follows:
Borrowing facilities – Non-compliance with the change of control 
clauses in the Group’s funding arrangements, or failure to reach 
agreement with the parties on revised terms, would require any 
acquirer to put in place replacement facilities.
Supply agreements – Certain supply agreements contain 
provisions whereby on a change of control of the Group, they may 
be terminable. Accordingly, a change of control of the Group could 
result in the need for the Group to source alternative supply for 
certain materials or services.
No compensation for loss of office: The Company does not 
have agreements with any Director or employee that would provide 
compensation for loss of office or employment resulting from a 
takeover, except that provisions of the Company’s share schemes 
and plans may cause options and awards granted to employees 
under such schemes and plans to vest on a takeover. 64 Dairy Crest Annual Report 2017
pensions: The Company employs only the Executive Directors. 
Most employees in the Group are employed by the Company’s 
main subsidiary, Dairy Crest Limited. Relevant companies within 
the Group became subject to the automatic enrolment regulations 
on 1 April 2013. Depending on their grade, effective from 1 April 
2013 employees either enter the auto enrolled pension 
arrangements for the Group which are provided by Zurich or into 
the Group’s defined contribution pension scheme also provided by 
Zurich. The Group’s defined benefit pension fund is closed to 
future accrual and is now in run-off. It remains under the control of 
a corporate trustee, Dairy Crest Pension Trustees Limited, the 
board of which comprises four directors nominated by Dairy Crest 
Limited and three directors elected by all members. Its assets are 
held separately from those of the Group and can only be used in 
accordance with the rules of the fund.
Greenhouse gas emissions: The Company is required to report 
annually on the quantity of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions in 
tonnes emitted as a result of activities for which it is responsible.

the actions which the Group has taken to reduce them are set out 
on pages 22 to 23 and form part of the Directors’ report 
disclosures.
Directors’ responsibility statement: The responsibility 
statement required under DTR 4.1 is set out on page 65.
Branch offices outside the UK: The Company has no branch 
offices.
Annual general meeting: The AGM will be held at Eversheds 
Sutherland (International) LLP, One Wood Street, London, EC2V 
7WS on Tuesday, 18 July 2017 at 12pm. The Notice of Meeting will 
be issued separately, together with details of the business to be 
considered and explanatory notes relating to each of the 
resolutions being proposed.

auditor for the year commencing 1 April 2017. A resolution to 
appoint Deloitte LLP as the Group’s auditor will be put to the 
forthcoming AGM. The Group’s current auditor, EY, will retire by 
rotation.

Accounting policies
Year ended 31 March 2017
Basis of preparation
The consolidated and Company financial statements have been 
prepared on a historical cost basis, modified in respect of the 
revaluation to fair value of financial instruments, assets held by 
defined benefit pension plans and on consolidation the original 
interest in an acquiree purchased through a stepped acquisition. 
They are presented in sterling and all values are rounded to the 
nearest 0.1 million (£ million) except where otherwise indicated.
The consolidated financial statements of Dairy Crest Group plc 
have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the 
European Union (‘EU’). The separate Company financial statements 
have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the 
EU and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the 
Companies Act 2006. The Company has taken advantage of the 
exemption provided under section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 
not to publish its individual income statement and related notes.
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the Group and Company have adequate 
resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable 
future. The financial statements have therefore continued to be 
prepared on a going concern basis. See Going Concern section on 
page 62 of the Directors’ Report.
Areas of estimation
The key sources of estimation uncertainty that have a significant 
risk of causing material adjustments to the carrying amounts of 
assets and liabilities within the next financial year are (i) The 
calculation of promotional discount accruals, (ii) the measurement 
of defined benefit pension scheme assets and obligations and (iii) 
the measurement of impairment of goodwill.
(i) The Group accrues for agreed promotional funding. Accruals 
for promotional funding are calculated based on an estimated 
redemption rate of the promotion on expected volumes. The 
redemption rate and volumes used are dependent on the 
promotional mechanic and considers known historical data on the 
performance of that mechanic. Management considers this to be 
an area of estimation, which is dependent on the customer mix 
and promotion mechanic. See Note 22.
(ii) The Group recognises and discloses its retirement benefit 
obligation in accordance with the measurement and presentational 
requirement of IAS 19 ‘Retirement Benefit Obligations’. The 
calculations include a number of judgements and estimations in 
respect of the expected rate of return on assets, the discount rate, 
inflation assumptions, the rate of increase in salaries, and life 
expectancy, amongst others. Changes in these assumptions can 
have a significant effect on the value of the retirement benefit 
obligation. See Note 21.
(iii) The Group determines whether goodwill is impaired on an 
annual basis and this requires an estimation of the value in use of 
the cash-generating units to which goodwill is allocated. The 
assessment of value in use is compared to the carrying value of 
goodwill. This requires estimation of future cash flows and the 
selection of a suitable discount rate. See Note 12. 
Areas of judgment
The following items are considered by Management to be key 
areas of judgment: 
(i) Classification of exceptional items – The Group classifies items of 
a material, one-off nature, which result from a restructuring of the 
business or some other event or circumstance as exceptional. These 
are disclosed separately in the consolidated income statement. 
Management considers this to be an area of judgment due to the 
assumption made that the items are material in size and one-off in 
nature. Further disclosure is provided in Note 4 and Note 7 .
(ii) Profit on the disposal of depots – The Group recognises profits 
from the disposal of closed Dairies depots as ‘Other income – 
property’ within continuing operations. Management considers this 
treatment appropriate on the basis that the closed depots were not 
related to the disposal of the Dairies operation and that all historic 
costs in respect of the closure of these depots have been charged 
to the income statement therefore ensuring consistent treatment 
between gains and losses. 
(iii)  Non-current assets held for sale – The Group has classified 
some closed properties as non-current assets held for sale. 
Management considers this to be an area of judgement due to the 
assumptions made around the timing of the disposals. See Note 
19.
(iv)  Contingent liability in respect of Chadwell Heath – The Group 
has disclosed a contingent liability in relation to a potential 
dilapidations liability at Chadwell Heath. Management considers 
this to be an area of judgement due to the uncertainty around the 
intention of the landlord with respect to the future use of the land 
following the cessation of the lease. See Note 28.
(v) Contingent liability in respect of potential litigation – The Group 
has disclosed a contingent liability in respect of potential litigation 
in relation to the demineralised whey and galacto-oligosaccharide 
capital project at Davidstow. Management considers this to be an 
area of judgment because a reliable estimation of the liability, if any, 
cannot be made at this stage. See Note 28. 
(vi)  Recognition of deferred tax asset – The Group has recognised a 
deferred tax asset in relation to carried forward trading losses on the 
basis that these losses, which have arisen from various unprofitable 
operations within the Group and rationalisation initiatives to promote 
the profitability of the Group as a whole, will be available to offset 
future taxable profits of the Group. See Note 6.
(vii) Operating segments – Management has judged that the Group 
comprises one segment under IFRS 8 ‘Operating Segments’. 
Certain product Group information is provided voluntarily to assist 
the users of the accounts. See Note 1. Dairy Crest Annual Report 2017 77

c hanges in accounting policies
The following accounting standards and interpretations became 
effective for the current reporting period:
International Accounting Standards (IAS/IFRSs) 
 • IAS 7 ‘Disclosure Initiative’ – Amendments to IAS7
 • IAS 12 ‘Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for Unrealised Losses’ 
– Amendments to IAS 12 
 • IFRS 12 ‘Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities’ – Clarification of 
the scope of the disclosure requirements in IFRS 12
The application of these standards has had no material impact on 
the net assets, results and disclosures of the Group in the year 
ended 31 March 2017. 
The IASB and IFRIC have issued the following standards and 
interpretations (with an effective date after the date of these 
financial statements):
 • IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’ (effective 1 
January 2018) 
 • IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’ (effective 1 January 2018)
 • IFRIC Interpretation 22 ‘Foreign Currency Transactions and 
Advance Consideration’ (effective 1 January 2018)
 • IFRS 16 ‘Leases’ (effective 1 January 2019)
The Directors do not anticipate that the adoption of IFRS 9 
‘Financial Instruments’, IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with 
Customers’ and IFRIC Interpretation 22 ‘Foreign Currency and 
Advance Consideration’ will have a material impact on the Group’s 
financial statements, however further disclosure around the 
potential impact of IFRS 15 has been provided.
IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’ will replace IAS 
18 ‘Revenue’ and the Group is in the early stages of evaluating the 
impact of the standard. 
Under IFRS 15, revenue will be recognised based on a five step 
model which requires, for each contract with a customer, the 
transaction price to be matched against the performance 
obligation arising under the contract or in the case of more than 
one performance obligation, apportioned over those obligations. 
The transaction price will be the amount of consideration the 
Group expects to be entitled to in exchange for transferring the 
goods or service to the customer. Depending on the particular 
contractual arrangements in place, application of the new standard 
could change the amount of revenue recognised on a contract 
and/or its timing.
Whilst management continues the process of evaluating the impact 
against all of the Groups contracts with customers, initial reviews 
by management indicate the impact of IFRS 15 would not 
materially change the way in which the Group accounts for 
revenue.
IFRS 16 ‘Leases’ will apply to annual reporting periods beginning 
on or after 1 January 2019 and will be applicable to the Group in its 
financial statements for the year ending 31 March 2020.
IFRS 16 will remove the distinction between Operating Leases and 
Finance Leases and will require lessees to report operating leases 
on the balance sheet, similar to the treatment of finance leases 
under IAS 17. Lessees will recognise an asset and a liability for 
each lease and will have to recognise an element of each lease 
payment as an interest charge.
The effect of this on the Group’s financial statements will be that 
the gross assets and gross liabilities will each increase by an equal 
and opposite amount. There will also be a timing effect on the 
income statement, as interest on leases will have to be charged in 
a similar way to that in which interest is charged on a loan which 
will result in more interest being charged in early periods of each 
lease and less interest being charged in the later periods.
Basis of consolidation
The Group financial statements consolidate the accounts of Dairy 
Crest Group plc (the Company), its subsidiaries and associates 
(together referred to as the Group). The financial statements are 
drawn up to 31 March each year using consistent accounting 
policies. 
Subsidiaries are entities that are directly or indirectly controlled by 
the Group. Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which 
the Group obtains control and continue to be consolidated until the 
date control ceases. All intercompany balances and transactions, 
including unrealised profits and losses arising from intra-group 
transactions, have been eliminated in full. 
a) Acquisitions
Subsidiaries acquired during the year are consolidated from the 
date on which control is transferred to the Group. The separable 
net assets, both tangible and intangible, of the newly acquired 
subsidiary undertakings are incorporated into the financial 
statements on the basis of the fair value as at the effective date of 
control, if appropriate. Acquisition costs incurred are expensed in 
the income statement.
If a business acquisition is achieved in stages, the acquisition date 
carrying amount of the Group’s previously held interest in the 
acquiree is remeasured to fair value at the acquisition date through 
the consolidated profit and loss account. The fair value 
measurement is determined using the hierarchy principles of 
IFRS13 ‘Fair Value Measurement’.
b) Discontinued operations 
Results of subsidiary undertakings disposed of during the financial 
year are included in the financial statements up to the effective date 
of disposal. Where a business component representing a separate 
major line of business is disposed of, or classified as held for sale, 
it is classified as a discontinued operation. The post-tax profit or 
loss of the discontinued operations is shown as a single amount on 
the face of the income statement, separate from the other results 
of the Group. The comparative consolidated income statement, 
other comprehensive income and associated notes have been 
restated as if the operation had been discontinued from the start of 
the comparative year. 
Foreign currency translation 
The functional and presentational currency of Dairy Crest Group 
plc and its subsidiaries is Sterling (£). 
Transactions in foreign currency are initially recorded in the 
functional currency rate ruling at the date of the transaction. 
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
are translated into Sterling at the balance sheet date. Exchange 
differences on monetary items are generally taken to the income 
statement. However, foreign currency differences arising from the 
translation of qualifying cash flow hedges to the extent the hedges 
are effective are recognised in other comprehensive income.  78 Dairy Crest Annual Report 2017
property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated 
depreciation and any impairment losses. Cost comprises the 
purchase price and any costs directly attributable to bringing the 
asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable 
of operating in the manner intended by management. Depreciation 
is calculated to write off the cost (less residual value) of property, 
plant and equipment, excluding freehold land, on a straight-line 
basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows:
Freehold buildings:  25 years
Leasehold land and buildings:   25 years or, if shorter, the 
period of the lease
Vehicles, plant and equipment:  4 to 20 years
The carrying value of property, plant and equipment is reviewed for 
impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that 
the carrying value may not be recoverable. If the carrying value 
exceeds the estimated recoverable value, the asset is written down 
to its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount of plant and 
equipment is the greater of the fair value less costs to sell or value 
in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows 
are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate 
that reflects current market assessments of the time value of 
money and the risks specific to the asset. For an asset that does 
not generate largely independent cash flows, the recoverable 
amount is determined for the cash-generating unit to which the 
asset belongs. Impairment losses are charged to the consolidated 
income statement.
An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon 
disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected to 
arise from the continued use of the asset. Any gain or loss arising 
on derecognition of the asset is included in the consolidated 
income statement in the year that it is derecognised. 
Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, 
construction or production of an asset that necessarily takes a 
substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use are 
capitalised as part of the cost of the respective assets. 
All other borrowing costs are recognised as an expense in the 
period they occur.
g oodwill
Goodwill arising on an acquisition is carried at cost at acquisition 
date less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill on acquisition is initially measured as the cost of the 
acquisition less the fair value of net identifiable assets acquired and 
the liabilities assumed in exchange for the business combination. 
The cost of the acquisition is measured as the consideration 
transferred (measured at acquisition date fair value), the amount of 
any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and in the case of 
business combinations achieved in stages, the acquisition date fair 
value of any previous equity interest in the acquiree. 
Goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if 
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value 
may be impaired. 
Any goodwill acquired is allocated to the cash-generating unit or 
groups of cash-generating units expected to benefit from the 
combination’s synergies as at the acquisition date. Impairment is 
determined by assessing the recoverable amount of the cash-
generating unit to which the goodwill relates. Where the 
recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the 
carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognised. Where 
goodwill forms part of a cash generating unit and part of the 
operation within that unit is disposed of, the goodwill associated 
with the operation disposed of is included in the carrying amount 
of the operation when determining the gain or loss on disposal of 
the operation. Goodwill disposed of in this circumstance is 
measured on the basis of the relative values of the operation 
disposed of and the portion of the cash-generating unit retained.
intangible assets
Intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation 
and any recognised impairment losses. All intangible assets 
recognised by the Group have finite useful economic lives and are 
being amortised on a straight line basis.
Intangible assets acquired as part of an acquisition of a business 
are recognised at fair value separately from goodwill if the fair value 
can be measured reliably on initial recognition and the future 
expected economic benefits flow to the Group. Acquired intangible 
assets comprise the Frylight brand which was considered to have 
a useful life of 15 years at the date of acquisition.
Intangible assets generated internally comprise software and 
product development where the future recoverability can 
reasonably be assured under IAS 38 ‘Intangible Assets’. 
Development is amortised over a period of up to ten years 
dependent on the type of development. Internally generated 
intangible assets that are not yet available for use are tested for 
impairment annually either individually or at the cash-generating 
unit level or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances 
indicate that the carrying value may be impaired.
investments
The Company recognises its investments in subsidiaries at cost 
being the fair value of consideration paid, less provisions for 
impairment where appropriate.
Research and development
Expenditure on research is written off as incurred. Development 
expenditure is also written off as incurred unless the future 
recoverability of this expenditure can reasonably be assured as 
required by IAS 38 ‘Intangible Assets’.
inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. 
Cost includes the purchase price of raw materials (on a first in first 
out basis), direct labour and a proportion of manufacturing 
overheads based on normal operating capacity incurred in bringing 
each product to its present location and condition. Net realisable 
value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of 
business less estimated costs of completion and selling costs.
ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED Dairy Crest Annual Report 2017 79
The numbers
Financial Assets and l iabilities
Financial assets and liabilities are recognised at fair value on initial 
recognition.
The Group and Company classify financial assets on initial 
recognition within the scope of IAS 39 as: 
 – financial assets at fair value through income statement;
 – loans and receivables; 
 – held-to-maturity investments; or 
 – available-for-sale financial assets, as appropriate. 
The Group and Company classify non-derivative financial liabilities 
into the following categories: 
 – financial liabilities at fair value through profit and loss; or 
 – other financial liabilities.
The Group holds derivative financial instruments to hedge its 
foreign currency exposures.
A financial asset is derecognised when the rights to receive cash 
flows from that asset have expired. A financial liability is 
dereognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged, 
cancelled or expires. 
a) t rade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables are recognised and carried at original 
invoice amount less an allowance for any uncollectable amounts. 
An estimate for doubtful debts is made when collection of the full 
amount is no longer probable. Trade receivable debts are written 
off when there is no expectation of recovery. 
b) c ash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and in hand 
and short-term deposits with an original maturity of three months 
or less. For the purposes of the consolidated cash flow statement, 
cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as 
defined above, net of bank overdrafts.
c) interest bearing loans and borrowings
Interest bearing loans and borrowings are initially recognised at the 
fair value net of issue costs associated with the borrowing. After 
initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are 
subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective 
interest method. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into 
account any issue costs and any discount or premium on 
settlement. Gains and losses are recognised in the Consolidated 
Income Statement when the liabilities are derecognised.
d) n et debt
The Group and Company define net debt as interest bearing loans 
and borrowings and finance leases less cash and cash 
equivalents. The calculation of net debt excludes the fair value of 
derivative financial instruments with the exception of cross-
currency swaps to fix foreign currency debt in Sterling where they 
are designated as cash flow hedges. In this case the fixed Sterling 
debt, not the underlying foreign currency debt retranslated, is 
included in net debt. It includes any cash or borrowings included 
within disposal groups classified as held for sale and excludes 
unamortised upfront facility fees.
e) Derivative financial instruments
The Group and Company use derivative financial instruments such 
as forward currency contracts, cross-currency swaps to hedge its 
risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations. Such derivative 
financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value and 
subsequently re-measured to fair value at each balance sheet date.
For derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge 
accounting, any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value 
are taken directly to the income statement for the year.
f) c ash flow hedges
When a derivative financial instrument is designated as a cash flow 
hedging instrument at inception of the hedge relationship, the 
effective portion of the changes in fair value of the derivative is 
recognised to other comprehensive income and accumulated in 
the hedging reserve. The ineffective portion is recognised in the 
income statement.
The cumulative amount recognised to other comprehensive 
income is reclassified into the income statement out of other 
comprehensive income in the same period or periods during which 
the hedged forecast cash flows affects the income statement or 
the hedged item affects the income statement, for example when 
the future sale actually occurs, interest payments are made or 
when debt matures.
If the forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the 
hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, the 
hedge instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or 
designated as revoked, the hedge accounting is discontinued 
prospectively. If the forecast transaction is no longer to occur, then 
the cumulative amounted recognised in other comprehensive 
income is reclassified to the income statement. 
Fair value measurement
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or 
paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market 
participants at the measurement date, regardless of whether that 
price is directly observable or estimated using another valuation 
technique. In estimating the fair value of an asset or liability, the 
Group takes into account the characteristics of the asset or liability 
if marker participants would take those characteristics into account 
when pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date. 
All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or 
disclosed in the financial statements are categorised within the fair 
value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level 
input that is observable and significant to the fair value 
measurement as a whole:
 • Level 1 – Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for 
identical assets or liabilities
 • Level 2 – Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that 
is significant to the fair value measurement is directly or indirectly 
observable
 • Level 3 – Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that 
is significant to the fair value measurement is unobservable.
For assets and liabilities that are recognised in the financial 
statements on a recurring basis, the Group determines whether 
transfers have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by 
re-assessing categorisation (based on the lowest level input that is 
significant to the fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of 
each reporting period. 80 Dairy Crest Annual Report 2017
provisions
A provision is a liability of uncertain timing or amount that is 
recognised when the Group or Company has a present obligation 
(legal or constructive) where, as a result of a past event, it is more 
likely than not that payment will be required to settle the obligation 
and the amount can be estimated. If the effect is material, 
expected future cash flows are discounted using the current 
pre-tax rate that reflects the risks specific to the liability. 
Provisions are estimates and the actual costs and timings of future 
cash flows are dependent on future events. Provisions are 
reviewed regularly by management, with any difference between 
the amounts previously recognised and current estimate or actual 
liability being recognised to the income statement.
l eased assets
Assets acquired under finance leases, which transfer to the Group 
substantially all the risks and benefits incidental to ownership of the 
leased item, are capitalised at the inception of the lease at fair 
value of the leased asset or, if lower, the present value of the 
minimum lease payments. The net present value of future lease 
rentals is included as a liability on the balance sheet. The interest 
element of lease rentals is charged to the income statement in the 
year. Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and 
benefits of ownership of the asset are classified as operating 
leases. 
Assets held under operating leases are not recognised in the 
Group’s balance sheet, with the operating lease rentals being 
charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the 
lease term.
n on-current assets held for sale
Non-current assets held for sale comprise closed properties 
owned by the Group that meet the definition of held for sale assets 
under IFRS 5 ‘Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued 
operations’.
For a property to be classified as held for sale it must be available 
for immediate resale in its present condition and the sale must be 
highly probable. The following criteria must be met for the sale to 
be ‘highly probable’:
 • Management must be committed to a plan to sell the asset
 • An active programme to locate a buyer and complete the plan 
must be initiated
 • The asset must be actively marketed for sale at a price that is 
reasonable
 • The sale should be expected to qualify for recognition as a 
completed sale within one year from the date of classification; and
 • Actions required to complete the plan should indicate that it is 
unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or the 
plan withdrawn
Non-current assets held for sale are measured at the lower of 
carrying value and fair value less costs to sell.
Retirement benefit obligations
The Group operates two types of pension arrangements, a defined 
benefit scheme and a defined contribution scheme.
a) Defined benefit scheme
The net asset or liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect 
of the defined benefit pension scheme is the fair value of scheme 
assets less the present value of the defined benefit obligations at 
the balance sheet date as adjusted for unrecognised past service 
cost. Any asset resulting from the calculation is limited to past 
service cost, plus the present value of available refunds and 
reductions in future contributions to the scheme. Where the Group 
is considered to have a contractual obligation to fund the scheme 
above the accounting value of the liabilities, an onerous obligation 
is recognised as an unrecoverable notional surplus. The defined 
benefit obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries 
using the projected unit credit method.
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments 
and changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised in full to the 
statement of comprehensive income as they arise.
The Company has closed its defined benefit scheme and therefore 
no current service costs are required to be charged to income 
statement. Past service costs are recognised in the income 
statement at the earlier of the date of the plan amendment or 
curtailment, and the date that the Group recognises related 
restructuring costs. 
Scheme administration costs that are not directly related to 
investment activities are charged to the income statement. 
Administration costs that are directly related to investment are 
recognised as part of the re-measurement exercise through the 
Statement of Comprehensive Income. 
The net interest charge is calculated by applying the discount rate 
to the net defined benefit liability or asset. 
b) Defined contribution scheme
These pension arrangements do not constitute a future obligation 
to the Group. Members of these schemes will contribute a 
percentage of their salary into the scheme and the Company will 
pay an additional amount into the scheme. The size of an 
individual’s pension on retirement is based on the performance of 
the asset portfolio and is not linked to salary. Company 
contributions to the scheme are charged to the income statement 
in the same period as services are rendered by the relevant 
employee. 
s hare-based payments
a) equity-settled performance payments
The Group and Company have issued equity instruments for which 
they receive services from employees in consideration for these 
equity instruments. All of the awards granted under existing plans 
are classified as equity-settled awards. The Group and Company 
recognise a compensation expense that is based on the fair value 
of the awards measured at grant date using an appropriate pricing 
model. Fair value is not subsequently remeasured unless relevant 
conditions attaching to the award are modified. 
Fair value reflects any market performance conditions and all 
non-vesting conditions. Adjustments are made to the 
compensation expense to reflect actual and expected forfeitures 
due to failure to satisfy service conditions or non-market 
performance conditions. 
ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED Dairy Crest Annual Report 2017 81
The numbers
The compensation expense is generally recognised to the income 
statement on a straight-line basis over the vesting period and a 
corresponding credit is recognised in equity. 
Where an equity-settled award is cancelled it is treated as if it had 
vested on the date of cancellation, and any cost not yet recognised 
in the income statement for the award is expensed immediately.
Rights granted to employees of subsidiary undertakings over 
equity instruments of the Company are treated as an investment in 
the Company’s balance sheet.
b) employees’ s hare o wnership plan (“esop ”)
The shares in the Company held by the Dairy Crest Employees’ 
Share Ownership Plan Trust to satisfy Long Term Incentive Share 
Plan awards are presented as a deduction from equity in arriving at 
shareholders’ equity. Consideration received from the sale of such 
shares is also recognised in equity with no gain or loss recognised 
in the consolidated income statement.
Revenue
Revenue on the sale of food related products is recognised on 
delivery. Revenue comprises the invoiced value for the sale of 
goods net of Value Added Tax, rebates and discounts and after 
eliminating sales within the Group. 
Discounts comprise mainly promotional accruals, overriding 
discounts and customer terms. Promotional accruals are made in 
respect of customer claims, where a discount is claimed following 
completion of the promotion based on the redemption rate of that 
promotion. The accruals are calculated based on the expected 
in-store redemption rate for the particular promotional mechanic 
(e.g ‘buy one get one free’ or ‘25% off’) against the delivered 
volume. The redemption rate used considers known historical data 
on the performance of that mechanic and is adjusted for actual 
performance. An overriding discount is a discount given across all 
sales of a particular product, providing the sales exceed agreed 
volumes. The overriding discounts are calculated as a proportion 
of the level of customer sales in the period. A customer term is 
where the Group has agreed to pay a customer a sum of money 
based on that customer delivering an agreed sales and 
promotional plan. These terms are generally paid for in arrears, 
following delivery of the plan, and are accrued for over the period 
to which they relate.
Dividend income is recognised when the Company’s right to 
receive payment is established.
o ther income
Other income comprises the profit on disposal of depots as a 
result of rationalisation.
exceptional items
Certain items are recorded separately in the income statement as 
exceptional. Only items of a material, one-off nature, which result 
from a restructuring of the business or some other event or 
circumstance, are disclosed in this manner in order to give a better 
understanding of the underlying operational performance of the 
Group. The profits arising on disposal of closed sites, other than 
closed Dairies depots retained by the Group following disposal of 
the Dairies operation, are reported within exceptional items. 
government and other grants
Government grants are initially recognised at their fair value where 
there is reasonable assurance that the grant will be received and all 
attaching conditions will be complied with. When the grant relates 
to an expense item, it is recognised as income over the periods 
necessary to match the grant on a systematic basis to the costs 
that it is intended to compensate. Where the grant relates to an 
asset, the fair value is credited to a deferred income account and is 
released to the income statement over the expected useful life of 
the relevant asset in equal annual instalments.
income tax
Income tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. It is 
recognised to the income statement except to the extent it relates 
to items recognised directly to equity or other comprehensive 
income.
Current tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount 
expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities, 
based on tax rates and laws that are enacted or substantively 
enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred income tax is provided on all temporary differences at the 
balance sheet date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial 
statements, except as indicated below. Deferred tax is not 
recognised in respect of:
 • temporary differences arising from the initial recognition of 
goodwill or the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a 
transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of 
the transaction affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable 
profit or loss; and
 • taxable temporary differences associated with investments in 
subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint ventures, where the 
timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be 
controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not 
reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised for all deductible 
temporary differences, carry-forward of unused tax assets and 
unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable 
profit will be available against which they can be utilised. The 
carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at each 
balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer 
probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or 
part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilised.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax 
rates that are expected to apply in the year when the asset is 
realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) 
that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance 
sheet date. 
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset only if a legal 
enforcement right exists to set off current tax assets against 
current tax liabilities, the deferred income taxes relate to the same 
taxation authority and that authority permits the Group to make a 
single net payment. 82 Dairy Crest Annual Report 2017
Notes to the fiNaNcial statemeNts
1 segmental analysis
IFRS 8 requires operating segments to be determined based on the Group’s internal reporting to the Chief Operating Decision Maker 
(‘CODM’). The CODM has been determined to be the Company’s Board members as they are primarily responsible for the allocation of 
resources to segments and the assessment of performance of the segments.
The business is managed centrally by functional teams (Demand, Supply, Procurement and Finance) that have responsibility for the whole of 
the Group’s product portfolio. Although some discrete financial information is available to provide insight to the management team of the key 
performance drivers, the product group profit is not part of the CODM’s review. Management has judged that the continuing Group comprises 
one operating segment under IFRS 8. As such, disclosures required under IFRS 8 for the financial statements are shown on the face of the 
consolidated income statement and balance sheet.
To assist the readers of the financial statements, management considers it appropriate to provide voluntary disclosure on a basis consistent 
with historical reporting of the cheese and functional ingredients product group and the butters, spreads and oils product group results 
included within the consolidated income statement. In disclosing the product group profit for the year, certain assumptions have been made 
when allocating resources which are centralised at a group level.
The ‘Other’ product group comprises revenue earned from distributing products for third parties and certain central costs net of recharges to 
the other product groups. Generally, central costs less external ‘Other’ revenue is recharged back into the product groups such that their 
result reflects the total cost base of the Group. ‘Other’ operating profit therefore is nil.
The results under the historical segmentation basis for the Group included in the financial information are as follows:

Demineralised whey powder and Gos projects
The Group has completed an investment in its cheese creamery at Davidstow, Cornwall enabling the Group to manufacture demineralised 
whey powder, a base ingredient of infant formula, and galacto-oligosaccharide (‘GOS’), widely used in infant formula. During the year £19.0 
million of costs were charged to the income statement in relation to this project. £12.3 million related to commissioning of the facility of which 
£7.3 million was for the write-down of product produced during the commissioning process which did not meet the required standard to be 
considered for infant formula. In addition, £5.8 million related to project review costs. A further £0.9 million has been charged in respect of a 
financial liability relating to the project that did not meet the criteria for hedge accounting due to it being an ineffective hedge at 31 March 2017. 
In the prior year £16.2 million of exceptional costs were incurred of which £5.3 million related to the commissioning and £6.5 million on project 
review costs. A further £4.4 million was charged for set up costs. The tax credit relating to this exceptional charge in the year was £3.1 million 
(2016: £2.7 million). Management considers these costs to be exceptional due to the materiality and the one-off nature of the capital project to 
which they relate and do not expect any significant costs in relation to this project going forward.
Disposal costs in relation to closed manufacturing sites
The Group has incurred costs of £2.3 million relating to the disposal of closed manufacturing sites in Totnes in Devon, Fenstanton in 
Cambridgshire and Crudgington in Shropshire. Management has determined these properties to be ‘held for sale’ at the 31 March 2017 and 
any future gains in respect of these properties will be treated as exceptional consistent with the historical closure costs. The tax credit in 
relation to these costs was £0.1 million.
settlement gain in relation to f armright l imited and Quadra f oods l imited
On 9 May 2016, the Group paid £1.0 million in full and final settlement of claims arising out of the debt originally owed to Farmright Limited. 
Claims between the Group, Farmright Limited and Quadra Foods Limited (and any assignees of the claims) are now resolved. Following 
settlement, £2.1 million plus a provision for professional fees of £0.1 million which was no longer required, have been released. Management 
considers this credit to be exceptional due to it being one-off in nature and in relation to the debt of Quadra Foods Limited, for which £4.3 
million was provided for under an exceptional impairment provision in the year ended 31 March 2012. The tax charge in relation to this release 
was £0.4 million.
Prior Year
Property provision
The Group commissioned a dilapidation assessment on some of its leasehold properties. The £1.8 million exceptional charge represents an 
increase in provision for property dilapidation liabilities on properties where the Group considers there to be a high likelihood of exiting when 
the lease term expires. The tax credit on this exceptional charge was £0.4 million.
spreads restructuring costs
During the year ended 31 March 2015, the Group completed the consolidation of its spreads production operations into one site in Kirkby, 
Liverpool. As a result of this consolidation, the site at Crudgington, Shropshire ceased production in December 2014. The exceptional credit of 
£0.7 million in the year represents the release of a prior year provision relating to the completion of this project that was not required. The tax 
charge relating to this exceptional credit was £0.3 million.
Gain on remeasurement to fair value of original investment in Promovita ingredients l imited
On 18 December 2015, the Group completed the stepped acquisition of Promovita Ingredients Limited (‘Promovita’). In accordance with IFRS 
3 (Revised), the original investment was revalued to fair value at point of acquisition and the resulting gain of £6.0 million has been recognised 
within exceptional items. See Note 30. 86 Dairy Crest Annual Report 2017

The total Group effective tax rate is below the headline rate of UK corporation tax at 17.9% (2016: 15.2%). One of the reasons for this is the 
availability of capital losses for which no deferred tax asset has been recognised against profits of £3.0 million on the disposal of closed 
depots. We expect the effective tax rate to remain below the headline rate of UK corporation tax next year due to the expected disposal of 
closed properties.
*  Two further reductions in the UK Corporation tax rate have been enacted, taking the rate to 19% from April 2017 and to 17% from April 2020. Accordingly, deferred tax 
has been provided on all temporary differences at the rate in force when they are anticipated to reverse. 
Discontinued operations
The total income tax credit in respect of discontinued operations for the year ended 31 March 2017 is £9.8 million (2016: £35.7 million). Tax 
relief on exceptional costs incurred by discontinued operations in the year ended 31 March 2017 was £5.7 million (2016: £28.8 million). A £3.8 
million tax credit has been realised in respect of the disposal of St Hubert SAS. Tax attributable to discontinued operations is disclosed in

Notes to the fiNANCiAl stAtemeNts CoNtiNueD
The Group has capital losses which arose in the UK of £121.2 million (2016: £1 18. 1 million) that are available indefinitely for offset against future taxable 
gains. Deferred tax has not been recognised in respect of these losses as there is no foreseeable prospect of their being utilised. The Group has 
realised capital gains amounting to £22.6 million (2016: £47 .9 million) for which rollover relief claims have been or are intended to be made. 
7 Discontinued operations
On 26 December 2015, the Group completed the disposal of its Dairies operation to Muller UK & Ireland Group LLP. The Dairies operation has 
been classified as a discontinued operation since the year of disposal.

A tax provision of £3.8 million was created when St Hubert SAS was disposed of in August 2012. A tax credit has been recognised in the 
period in respect of this because the period during which the French authorities can raise tax assessments has now expired. This has been 
recognised within discontinued operations consistent with the results of St Hubert SAS following disposal.
costs associated with the separation and proposed sale of the Dairies operations
In the prior year the Group incurred £8.9 million of separation costs such as one-off systems costs and professional fees. A tax credit of £0.5 
million has been recognised in the period (2016: £1.9 million).
Rationalisation of operating sites
In September 2014, the Group announced it had started consultation with employees and their representatives regarding the closure of its 
glass bottling dairy in Hanworth, West London. In the prior year, an exceptional charge of £1.7 million was incurred in the year, primarily 
comprising accelerated depreciation of assets following an assessment of their useful economic lives as well as other associated closure 
costs. The Group ceased production at its specialist cream potting factory in Chard, Somerset in September 2015. In the prior year a charge 
of £6.0 million was recognised in relation to site decommissioning and demolition costs. The tax credit on these exceptional costs in the prior 
year was £0.3 million.

8 earnings per share
The basic earnings per share (‘EPS’) measures for the year have been calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity shareholders from 
the relevant operations (continuing, discontinued and total Group) by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the 
period, excluding those held by the Dairy Crest Employees’ Share Ownership Plan Trust which are held as treasury shares and treated as 
cancelled.
The weighted average number of shares used in the calculation of basic EPS is detailed below along with the diluted weighted average 
number of ordinary shares used for the calculation of diluted EPS. The diluted weighted average number of ordinary shares reflects the dilutive 
impact of share options exercisable under the Group’s share option schemes. Note that in the circumstances where there is a basic loss per 
share from continuing operations, share options are anti-dilutive and therefore are not included in the calculation of any other EPS measures.

recognition of £12.0 million of goodwill (see Note 30) and disposed of its Dairies operation leading to the disposal of £70.7 million of goodwill 
which was fully written down during the year ended 31 March 2012. 
impairment testing of goodwill
Acquired goodwill has been allocated for impairment testing purposes to three groups of cash-generating units (‘CGUs’): Butters and 
Spreads, MH Foods and Cheese and Functional Ingredients. Goodwill recognised on the acquisition of Promovita Ingredients Limited is 
included in the Cheese and Functional Ingredients CGU as the business is directly linked to the Cheese and Functional Ingredients product 
group with a number of shared overheads.
All groups of CGUs with goodwill are tested for impairment annually by comparing the carrying amount of that CGU with its recoverable 
amount. Recoverable amount is determined based on a value-in-use calculation using cash flow projections based on financial budgets and 
strategic plans approved by senior management covering a three-year period and appropriate growth rates beyond that. The discount rate 
applied to the projections was 6.5% for Butters and Spreads, MH Foods and Cheese and Functional Ingredients (2016: 6.0%).
The growth rate used to extrapolate cash flows beyond the three-year period for Butters and Spreads, MH Foods and Cheese and Functional 
Ingredients is nil (2016: nil).
The carrying amount of goodwill allocated to groups of CGUs at 31 March 2017 is:
MH Foods £6.7 million (2016: £6.7 million)
Butters and Spreads £65.5 million (2016: £65.5 million)
Cheese and Functional Ingredients £14.1 million (2016: £14.1 million)
Key assumptions on which management has based its cash flow projections 
Gross margin – budgeted gross margins are based initially on actual margins achieved in the preceding year further adjusted for projected 
input and output price changes, volume changes, initiatives implemented and associated efficiency improvements. The budgeted margins 
form the basis for strategic plans, which incorporate longer-term market trends. 
Discount rates – Discount rates are pre-tax and calculated by reference to average industry gearing levels, the cost of debt and the cost of 
equity based on the capital asset pricing model and CGU-specific risk factors.
Raw materials prices – budgets are prepared using the most up to date price and forecast price data available. This is based on forward 
prices in the market place adjusted for any contracted prices at the time of forecast. The key resources are milk, vegetable oils, fuel oil, diesel, 
gas and electricity and packaging costs.
Growth rate estimates – for periods beyond the length of the strategic plans, growth estimates are based upon published industry research 
adjusted downwards to reflect the risk of extrapolating growth beyond a three-year time frame. 
The Directors consider the assumptions used to be consistent with the historical performance of each CGU where appropriate and to be 
realistically achievable in the light of economic and industry measures and forecasts.
2017 and 2016
sensitivity to changes in assumptions
With regard to the assessment of value-in-use of the Butters and Spreads, MH Foods and Cheese and Functional Ingredients CGUs, 
management believes that no reasonably possible change in the above key assumptions would cause the carrying value of those units to 
exceed their recoverable amount. 94 Dairy Crest Annual Report 2017

In the year ending 31 March 2017, additions to assets in the course of construction of £4.2 million comprised third party system support costs 
relating to a new enterprise planning system of £3.7 million (2016: £nil) and product development costs of £0.5 million (2016: £nil). In the prior 
year, the assets in the course of construction of £3.5 million comprised third party systems and set-up support costs relating to the 
demineralised whey powder and GOS projects at Davidstow.
Internally generated intangible assets comprise software development and implementation costs across manufacturing sites and Head Office 
and product development where the future recoverability can be reasonably assured under IAS 38 ‘Intangible Assets’.
Acquired intangibles comprise predominantly brands acquired with the acquisition of businesses. The largest component within acquired 
intangibles is the ‘Frylight’ brand acquired with the acquisition of Morehands Limited (MH Foods Limited) in June 2011. A useful life of 15 years 
has been assumed for this brand, with 9 years remaining. The carrying value of the Frylight brand at 31 March 2017 is £3.7 million (2016: £4.1 
million).
14 investments
c onsolidated
A charge of £0.5 million was incurred during the year ended 31 March 2017 following an impairment of the investment in HEICO Limited. This 
investment related to the Dairies operation and the charge has therefore been recognised within discontinued operations.
In the prior year, the Group acquired the outstanding share capital of Promovita Ingredients Limited (‘Promovita’) for a cash consideration of 
£6.0 million. Promovita was established in 2014 as a joint venture between the Group and Fayrefield Foods Limited to develop and produce 
galacto-oligosaccharide, a prebiotic for use in infant formula. (see Note 30). Dairy Crest Annual Report 2017 95

On 4 April 2016, the Group repaid $123 million (£70.2 million) and £10 million of 2006 fixed coupon loan notes on maturity. To fund the 
repayment, on 23 March 2016, the Group raised £45 million and $45 million (£31.1 million) of fixed coupon loan notes. The Sterling loan notes 
have a maturity of 10 years and an interest rate of 3.34%. The US Dollar loan notes have a maturity of seven years. The principal and the 
interest cash flows have been swapped into Sterling at an exchange rate of 1.4471 and an interest rate of 3.23%. Upfront debt issuance costs 
amounted to £0.4 million and these are being charged to the consolidated income statement over the term of the loan notes.
On 6 October 2015, the Group refinanced its revolving credit facility. The £170 million plus €90 million revolving credit facility which was due to 
expire in October 2016 was cancelled and replaced by a £240 million facility, of which £80 million will expire on 6 October 2018 and £160 
million will expire on 6 October 2020. Upfront debt issuance costs amounted to £1.6 million and these are being charged to the consolidated 
income statement over the expected life of the facility. There were no debt issuance costs charged to the income statement relating to the 
cancelled facility in the prior year.
The Group is subject to a number of covenants in relation to its borrowing facilities which, if contravened, would result in its loans becoming 
immediately repayable. These covenants specify a maximum net debt to EBITDA ratio of 3.5 times and minimum interest cover ratio of 3.0 
times. No covenants were contravened in the year ended 31 March 2017 (2016: None).

21 Retirement benefit obligations
The Group has a defined benefit pension scheme (Dairy Crest Group Pension Fund), which is closed to future service accrual and a defined 
contribution scheme (Dairy Crest Group defined contribution scheme).
Defined Benefit Pension Scheme
The Dairy Crest Group Pension Fund (‘the Fund’) is a final salary defined benefit pension scheme, which was closed to future service accrual 
from 1 April 2010 and had been closed to new joiners from 30 June 2006. This pension scheme is a final salary scheme.
The Fund is administered by a corporate trustee which is legally separate from the Company. The Trustee’s directors comprise representatives 
of both the employer and employees, plus a professional trustee. The Trustee is required by law to act in the interest of all relevant beneficiaries 
and is responsible for the investment policy with regard to the assets plus the day to day administration of the benefits.
The Company and Trustee have agreed a long-term strategy for reducing investment risk as and where appropriate. This includes an 
asset-liability matching policy which aims to reduce the volatility of the funding level of the pension plan by investing in assets which perform in 
line with the liabilities of the plan so as to protect against inflation being higher than expected. In December 2008 and June 2009, certain 
obligations relating to retired members were hedged by the purchase of annuity contracts. 
During the financial year, a Flexible Retirement Option (‘FRO’) exercise was carried out. An offer enabling deferred pensioners aged 55 and 
over to take cash equivalent transfer values (or trivial commutation lump sums, where applicable), with financial advice paid for by the 
company. Transfer values totalling £16.7 million and trivial commutation lump sums totalling £0.1 million were accepted. This resulted in a 
settlement gain before costs of £2.0 million, representing IAS19 liabilities extinguished of £18.8 million less amounts paid of £16.8 million.
UK legislation requires that pension schemes are funded prudently. The most recent full actuarial valuation of the Fund was carried out as at 
31 March 2013 by the Fund’s independent actuary using the projected unit credit method. Full actuarial valuations are carried out triennially. 
This valuation resulted in a deficit of £145.0 million compared to the IAS19 deficit of £56.3 million reported at that date. The next full actuarial 
valuation is currently being carried out on the 31 March 2016 position. We expect the results of the valuation in the first half of 2017/18.
Under the latest schedule of contributions, which was signed in March 2014, the level of contributions is £13 million per annum from April 2014 
to March 2016, then £16 million per annum until March 2017 and then £20 million per annum until March 2020. Until June 2018, these 
contributions included £2.8 million per annum of rental payments for land and buildings that were subject to a sale and leaseback 
arrangement between the Group and the Fund as part of the final schedule of contributions. The Group bought back the land and buildings 
for £8.3 million in November 2015 with rental payments ceasing from this date. This reduced contributions payable to £11.8 million per annum 
to March 2016, £13.2 million per annum from April 2016 to March 2017, £17.2 million per annum from April 2017 until June 2018 and then £20 
million per annum until March 2020.
A new schedule of contributions will be agreed with the Trustee following the next actuarial review as at 31 March 2016.
The Fund duration is an indicator of the weighted-average time until benefit payments are made. For the Fund as a whole, the duration is 
around 20 years reflecting the approximate split of the defined benefit obligation (including insured pensioners) between deferred members 
(duration of 27 years), current non-insured pensioners (duration of 15 years) and insured pensioners (duration of 11 years).
The principal risks associated with the Group’s defined benefit pension arrangements are as follows:
Asset Volatility
The liabilities are calculated using the discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields; if assets underperform this yield, this will 
create a deficit. The Fund holds a significant proportion in a range of return-seeking assets which, though expected to outperform corporate 
bonds in the long-term, create volatility and risk in the short-term. The allocation to return-seeking assets is monitored to ensure it remains 
appropriate given the Fund’s long-term objectives.
Changes in Bond Yields
A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase the value placed on the Fund’s liabilities for accounting purposes, although this will be 
partially offset by an increase in the value of the Fund’s bond holdings.
Inflation Risk
A significant portion of the Fund’s benefit obligations are linked to inflation, and higher expected future inflation will lead to higher liabilities 
(although, in most cases, caps on the level of inflationary increases are in place to protect against extreme inflation). The majority of the assets 
are either unaffected by or only loosely correlated with inflation, meaning that an increase in expected future inflation will also increase the 
deficit.
Longevity Risk
The majority of the Fund’s obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member, so increases in life expectancy will result in an increase 
in liabilities.
A contingent liability exists in relation to the equalisation of Guaranteed Minimum Pension (‘GMP’). The UK Government intends to implement 
legislation which could result in higher benefits for some members. This would increase the defined benefit obligation of the Fund. At this 
stage, it is not possible to quantify the impact of this change. Dairy Crest Annual Report 2017 101

** Includes obligations to deferred members of £676.9 million (2016: £541.9 million) and non-insured members of £317.1 million (2016: £244.9 million).
The Group is entitled to any surplus on winding up of the Fund albeit refunds are subject to tax deductions of 35% at source. Based on the 
present value of committed cash contributions at 31 March 2017 and the IAS 19 valuation at that date of £109.6 million, there would be 
nothing deducted from any notional surplus returned to the Group (2016: £12.1 million). In the prior year this was recognised as an additional 
liability in accordance with IFRIC 14. It should be noted that cash contributions are determined by reference to the triennial actuarial valuation, 
not the IAS 19 valuation. The actuarial deficit is greater than that recognised under IAS 19 since liabilities are discounted by reference to gilt 
yields rather than high quality corporate bond yields.

not by corporations. Investors benefit from higher yields on the bonds due to the  additional risks of investing in emerging market countries, compared to developed

market debt and distressed debt of non-investment grade. The investment strategies will also allocate amounts in investment grade credit, sovereign bonds and 
cash for defensive reasons. The strategies are opportunistic and allocate dynamically to the best opportunities within the credit market from an asset allocation and 
individual security selection perspective.
***  Insurance linked securities are event-linked investments which allow investors outside the insurance industry to access insurance premiums for assuming various 
forms and degrees of insurance risk. The underlying risk premium is a type of investment risk where the event is linked to natural or man-made catastrophes. The 
premium paid to the investor represents compensation for the “expected loss” due to the uncertainty around the size and timing of the insured event.
****   Absolute Return Bond strategies are designed to deliver a positive return in all market environments and will take advantage of numerous alpha opportunities within 
the fixed income universe. The objective of the strategy is to capture returns from active management in a number of areas within fixed income including interest 
rates, currencies, asset allocation and security selection. The strategy will have long and short positions and employ a degree of leverage. The strategies tend to 
have low sensitivity to the direction of interest rates and credit.
*****  Insight have been appointed to manage the Liability Driven Investment (‘LDI’) portfolio for the Fund. The objective is to hedge a proportion of the Fund’s liabilities 
against changes in interest rates and inflation expectations by investing in assets that are similarly sensitive to changes in interest rates and inflation expectations. 
Insight will seek to add interest and inflation exposure to the LDI portfolio over time in line with parameters that have been set by the Trustee. Insight are permitted 
to use a range of swaps and gilt based derivative instruments as well as physical bonds to structure the liability hedge for the Fund. In addition, Insight are 
responsible for monitoring market yields against a number of pre-set yield triggers and will increase the level of hedging as and when the triggers are met.
The principal assumptions used in determining retirement benefit obligations for the Fund are shown below:

Key assumptions:
Price inflation (RPI) 3.3 3.2 3.1 
Price inflation (CPI) 2.2 2.1 2.0 
Pension increases (Pre 1993 – RPI to 7%/annum) 3.3 3.2 3.1 
Pension increases (1993 to 2006 – RPI to 5%/annum) 3.2 3.1 3.0

Life expectancy at 65 for a female currently aged 50 (years) 27.0 26.9 26.8 
Average expected remaining life of a 65 year old retired female (years) 24.8 24.7 24.6 
Discount rate 2.4 3.5 3.4 
The financial assumptions reflect the nature and term of the Fund’s liabilities. The mortality assumptions are based on analysis of the Fund 
members, and allow for expected future improvements in mortality rates. It has been assumed that members exchange 25% of their pension 
for a cash lump sum at retirement and 30% of deferred members take the Pension Increase Exchange option at retirement.
Sensitivity to changes in assumptions
The key assumptions used for IAS 19 are discount rate, inflation and mortality. If different assumptions were used, this could have a material 
effect on the results disclosed. The sensitivity of the results to these assumptions is as follows:

Effect of a 1 year increase in life expectancy – 1.0 1.0 (41.6)
Recalculated value 1.0 3.4 4.4 (151.2)
The above sensitivities assume that, with the exception of the annuity contracts, the Fund’s assets remain unchanged due to changes in 
assumptions, but in practice changes in market interest and inflation rates will also affect the value of the Fund’s assets. The Company and 
Trustee have agreed a long-term strategy for reducing investment risk as and when appropriate. This includes an asset-liability matching policy  104 Dairy Crest Annual Report 2017
Notes to the fiNANCiAl stAtemeNts CoNtiNueD
21 Retirement benefit obligations continued 
which aims to reduce the volatility of the funding level of the Fund by investing in assets which perform in line with the liabilities of the Fund. In 
December 2008 and June 2009, certain obligations relating to retired members were fully hedged by the purchase of annuity contracts. The 
Fund’s other investments include matching assets which protect against changes in bond yields and against inflation risk. The respective 
interest rate and inflation hedge ratios for these assets as at 31 March 2017 were both 36% of those obligations not covered by annuity 
contracts.
The Company recognises no liabilities on its balance sheet, or charges or credits in its income statement or statement of recognised income 
and expense in relation to the Fund. The legal sponsor of the Fund is Dairy Crest Limited. 
Defined Contribution Pension Scheme
The Group has charged £2.0 million in respect of the Dairy Crest Group defined contribution scheme in the year ended 31 March 2017 (2016:

Restructuring and rationalisation of operating sites
In the prior year, the Group provided through exceptional operating items, decommissioning and demolition costs in relation to the closure of 
the Chard site of £4.3 million. The Group has paid £2.7 million of these costs in the year ending 31 March 2017 (2016: £2.4 million) and expects 
the remaining provision to be utilised in the year ending 31 March 2018.
Dairies disposal provision
At 31 March 2016, the Group held a provision of £3.0 million for future expected costs in relation to the disposal of the Dairies operation to 
Muller UK & Ireland Group LLP on 26 December 2015. The Group has paid £2.8 million of these costs in the year ending 31 March 2017 and 
expects the remainder of this provision to be utilised in the year ending 31 March 2018.
Dilapidation provision
At 31 March 2017, the Group held a provision relating to leasehold property dilapidation liabilities on properties where the Group considers 
there to be a high likelihood of exiting when the lease term expires. The payment of this provision would occur following vacation of the 
respective properties. A provision of £0.2 million relates to vacated properties and therefore may become payable in the year ending 31 March 
2018. The remaining £2.0 million relates to properties where the lease term expires in the year ending 31 March 2020 and as such the 
provision has been re-classified as non-current in the Group’s financial statements. The prior year has not been re-stated.

The merger reserve includes the premium on shares issued to satisfy the purchase of Dairy Crest Limited in 1996. The cumulative amount of 
goodwill charged against the merger reserve is £86.8 million (2016: £86.8 million). The reserve is not distributable.
The hedging reserve records the gains and losses on hedging instruments, to the extent that they are effective cash flow hedges. Any gains 
and losses previously recorded in the hedging reserve are reclassified in profit and loss when the underlying hedged item affects profit and 
loss.
The translation reserve records exchange differences arising from the translation of the accounts of foreign currency denominated subsidiaries 
offset by the movements on loans and derivatives designated to hedge the net investment in foreign subsidiaries.
Parent Company
As permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, no separate profit and loss account is presented for the Company. The profit for the 
year dealt with in the accounts of the Company is £196.9 million (2016: £34.5 million), this included a profit on the sale of shares held in Dairy 
Crest Limited of £194.6 million and dividends received from subsidiary companies of £nil (2016: £34.5 million). Dividends paid amounted to 
£31.1 million (2016: £30.0 million) which, along with a debit for share-based payments of £0.8 million (2016: £0.8 million) and a transfer 
between reserves of £158.9 million resulted in a £325.5 million increase in retained earnings (2016: £5.7 million). Not all the retained earnings 
are distributable at this point as this is dependent on the proceeds for the sale being settled in cash, as is the Company’s intention in the 
future.      
In 1996 the Company acquired the entire issued share capital of Dairy Crest Limited. Consideration was in the form of cash and the issue of 
109.8 million ordinary shares of 25 pence each. The fair value of the shares issued was estimated as £170.2 million. The capital reserve of 
£142.7 million, shown in the statement of changes in equity, represents the difference between the fair value of shares issued and their 
nominal value of £27.5 million. During the year these shares were sold to Dairy Crest UK Limited.
27 Share based payment plans
Consolidated
The Group has five share option schemes in operation.
The Dairy Crest Long Term Alignment Plan (‘LTAP’)
The LTAP is a long-term incentive scheme under which awards are made to Directors and senior managers consisting of the right to acquire 
shares for a nominal price. The vesting period for grants made under this scheme is 50% of the award after 4 years and 50% after 5 years. 
Pre-grant performance criteria determine the amount of any initial grant after which there are no significant performance conditions prior to 
vesting. As such, these options are fair valued at 100% of the price at the date of the grant.
The Transformational Incentive Award (‘TIA’)
The TIA was granted, under the rules of the LTISP, in December 2014. The TIA is a nil price option to acquire ordinary shares subject to certain 
performance objectives being met in addition to continuing employment. The performance objectives relate to three categories detailed 
below:
1) managing the competition approval process relating to the proposed Dairies operation disposal;
2) appropriate reshaping of the Group, taking into account the competition approval process; and
3) establishing a successful future business, by reference to the development of the Group, including delivering value to shareholders.
The vesting period is three years from the date of grant. There are no cash settlement alternatives. Dairy Crest Annual Report 2017 107
The numbers
27 Share based payment plans continued 
Deferred Bonus Plan (‘DBP’)
Any bonus in excess of 50% of basic annual salary is deferred in share options with a vesting period of 3 years. The only vesting condition is 
continuing employment. The cost of these share options is based on the number of shares issued and the share price at the date of grant, 
spread over the vesting period. During the year ended 31 March 2017, no deferred shares were awarded in relation to the year ended 31 
March 2016 (2016: none).
The Dairy Crest Long Term Incentive Share Plan (‘LTISP’)
This is a long-term incentive scheme under which awards are made to Directors and senior managers consisting of the right to acquire shares 
for a nominal price subject to the achievement of financial targets based on (i) total shareholder returns (‘TSR’) over a three year period versus 
comparator companies and (ii) growth in adjusted basic earnings per share. The TSR element represents 60% of the awards granted. The 
vesting period for grants made under this scheme is 3 years with an exercise period of 7 years. There were no awards granted in the year 
ended 31 March 2017 (2016: nil). There are no cash settlement alternatives. The LTISP was replaced by the LTAP in the year ended 31 March 
2014.
Dairy Crest Sharesave Scheme
All employees are eligible to join the Dairy Crest Sharesave Scheme, which allows employees to use regular monthly savings to purchase 
shares. Options are granted at a discount of up to 20% of the market value of the shares. No financial performance criteria are attached to 
these options and they vest three years from the date of grant with an exercise period of six months. During the current year 629,639 options 
were granted at 463 pence (2016: none). There are no cash settlement alternatives.

years and Sharesave Scheme 1.8 years).
The fair value factor of the Sharesave Scheme options issued in May 2016 was 19.0% giving a fair value of £1.06 per option granted. This has 
been computed using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. The key assumptions used in the valuation model were expected share price 
volatility 24%, risk free rate of interest 0.61% and dividend yield 3.57%. The volatility assumption is based on the historical volatility of the Dairy 
Crest Group plc share price over a period commensurate with the expected option life, ending on the grant date of option. 108 Dairy Crest Annual Report 2017

The fair value of TIA options issued on 23 December 2014 was £4.91 per option granted. This has been computed using a Black-Scholes 
option pricing model. The key assumptions used in the valuation model were expected share price volatility 24% and a risk free rate of interest 
0.85%. The volatility assumption is based on the historical volatility of the Dairy Crest Group plc share price over a period commensurate with 
the expected option life, ending on the grant date of option.
The Group expense arising from share option plans for continuing operations for the year ended 31 March 2017 was £1.2 million (2016: £1.4

Contingent liabilities
Dilapidations liability of Chadwell Heath
Under the terms of the sale and purchase agreement of the Dairies operation, the Group has a potential dilapidations liability to 26 December 
2015 in relation to the Chadwell Heath site. The lease does not end until July 2032, with break clauses in July 2022 and July 2027. Muller UK & 
Ireland Group LLP have announced they intend to close the site in 2018, however any obligations are dependent on the intentions of the 
landlord in respect of the site. The Directors are not quantifying the potential liability in respect of this obligation because to do so may be 
prejudicial to the interests of the Group as the matter may be subject to negotiation or judicial proceedings.
Litigation in relation to the capital project at Davidstow 
There are a number of contractual disputes in respect of the demineralised whey and GOS capital project at Davidstow which remain 
outstanding as of 31 March 2017. In a number of instances, claims have been made by the Group, and in others, claims made against the 
Group. To the extent that claims are being made by the Group, including the most significant ongoing dispute, the status of the resolution of 
these matters does not support recognition of an asset. The Group has rebutted all claims against it, but nonetheless has accrued for 
professional fees on these claims. 
In the case of both the claims made by the Group and those made against it, the Group is not disclosing detail of the claims due to the legal 
sensitivity of the matter. In each instance, it is anticipated that the case will be resolved in the next financial year. It is the opinion of the 
Directors that there is no significant financial liability that would require being provided for as at 31 March 2017. 110 Dairy Crest Annual Report 2017

Company
Dairy Crest Limited, a subsidiary company, incurred costs of £2.0 million (2016: £1.9 million) from the Company for the provision of 
management and administrative services carried out on its behalf. Dairy Crest Limited received £1.9 million (2016: £1.8 million) for the 
remuneration of the Company’s employees which had been paid by Dairy Crest Limited. 
Interest charges of £2.5 million (2016: £4.0 million) were incurred by the Company from Dairy Crest Limited on loans reflecting an interest rate 
of LIBOR+100 basis points. Interest income of £5.7 million (2016: £11.5 million) was received by the Company from Dairy Crest Limited on 
loans reflecting an interest rate of 4.5% (2016: 5.3%) and a further £5.4 million was received by the Company from Dairy Crest UK Limited on 
floating rate loans paying LIBOR plus margin (2016: £0.4 million). The Company paid no interest (2016: £nil) to Dairy Crest Limited on cross-
currency swaps paying LIBOR and receiving EURIBOR.
30 Business combinations and disposals
(i) Disposal of Discontinued Operations
On 26 December 2015, the Group completed the disposal of its Dairies operation to Muller UK & Ireland Group LLP (‘Müller’). The Dairies 
operation has therefore been classified as discontinued operations.
The disposal resulted in a post tax loss of £108.0 million which is analysed below. The final consideration of £23.5 million comprised £54.5 
million received in cash during the prior year net of £25.9 million which was provided for in the prior year but repaid to Müller in 2017. The final 
consideration adjustment of £2.5 million was agreed in the current year. The disposal resulted in a net cash outflow in the current year of £28.4 
million (2016: £49.0 million inflow, after £5.5 million of professional fees).

(ii) Acquisitions
There were no business acquisitions during the year.
In the prior year, the Group acquired the outstanding share capital of Promovita Ingredients Limited (‘Promovita’) for a cash consideration of 
£6.0 million bringing its shareholding to 100%. Promovita was established in 2014 as a joint venture between the Group and Fayrefield Foods 
Limited to develop and produce GOS, a prebiotic for use in infant formula. In accordance with IFRS 3 (Revised) ‘Business Combinations’, the 
value of the previously held 50% shareholding has been restated to fair value at the acquisition date. The difference between the fair value of 
the equity owned prior to acquisition of £6.0 million and the book value of the original investment of £nil was recognised in the consolidated 
income statement, with the gain of £6.0 million reported in exceptional items under continuing operations. Dairy Crest Annual Report 2017 111

31  Financial risk management objectives and policies
The objective of the treasury function, which is accountable to the Board, is to manage the Group’s and Company’s financial risk, secure 
cost-effective funding for the Group’s operations and to minimise the effects of fluctuations in interest rates and exchange rates on the value of 
the Group’s and Company’s financial assets and liabilities, on reported profitability and on cash flows.
The Group’s principal financial instruments comprise bank loans and overdrafts, loan notes, finance leases and cash and short-term deposits. 
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Group’s operations. The Group has various other financial assets 
and liabilities such as trade receivables and trade payables, which arise directly from its operations.
The Group also enters into derivative transactions; principally cross currency swaps and forward currency contracts. The purpose is to 
manage the interest rate and currency risks arising from the Group’s operations and its sources of finance. It is, and has been throughout 
2016 and 2017, the Group’s policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
The main risks arising from the Group’s financial instruments are liquidity risk, interest rate risk, foreign currency risk, price risk and credit risk. 
Information on how these risks arise is set out below, as are the objectives, policies and processes agreed by the Board for their management 
and the methods used to measure each risk. Derivative instruments are used to change the economic characteristics of financial instruments 
in accordance with the Group’s treasury policies. The Group’s accounting policies in relation to derivatives are set out in the Accounting 
Policies note.
Liquidity risk
The Group’s objectives are:
 • to ensure that forecast peak net borrowings, plus a prudent operating headroom are covered by committed facilities which mature after at 
least 12 months; 
 • to ensure that prudent headroom versus bank and loan note covenant ratios are forecast for the next three years;
 • to maintain flexibility of funding by employing diverse sources of funds (eg use of non-bank markets such as private placements); and
 • to avoid a concentration of facility maturities in any particular year. 
The maturity analysis of Group borrowings is set out in Note 20. At 31 March 2017 the Group’s total credit facilities amounted to £397.9 million 
(2016: £479.8 million) excluding finance leases of £2.5 million (2016: £3.9 million) and the impact of cross-currency swaps on US Dollar and 
Euro loan notes of £12.2 million (2016: £19.4 million). The facilities at 31 March 2017 and 31 March 2016 consisted of:
March 2017
 • £240 million revolving credit facility of which £80 million will expire on 6 October 2018 and £160 million on 6 October 2020. 
 • loan notes totalling £157.9 million repayable between April 2017 and March 2026.
March 2016
 • £240 million revolving credit facility of which £80 million will expire on 6 October 2018 and £160 million on 6 October 2020.
 • loan notes totalling £239.8 million repayable between April 2016 and March 2026.
Undrawn revolving credit facilities at 31 March 2017 amounted to £112.0 million (2016: £135.0 million). Effective headroom including cash and 
short-term deposits amounted to £132.9 million (2016: £235.3 million).
The Group aims to mitigate liquidity risk by closely managing cash generation by its operating businesses and by monitoring performance to 
budgets and forecasts. Capital investment is carefully controlled, with detailed authorisation limits in place up to Executive level and cash 
payback criteria considered as part of the investment appraisal process. Short-term and long-term cash and debt forecasts are constantly 
reviewed and there are regular treasury updates to the Executive highlighting facility headroom and net debt performance.
Day-to-day cash management utilises undrawn revolving credit facilities, overdraft facilities and occasionally short-term money market 
deposits if there is excess cash. 112 Dairy Crest Annual Report 2017
Notes to the fiNANCiAl stAtemeNts CoNtiNueD
31  Financial risk management objectives and policies continued
Interest rate risk
The Group’s exposure to the risk for changes in market interest rates relate primarily to the Group’s long-term debt obligations with a floating 
interest rate.
The Group’s policy is to manage its interest cost using a mix of fixed and variable rate debt. The Group’s long-term strategy is to keep 
between one third and three quarters of its borrowings at fixed rates of interest in the medium term. To manage this mix in a cost-efficient 
manner, the Group has issued fixed coupon loan notes and also enters into interest rate swaps from time to time on a portion of its floating 
bank borrowings, in which the Group agrees to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and variable rate interest 
amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional principal amount. These swaps are designated to hedge underlying debt interest 
cash flow obligations. In the short-term the proportion of fixed and floating rate borrowings can go outside the long-term range.
At 31 March 2017, 55% of the Group’s borrowings were at a fixed rate of interest (2016: 70%). On 23 March 2016, the Group raised £76.1 
million sterling equivalent by way of fixed coupon loan notes and on 4 April 2016 the Group repaid £80.2 million sterling equivalent of fixed 
coupon loan notes. This resulted in a high percentage of fixed interest rate debt as at 31 March 2016. In the medium term we expect the fixed 
proportion of borrowings to continue to be in the target range.
The Group’s borrowing facilities require minimum interest cover of 3.0 times. 
The Group’s exposure to interest rate risk is shown (by way of a sensitivity analysis) in Note 32.
Foreign currency risk
The Group has no significant operations outside the UK. However it buys and sells a small amount of goods in currencies other than Sterling. 
As a result the value of the Group’s non-Sterling revenues, purchases, assets, liabilities and cash flows can be affected by movements in 
exchange rates – predominantly Euro/Sterling. The Group’s exposure to Euro/Sterling is increasing due to the investment in demineralised 
whey production which is sold in Euros. The Group’s policy is to match foreign currency transaction exposures where possible and where 
appropriate the Group will use financial instruments in the form of forward foreign currency contracts to hedge future transaction and cash 
flows denominated in currencies other than Sterling. 
The majority of the Group’s transactions are carried out in the relevant entity’s functional currency and therefore transaction exposures are 
currently limited. It can be seen in Note 16 that the only significant non-Sterling trade receivables are in Euros. In 2016/17, the Group began 
trading demineralised whey products in Euros resulting in an increase in trade receivables denominated in Euros from £1.0 million at 31 March 
2016 to £2.3 million at 31 March 2017. We expect this to increase further in 2017/18.
Currency exposures on other transactions, such as certain capital expenditure denominated in a foreign currency, are hedged following 
approval of the project using forward foreign exchange contracts.
In 2007, 2011 and 2016 the Group issued loan notes denominated either in $US, € or £. Cross-currency swaps were implemented as required 
to hedge the interest and principal repayment cash flows. These have the effect of fixing the liability and coupon in Sterling. The principal 
amount and interest and principal payment dates on these swaps match those on the loan notes exactly and all swaps are with counterparties 
with strong credit ratings. There is no profit and loss exposure in relation to $US or € note debts as any retranslation impact on the profit and 
loss account is offset by reclassification of amounts from other comprehensive income into profit and loss. 
Price risk
The Group is exposed to price risk related to certain commodities and their by-products used by the Group’s businesses. The principal 
non-milk commodities that affect input prices for the Group are vegetable oils, gas, electricity, diesel, heavy fuel oil and crude oil by-products 
(used in packaging).
The Group monitors prices on an ongoing basis in order to assess the impact that movements have on profitability and to assess whether the 
amount of forward cover is appropriate. This includes vegetable oil contracts and energy, which is generally contracted one season in 
advance for both summer and winter energy but with some requirement contracted at more regular intervals.
The Group regularly reviews relevant commodity markets and levels of future cover. Fixed price contracts are only entered into with the 
approval of the Commodity Risk Committee comprising senior operational and finance management and external advisers.
Credit risk
It is the Group’s policy that all customers who wish to trade on credit terms are subject to credit verification procedures. The Group only offers 
these terms to recognised, creditworthy third parties. In addition, receivables balances are monitored on an ongoing basis with the result that 
the Group’s history of bad debt losses is not significant.
Debtor days outstanding are closely monitored throughout the year and action is taken promptly when payment terms are breached.
With respect to credit risk arising from the other financial assets of the Group, which comprise cash and cash equivalents, trade and other 
debtors (excludes prepayments) and certain derivative instruments, the Group’s exposure to credit risk arises from default of the counterparty. 
The maximum exposure for the Group is equal to the carrying amount of these financial assets of £62.1 million (2016: £158.2 million).
All revolving credit facility borrowings are through banks with long-term credit ratings of A or above. Funds temporarily surplus to business 
requirements are invested through deposit accounts with mainstream UK commercial banks with a credit rating of A or better. The Group 
currently has no requirement to place deposits for long periods, accordingly counterparty risk is considered to be acceptable. Derivative 
financial instruments are contracted with a range of banks with long-term credit ratings of A or above to avoid excessive concentration of 
financial instruments with one counterparty. Dairy Crest Annual Report 2017 113

31  Financial risk management objectives and policies continued
Capital management
The primary objective of the Group’s capital management is to ensure that it maintains an appropriate level of gearing in order to support its 
business and maximise shareholder value. In addition, the Group monitors its forecast net debt to EBITDA ratios in order that they are 
comfortably within its banking covenant requirements. The maximum net debt to EBITDA ratio for the purposes of bank covenants is 3.5 times 
though the Directors target a ratio of below 2 times. At 31 March 2017 the ratio of net debt to EBITDA was 2.94 times (March 2016: 2.69 
times).
The Group monitors its capital structure and makes adjustments to it in the light of changes in economic conditions or changes in Group 
structure. Possible mechanisms for changing capital structure include adjusting the level of dividends, issuance of new shares or returning 
capital to shareholders. No significant changes in capital structure have been implemented in the year ended 31 March 2017 or the prior year.
The Group monitors capital using a gearing ratio, which is net debt divided by shareholders’ funds. The analysis of net debt is included in Note 
34. The gearing ratio at 31 March 2017 and 31 March 2016 can be analysed as follows:
 
2017 
£m
 
2016

Net debt   249.8   229.0
Shareholders’ funds   71.9   134.2
Gearing ratio   347%   171%
Dividends
Details of dividends paid and proposed during the year are given in Note 9. The dividend policy is to maintain a progressive dividend whilst 
seeking to maintain a level of dividend cover between 1.5 and 2.5 times. The final proposed dividend in respect of the year ended 31 March 
2017 is 16.3 pence, up 0.3 pence from last year (2016: 16.0 pence). Total dividends paid and proposed in respect of the year ended 31 March 
2017 amount to 22.5 pence (2016: 22.1 pence).

32 Financial instruments continued
Interest on financial instruments classified as floating rate is repriced at intervals of less than one year. Interest on financial instruments 
classified as fixed rate is fixed until the maturity of the instrument.
Interest rate risk
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in interest rates, with all other variables held constant, of the 
Group’s profit before tax through the impact on floating rate borrowings. There is no material impact on the Group’s equity resulting from 
movements in interest rates other than in relation to the $US/GBP and EUR/GBP cross-currency swaps used as a cash flow hedge on $US 
and EUR loan notes. The impact on equity is nil over the life of the instruments as these swaps comprise an effective hedge. At 31 March 
2017, 55% of Group borrowings were at fixed rates of interest (2016: 70%) (see Note 30).
The sensitivity analysis below excludes all non-derivative fixed rate financial instruments carried at amortised cost but includes non-derivative 
floating rate financial instruments except those where interest rate swaps have been used as cash flow hedges. This is due to the fact that 
gains and losses on the hedging instrument offset losses and gains on the non-derivative floating rate financial instrument which are subject to 
the hedge and are matched in both profit and loss and cash terms. No non-derivative fixed rate financial instruments have profit and loss 
exposure due to floating rates as a result of interest rate swaps.
The 2017 analysis below reflects lower reasonably possible changes in interest rates to 2016 – upside LIBOR expectations assumed last year 
were not realised and the assumption is that base rates will increase less than anticipated at March 2016.

Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities
The carrying amounts and the fair values of all of the Group’s financial instruments that are carried in the financial statements are the same, 
with the exception of the loan notes. The carrying amount of the loan notes was £157.9 million (2016: £239.8 million) and the fair value was 
£156.4 million (2016: £231.0 million). The fair value of borrowings has been calculated based on the principles of IFRS 13 ‘Fair Value 
Measurement’ under Hierachy Level 2, by discounting the expected future cash flows at prevailing interest rates.
Cross currency swaps
The notional principal amount of the outstanding $US/GBP cross currency swap contracts at 31 March 2017 was $126.3 million (£101.0 
million) (2016: $249.4 million (£173.5 million)). These cross currency swaps have both legs at fixed interest rates, are designated as cash flow 
hedges and meet the criteria for hedge accounting. At 31 March 2017 the fixed interest rates varied from 3.227% to 4.516% (2016: 3.227% to 
5.305%). Any gains/losses arising from fair value adjustments deferred in equity will reverse in the income statement (finance costs) during the 
next six years (being the life of the swaps).
The notional principal amount of the outstanding EUR/GBP cross currency swap contracts at 31 March 2017 was €10.7 million (£9.2 million) 
(2016: €10.7 million (£8.5 million)). These cross currency swaps have both legs at fixed interest rates, are designated as cash flow hedges and 
meet the criteria for hedge accounting. At 31 March 2017 the fixed interest rates varied from 5.47% to 5.60% (2016: 5.47% to 5.60%). The loss 
deferred in equity will reverse in the income statement (finance costs) during the next year (being the life of the swaps).
Forward currency contracts
The Group enters into certain forward currency contracts in order to hedge the Sterling cost of currency-denominated future purchases and 
receipts. The forward currency purchases in place at 31 March 2017 do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting and the loss in respect of 
these has been recognised within the income statement.
Borrowing facilities
The Group has undrawn committed long-term borrowing facilities available at 31 March 2017 of £112.0 million (2016: £135.0 million) in respect 
of which all conditions precedent had been met at that date. Undrawn facilities expire on 6 October 2018 (£nil) and 6 October 2020 (£112.0 
million).

32 Financial instruments continued
The sensitivity analysis excludes all non-derivative fixed rate financial instruments carried at amortised cost but includes non-derivative floating 
rate financial instruments except those where interest rate swaps have been used as cash flow hedges. This is due to the fact that gains and 
losses on the hedging instrument offset losses and gains on the non-derivative floating rate financial instrument which are subject to the 
hedge are matched in both profit and loss and cash terms. No non-derivative fixed rate financial instruments have profit and loss exposure 
due to floating rates as a result of interest rate swaps.
The 2017 analysis below reflects lower reasonably possible changes in interest rates to 2016 – upside LIBOR expectations assumed last year 
were not realised and the assumption is that base rates will increase less than anticipated at March 2016.

Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities
The carrying amounts and the fair values of all of the Company’s financial instruments that are carried in the financial statements are the same, 
with the exception of the loan notes. The carrying amount of the loan notes was £157.9 million (2016: £239.8 million) and the fair value was 
£156.4 million (2016: £231.0 million). The fair value of borrowings has been calculated based on the principles of IFRS 13 ‘Fair Value 
Measurement’ under Hierachy Level 2, by discounting the expected future cash flows at prevailing interest rates.
Cross currency swaps
External
The notional principal amount of the outstanding $US/GBP cross currency swap contracts at 31 March 2017 was $126.3 million (£101.0 
million) (2016: $249.4 million (£173.5 million)). These cross currency swaps have both legs at fixed interest rates, are designated as cash flow 
hedges and meet the criteria for hedge accounting. At 31 March 2017 the fixed interest rates varied from 3.227% to 4.516% (2016: 3.227% to 
5.305%). Any gains/losses arising from fair value adjustments deferred in equity will reverse in the income statement (finance costs) during the 
next one to six years (being the life of the swaps).
The notional principal amount of the outstanding EUR/GBP cross currency swap contracts at 31 March 2017 was €10.7 million (£9.2 million) 
(2016: €10.7 million (£8.5 million)). These cross currency swaps have both legs at fixed interest rates, are designated as cash flow hedges and 
meet the criteria for hedge accounting. At 31 March 2017 the fixed interest rates varied from 5.47% to 5.60% (2016: 5.47% to 5.60%). The loss 
deferred in equity will reverse in the income statement (finance costs) during the next year (being the life of the swaps). Dairy Crest Annual Report 2017 117

*  The Group has $126.3 million and €10.7 million of loan notes against which cross-currency swaps have been put in place to fix interest and principal repayments 
in Sterling (March 2016: $249.4 million and €10.7 million). Under IFRS, currency borrowings are retranslated into Sterling at year end exchange rates. The cross-
currency swaps are recorded at fair value and incorporate movements in both market exchange rates and interest rates. The Group defines net debt so as to include 
the effective Sterling liability where cross-currency swaps have been used to convert foreign currency borrowings into Sterling. The £17.7 million adjustment included 
in the above (March 2016: £19.4 million) converts the Sterling equivalent of Dollar and Euro loan notes from year end exchange rates (£110.1 million (March 2016: 
£182.0 million)) to the fixed Sterling liability of £92.3 million (March 2016: £162.6 million).
**  During the year the Group repaid $123.0 million (£70.2 million) and £10.0 million of 2006 fixed coupon loan notes on maturity. The £80.2 million cash flow in respect 
of the repayment is reflected in the table under borrowings (current) of £95.6 million and the impact of cross-currency swaps of £15.4 million.
*** Finance lease non-cash movement relates to the recognition of the agreement of a secondary lease term for assets at Nuneaton.
On 4 April 2017 there was a natural maturity of €10.7 million (£9.2 million) and £2.8 million of 2007 fixed coupon loan notes. Dairy Crest Annual Report 2017 119
