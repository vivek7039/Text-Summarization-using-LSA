CONTENTS OPERATIONAL HIGHLIGHTS
 » Feeds – headline operating profit of £1.5 million 
(2016: £2.1 million). Good second half recovery, 
having been impacted by margin pressure due to 
increased commodity costs, particularly through 
the winter months. Volumes were robust and the 
mill developments in the North and Cheshire, 
completed during the year, have strengthened 
our operating platform.
 » Food – headline operating profit of £3.0 million 
(2016: £2.7 million). A strong result built on 
efficiently delivering increased activity levels with 
the business operating at capacity throughout 
the year.
 » Fuels – headline operating profit of £4.5 million 
(2016: £3.9 million). Strong volume growth across 
the depot network and the new depots in the 
South East exceeded expectations in their first 
full year.

OVERVIEW STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
Overview
In my last year as Chairman, I am pleased to report 
another robust performance for NWF and continued 
investment in the strategic development of the 
Group. Over the last ten years we have seen solid 
progress from the Group with revenue up from 
£361 million to £556 million, headline profit before 
tax up from £4.0 million to £8.5 million, headline 
earnings per share up from 5.8p to a record 14.0p 
this year and dividend per share up from 3.9p per 
share to 6.0p per share. Over the same period net 
debt has fallen from £52 million to £13 million.
During the year, strong performances from 
Food and Fuels more than offset the challenging 
conditions experienced in the Feeds market. 
Food remained at full capacity, operated efficiently 
and delivered more loads whilst maintaining 
service levels at 99.7%. Fuels increased volumes 
significantly, more than offsetting the impact of the 
mild weather in the first half with growth across the 
depot network and the successful development 
of our cold starts in the South East. Feeds volumes 
were stable, with growth in line with the market but, 
with increasing commodity costs, margins were 
under pressure and the business was not able 
to fully pass on these increases during the year. 
The capability of the Group to deliver sustainable 
growth whilst experiencing tough trading 
conditions due to its diversified operations has 
again been demonstrated. The continued ambition 
of the Group has been shown by the significant 
investment in the feed mills in the North and in 
Cheshire. Strong cash generation has allowed 
this investment in the year whilst maintaining 
a satisfactorily low level of net debt and a robust 
balance sheet position.
In 2017, the capability of the 
Group to deliver sustainable 
growth due to its diversified 
operations has again 
been demonstrated.
I am pleased to report 
another robust performance 
for NWF and continued 
investment in the strategic 
development of the Group.
OVERVIEW As a consequence of the good progress achieved 
and the Group’s strong cash generation, the Board 
is recommending a final dividend of 5.0p per share 
(record date: 3 November 2017; payment date: 
4 December 2017) (2016: 4.7p) giving a total 
dividend of 6.0p per share (2016: 5.7p), a 5.3% 
increase on the prior year.
Our business
NWF Group is a specialist agricultural and 
distribution business delivering feed, food and fuel 
across the UK. Each of our trading divisions has 
scale and good market position, and is profitable 
and cash generative. Each division trades under 
different brands with their own brand architecture 
as follows:
 » Feeds: NWF Agriculture, S.C. Feeds, 
New Breed and Jim Peet 
 » Food: Boughey
 » Fuels: NWF Fuels (including a number of local 
sub-brands) 
Key areas of focus for the Board in 2017 were:
Investing in strategic development
The Group has invested in significantly increasing 
the capacity and improving efficiency of the mill 
at Longtown in Cumbria, which was acquired 
with the Jim Peet business in 2016. In parallel the 
blending facility at Wardle has been automated 
which improves the production capacity for this 
growing segment of the market and increases 
efficiency. Both were completed during the year, 
albeit the Longtown facility was delayed by a few 
months and so incurred some additional 
exceptional costs in the year.
Responding proactively to market conditions
The Group has responded effectively to some 
challenging market conditions in the year. In Feeds 
the year started with low milk prices and whilst 
feed volumes recovered with milk price increases, 
the volatility in the commodity and foreign exchange 
markets led to significant cost increases, which the 
business endeavoured to pass on to the market. 
In Food, further efficiencies have been gained 
from ensuring loads are ready for dispatch ahead 
of time and improved backload revenue was 
delivered. In Fuels, in spite of a mild first half, the 
business has delivered increased volumes and 
improved margins on key product lines to offset 
the impact of lower demand for heating oil.
Cash generation
Cash generation remains a priority for the Group 
and a further sustainable improvement in working 
capital has been achieved in Feeds that has been 
managed sensitively at a time of recovery in the 
dairy market. 
Rewarding good service
The consistent focus on excellence in customer 
service across the Group has been critical to our 
continued development. It has enabled volume 
gains to be achieved in each of the three divisions 
in the year.
Commodity volatility 
Volatility in the commodity markets impacted the 
Group’s performance in 2017. In Fuels, oil (which 
is purchased on the spot market) moved between 
$42 per barrel and $57 per barrel for Brent Crude 
with further volatility resulting from exchange rates. 
In line with market practice, Feeds buys its raw 
materials under forward purchase contracts. 
Significant increases in feed input commodities in 
the year impacted margins as price increases were 
implemented after cost inflation was experienced.
Board changes
My thanks go to all who have supported NWF 
throughout the year both inside and outside 
the Group. 
I am delighted that Philip Acton, Non-Executive 
Director, will be taking over from me as the 
Chairman of NWF Group, with effect from the 
Annual General Meeting in September. Philip has 
extremely valuable experience in listed agricultural 
businesses and has gained a good understanding 
of NWF since joining the Board almost four years 
ago. In addition, as previously announced, Lorraine 
Clinton will join the Board in September and brings 
a strong operational and commercial background 
which adds complementary skills to the Board. 
Chris Belsham, Finance Director, joined the Board in 
April 2017 and this completes the transition process 
for the Board to whom I wish the best for the future.
Finally, I wish to pay tribute to the Executive team, 
many of whom have worked with me during the 
entire 11 years that I have chaired the Board. 
As a group, they have displayed that combination 
of commitment, hard work, vision, humanity and 
humour that has made my job rewarding and 
NWF successful.
I look forward to updating shareholders on the 
Group’s continuing progress at the time of the 
Annual General Meeting on 28 September 2017.

OVERVIEW STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
How does Brexit impact NWF?
We are a UK business, with three divisions which 
all performed well in the global financial crisis as 
they supply basic products to meet the country’s 
needs for Feeds, Food and Fuels. We have not 
seen any changes in the demand for our products 
and services to date and monitor the situation closely.
Who are your largest shareholders?
We have no shareholders greater than 5% but a 
number of significant pension funds and investment 
funds below 5% with whom we meet regularly.
Which is your favoured division?
All three businesses are unique and deliver benefits 
to shareholders and have development potential. 
In addition, through operating in three separate 
markets the overall risk profile of the Group is reduced.
Does the pension scheme constrain the 
development potential of the Group?
Our pension scheme is closed to both new 
members and future accrual and is carefully 
monitored by the Board and managed carefully 
alongside professional advice. We have a strong 
asset base and significant banking facilities to help 
invest in growth opportunities.
Are you just a dividend/yield stock?
Whilst we recognise the value in the dividend, 
we are looking to deliver total shareholder return 
through a combination of share price accretion and 
a progressive dividend policy. We are looking to be 
strong and resilient but are also ambitious for the 
development of NWF. 
Is the Group susceptible to weather and 
commodity price changes?
Commodities can impact the Group in our 
Feeds business as we buy forward in line with the 
market and have a capability to outperform when 
conditions move in our favour. With an oil business 
that focuses on heating oil in the winter, cold 
weather will benefit the division, but an ability 
to sell a range of oil products has demonstrated 
some effective mitigation in recent milder conditions.
Q&A
with Chief Executive Officer, Richard Whiting
NWF delivered a solid performance 
last year with increased activity in 
all three divisions and the benefits 
of the diversified business model 
resulted in record earnings 
per share.
STRATEGIC REPORT NWF delivered a solid performance last year with 
increased activity in all three divisions and the 
benefits of the diversified business model resulting 
in record earnings per share. The increase in 
profitability and strong cash generation allowed 
the Group to continue its investment strategy, 
completing major feed mill expansions in the year. 
The Group delivered headline operating profit 
up 3.4% to £9.0 million (2016: £8.7 million) and 
headline profit before tax up 2.4% to £8.5 million 
(2016: £8.3 million). Headline earnings per share 
were up 3.7% to a record level of 14.0p 
(2016: 13.5p).
Cash management remains strong with net debt of 
£13.0 million, representing 1.0x EBITDA. This has 
been achieved by generating net cash of £2.1 million 
after interest, tax, dividends and net replacement 
and maintenance capital expenditure of £4.0 million, 
but before development spend of £5.2 million, 
as a consequence of the trading performance and 
further sustainable working capital improvements.
Outlook
In Feeds, margins and volumes are in line with our 
expectations for this time of the year. Our mills in 
the North, Cheshire and the South West are fully 
operational and aligned to the needs of our farming 
customers in these key areas of the country.
In Food, we are focused on business development 
activity to maintain utilisation levels at the Wardle 
site and have won some small new accounts to 
date. The Palletline operation continues to expand 
and we are looking at further options to increase 
this segment of our business. We remain focused 
on continuing to provide excellent levels of service 
and value to our customers and supermarkets 
across the UK.
In Fuels, we have a proven depot operating model 
and have demonstrated that the business can 
deliver a solid result even when market conditions 
are adverse. Volumes remain robust for the time 
of year.
The Group has established a solid platform for 
development, has strong cash flows and flexible 
banking facilities to fund growth and has a 
strong asset base that provides resilience. 
We will therefore continue to review acquisition 
opportunities, building on our successful track 
record of acquiring and integrating businesses.
Performance to date in the current financial year 
has been in line with the Board’s expectations. We 
expect to benefit from a full year of efficiencies at 
our new expanded Feeds operational base. 
Overall, the Board therefore remains confident 
about the Group’s future prospects.
Richard Whiting
Chief Executive

Summary
 » Increased activity in all three divisions
 » Completed strategic investment in Feeds operations
 » Delivered results in line with expectations – record EPS 
and dividend
We continue to see opportunity for further 
strategic and operational progress and our 
performance in the current financial year to 
date has been in line with our expectations.

DIVISIONAL REVIEW
NWF Agriculture has grown to 
be a leading national supplier of 
ruminant animal feed, feeding 
one in six dairy cows in Britain. 
The business supplies over 
4,750 farmers from Scotland 
to Cornwall.
Outlook for Feeds
 » Margins and volumes are in line with our 
expectations for this time of year
 » Our mills in the North, Cheshire and the South West 
are fully operational
 » We are aligned to the needs of our farming 
customers in these key areas of the country
2017 was a year of investment for Feeds whilst 
operating in a volatile market environment. Low milk 
prices at the start of the year depressed market 
volumes for feed over the summer. As milk prices 
increased, feed demand recovered and for the year 
as a whole ruminant feed market volumes were 
ahead by 1.5%, albeit with the growth coming from 
sheep feed. In addition, commodity prices increased 
significantly through the year, increasing by 17% from 
the start of the year until March 2017, since when 
they have eased back. 
The new feed mill in Longtown, Cumbria, was 
completed in the year, although later than anticipated, 
and the automated blends production facility in

STRATEGIC REPORT [
Cheshire opened in line with the project plan. These 
investments complete the operational reorganisation 
for Feeds and the exceptional costs incurred relating 
to this project. This provides world-class operating 
units close to our key farming customers from the 
South West of England to Scotland and gives an 
effective platform for further development. 
Revenue increased by 16.5% to £158.2 million 
(2016: £135.8 million) as a result of increased 
volumes, feed prices and additional sales of traded 
products in the year. Headline operating profit was 
£1.5 million (2016: £2.1 million) as a consequence 
of the impact of increasing commodity prices 
on margins. Total feed volume was 1.6% higher 
at 589,000 tonnes (2016: 580,000 tonnes). 
A key strategic priority for the business remains to 
increase the nutritional focus in Feeds by providing 
high quality advice and value added products to our 
farming customers. This has been of particular 
importance in the year to support our farming 
customers as the milk price has increased and 
farmers look to increase yields.
Average milk prices in Great Britain increased during 
the year by 6.4p per litre to 26.9p in May 2017, 
a level that, positively, is above the average cost 
of production and therefore reducing the hardship 
faced by dairy farmers at the start of the year. 
Despite this, milk production fell by 5% to 11.8 billion 
litres (2016: 12.4 billion litres) as the UK herd size 
had reduced as a consequence of a low milk price. 
Feeds has a very broad customer base working with 
over 4,750 farmers across the country. This base, 
and the underlying robust demand for milk and dairy 
products, results in a reasonably stable overall 
demand for our feed in most market conditions.

 » Business development activity to maintain 
utilisation at the Wardle site
 » Palletline continues to expand with further 
options considered
 » Remain focused on excellent levels 
of customer service
This has been another strong year in Food despite 
the supermarkets’ continued competition for market 
share. The business has operated efficiently with its 
warehouses remaining full throughout the year, and 
the business responded effectively to increased

STRATEGIC REPORT
DIVISIONAL REVIEW
Boughey Distribution is 
a leading consolidator of 
ambient grocery products 
with significant warehousing 
and distribution assets. 
The business consolidates full 
loads from its customers, the 
food producers and importers, 
and ships across the UK daily 
to all the major supermarkets, 
cash and carry and food 
service customers. Revenue increased 3.7% to £39.0 million (2016: 
£37.6 million). Storage overall was at an average of 
97,000 pallets (2016: 97,000 pallets), reflecting the 
full-year benefit of customers won in the prior year 
and some organic customer growth. This offset 
lower contracted volumes with a major customer, 
as previously announced. T otal loads were 6.3% 
higher than the prior year. Headline operating profit 
increased by 11.1% to £3.0 million (2016: £2.7 million), 
as a consequence of increased activity, improved 
backload revenue and increased Palletline activity. 
As previously announced, we have storage capacity 
available at Wardle and have increased business 
development activity to fill this space during 2018.
Demand for our customers’ products continues to be 
stable and the outlook for most product categories 
handled by the business is resilient. The business 
operates in a competitive supply chain and needs to 
continually demonstrate the value and service that it 
provides to food manufacturers and importers. The 
business has a leading position in consolidating 
ambient grocery products in the North West, with 
high service levels, industry leading systems and a 
strong operating performance being the key 
components of its customer proposition.

NWF Fuels is a leading 
distributor of fuel oil and 
fuel cards delivering over 
500 million litres across the 
UK to 58,000 customers. 
It is one of the largest 
authorised distributors 
of Texaco and is a major 
customer of other fuel 
suppliers including 
Shell and Jet.
Outlook for Fuels
 » We have a proven depot operating model
 » The business can deliver a solid result even when 
market conditions are adverse
 » Volumes remain robust for the time of year
Fuels has delivered significant growth in the year 
breaking through the 500 million litres mark for 
the first time. Growth was delivered across the 
depot network and this, along with robust margins, 
mitigated effectively the warm weather of the first 
half and consequent lower demand for heating 
oil. In addition, the cold starts (Home Counties 
Fuels and Martlet Fuels) performed ahead of 
expectations delivering in excess of 30 million 
litres in the year.

(2016: 474 million litres), whilst revenue increased 
by 22.6% to £358.6 million (2016: £292.5 million) 
as a result of higher oil prices and a greater 
proportion of diesel and gas oil sales in the year. 
The average Brent Crude oil price in the year was 
$51 per barrel compared to $46 per barrel in the 
prior year. 
Headline operating profit was up 15.4% to 
£4.5 million (2016: £3.9 million) as the additional 
volume generated an increase in profitability.
With 58,000 customers being supplied across 19

Group results
Group revenue increased by 19.3% to £555.8 million 
(2016: £465.9 million) reflecting higher activity 
levels, increased oil and commodity prices and 
the contribution from the acquisitions in 2016. 
Headline operating profit was £9.0 million, 
an increase of 3.4% (2016: £8.7 million).
Financing costs (excluding those in respect of 
the defined benefit pension scheme) increased 
by £0.1 million to £0.5 million, reflecting the higher 
average net debt levels during the year resulting 
from the three acquisitions last year and the 
investment in the Northern and Cheshire mills in 
the year, with interest cover decreasing to 18.0x 
(excluding IAS 19 net pension finance costs) 
(2016: 21.8x).
Headline profit before taxation increased by 2.4% 
to £8.5 million (2016: £8.3 million). Exceptional 
items totalling £1.2 million have been recognised in 
the year, the cash impact of which was £1.0 million. 
These represent restructuring costs in the Feeds 
business as the investment in the mills was 
completed and the mill at Longtown commenced 
production in the year. Profit before taxation 
has increased by £0.7 million to £6.7 million 
(2016: £6.0 million).
STRATEGIC REPORT

1  Headline operating profit is statutory operating profit of £7.8 million (2016: £7.1 million) before exceptional items of £1.2 million (2016: £1.6 million). 
Headline profit before taxation is statutory profit before taxation of £6.7 million (2016: £6.0 million) after adding back the net finance cost in respect of 
the Group’s defined benefit pension scheme of £0.6 million (2016: £0.7 million) and the exceptional items and the taxation effect thereon where relevant. 
Dividend cover is calculated using headline EPS.
The headline basic earnings per share of 14.0p 
represented an increase of 2.9% (2016: 13.6p), 
whilst diluted headline earnings per share increased 
by 3.7% to 14.0p (2016: 13.5p). The proposed 
full-year dividend per share is an increase of 5.3% 
to 6.0p, which reflects the Board’s confidence 
in the robustness of the Group’s earnings, 
strong underlying cash generation and future 
prospects. The proposed dividend equates to 
a dividend cover ratio of 2.3x.
The finance costs in respect of the defined benefit 
pension scheme were slightly lower than the prior 
year at £0.6 million (2016: £0.7 million).
The tax charge for the year is £1.2 million 
(2016: £1.2 million), which represents an effective 
tax rate of 17.9% (2016: 20.4%). However, this 
has been reduced by an adjustment in respect 
of the prior year of £0.2 million which has resulted 
from the prudent assessment at 31 May 2016 
of the tax impact of capital allowances and 
exceptional items recognised in the year ended 
31 May 2016. The Group’s headline effective rate 
of tax is slightly above the standard rate at 20%. 
The Group’s future underlying effective rate of tax 
is expected to fall in line with the decrease in the 
main rate of corporation tax. After the exceptional 
items noted above, the post-tax profit for the year 
was £5.5 million (2016: £4.8 million).

Balance sheet summary
The Group has increased net assets by £1.0 million 
to £37.7 million (31 May 2016: £36.7 million). This 
reflects the robust underlying trading performance 
during the year with a retained profit for the year 
of £2.7 million (2016: £2.2 million) which has been 
partly offset by an increase in the accounting 
valuation of the pension deficit.
Tangible and intangible assets have increased by 
£5.0 million to £69.4 million as at 31 May 2017 
(31 May 2016: £64.4 million) as a result of the 
capital expenditure of £9.4 million. The depreciation 
and amortisation charges for the year to 31 May 
2017 were £3.4 million and £0.8 million respectively 
(2016: £3.2 million and £0.7 million respectively).
Group-level ROCE has decreased to 12.4% as at 
31 May 2017 (31 May 2016: 12.9%) primarily due 
to the increased capital base.
The Group has continued to focus on reducing 
net working capital, which has decreased by 
£0.2 million despite the increase in revenue 
resulting from increased commodity prices. 
The Group’s inventories have increased by £0.8 
million to £4.2 million (31 May 2016: £3.4 million) 
with trade and other receivables increasing to 
£61.3 million (31 May 2016: £52.8 million) and 
an increase in trade and other payables to 
£62.2 million (31 May 2016: £52.7 million).
Net debt increased by £3.1 million to £13.0 million 
(31 May 2016: £9.9 million), reflecting the capital 
investment in the year of £9.4 million partly offset by 
the strong underlying cash generation of the Group 
resulting from a combination of the trading 
performance and further reductions in working 
capital. At the year end, the Group’s net debt to 
EBITDA ratio was 1.0x (2016: 0.8x).
The deficit of the Group’s defined benefit pension 
scheme increased by £1.6 million to £19.9 million 
(31 May 2016: £18.3 million). The value of pension 
scheme assets increased by £5.0 million to £39.5 
million (31 May 2016: £34.5 million). The value of 
the scheme liabilities increased by £6.6 million to 
£59.4 million (31 May 2016: £52.8 million) as a 
result of the reduction in the discount rate used to 
calculate the present value of the future obligations 
(31 May 2017: 2.60%; 31 May 2016: 3.55%).
Cash flow and banking facilities
The Group has continued to deliver further sustained 
improvements in working capital during the year 
which, together with the robust trading performance, 
has resulted in strong underlying cash generation. 
Net debt has increased by £3.1 million as a result of 
£9.2 million of net capital expenditure, including the 
development investment in the Cheshire and Northern 
mills of £5.2 million. The closing net debt of £13.0 
million represents a net debt to EBITDA ratio of 1.0x.
Net cash generated from operating activities was 
£8.9 million (2016: £11.9 million) representing a cash 
conversion ratio of 98.9% of headline operating profit 
(2016: 136.8%). Our consistent focus on working 
capital has resulted in a decrease of £0.2 million 
(2016: £5.2 million), despite significant increases in 
commodity prices, through continued initiatives to 
reduce debtor days, particularly in the Feeds division.
Net capital expenditure in the year at £9.2 million 
(2016: £3.4 million) was significantly ahead of the 
annual depreciation charge of £3.4 million (2016: 
£3.2 million). The main focus of capital expenditure 
was the investment in the Cheshire and Northern mills.

are committed through to 31 October 2019 with the 
exception of the bank overdraft facility of £1.0 million 
and the £4.0 million bank guarantee facility, which are 
renewed annually. There remains substantial facility 
headroom available to support the development of the 
Group. Within the total facility of £65.0 million, the 
Group has an invoice discounting facility, the availability 
of which depends on the level of trade receivables 
available for refinancing which is subject to a maximum 
drawdown of £50.0 million. The banking facilities are 
provided subject to ongoing compliance with 
conventional banking covenants against which the 
Group has substantial levels of headroom.
Going concern
The Group has an agreement with The Royal Bank 
of Scotland Group for credit facilities totalling 
£65.0 million. With the exception of the bank 
overdraft facility of £1.0 million and the £4.0 million 
bank guarantee facility, which are renewed 
annually, these facilities are committed through 
to 31 October 2019.
Accordingly, the Directors, having made suitable 
enquiries, and based on financial performance to 
date and the available banking facilities, have a 
reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate 
resources to continue in operational existence for the 
foreseeable future. The Group therefore continues to 
adopt the going concern basis of accounting in 
preparing the annual financial statements.
Share price
The market price per share of the Company’ s shares 
at 31 May 2017 was 136.5p (31 May 2016: 152.0p)

OVERVIEW STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES
RISK DESCRIPTION AND IMPACT MITIGATING ACTIONS CHANGE
Brexit 
The uncertainty around the implications of the European Union 
exit and exchange rate volatility creates commodity price risk.
We are a UK business, with three divisions which all performed 
well in the global financial crisis as they supply basic products to 
meet the country’s needs for Feeds, Food and Fuels. We have not 
seen any changes in the demand for our products and services to 
date and monitor the situation closely.
 
Commodity prices and volatility in raw material prices
The Group’s Feeds and Fuels divisions operate in sectors 
which are vulnerable to volatile commodity prices both for 
fuel and for raw materials. 
The Group maintains close relationships with key suppliers, 
enabling optimal negotiated prices, and where appropriate implements 
purchasing framework agreements. The Feeds business utilises 
forward contracts for key raw materials to ensure that impact of 
volatility can be partially mitigated through committed prices 
and volumes.
Multiple sources of supply are maintained for all key raw materials.
Given the size of the Group, the Directors have 
not established a sub‑ committee of the Board 
to monitor financial risk management, but have 
established policies that are implemented and 
monitored by the Executive Directors.
Effective risk management aids decision making, underpins 
the delivery of the Group’s strategy and objectives and helps 
to ensure that the risks the Group takes are adequately assessed 
and actively managed. The Group regularly monitors its key 
risks and reviews its management processes and systems 
to ensure that they are effective and consistent with good 
practice. The Board is ultimately responsible for the Group’s 
risk management. The risk management process involves 
the identification and prioritisation of key risks, together 
with appropriate controls and plans for mitigation, which 
are then reported to the Board. 
As with all businesses, the Group is affected by a number 
of risks and uncertainties, some of which are beyond our 
control. The table below shows the principal risks and 
uncertainties which could have a material adverse impact 
on the Group. This is not an exhaustive list and there may 
be risks and uncertainties of which the Board is not aware, 
or which are believed to be immaterial, which could have 
an adverse effect on the Group.
The Group’s operations expose it to a variety of financial 
risks: price risk, interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. 
There is no significant foreign exchange risk in respect of the 
Group’s operations.

STRATEGIC REPORT
22 NWF GROUP plc ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 RISK DESCRIPTION AND IMPACT MITIGATING ACTIONS CHANGE
Climate – impact on earnings volatility
The demand for both the Feeds and Fuels divisions is impacted 
by climatic conditions and the severity of winter conditions in 
particular, which directly affect the demand for heating 
products. The inherent uncertainty regarding climatic conditions 
represents a risk of volatility in the profitability of the Fuels and 
Feeds divisions.
Whilst the Fuels division seeks to mitigate this risk through the 
provision of a range of fuels including commercial fuels, there will 
always be volatility in the profitability of the Fuels division related to 
climate. The Feeds division seeks to mitigate the extent of climatic 
conditions on the profitability of the business through its 
concentration on the key dairy sector where there is a strong 
underlying demand.
Pension scheme volatility
Increases in the ongoing deficit associated with the Group’s 
defined benefit pension scheme would adversely impact on the 
strength of the Group’s balance sheet and could lead to an 
increase in cash contributions payable by the Group.
The defined benefit pension scheme has been closed to new 
entrants since 2002 and from April 2016, closed to future accrual. 
Regular meetings are held with both the scheme’s trustees and 
professional advisors to monitor and review the investment policy, 
the Group’s funding requirements and any other available 
opportunities to mitigate this risk.
Recruitment, retention and development of our key people
Recruiting and retaining the right people is crucial for the 
success of the Group and its development.
Remuneration policies are regularly reviewed to ensure 
employees are appropriately incentivised. Succession planning 
and development of key employees are also considered by 
the Board. The Remuneration Committee also ensures that 
it receives appropriate benchmark data which is used in the 
monitoring and formulation of remuneration policy for key 
employees and Executives.
Infrastructure and IT systems
IT system failures or business interruption events (such as 
cyber-attacks) could have a material impact on the Group’ s ability 
to operate effectively.
The Group has internal IT support teams together with close 
relationships with key software vendors and consultants. Significant 
investment has been made by the Group in upgrading and maintaining 
its core IT systems in each of the three operating divisions.
Non-compliance with legislation and regulations
The Group operates in diverse markets and each sector has 
its own regulatory and compliance frameworks which require 
ongoing monitoring to ensure that the Group maintains full 
compliance with all legislative and regulatory requirements. 
Any incident of major injury or fatality or which results in 
significant environmental damage could result in reputational 
or financial damage to the Group.
Expertise within the operating divisions is supplemented by 
ongoing advice from professional advisors and the involvement of 
the Head Office function which closely monitors existing business 
practices and any anticipated changes in regulatory practices 
or requirements.
The Group employs appropriately qualified and experienced health 
and safety personnel and retains health and safety specialists to 
ensure compliance.
Strategic growth and change management
A failure to identify, execute or integrate acquisitions, change 
management programmes or other growth opportunities could 
impact on the profitability and strategic development of the 
Group. A major consolidation amongst competitors, a new 
market entrant or other competitor activity could impact the 
Group’s profitability or development opportunities.
The Group management team is engaged in ongoing active 
review of competitor activity, development and acquisition 
opportunities. All potential acquisitions are subject to a review 
of their ability to generate a return on capital employed 
and their strategic fit with the Group. The Group conducts 
appropriate internal and external due diligence prior to 
completing any acquisition.

Due to the infrequency of senior appointments, the Board 
does not maintain a standing Nomination Committee but 
will form one as appropriate if required. The current Chief 
Executive’s and Group Finance Director’s appointments were 
approved by the Board, after receiving a recommendation from 
a Committee of the Board, consisting of the Non-Executive 
Directors, that was formed specifically for that purpose. 
The Committee undertook a comprehensive recruitment 
process and was assisted by independent external 
recruitment consultants.
The Board annually conducts an appraisal of its own 
performance and that of each Director consisting of 
individual assessments using prescribed questionnaires 
that are completed by all Directors. The results are 
reviewed, and individual feedback is given, by an 
independent Non-Executive Director in respect of 
assessments of the Chairman and by the Chairman in 
respect of assessments of each of the other Directors 
and of the Board as a whole.
All Directors are subject to retirement by rotation in 
accordance with the Articles of Association.
The service contracts of Executive Directors require 
one year’s notice or less.
Audit Committee 
The Audit Committee consists of all three Non-Executive 
Directors and is chaired by Yvonne Monaghan, an 
independent Non-Executive Director. The Audit Committee 
met on two occasions during the year and all members 
attended. The operations of the Audit Committee are set out 
in the separate Audit Committee Report on pages 28 and 29. 
Its terms of reference will be made available at the AGM and 
on the Company’s website.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee consists of all three Non-Executive 
Directors and is chaired by Philip Acton, an independent 
Non-Executive Director. The Remuneration Committee met on a 
number of occasions during the year. Its remit is to determine, on 
behalf of the Board, appropriate short and long-term total reward 
packages for the Executive Directors and will also satisfy itself 
that good practices apply to all Group employees through the 
relevant management structures. Its terms of reference will be 
made available at the AGM and on the Company’s website.
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT
The Board is committed to 
achieving high standards 
of corporate governance, 
integrity and business 
ethics for all of the 
activities of the Group.
Under the rules of AIM, the Group is not 
required to comply with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code 2016 (‘the Code’). 
Nevertheless, the Board has taken steps to 
comply with the Code insofar as it can be 
applied practically and appropriately, given 
the size of the Group and the nature of its 
operations. The main ways in which it does 
this are described below. 
Board composition and operation
The Board currently comprises two Executive 
and three Non-Executive Directors. The names 
of the Directors together with their roles and 
biographical details are set out on page 24. 
The roles of Chairman and Chief Executive are 
separated, clearly understood and have been 
agreed by the Board. The Chairman is 
responsible for the Board. The Chief Executive 
is responsible for the operating performance 
of the Group. A formal schedule of matters 
requiring Group Board approval is maintained 
and regularly reviewed, covering such areas as 
Group strategy, approval of budgets, financial 
results, Board appointments and dividend 
policy. The Board normally meets once a 
month and additional meetings are called 
when required. Comprehensive briefing 
papers are sent to all Directors prior to each 
scheduled Board meeting. Directors are able, 
if necessary, to take independent professional 
advice in the furtherance of their duties at the 
Company’s expense.

OVERVIEW STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION
Directors
Each of the Directors is subject to election by the 
shareholders at the first Annual General Meeting after 
their appointment. Thereafter, all Directors are subject to 
retirement by rotation in accordance with the Articles of 
Association. Biographical details of all Directors are set 
out on page 24. After 11 years’ service as Chairman, 
Sir Mark Hudson KCVO has made the decision to step 
down at this year’s AGM to be held in September 2017. 
Philip Acton, currently Non-Executive Director and Chairman 
of the Remuneration Committee, has accepted the position 
of Chairman, which he will commence upon the conclusion 
of the AGM. Lorraine Clinton has been appointed as a 
Non-Executive Director and will join the Board with effect 
from 28 September 2017.
The Non-Executive Directors have received appointment letters 
setting out their terms of appointment. All Non-Executive 
Directors are appointed for one year with renewal for further 
one-year terms if performance is satisfactory. The retiring 
Chairman has served for more than nine years on the 
Board, which does not comply with the Code’s definition 
of independence. The Board considers that the other two 
Non-Executive Directors meet the independence tests. The 
terms and conditions of appointment of the Non-Executive 
Directors are available for inspection at the Company’s 
registered office.
The appointment of new Non-Executive Directors to the 
Board is considered by the whole Board.
Internal control
The Board has overall responsibility for ensuring that the 
Group maintains a system of internal control, to provide 
it with reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of 
financial information that is used within the business and 
for publication and the safeguarding of assets. There are 
inherent limitations in any system of internal control and 
accordingly even the most effective system can provide 
only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance against 
material misstatement or loss. Some examples of internal 
controls operated by the Group are given below and 
elsewhere in this statement.
The Group’s organisational structure has clear lines of 
responsibility. Operating and financial responsibility for 
subsidiary companies is delegated to operational 
management.
The Group’s risk management programme, which assesses 
key risks and the required internal controls that are delegated 
to Directors and managers at all levels in the Group, is 
reviewed regularly in order to ensure that it continues to meet 
the Board’s requirements.
Shareholders
The Chairman and the Non-Executive Directors will always 
make themselves available to meet with shareholders. Each 
AGM is a particular opportunity for this. Normal relationships 
with shareholders are maintained by the Executive Directors 
who brief the Board on shareholder issues and who relate 
the views of the Group’s advisors to the Board. The Board 
believes that the disclosures set out on pages 6 to 23 
of the Annual Report provide the information necessary 
for shareholders to assess the Company’s performance, 
business model and strategy.
Share capital structures
Details of the Company’s share capital can be found in the 
‘Takeover Directive requirements’ section of the Directors’ 
Report and in note 21 of the Group financial statements.
Going concern basis
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors 
likely to affect its future development, performance and 
position, are set out in the Group Financial Review. The 
financial position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity 
position and borrowing facilities are also described in the 
Group Financial Review. In addition, note 19 of the Group 
financial statements includes the Group’s objectives, policies 
and processes for managing its capital, its financial risk 
management objectives, details of financial instruments 
and hedging activities and its exposure to price, interest 
rate, credit and liquidity risk. Accordingly, the Directors 
have a reasonable expectation that the Company and the 
Group have adequate resources to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future based on the 
following factors:
 » The Group’s banking facilities totalling £65.0 million 
with The Royal Bank of Scotland Group are committed 
through to October 2019. There is significant headroom 
both in terms of covenant compliance and funding 
availability. Undrawn facilities at 31 May 2017 were 
£43.8 million (2016: £36.3 million).
 » The Group has prepared financial projections to 
31 May 2019 which project positive earnings and 
demonstrate covenant compliance at all quarterly 
covenant test dates.
 » Calculations to support covenant compliance are 
prepared and reviewed on a quarterly basis.
 » The Group monitors capital risk on the basis of net debt/
EBITDA ratio, which at 31 May 2017 was 1.0x (2016: 0.8x).
On the basis of the above, the Directors continue to adopt 
the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the 
annual financial statements.
Forward-looking statements
The Annual Report and Accounts includes certain 
statements that are forward-looking statements. These 
statements appear in a number of places throughout 
the strategic report and include statements regarding the 
Group’s intentions, beliefs or current expectations and those 
of its officers, Directors and employees concerning, amongst 
other things, the results of operations, financial condition, 
liquidity, prospects, growth and strategies of the Group’s 
businesses. By their nature, these statements involve 
uncertainty since future events and circumstances can 
cause results and developments to differ materially from 
those anticipated. CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT 
External audit
The Audit Committee also approves the appointment and 
remuneration of the Group’s external auditors and satisfies 
itself that they maintain their independence regardless of any 
non-audit work performed by them. The Group adopts the 
following policy governing the performance of non-audit 
work by the auditors. The auditors are permitted to provide 
non-audit services which are not, and are not perceived to 
be, in conflict with auditor independence, providing they have 
the skill, competence and integrity to carry out the work and 
are considered to be the most appropriate advisors to 
undertake such work in the best interests of the Group. 
All assignments are monitored by the Committee.
The respective responsibilities of the Directors and external 
auditors in connection with the financial statements are 
explained in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities on 
page 36 and the Auditors’ Report on pages 37 and 38. Details 
of services provided by, and fees payable to, the auditors are 
shown in note 5 of the Group financial statements.
Whilst the Audit Committee has not adopted a formal policy 
in respect of the rotation of the external auditors, one of its 
principal duties is to make recommendations to the Board in 
relation to the appointment of the external auditors. Various 
factors are taken into account by the Committee in this 
respect, including the quality of the reports provided to the 
Committee, the level of service provided and the level of 
understanding of the Group’s business.
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP have been the Company’s 
external auditors for many years. The Audit Committee 
considers that the relationship with the auditors is working 
well and remains satisfied with their effectiveness and 
independence. Accordingly, it has not considered it 
necessary to date to require the firm to re-tender for the audit 
work. The auditors are required to rotate the audit partner 
responsible for the Group and subsidiary audits every five 
years. The current audit partner is in the third year of his term 
as audit partner. There are no contractual obligations 
restricting the Company’s choice of auditors.
Dear shareholder,
I am pleased to present the Audit Committee 
Report for the year ended 31 May 2017.
Composition
The Audit Committee consists of all three 
Non-Executive Directors and is chaired by 
myself as an independent Non-Executive 
Director. The Audit Committee met on two 
occasions during the year and all 
members attended.
Responsibilities
The Audit Committee has terms of 
reference in place which have been formally 
approved by the Board and are made 
available at the AGM and on the Company’s 
website. Its primary responsibilities include 
reviewing the effectiveness of the Group’s 
internal control systems and monitoring the 
integrity of the Group’s financial statements 
and external announcements of the Group’s 
results. The Committee reports to the Board 
on all these matters.
Experience of the Audit Committee
The Audit Committee comprises all three 
Non-Executive Directors, two of whom are 
qualified Chartered Accountants and have 
extensive industry experience in senior 
finance roles. NWF GROUP plc ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 29
OVERVIEW STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION
Internal audit
The Group does not have a formal internal audit function 
but performs targeted reviews and visits to operations by 
the Head Office team and professional advisors. The results 
of these reviews are communicated back to the Audit 
Committee. This approach is considered appropriate and 
proportionate given the extensive work performed by the 
external auditors.
Internal control and risk management
An internal control update is provided to the Audit Committee 
at each meeting. The principal risks are also reviewed and 
any changes in risk ratings are discussed to ensure that 
appropriate risk mitigations are in place where relevant.
Going concern
Financial projections covering a period of not less than two 
years are prepared to support the appropriateness review 
of going concern. Sensitivities are calculated to ensure that 
headroom exists in both financial resources and covenants, 
both of which are sufficient.
Significant issues considered in relation to the 
financial statements
The Audit Committee assesses whether suitable accounting 
policies have been adopted and whether management has 
made appropriate estimates and judgements. The Committee 
reviews accounting papers prepared by management which 
provides details on the main financial reporting judgements. 
The Committee also reviews reports by the external auditors 
on the half-year and full-year results which highlight any 
issues arising from their work undertaken in respect of the 
half-year review and year-end audit. The specific areas of 
audit and accounting risk reviewed by the Committee were:
1. The carrying value of goodwill
The Group’s goodwill is a material balance. Annual 
impairment reviews are performed which use key 
judgements including estimates of future business 
performance and cash generation, discount rates and 
long-term growth rates. The Committee is comfortable with 
the key assumptions applied and management’s conclusion 
that no impairment has occurred.
2. The carrying value of trade receivables
The Group holds material trade receivable balances, and 
the calculations of provisions for impairment are estimates 
of future events and therefore uncertain. The Committee 
has reviewed the current year provisions against trade 
receivables, including an assessment of the adequacy of 
the prior year provisions and is satisfied with management’s 
conclusions that the provisioning levels are appropriate.
3. Pensions including obligations and assumptions
The Group’s defined benefit pension scheme is material to its 
financial position. The amounts shown in the balance sheet 
are highly sensitive to changes in key actuarial assumptions 
which are set by reference to advice from professional 
advisors. Full disclosure of the pension scheme is provided 
in note 22 to the financial statements.
4. Deferred consideration
Accounting for deferred consideration has been reviewed 
in light of performance criteria.
5. Exceptional items
The Committee has considered the presentation of 
the Group financial statements and, in particular, the 
presentation of exceptional items and the items included 
within such categories. The Committee has discussed these 
items with management and agreed that the presentation is 
consistent with the Group’s accounting policy and provides 
more meaningful information to shareholders about the 
underlying performance of the Group.

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT
Dear shareholder,
I am pleased to present the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report for the year ended 31 May 2017.
The aim of our report is to provide shareholders 
with information to understand our remuneration 
strategy and its linkage to the Group’s financial 
performance. The following Directors were 
members of the Remuneration Committee when 
matters relating to the Executive Directors’ 
remuneration were being considered:
Members of the Remuneration Committee
Mr T P Acton
Sir Mark Hudson KCVO
Mrs Y M Monaghan
Our performance in 2016/17
This has been another year of solid results for 
NWF Group plc, despite many challenges in the 
Group’s operating markets. The business model 
proved robust with tough conditions in the market 
for dairy feeds more than offset by further growth 
in the Fuels division and a solid performance in 
the Food division in the year.
Key pay out-turns for 2016/17
For 2016/17, the performance achieved against 
financial and operational targets resulted in 14% 
of the maximum annual bonus being paid.
Given our headline earnings per share (‘EPS’) 
performance of 14.0p at 31 May 2017, 0% of the 
LTIP awards granted at the start of 2014/15 will 
vest in August 2017.
Looking forward to 2017/18
We continue to work with Deloitte LLP, our 
professional advisors, to ensure our remuneration 
structure supports the evolving strategy of the 
Company and our growth ambitions over the 
coming years and is at the appropriate levels in 
the current marketplace. The key reward 
schemes can be summarised as follows:
 » Annual bonus – an annual bonus with 
performance criteria based upon a mixture of 
profit-based and personal objectives as set by 
the Remuneration Committee.
 » Long-term Incentive Plans (‘LTIP’) – three-year 
share-based payments with the performance 
criteria being based upon EPS growth over 
the term of the award.
I do hope that this clearly explains our approach 
to remuneration and enables you to appreciate 
how it underpins our business growth strategy.

OVERVIEW STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION
Remuneration policy
As an AIM-listed entity, the Company is not required to fully apply the Listing Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority or the 
BIS Directors’ Remuneration Reporting Regulations and hence is not required to present a board report on remuneration in 
accordance with those rules. Nevertheless, the Board considers it appropriate for the Company to provide shareholders with 
information with respect to Executive remuneration. The report is unaudited, unless otherwise stated.
The Company’s remuneration principles are as follows – these have been taken from the Association of British Insurers’ 
(‘ABI’) ‘Principles of Remuneration’:
 » remuneration structures should be appropriate to the specific business, efficient and cost effective in delivery;
 » complexity is discouraged in favour of simple and understandable remuneration structures;
 » remuneration structures should seek to align Executive and shareholder interests including through a meaningful level 
of personal shareholding;
 » remuneration structures should promote long-term focus through features such as deferral and measuring performance 
over the long term;
 » structures should include performance adjustments (malus) and/or clawback provisions;
 » pay should be aligned to the long-term sustainable success and the desired corporate culture throughout the 
organisation; and
 » the Remuneration Committee ensures that rewards properly reflect business performance.

information on matters of concern to them, consulting them 
or their representatives regularly, so that their views can be

persons in suitable employment and gives full and fair 
consideration to such persons, including any employee who

unaware; and
 » each Director has taken all the steps that they ought to 
have taken as a Director to make themselves aware of 
any relevant audit information and to establish that the 
Company’s auditors are aware of that information.
This confirmation is given and should be interpreted in

STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MAY 2017
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report 
and the financial statements in accordance with applicable 
law and regulation.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial 
statements for each financial year. Under that law the 
Directors have prepared the Group financial statements 
in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union and 
Parent Company financial statements in accordance with 
United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice 
(United Kingdom Accounting Standards, comprising FRS 
101 “Reduced Disclosure Framework”, and applicable law). 
Under company law the Directors must not approve the 
financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give 
a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and 
Parent Company and of the profit or loss of the Group and 
Parent Company for that period. In preparing the financial 
statements, the Directors are required to:
 » select suitable accounting policies and then apply 
them consistently;
 » state whether applicable IFRSs as adopted by the 
European Union have been followed for the Group 
financial statements and United Kingdom Accounting 
Standards, comprising FRS 101, have been followed 
for the Company financial statements, subject to any 
material departures disclosed and explained in the 
financial statements;
 » make judgements and accounting estimates that are 
reasonable and prudent; and
 » prepare the financial statements on the going concern 
basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the 
Group and Parent Company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate 
accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain 
the Group and Parent Company’s transactions and disclose 
with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position 
of the Group and Parent Company and enable them to 
ensure that the financial statements comply with the 
Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group financial 
statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
The Directors are also responsible for safeguarding the 
assets of the Group and Parent Company and hence for 
taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection 
of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and 
integrity of the Parent Company’s website. Legislation 
in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and 
dissemination of financial statements may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions.
The Directors consider that the Annual Report and Accounts, 
taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and 
provides the information necessary for shareholders to 
assess the Group and Parent Company’s performance, 
business model and strategy.
Each of the Directors, whose names and functions are listed 
in Directors’ report confirm that, to the best of their knowledge:
 » the Parent Company financial statements, which have 
been prepared in accordance with United Kingdom 
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom 
Accounting Standards, comprising FRS 101 “Reduced 
Disclosure Framework”, and applicable law), give a true 
and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position 
and profit of the Company;
 » the Group financial statements, which have been 
prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the 
European Union, give a true and fair view of the assets, 
liabilities, financial position and profit of the Group; and
 » the Strategic report includes a fair review of the 
development and performance of the business and the 
position of the Group and Parent Company, together with 
a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that 
they face.

OVERVIEW STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION
Report on the Group financial statements
Our opinion
In our opinion, NWF Group plc’s Group financial statements (the ‘financial statements’):
 » give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 31 May 2017 and of its profit and cash flows for the year 
then ended;
 » have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRSs’) as adopted by 
the European Union; and
 » have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
What we have audited
The financial statements, included within the Annual Report and Accounts 2017 (the ‘Annual Report’), comprise:
 » the Consolidated balance sheet as at 31 May 2017;
 » the Consolidated income statement and Consolidated statement of comprehensive income for the year then ended;
 » the Consolidated cash flow statement for the year then ended;
 » the Consolidated statement of changes in equity for the year then ended; and
 » the notes to the financial statements, which include a summary of significant accounting policies and other 
explanatory information.
Certain required disclosures have been presented elsewhere in the Annual Report, rather than in the notes to the financial 
statements. These are cross-referenced from the financial statements and are identified as audited.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the financial statements is IFRSs as adopted 
by the European Union, and applicable law.
In applying the financial reporting framework, the Directors have made a number of subjective judgements, for example 
in respect of significant accounting estimates. In making such estimates, they have made assumptions and considered 
future events.
Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:
 » the information given in the Strategic report and the Directors’ report for the financial year for which the financial 
statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and
 » the Strategic report and the Directors’ report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.
In addition, in light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and its environment obtained in the course of the audit, 
we are required to report if we have identified any material misstatements in the Strategic report and the Directors’ report. 
We have nothing to report in this respect.
Other matters on which we are required to report by exception
Adequacy of information and explanations received
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, we have not received all the information 
and explanations we require for our audit. We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility. 
Directors’ remuneration
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, certain disclosures of Directors’ 
remuneration specified by law are not made. We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.

Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit
Our responsibilities and those of the Directors
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ responsibilities set out on page 36, the Directors are responsible for 
the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view.
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and 
International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) (‘ISAs (UK & Ireland)’). Those standards require us to comply with the 
Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the Parent Company’s members as a body in 
accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these 
opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or 
into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
What an audit of financial statements involves
We conducted our audit in accordance with ISAs (UK & Ireland). An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts 
and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from 
material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: 
 » whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and 
adequately disclosed; 
 » the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the Directors; and 
 » the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
We primarily focus our work in these areas by assessing the Directors’ judgements against available evidence, forming our own 
judgements, and evaluating the disclosures in the financial statements.
We test and examine information, using sampling and other auditing techniques, to the extent we consider necessary to 
provide a reasonable basis for us to draw conclusions. We obtain audit evidence through testing the effectiveness of 
controls, substantive procedures or a combination of both. 
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report to identify material inconsistencies with 
the audited financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially 
inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent 
material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report. With respect to the Strategic report 
and Directors’ report, we consider whether those reports include the disclosures required by applicable legal requirements.
Other matter
We have reported separately on the Parent Company financial statements of NWF Group plc for the year ended 31 May 2017.

CONSOLIDATED CASH FLOW STATEMENT
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MAY 2017 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
44 NWF GROUP plc ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
1. General information
NWF Group plc (‘the Company’) is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in the UK under the Companies Act 2006. 
The principal activities of NWF Group plc and its subsidiaries (together ‘the Group’) are the manufacture and sale of animal 
feeds, the sale and distribution of fuel oils and the warehousing and distribution of ambient groceries. Further information on the 
nature of the Group’s operations and principal activities is set out in note 4 of the Group financial statements.
The address of the Company’s registered office is NWF Group plc, Wardle, Nantwich, Cheshire CW5 6BP . The Company has its 
primary listing on AIM, part of the London Stock Exchange.
The Group financial statements were authorised for issue by the Board of Directors on 1 August 2017.
2. Significant accounting policies
The Group’s principal accounting policies, all of which have been applied consistently to all of the years presented, are set out below.
Basis of preparation
The Group financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as 
endorsed by the European Union (‘IFRS’), IFRS Interpretations Committee (‘IFRS IC’) interpretations and those provisions of the 
Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. The Group financial statements have been prepared on 
the going concern basis and on the historical cost convention modified for the revaluation of certain financial instruments.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates, which 
are outlined in the critical accounting estimates and judgements section of these accounting policies. It also requires 
management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies.
Headline profit before taxation and headline earnings
The Directors consider that headline operating profit, headline profit before taxation and headline earnings per share 
measures, referred to in these Group financial statements, provide useful information for shareholders on underlying trends 
and performance. 
Headline profit before taxation is reported profit before taxation after adding back the net finance cost in respect of the Group’s 
defined benefit pension scheme and exceptional items, to show the underlying performance of the Group.
The calculations of basic and diluted headline earnings per share are shown in note 10 of the Group financial statements.
Adoption of new and revised standards
The following new standards, amendments to standards or interpretations are mandatory for the first time for the financial year 
beginning 1 June 2016.
The Group has adopted the following new standards, amendments and interpretations now applicable. None of these 
standards and interpretations have had any material effect on the Group’s results or net assets.

Adoption of new and revised standards continued
The following standards, amendments and interpretations are not yet effective and have not been adopted early by the Group:

Amendment to IAS 7 Statement of Cash Flows 1 June 2017

Amendment to IFRS 2 Share-based Payments 1 June 2018
Amendment to IAS 40 Investment Properties 1 June 2018
Annual improvements to IFRS 2014 – 2016 Various 1 June 2018
IFRS 16 Leases 1 June 2019
Other than IFRS 16, none of these standards or interpretations are expected to have a material impact on the Group. Under 
IFRS 16 the present distinction between operating and finance leases will be removed, resulting in all leases being recognised 
on the balance sheet except for those with a very low value. At inception, a right-of-use asset will be recognised together with an 
equivalent liability reflecting the discounted lease payments over the estimated term of the lease. Whilst the overall cost of using 
the asset over the lease term should be the same, it is likely that the weighting of the charge between periods may differ due to 
the requirement to distinguish between the lease and non-lease elements of the agreement. Adoption of this standard is likely 
to result in an increase in gross assets and gross liabilities, and the consolidated income statement is expected to have an 
increased depreciation expense; however, the lease expense will reduce by a similar amount. The Group will make an 
assessment of the full impact in due course. 
Consolidation
The Group financial statements incorporate the financial statements of NWF Group plc (‘the Company’) and entities controlled 
by the Company (its ‘subsidiaries’) made up to 31 May each year. Control is achieved where the Company has the power to 
govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are de-consolidated from the 
date that control ceases.
The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the acquisition method. The consideration transferred for the acquisition 
of a subsidiary is the fair value of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred and the equity interests issued by the Company. 
The consideration transferred includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement. 
Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed 
in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date. On an acquisition-by-acquisition 
basis, the Group recognises any non-controlling interest in the acquiree either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest’s 
proportionate share of the acquiree’s net assets.
The excess of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the acquisition date 
fair value of any previous equity interest in the acquiree over the fair value of the Group’s share of the identifiable net assets 
acquired is recorded as goodwill. If this is less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired in the case of 
a bargain purchase, the difference is recognised directly in the income statement.
Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companies are eliminated. 
Unrealised losses are also eliminated. Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure 
consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.
If the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete by the end of the first reporting period in which the combination 
occurs, the Group reports provisional amounts for the items for which the accounting is incomplete. Those provisional amounts 
are adjusted during the measurement period (see below), or additional assets or liabilities are recognised, to reflect new 
information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed at the date of acquisition that, if known, would have affected 
the amounts recognised as of that date.
The measurement period is the period from the date of acquisition to the date the Group obtains complete information about 
facts and circumstances that existed at the date of acquisition, and is subject to a maximum of one year. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
46 NWF GROUP plc ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
2. Significant accounting policies continued
Revenue recognition
Revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for the sale of goods and services in the ordinary 
course of the Group’s activities. Revenue is shown net of value added tax, estimated returns, rebates and discounts, and after 
eliminating sales within the Group. Specific types of revenue are recognised as follows:
Feeds and Fuels
Revenue from the sale of goods in each of these segments is recognised when they are delivered to the customer and title has 
passed. Revenue from sale of fuels includes fuel duty.
Food
Revenue from storage, distribution, handling and re-packaging of clients’ products is recognised when the relevant service has 
been performed.
Interest income
Interest income is recognised on a time proportion basis using the effective interest rate method.
Segment reporting
A business segment is a group of assets and operations engaged in providing products or services that are subject to risks 
and returns that are different from those of other business segments. A geographical segment is engaged in providing products 
and services within a particular economic environment that are subject to risks and returns which are different from those 
of segments operating in other economic environments. Segment reporting information is shown in note 4 of the Group 
financial statements.
Taxation
The income tax expense represents the sum of current and deferred income tax. Tax is recognised in the income statement, 
except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. In this case the tax 
is also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively.
Current income tax is based on taxable profits for the year. Taxable profit differs from profit as reported in the income statement 
because it excludes items of income and expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that 
are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred income tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases 
of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the Group financial statements. However, deferred income tax is not 
accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that 
at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profits or losses.
Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance 
sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability 
is settled.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against 
which the temporary differences can be utilised.
Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the construction of qualifying assets, which are assets that necessarily take 
a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use, are added to the cost of those assets, until such time as the 
assets are substantially ready for their intended use. 
All other borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement in the period in which they are incurred.
Dividend distribution
The distribution of a dividend to the Company’s shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Group’s financial statements 
in the period in which it is approved by the Company’s shareholders.

2. Significant accounting policies continued
Property, plant and equipment
All property, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation. Historical cost includes expenditure 
that is directly related to the acquisition of the items.
Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount, or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it 
is probable that future economic benefits associated with the asset will flow to the Group, and the cost of the asset can be 
measured reliably. All other repairs and maintenance expenditure is charged to the income statement during the financial period 
in which it is incurred.
Land is not depreciated. Depreciation on other assets is calculated, using the straight-line method, to reduce their cost to their 
residual values over their useful economic lives, as follows:
Freehold and long leasehold buildings 10 – 50 years
Plant, machinery and equipment 3 – 10 years
Commercial vehicles 4 – 8 years
Motor vehicles 4 years
Residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance sheet date. An asset’s carrying 
amount is written down immediately to its estimated recoverable amount, if the asset’s carrying amount is greater than its 
estimated recoverable amount.
Gains and losses on disposal are determined by comparing the proceeds of disposal with the carrying value and are recognised 
in the income statement.
Intangible assets
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of the identifiable net assets 
of the acquired subsidiary at the date of acquisition. 
Goodwill on acquisitions of subsidiaries is included within intangible assets. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment and 
carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Impairment losses on goodwill are recognised immediately in the income 
statement and are not subsequently reversed. Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of 
goodwill relating to the entity sold.
Goodwill is allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units for the purpose of impairment testing. The allocation is made 
to those cash-generating units or groups of cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the business combination in 
which they arose, identified according to operating segment.
Brands
Separately acquired brands are shown at historical cost. Brands acquired in a business combination are recognised at fair value 
at the date of acquisition. Brands have a finite useful life and are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and represent an 
acquired intangible asset. Amortisation is calculated, using the straight-line method, to allocate the cost of brands over their 
estimated useful lives (10 to 20 years).
Computer software
Costs associated with maintaining computer software programs are recognised as an expense as incurred. Costs incurred to 
acquire computer software licences and directly attributable costs incurred to bring the software into use are capitalised. 
Directly attributable costs include software development employee costs. Capitalised computer software costs are amortised 
over their estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis (3 to 7 years).
Impairment of non-financial assets
Assets that have an indefinite useful life, for example goodwill, are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for 
impairment. Assets that are subject to amortisation or depreciation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in 
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised as the amount by 
which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of the asset’s fair 
value less costs to sell and its value in use. Non-financial assets, other than goodwill, that suffer an impairment are reviewed for 
possible reversal of the impairment at each reporting date. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is determined using the first in first out (‘FIFO’) method. 
The cost of raw materials, consumables, finished goods and goods for resale comprises purchase cost and, in the case of 
finished goods, the cost of transporting the goods to their stock location.
Net realisable value comprises the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less applicable variable selling 
expenses. Provision is made for obsolete, slow-moving or defective items where appropriate.
Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables are recognised initially at fair value less provision for impairment.
A provision for impairment is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts 
due according to the original terms of the receivables. The amount of the provision is charged to the income statement within 
administrative expenses.
Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities
A derivative is initially recognised at fair value on the date that the associated contract is entered into and then is re-measured 
at fair value at each subsequent balance sheet date. 
The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether or not the derivative is designated as a hedging 
instrument and, if so, the nature of the item being hedged. During the current and prior year, none of the Group’s derivative 
financial instruments have been designated as effective hedges. Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments 
that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in the income statement as they arise.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks and bank overdrafts. Bank overdrafts are 
shown within borrowings in current liabilities on the balance sheet.
Trade and other payables
Trade and other payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective 
interest method.
Exceptional items
The Group’s income statement separately identifies exceptional items. Such items are those that in the Directors’ judgement 
are one-off in nature or non-operating and need to be disclosed separately by virtue of their size or incidence and may include, 
but are not limited to, restructuring costs, acquisition-related costs, costs of implementing new systems and income from legal 
settlements. In determining whether an item should be disclosed as an exceptional item, the Directors consider quantitative as 
well as qualitative factors such as the frequency, predictability of occurrence and significance. This is consistent with the way 
financial performance is measured by management and reported to the Board. Disclosing exceptional items separately provides 
additional understanding of the performance of the Group.
Bank borrowings
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently stated at 
amortised cost. Any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognised in the 
income statement over the period of the borrowings, using the effective interest method.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for 
at least one year after the balance sheet date.
Retirement benefit costs
The Group operates various pension schemes, including defined contribution and defined benefit schemes.
For defined contribution schemes, the Group pays contributions to publicly or privately administered pension insurance 
schemes on a mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis. The contributions are recognised as an employee benefit expense 
in the income statement when they are due. 
The liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect of defined benefit schemes is the present value of the defined benefit 
obligation at the balance sheet date less the fair value of scheme assets, together with adjustments for unrecognised actuarial 
gains or losses and past service costs. The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the 
Projected Unit Credit Method. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated 
future cash outflows using interest rates of high quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the 
benefits will be paid and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension liability.

2. Significant accounting policies continued
Retirement benefit costs continued
The net pension finance cost is determined by applying the discount rate, used to measure the defined benefit pension obligation 
at the beginning of the accounting period, to the net pension obligation at the beginning of the accounting period taking into 
account any changes in the net pension obligation during the period as a result of cash contributions and benefit payments. 
Pension scheme expenses are charged to the income statement within administrative expenses.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised immediately in the statement of comprehensive income. Net defined benefit pension 
scheme deficits before tax relief are presented separately on the balance sheet within non-current liabilities. The attributable 
deferred income tax asset is included within the deferred income tax asset in the balance sheet and is subject to the recognition 
criteria as set out in the accounting policy on deferred income tax.
Share-based payments
In the year ended 31 May 2017 , the Group operated one (2016: one) equity-settled share-based payment plan, details of which 
can be found in note 23 of the Group financial statements.
The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of share awards is recognised as an expense. 
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value (excluding the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions) 
at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a 
straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest and adjusted for the 
effect of non-market-based vesting conditions.
Fair value is measured by the use of a Black Scholes model. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based 
on management’s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
Employer social security contributions payable in connection with the grant of share awards is considered an integral part of the 
grant itself and the charge is treated as a cash-settled transaction.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is probable 
that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and the amount has been reliably estimated. Provisions are 
not recognised for future operating losses.
Leases and hire purchase agreements
Leases in which a significant proportion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as 
operating leases. Payments made under operating leases (net of any incentives received from the lessor) are charged to the 
income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease. Depreciation is provided at rates consistent with that for 
similar assets or over the term of the lease, where shorter than the useful economic life.
Other leases are classified as finance leases. 
Assets and liabilities under finance leases and hire purchase agreements are recognised in the balance sheet at the inception of the 
agreement at amounts equal to their fair value or, if lower, the net present value of the minimum payments under the agreement. 
Depreciation on hire purchase and leased assets is provided at rates consistent with that for similar assets that are owned by the Group.
Subsequent to initial recognition, payments made are apportioned between the finance charge element and the reduction in the 
capital value of the outstanding liability. The finance charge is allocated to each period so as to produce a constant periodic rate 
of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Share capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares are shown in equity 
as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds of issue. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

2. Significant accounting policies continued
Critical accounting estimates and judgements
The Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future. The resulting accounting estimates will, by definition, 
seldom equal the related actual results. The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material 
adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below.
Estimated impairment of goodwill
The Group tests annually whether goodwill has suffered any impairment, in accordance with the accounting policy stated on 
page 47. The recoverable amounts of cash-generating units have been determined based on value in use calculations. These 
calculations require the use of estimates, both in arriving at expected future cash flows and a suitable discount rate in order 
to calculate the present value of these flows. Further details can be found in note 12 of the Group financial statements.
Estimated impairment of trade receivables
The Group regularly reviews the recoverability of trade receivables. A provision for impairment is made where the Group believes 
that it will not be able to collect amounts due according to the original terms of sale. Provisions for impairment are estimates of 
future events and are therefore uncertain. Further details can be found in note 14 of the Group financial statements.
Defined benefit pension scheme – valuation assumptions
The balance sheet carrying values of defined benefit pension scheme surpluses or deficits are calculated using independently 
commissioned actuarial valuations. These valuations are based on a number of assumptions, including the most appropriate mortality 
rates to apply to the profile of scheme members and the financial assumptions regarding discount rates and inflation. All of these are 
estimates of future events and are therefore uncertain. Further details can be found in note 22 of the Group financial statements.
Estimated fair value of derivatives and other financial instruments
The Group has certain financial instruments (forward supply contracts) that are not in an active market and cannot be valued 
by reference to unadjusted quoted prices for identical instruments. The Group, therefore, uses its judgement to select valuation 
techniques and makes assumptions that are mainly based on observable market data in respect of equivalent instruments 
at the balance sheet date. Further details can be found in note 19 of the Group financial statements.
Valuation of acquired intangibles
IFRS 3(R) requires separately identifiable intangible assets to be recognised on acquisitions. The principal estimates used in 
valuing these intangible assets are generally based on the future cash flow forecast to be generated by these assets, and the 
selection of appropriate discount rates to apply to the cash flows.
Classification of exceptional items
Certain items of income and expense are classified as exceptional items due to their nature or size and are presented 
separately on the face of the income statement in order to provide a better understanding of the Group’s financial performance. 
Exceptional items, together with the net finance cost in respect of the Group’s defined benefit arrangements are excluded from 
underlying performance measures in order to present a more meaningful measure of the underlying (‘headline’) performance of 
the business. Further details can be found in note 5 of the Group financial statements.

The chief operating decision-maker has been identified as the Board of Directors (‘the Board’). The Board reviews the Group’s 
internal reporting in order to assess performance and allocate resources. The Board has determined that the operating 
segments, based on these reports, are Feeds, Food and Fuels.
The Board considers the business from a products/services perspective. In the Board’s opinion, all of the Group’s operations 
are carried out in the same geographical segment, namely the UK.

4. Segment information continued
The nature of the products/services provided by the operating segments is summarised below:
Feeds – manufacture and sale of animal feeds and other agricultural products
Food –  warehousing and distribution of clients’ ambient grocery and other products to supermarket and other retail 
distribution centres
Fuels – sale and distribution of domestic heating, industrial and road fuels
Segment information about the above businesses is presented below.
The Board assesses the performance of the operating segments based on a measure of operating profit (‘headline operating 
profit’). Finance income and costs are not included in the segment result that is assessed by the Board. Other information 
provided to the Board is measured in a manner consistent with that in the financial statements.
Inter-segment transactions are entered into under the normal commercial terms and conditions that would also be available 
to unrelated third parties.
Segment assets exclude deferred income tax assets and cash at bank and in hand. Segment liabilities exclude taxation, borrowings 
and retirement benefit obligations. Excluded items are part of the reconciliation to consolidated total assets and liabilities.

in the North and Cheshire and the associated restructuring to align the business with its production facilities. The restructuring 
costs include redundancy and relocation payments, costs in respect of site closure and other restructuring costs.
Of the £1.2 million exceptional items, £1.0 million has been recognised as a cash outflow in the year to 31 May 2017. A further 
£0.2 million will impact cash in future periods.
Prior year exceptional items
Restructuring costs – during the prior year the Group incurred restructuring costs relating to redundancy payments, impairment 
of property, plant and equipment in respect of site closures, lease provisions for onerous leases and other restructuring costs.
Acquisition-related costs – the acquisition-related costs comprise professional fees and other costs in relation to the three 
acquisitions made during the prior year.
Net gain on pension scheme closure – as a result of the closure of the Group’s defined benefit pension scheme to future accrual 
with effect from 6 April 2016 a gain was recognised relating to the impact of lower future inflationary increases, net of the 
associated legal and professional costs.

Further reductions in the UK corporation tax rate, to 17% with effect from 1 April 2020, were substantively enacted into law 
before the balance sheet date. In the opinion of the Directors, the relevant timing differences are expected to reverse after 
1 April 2020 and therefore deferred tax has been provided at a rate of 17%.

Goodwill
Goodwill acquired is allocated, at acquisition, to cash-generating units (‘CGUs’) that are expected to benefit from that business 
combination. The carrying value of goodwill is allocated as follows:
2017
£m
2016
£m
Feeds 11.9 11.9
Fuels 8.2 8.2
 20.1 20.1
The Group tests annually for impairment of goodwill. The recoverable amounts of CGUs are determined using value in use 
calculations. The value in use calculations use post-tax cash flow projections based on the Board-approved budget for the year 
ending 31 May 2018 and forecasts for the following four years. Subsequent cash flows are extrapolated using an estimated 
growth rate of 2%.
The rate used to discount the projected cash flows, being a post-tax risk-adjusted discount rate, is 7.2% (2016: 9.9%) for all 
business segments. The same discount rate has been used for each CGU as the principal risks associated with the Group, 
as highlighted on pages 22 and 23, would also impact each CGU in a similar manner.
The value in use calculations described above, together with sensitivity analysis using reasonable assumptions, indicate ample 
headroom and therefore do not give rise to impairment concerns. Having completed the 2017 impairment reviews of both the 
Feeds and Fuels divisions, no impairments have been identified. Management does not consider that there is any reasonable 
downside scenario which would result in an impairment.

18. Borrowings continued
Invoice discounting advances
Invoice discounting advances at 31 May 2017 were drawn under a committed facility with an expiry date of 31 October 2019 
(2016: 31 October 2019). The availability of invoice discounting facilities is dependent on the level of current trade receivables 
available for refinancing and is subject to a maximum drawdown of £50.0 million (2016: £50.0 million).
The facility is secured by way of a fixed and floating charge against the Group’s trade receivables. Interest is charged at 1.25% 
(2016: 1.25%) per annum above the bank’s base rate.
Invoice discounting advances have been classified according to the maturity date of the longest permitted refinancing. 
Accordingly, all of the invoice discounting advances at 31 May 2017 totalling £9.8 million (2016: £1.4 million) are presented within 
non-current liabilities. Without these committed facilities, all invoice discounting advances would have been classified as current 
liabilities.
The Group incurred non-utilisation fees on its committed invoice discounting facility. Under the renewed terms the Group 
will incur non-utilisation fees only in respect of committed and undrawn facilities of up to £20.0 million (2016: £20.0 million).
Revolving credit facility
At 31 May 2017, the Group has a revolving credit facility of £10.0 million (2016: £10.0 million) with an expiry date of 
31 October 2019 (2016: 31 October 2019). Interest is charged on amounts drawn down at 1.60 – 1.85% per annum above 
LIBOR (2016: 1.60 – 1.85% above LIBOR) depending on the level of net debt to EBITDA.
The amount drawn down under the revolving credit facility at 31 May 2017 is £4.0 million (2016: £10.0 million).
The Group incurs non-utilisation fees on its committed revolving credit facility.
Bank overdrafts
The Group’s net bank overdraft facility at 31 May 2017 is repayable on demand and is subject to a maximum limit of £1.0 million 
(2016: £1.0 million). None of the facility was utilised at 31 May 2017 (2016: £Nil). Interest is charged at 1.5% per annum over the 
bank’s base rate (2016: 1.5% per annum over the bank’s base rate).
Bank guarantee
The Group has a bank guarantee agreement with The Royal Bank of Scotland Group, under which the bank provides a facility 
which allows the Group to request that the bank issue guarantees to third party suppliers for general business purposes. The 
maximum total facility value is £4.0 million but this was not utilised in the year. 
The above facilities are subject to quarterly covenant tests on interest cover and net debt to EBITDA ratios. The covenants have 
been set at levels that provide sufficient headroom and flexibility for the Group until maturity of the facilities in October 2019.
Bank borrowings amounting to £13.8 million (2016: £11.4 million) are secured by way of unscheduled mortgage debentures 
provided by the Company and certain subsidiaries within the Group to The Royal Bank of Scotland Group which incorporate 
a fixed charge over their book debts and floating charges over all their other assets.

19. Financial instruments and risk management
The Group’s financial instruments comprise cash, bank overdrafts, invoice discounting advances, obligations under hire purchase 
agreements, commodity derivatives and various items such as receivables and payables, which arise from its operations. All financial 
instruments in 2017 and 2016 were denominated in Sterling. There is no material foreign exchange risk in respect of these instruments.
The carrying amounts of all of the Group’s financial instruments are measured at amortised cost in the financial statements, with the 
exception of derivative financial instruments. Derivative financial instruments are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value.
IFRS 13 (amended) ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’ requires disclosure of financial instruments measured at fair value, 
grouped into Levels 1 to 3 below, based on the degree to which fair value is observable:
 » Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
 » Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs, other than quoted prices included within Level 1 above, that 
are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and
 » Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that 
are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).
All of the Group’s derivative financial instruments as described on pages 61 and 62 (forward supply contracts) were classified 
as Level 2 in the current and prior year. There were no transfers between levels in either the current and prior year.

Financial risk management
The Group’s operations expose it to a variety of financial risks: price risk; interest rate risk; credit risk; and liquidity risk. Given the 
size of the Group, the Directors have not established a sub-committee of the Board to monitor financial risk management, but 
have established policies that are implemented and monitored by the Executive Directors.
Price risk
The Group is exposed to commodity price risk principally in respect of certain raw materials in its Feeds business and 
oil-related products in the Fuels business. 
The Feeds business enters into forward supply contracts in order to manage the impact of price movements on its gross margin. 
At 31 May 2017 , the Group had open forward supply contracts with a principal value of £42.1 million (31 May 2016: £25.5 million). 
The fair value of forward supply contracts recognised in the balance sheet in accordance with IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments: 
Recognition and Measurement’ is £0.2 million (31 May 2016: £0.2 million). 
The fair value of forward supply contracts is based on generally accepted valuation techniques using inputs from observable 
market data on equivalent instruments at the balance sheet date. The contracts are settled on a gross cash basis and are 
classified as current assets or liabilities, as all contractual cash flows fall due to be settled in less than one year.
The Group has not designated any of these contracts as hedging instruments during the period under review. As a result, 
changes in the fair value of non-hedging forward supply contracts amounting to £Nil have been credited to the income 
statement in the year (2016: £0.1 million). 
The Fuels business’ oil-related products are subject to changes in the world commodity price for crude oil. However, the 
relatively low stockholding maintained and daily price monitoring systems used to determine selling prices enable the business 
to effectively manage the risk of gross margin erosion. Forward supply contracts are not utilised by this business.
The extent of these risks is regularly reviewed and assessed by the Executive Directors and reported back to the Board. This 
process is considered to be effective given the size and nature of the risks involved, but will be reviewed in the future should 
circumstances change. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
62 NWF GROUP plc ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
19. Financial instruments and risk management continued
Financial risk management continued
Interest rate risk
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk due to its floating rate borrowings.
The Directors review the interest rate hedging policy on at least an annual basis. The Group monitors its exposure to interest rate risk 
primarily through sensitivity analysis. On the basis of the Group’s analysis, it is estimated that a rise of one percentage point in interest 
rates on floating rate borrowings would have reduced 2017 profit before taxation by approximately £0.2 million (2016: £0. 1 million).
Credit risk
Where appropriate, relevant credit checks are performed on potential customers before sales are made. The amount of 
exposure to any individual customer is controlled by means of a credit limit that is monitored regularly by management and, in 
the case of a financially material value, by the Executive Directors. In addition, the Fuels business maintains credit insurance for 
certain higher value accounts in order to manage the potential financial loss incurred on certain bad debts. 
Liquidity risk
The Group actively maintains a mixture of medium-term and short-term debt finance, which is designed to ensure that it has 
access to sufficient available funds for ongoing working capital needs as well as planned capital investment and expansion 
generally. The amount of debt finance required is reviewed at least annually by the Directors.
All of the Group’s financial instruments, with the exception of certain borrowings (see note 18), have a contractual maturity of 
less than one year, based on the earliest date on which the contractual cash flows are required to be settled.
Capital risk
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern in order to 
provide returns to shareholders and benefits to other stakeholders, and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the 
cost of capital. In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to 
shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt. 
The Group monitors capital risk on the basis of the net debt/EBITDA ratio. This ratio is calculated as net debt divided by 
earnings before interest, depreciation and amortisation as shown below: 
2017 2016
Borrowings (£m) (note 18) 14.0 11.7
Less: cash at bank and in hand (£m) (1.0) (1.8)
Net debt (£m) 13.0 9.9
Headline EBITDA (£m) (adjusted for exceptional items – see note 5) 13.2 12.6

to satisfying certain performance criteria (see Directors’ Remuneration Report and note 23).
22. Retirement benefit schemes
Defined contribution schemes
The Group operates several defined contribution pension schemes for qualifying employees. The assets of the schemes are 
held separately from those of the Group in funds under the control of trustees. The total cost charged to the income statement 
of £0.8 million (2016: £0.5 million) represents the contributions payable to these schemes by the Group at the rates specified 
in the scheme rules. 
There were no outstanding or prepaid contributions at the balance sheet date (31 May 2016: £Nil).
Defined benefit scheme
The Group operates a defined benefit pension scheme providing benefits based on final pensionable earnings.
NWF Group Benefits Scheme
The scheme is administered by a fund that is legally separated from the Group. The trustees of the pension fund are required 
by law to act in the interest of the fund and of all relevant stakeholders in the scheme. The trustees are responsible for the 
investment policy with regard to the assets of the fund.
The scheme was closed to new members during the year ended 31 May 2002 and closed to future accrual with effect from 
April 2016. A curtailment gain of £1.3 million arose on the closure of the scheme (as active member benefits became linked 
to CPI rather than future salary increases) and was included within exceptional items in the prior year.
The latest full triennial actuarial valuation of this scheme was completed in the year ended 31 May 2015, with a deficit of 
£14.1 million at the valuation date of 31 December 2013. The present value of the defined benefit obligation and the related 
current service cost were measured using the Projected Unit Credit Method. In these financial statements this liability has 
been updated in order to derive the IAS 19R valuation as of 31 May 2017. The next full triennial valuation will be completed 
in the year ending 31 May 2018.
The average duration of the benefit obligation at the balance sheet date is 20 years. The defined benefit obligation includes 
benefits for current employees, former employees and current pensioners. Approximately 49% of the liabilities are attributable 
to current and former employees and 51% to current pensioners.
The Group expects to make total contributions of £1.5 million in the year ending 31 May 2018. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
64 NWF GROUP plc ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
22. Retirement benefit schemes continued
Defined benefit scheme continued
NWF Group Benefits Scheme continued
The scheme typically exposes the Group to actuarial risks such as investment risk, interest rate risk and longevity risk, 
as described below:
 » Investment risk. The present value of the defined benefit scheme liability is calculated using a discount rate determined by 
reference to high quality corporate bond yields. If the return on plan assets is below this rate, it will create a scheme deficit. 
Currently, the scheme has a relatively balanced investment in equities, bonds, property funds and alternatives, cash and 
diversified growth funds. Due to the long-term nature of scheme liabilities, the trustees of the pension fund consider it 
appropriate that a reasonable portion of the scheme assets should be invested in equities, property funds and diversified 
growth funds to leverage the return generated by the fund.
 » Interest risk. A decrease in the bond interest rate will increase the scheme liability but this will be partially offset by an 
increase in the return on the scheme’s bond investments.
 » Longevity risk. The present value of the defined benefit scheme liability is calculated by reference to the best estimate of 
the mortality of the scheme participants both during and after their employment. An increase in the life expectancy of the 
scheme participants will increase the scheme’s liability.
The risk relating to benefits to be paid to dependents of scheme members is re-insured by an external insurance company. 
No other post-retirement benefits are provided to these employees.
The principal actuarial assumptions as at the balance sheet date, used for the purposes of the actuarial valuations, were as follows:
2017

2016

Discount rate 2.60 3.55
Future salary increases n/a n/a
RPI inflation 3.15 2.90

Current pensioners – male life expectancy at age 65 22.0 22.2
Future pensioners currently aged 45 – male life expectancy at age 65 23.4 23.9

of 1.25% (2016: S1PXA with CMI 2015 improvements and a long-term trend rate of 1.25%).

The actual return on scheme assets was a gain of £6.3 million (2016: £0.2 million gain).
Asset-liability matching reviews of the NWF Group Benefits Scheme are performed regularly. The results of reviews are used 
to assist the trustees and the Group to determine the optimal long-term asset allocation with regard to the structure of the 
liabilities of the scheme. They are also used to assist the trustees in managing the underlying volatility inherent in investment 
performance and the risk of a significant increase in the scheme deficit, by providing information used to determine the 
scheme’s investment strategy. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

22. Retirement benefit schemes continued
Defined benefit scheme continued
NWF Group Benefits Scheme continued
The main strategic choices that are formulated in an actuarial and technical policy document of the fund are described below:
 » asset mix is based on 22% equity investments, 21% bond allocation, 40% diversified growth fund and 17% property funds 
and alternative assets;
 » it is the policy of the fund to cover its exposure to the interest rate risk of the defined benefit liability by the use of bond 
investments only. The fund has not used interest rate derivatives to hedge its exposure to interest rate risk in the current 
and prior year; 
 » inflation risk is mitigated by the use of liability-driven investment (‘LDI’) funds. LDI funds are derivative-based investments 
that give leveraged exposures to the bond markets. Within the 21% bond allocation, there is a 15% LDI fund allocation which 
results in approximately 30% exposure to changes in inflation;
 » consideration has been given to using LDI funds to give improved leveraged protection against changes in interest rates. 
However, the current policy is to use LDI funds to hedge inflation risk only, given that the majority of the scheme’s liabilities 
are inflation linked;
 » the fund does not have a material foreign exchange exposure and does not, therefore, use foreign exchange derivatives 
to hedge its foreign exchange risk; and
 » active management is within the diversified growth fund, bond investments, property funds and alternative assets. All equity 
investments are passively managed.
Virtually all equity and bonds have quoted prices in active markets. 
There has been no change in the processes used by the Group to manage its risks from the prior year.
Significant actuarial assumptions for the determination of the defined benefit liability are discount rate, price inflation and 
mortality. The sensitivity analyses shown below have been determined based on reasonably possible changes of the respective 
assumptions occurring at the end of the balance sheet dates, while holding all other assumptions constant.

23. Share-based payments
In the year ended 31 May 2017 , the Group operated one (2016: one) equity-settled share-based payment plan as described below.
The Group recognised total expenses of £Nil in respect of equity-settled share-based payment transactions in the year ended 
31 May 2017 (2016: £0.1 million).
Long-term Incentive Plan (‘the Plan’)
The Group operates a Performance Share Plan for senior executives, further details of which can be found in the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report in the Group financial statements. Under the Plan, the Group has made awards of conditional 
shares, which have yet to be exercised, to certain Directors on 30 September 2015 (vesting date: September 2018) and 
12 August 2016 (vesting date: August 2019). The vesting of these conditional share awards is subject to the Group achieving 
absolute earnings per share targets.
Details of the maximum total number of ordinary shares, which may be issued in future periods in respect of conditional share 
awards outstanding at 31 May 2017 , 31 May 2016, 31 May 2015 and 31 May 2014, are as shown below.

The estimate of the fair value of the services received in return for the conditional share awards is measured based on a 
Black Scholes model. The aggregate of the estimated fair values of the awards at 31 May 2017 shown above is £1.3 million 
(31 May 2016: £1.5 million), before taking into account the likelihood of achieving non-market-based performance conditions.

For awards granted in the current and prior years, the inputs into the Black Scholes model are as follows:

Risk-free interest rate 0.03% 0.69% 1.32% 0.73%
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Group’s share price over the previous three 
years. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the effects of 
non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.

The Group’s bank facilities are provided under an arrangement with The Royal Bank of Scotland Group. The Group has pledged 
security in favour of the bank over certain freehold land and buildings with a carrying value at 31 May 2017 of £23.2 million 
(31 May 2016: £23.9 million). Unscheduled mortgage debentures have also been provided by the Company and certain 
subsidiaries to the bank which incorporate a fixed charge over trade receivables and floating charges over all other assets.
The Group has an arrangement with the bank under which cash balances are offset against borrowings. The Company has 
given a guarantee in respect of the net bank borrowings within the Group under this arrangement amounting to £13.8 million 
at 31 May 2017 (31 May 2016: £11.4 million).
The Group has a bank guarantee agreement with The Royal Bank of Scotland Group, under which the bank provides a facility 
which allows the Group to request that the bank issue guarantees to third party suppliers for general business purposes. 
The maximum total facility value is £4.0 million but this was not utilised in the current or prior year.
The Company and certain subsidiaries have granted a fixed and floating charge in favour of the trustees of a defined benefit 
pension scheme (the NWF Group Benefits Scheme). This security, which is subordinated to the bank, creates a fixed charge 
over certain freehold land and buildings, subject to a maximum value of £5.0 million (31 May 2016: £5.0 million), and a floating 
charge over all other assets.
The Company has also given certain guarantees to third parties in respect of operating lease and supply agreement 
commitments due from various subsidiary companies.
No loss is expected to result from this arrangement. NWF GROUP plc ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 69
OVERVIEW STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION
Report on the Parent Company financial statements
Our opinion
In our opinion, NWF Group plc’s Parent Company financial statements (the ‘financial statements’):
 » give a true and fair view of the state of the Parent Company’s affairs as at 31 May 2017;
 » have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and
 » have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
What we have audited
The financial statements, included within the Annual report and Accounts 2017 (the ‘Annual Report’), comprise:
 » the Parent Company balance sheet as at 31 May 2017;
 » the Parent Company statement of comprehensive income for the year then ended;
 » the Parent Company statement of changes in equity for the year then ended; and
 » the notes to the financial statements, which include a summary of significant accounting policies and other 
explanatory information.
Certain required disclosures have been presented elsewhere in the Annual Report, rather than in the notes to the financial 
statements. These are cross-referenced from the financial statements and are identified as audited.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the financial statements is United Kingdom 
Accounting Standards, comprising FRS 101 ‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’, and applicable law (United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice).
In applying the financial reporting framework, the directors have made a number of subjective judgements, for example 
in respect of significant accounting estimates. In making such estimates, they have made assumptions and considered 
future events.
Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:
 » the information given in the Strategic report and the Directors’ report for the financial year for which the financial 
statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and
 » the Strategic report and the Directors’ report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.
In addition, in light of the knowledge and understanding of the Parent Company and its environment obtained in the 
course of the audit, we are required to report if we have identified any material misstatements in the Strategic report and 
the Directors’ report. We have nothing to report in this respect.
Other matters on which we are required to report by exception
Adequacy of information and explanations received
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
 » we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or
 » adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have 
not been received from branches not visited by us; or
 » the financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns.
We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.
Directors’ remuneration
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, certain disclosures of directors’ 
remuneration specified by law are not made. We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.

Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit
Our responsibilities and those of the directors
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ responsibilities set out on page 36, the directors are responsible for the 
preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view.
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and 
International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) (‘ISAs (UK & Ireland)’). Those standards require us to comply with the 
Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the Parent Company’s members as a body in 
accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these 
opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into 
whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
What an audit of financial statements involves
We conducted our audit in accordance with ISAs (UK & Ireland). An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and 
disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: 
 » whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Parent Company’s circumstances and have been consistently 
applied and adequately disclosed; 
 » the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and 
 » the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
We primarily focus our work in these areas by assessing the directors’ judgements against available evidence, forming our own 
judgements, and evaluating the disclosures in the financial statements.
We test and examine information, using sampling and other auditing techniques, to the extent we consider necessary to 
provide a reasonable basis for us to draw conclusions. We obtain audit evidence through testing the effectiveness of 
controls, substantive procedures or a combination of both. 
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report to identify material inconsistencies with 
the audited financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially 
inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent 
material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report. With respect to the Strategic report 
and Directors’ report, we consider whether those reports include the disclosures required by applicable legal requirements.
Other matter
We have reported separately on the group financial statements of NWF Group plc for the year ended 31 May 2017.

PARENT COMPANY STATEMENT OF CHANGES IN EQUITY
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MAY 2017 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
74 NWF GROUP plc ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
1. Significant accounting policies
Basis of preparation
The separate financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 
‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’ (‘FRS 101’), on the going concern basis and under the historical cost convention modified 
for fair values, and in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and applicable Accounting Standards in the UK. Effective 
1 June 2014 the Company transitioned from previously applicable UK Generally Accepted Accounting Principles to FRS 101. 
The principal accounting policies, which have been applied consistently to all the years presented, are set out below.
These financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with the reduced disclosure 
framework for all years presented.
The following exemptions from the requirements of IFRS have been applied in the preparation of these financial statements, 
in accordance with FRS 101:
 » the following paragraphs of IAS 1 ‘Presentation of Financial Statements’:
 » 10(d) (statement of cash flows);
 » 16 (statement of compliance with all IFRS);
 » 11 (cash flow statement information); and
 » 134 – 136 (capital management disclosures);
 » IFRS 7 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’;
 » IAS 7 ‘Statement of Cash Flows’;
 » IAS 24 (paragraphs 17 and 18a) ‘Related Party Disclosures’ (key management compensation); and
 » IAS 24 ‘Related Party Disclosures’ – the requirement to disclose related party transactions between two or more 
members of a group.
As the Group financial statements include the equivalent disclosures, the Company has taken the exemptions available under 
FRS 101 in respect of the following disclosures:
 » IFRS 2 ‘Share-based Payments’ in respect of Group settled equity share-based payments; and
 » certain disclosures required by IFRS 13 ‘Fair Value Measurement’ and disclosures required by IFRS 7 ‘Financial 
Instruments: Disclosures’.
Parent Company profit and loss account
The Company has not presented its own profit and loss account as permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006. 
The Company’s profit for the year was £8.6 million including dividends received (2016: £19.2 million). The profit for the year is 
shown in the statement of changes in equity and on the face of the balance sheet. There are no material differences between 
the profit for the year in the current and prior year and its historical cost equivalent. Accordingly, no note of historical cost 
profits and losses has been presented.
Dividend distribution
The distribution of a dividend to the Company’s shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Company’s financial 
statements in the period in which it is approved by the Company’s shareholders.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Cost includes the original purchase price of the asset and the costs 
attributable to bringing the asset to its working condition for its intended use. Depreciation is calculated to write off the 
cost of property, plant and equipment over their useful economic life on a straight-line basis as follows:
Freehold buildings  10 – 50 years
Plant and machinery 3 – 10 years
Freehold land is not depreciated. Assets under construction are not depreciated until they are put into use.
Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the construction of qualifying assets are capitalised.
Investment properties
Owner-occupied land and buildings owned by the Company and which are rented to subsidiary companies are treated 
as investment properties in accordance with IAS 40 ‘Investment Property’. Investment properties are valued using the 
cost model. Investment properties are stated at cost, which includes the original purchase price of the asset and the 
costs attributable to bringing the asset to its working condition for its intended use. Depreciation is calculated to write 
off the cost of the investment property over its useful economic life on a straight-line basis over 10 – 50 years.
NOTES TO THE PARENT COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MAY 2017 NWF GROUP plc ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 75
OVERVIEW STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION
1. Significant accounting policies continued
Investment in subsidiary undertakings
Investments in Group undertakings are stated at cost, unless their value has been impaired in which case they are valued 
at the lower of their realisable value or value in use.
Deferred taxation
Deferred taxation is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet 
date where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the 
future have occurred at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax assets are regarded as recoverable and recognised in the financial statements when, on the basis of available 
evidence, it is more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the timing 
differences can be deducted. The recoverability of tax losses is assessed by reference to forecasts which have been 
prepared and approved by the Board. The deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is 
probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and the amount has been reliably estimated. 
Provisions are not recognised for future operating losses.
Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables are recognised initially at fair value less provision for impairment. Subsequent to initial 
recognition, receivables are measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest method.
A provision for impairment is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all 
amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables. The amount of the provision is charged to the income 
statement within administrative expenses.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks and bank overdrafts. Bank overdrafts 
are shown within borrowings in current liabilities on the balance sheet.
Trade and other payables
Trade and other payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the 
effective interest method.
Retirement benefit costs
The Company operates various pension schemes, including defined contribution and defined benefit schemes.
Defined contribution schemes
For defined contribution schemes, the Group pays contributions to publicly or privately administered pension insurance 
schemes on a mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis. The contributions are recognised as an employee benefit expense 
in the income statement when they are due. 
Defined benefit scheme
The Company is the sponsoring employer in a funded Group-operated defined benefit pension scheme, the NWF Group 
Benefits Scheme, and has therefore recognised the defined liability, in full, on the Company balance sheet.
The liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect of defined benefit schemes is the present value of the defined benefit 
obligation at the balance sheet date less the fair value of scheme assets, together with adjustments for unrecognised actuarial 
gains or losses and past service costs. The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the 
Projected Unit Credit Method. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated 
future cash outflows using interest rates of high quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the 
benefits will be paid and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension liability.
The net pension finance cost is determined by applying the discount rate, used to measure the defined benefit pension obligation 
at the beginning of the accounting period, to the net pension obligation at the beginning of the accounting period taking into 
account any changes in the net pension obligation during the period as a result of cash contributions and benefit payments. 
Pension scheme expenses are charged to the income statement within administrative expenses.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised immediately in the statement of comprehensive income. Net defined benefit 
pension scheme deficits before tax relief are presented separately on the balance sheet within non-current liabilities. 
The attributable deferred income tax asset is included within the deferred income tax asset in the balance sheet and 
is subject to the recognition criteria as set out in the accounting policy on deferred income tax.
Share-based payments
In the year ended 31 May 2017, the Company operated one (2016: one) equity-settled share-based payment plan. 
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value (excluding the effect of non-market-based vesting 
conditions) at the date of grant.  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
76 NWF GROUP plc ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
1. Significant accounting policies continued
Share-based payments continued
The fair value determined at the grant date of equity-settled share-based payments issued to the Company’s employees 
is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Company’s estimate of shares that will eventually 
vest and adjusted for the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions.
The fair value determined at the grant date of equity-settled share-based payments issued to employees of subsidiary 
undertakings is recognised as an addition to the cost of investment in subsidiary undertakings on a straight-line basis over 
the vesting period, based on the Company’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest and adjusted for the effect of non-
market-based vesting conditions.
Fair value is measured by the use of a Black Scholes model. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based 
on management’s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
Employer social security contributions payable in connection with the grant of share awards are considered an integral part 
of the grant itself and the charge is treated as a cash-settled transaction.
Share capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares are shown in equity 
as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds of issue.
Critical accounting estimates
The critical accounting estimates set out in the Group financial statements also apply to the Company.

5.  CREST members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies through the CREST electronic proxy appointment service may do 
so for the Annual General Meeting to be held at 10.30 a.m. on 28 September 2017 and any adjournment(s) thereof by using 
the procedures described in the CREST Manual. CREST personal members or other CREST sponsored members, and 
those CREST members who have appointed a voting service provider, should refer to their CREST sponsors or voting 
service provider(s), who will be able to take the appropriate action on their behalf. 
  In order for a proxy appointment or instruction made by means of CREST to be valid, the appropriate CREST message (‘a 
CREST Proxy Instruction’) must be properly authenticated in accordance with Euroclear UK & Ireland Limited’s specifications 
and must contain the information required for such instructions, as described in the CREST Manual. The message must be 
transmitted so as to be received by the Company’s agent, Capita Asset Services (CREST Participant ID: RA10), no later than 
48 hours before the time appointed for the Meeting. For this purpose, the time of receipt will be taken to be the time (as 
determined by the time stamp applied to the message by the CREST Applications Host) from which the Company’s agent is 
able to retrieve the message by enquiry to CREST in the manner prescribed by CREST. 
  CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsor or voting service provider should note that Euroclear UK & 
Ireland Limited does not make available special procedures in CREST for any particular messages. Normal system timings 
and limitations will therefore apply in relation to the input of CREST Proxy Instructions. It is the responsibility of the CREST 
member concerned to take (or, if the CREST member is a CREST personal member or sponsored member or has appointed 
a voting service provider, to procure that his CREST sponsor or voting service provider takes) such action as shall be 
necessary to ensure that a message is transmitted by means of the CREST system by any particular time. In this connection, 
CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsor or voting service provider are referred in particular to those 
sections of the CREST Manual concerning practical limitations of the CREST system and timings.

Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001.
6.  You may appoint more than one proxy provided each proxy is appointed to exercise rights attached to different shares. 
In the event of a conflict between a blank form of proxy and a form of proxy which states the number of shares to which 
it applies, the specific form of proxy shall be counted first, regardless of whether it was sent or received before or after the 
blank form of proxy, and any remaining shares in respect of which you are the registered holder will be apportioned to the 
blank form of proxy. You may not appoint more than one proxy to exercise rights attached to any one share. To appoint 
more than one proxy, you should contact Capita Asset Services, PXS, The Registry, 34 Beckenham Road, Beckenham, 
Kent BR3 4TU.
7.  Any corporation which is a member can appoint one or more corporate representatives who may exercise on its behalf 
all of its powers as a member provided that they do not do so in relation to the same shares.

business on 1 August 2017. As at close of business on 1 August 2017 the Company did not hold any treasury shares.
Paragraph 6.2 of Resolution 6 will, if passed, authorise the Directors to allot unissued shares in connection with a rights issue 
in favour of holders of equity securities (which would include ordinary shareholders) as required by the rights of those securities 
or as the Directors may otherwise consider necessary, up to a maximum aggregate nominal amount of £8,107 ,437 which 
represents an amount which is equal to two-thirds of the aggregate nominal value of the issued and unconditionally allotted 
ordinary share capital of the Company as it was at close of business on 1 August 2017 (such amount to be reduced by the 
nominal amount of any relevant securities issued under the authority conferred by paragraph 6.1 of Resolution 6). 
The authorities sought in Resolution 6 are in substitution for all existing authorities, granted in the Company’s Articles of 
Association or otherwise, and without prejudice to previous allotments made under such existing authorities. The authorities will 
each expire 15 months after the date of the Annual General Meeting or, if earlier, at the conclusion of the next Annual General 
Meeting of the Company. The Directors have no present intention of exercising these authorities but believe that it is in the best 
interests of the Company to have the authorities available so that the Board has the flexibility to take advantage of business 
opportunities as they arise.
Resolution 7 – disapplication of pre-emption rights (Special Resolution)
Resolution 7 , which will be proposed as a Special Resolution, seeks to renew the authority conferred on the Directors at last 
year’s Annual General Meeting to issue equity securities of the Company for cash without application of the pre-emption rights 
provided by Section 561 of the Act. The authority being sought provides for non-pre-emptive allotments of equity securities: 
(i) to ordinary shareholders in proportion to their existing shareholdings; (ii) to holders of other equity securities as required by, 
or subject to (as the Directors consider necessary), the rights of those securities, and to deal with treasury shares, fractional 
entitlements and legal and practical problems in any territory, for example on a rights issue or other similar share issue; and 
(iii) for cash up to an aggregate nominal value of £608,058 which represents 5% of the issued ordinary share capital of the 
Company as it was at close of business on 2 August 2017 . The authority being sought is in substitution for all existing authorities, 
granted in the Company’s Articles of Association or otherwise, and without prejudice to previous allotments made under such 
authorities and will expire 15 months after the date of the Annual General Meeting or, if earlier, at the conclusion of the next 
Annual General Meeting of the Company. The Directors have no present intention of exercising these authorities but believe that 
it is in the best interests of the Company to have the authorities available so that the Board has the flexibility to take advantage 
of business opportunities as they arise.
The authority sought and the limits set by this resolution will also disapply the application of Section 561 of the Act from a sale 
of treasury shares to the extent also specified in this resolution.
