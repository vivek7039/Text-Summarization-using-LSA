know-how to give our partners first-mover advantage.
Our enterprise 
Technology platform
The GameSTACK™ IGS is a highly evolved 
enterprise software platform developed over 
16 years and capable of deploying real money

Gaming™ and diverse forms of monetised 
casual gaming. Unique in the B2B iGaming 
landscape, this single enterprise software 
system is capable of providing these three 
relevant gaming business models to major 
casino operators world-wide. In the context 
of real money Regulated Gaming, the 
GameSTACK™ IGS is technically compliant 
with some of the most challenging regulatory 
environments in the world, including Italy, the 
United Kingdom, Alderney and New Jersey, 
giving our current and potential partners 
comfort that GAN can seamlessly deliver 
their business online. 
Operating a software-as-a-service (SaaS) 
model, GAN continually maintains, develops

Our partners and clients
Operators
The GAN family of partners represents leading 
US Internet gaming groups, both online and 
offline. In the US, we have grown our client base 
to include 13 large-scale bricks and mortar 
operators and one dedicated online partner, 
which contracted with GAN for our ability to 
deliver real money Internet gaming and social 
gaming from the same core technology stack 
as well as provide dedicated services pre and 
post-product launch. Today, the GAN family of 
partners represents tens of thousands of slot 
machine units on their floors, and millions of 
dedicated loyalty club card holding players 
within their databases. With the continued 
success of Simulated Gaming™ and real money 
gaming key performance indicators, GAN 
was able to launch partnerships with Station 
Casinos out of Las Vegas, The Chickasaw 
Nation of Oklahoma, Turning Stone Resort of 
New York and Ocean Resort Casino in Atlantic 
City (formerly known as ‘Revel Casino’). 
Content partners
In addition to securing material partnerships  
in the US casino landscape, GAN has assembled 
a wide range of relationships with collaborating 
casino equipment manufacturers seeking to 
bring their machine-based slot games online 
and distribute them across the US and into 
selected regulated markets internationally. 
With over eight years of experience in bringing 
best-in-class manufacturers from the offline 
space into the online space, GAN has become a 
preferred partner in the development of gaming 
intellectual property (IP) for online play.
Third party
Beyond content, GAN has brought together 
world-leading service providers spanning 
payment processing, pre-paid card services, age 
and identity verification, and fraud detection. 
GAN enjoys a strong, positive reputation 
for technical competence, and the category 
partners which support the GameSTACK™ 
IGS as a turnkey ecosystem are critical to that 
success. The wide-ranging capability of GAN’s 
technical development and operations team, 
together with the underlying technical capability 
of the enterprise software platform, has 
enabled us to secure and develop relationships 
within gaming around the globe.

GAN PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 3 MARKET REVIEW
Real money regulated intra-State Internet gaming in the US 
remains focused on New Jersey’s fast-growing market and  
the new Pennsylvania market, which in October 2017 ended 
the four-year wait for incremental US States to legalise Internet 
gaming. Simulated Gaming™ continued to mature as the  
market-leading model adopted by major US casinos in advance  
of (and in addition to) regulated real money Internet gaming.
Regulated US Internet gaming
In 2017 there were approximately 940 
land-based casinos in the US located in 39 
States. The aggregate economic benefit to 
the US economy directly related to gaming is 
estimated to be over $240bn. In contrast, only 
three US States permitted Internet gaming, 
of which the State of New Jersey accounted 
for $246m – the overwhelming majority of 
US Internet gaming in 2017.
2017 was New Jersey’s fourth full year of 
Internet gaming and that State’s Internet 
gaming market grew more than 24% year- 
on-year compared with New Jersey’s seven 
land-based casinos that together saw static 
retail gaming revenues in the same period of 
$2.4bn. Accordingly, New Jersey’s $246m in 
Internet gaming revenues represented 10%  
of New Jersey land-based gaming revenues 
generated in the same year.
By way of reminder, in 2013 the first three  
US States regulated intra-State real money 
Internet gaming permitted within their State’s 
borders: Nevada (pop. <3m); Delaware (pop. 
<1m); and New Jersey (pop. 9m). In October 
2017, Pennsylvania (pop. 12.8m) passed 
legislation legalising Internet gaming, ending  
a four-year wait for another US State to 
regulate Internet gaming. In several other  
US States, legislation designed to regulate 
Internet gaming continued through the 
complicated legislative process in 2017. 
There are six US States actively considering 
regulation of intra-State Internet gaming: 
West Virginia, Illinois, Connecticut, New 
York, Massachusetts, and Michigan.
The ‘next State to regulate’ is generally believed 
by industry observers to be the State of 
Michigan (pop. 9.9m), which has a substantial 
existing land-based casino industry comprising 
three commercial casinos in Detroit and several 
Native American casinos.
Michigan made significant progress towards 
regulation of Internet gaming through the 
course of 2017, with a comprehensive bill 
appearing in the Michigan House of 
Representatives for active voting on various 
proposed amendments in Spring of 2018.  
If this legislation is enacted in the future, 
residents of Michigan will be permitted to play 
casino games online for real money in a similar 
manner to both New Jersey and Pennsylvania.

STRATEGIC REPORT

leading product: high-margin revenue 
stream generated online from existing 
customer database; attracts new 
customer demographics; re-activates 
long-term lapsed customers; improves 
frequency of customers’ visitation 
to the casino; and increases gaming 
revenue generated inside the casino 
from existing customers.
Social casino gaming
In the meantime, for the 900+ US casinos 
which do not sit within those four regulated 
US States or those six US States actively 
considering regulation, an alternative Internet 
gaming business model is required. Social 
casino gaming is the obvious alternative 
market, where end-user consumers buy  
time online for the entertainment value of 
playing casino games, without receiving the 
opportunity to win real money. The top  
three countries for social casino gaming 
are the US, Canada and Australia where in 
all cases real money Internet gaming is  
not permitted nationwide.
The global social casino gaming market reached 
$4bn in 2017 with $3bn generated from 
US-resident players. GAN’s Simulated Gaming™ 
enterprise solution is specifically designed for 
US casino operators seeking to enter the social 
casino gaming market. In the absence of real 
money regulated Internet gaming, social casino 
gaming has emerged as an alternative business 
model serving the latent demand for a 
high-quality Internet gaming experience.
Traditional casino operators that wish  
to participate in the social casino market 
generally have three options for market entry: 
• build their own technology; 
• acquire an existing social casino operator; or 
• adopt an enterprise software solution from 
a third party provider such as GAN.

Q&A with a US stakeholder
Alec Driscoll, the Interactive Director 
of American Casino & Entertainment 
Properties, LLC (ACEP) in 2017, 
spoke to GAN about the uplift of 
on-property visitation experienced 
in their ‘locals’ casino properties in 
Nevada throughout 2016 and the 
majority of 2017.
Q. What was the principal financial benefit  
to ACEP in operating Simulated Gaming
TM
?
A. The incremental share of our customers’ wallet 
online was valuable, but of more value was the 
significant level of engagement by our higher-value 
customers of bricks and mortar gaming, who increased 
their visitation to our ‘locals’ casino properties in 
Nevada as a result of engaging with GAN’s Simulated 
Gaming
TM
 online experience.
Q. What factors influenced your decision 
to work with GAN?
A. GAN was the only firm that had material traction 
across the country and was the only solution that  
we reviewed that had a full suite of front end games 
accompanied with back office business processes –
GAN had the only full solution out there and  
arguably remains so for social casino gaming.

A culture of innovation
Dear shareholders
During the course of 2017 the Group expanded 
its market share in the US, our key geographic 
market, by launching additional US land-based 
casinos as clients of either virtual currency-
based Simulated Gaming
TM
 or traditional real 
money regulated gaming conducted on an 
intra-State basis. In April 2017 the Group 
announced that it had successfully issued its 
first convertible loan note as a public company, 
raising gross proceeds of £2.0m in loan capital 
to continue expansion of real money regulated 
gaming and Simulated Gaming™ opportunities 
in the US, and for working capital and general 
business development purposes.
As has been widely reported, regulated  
real money Internet gaming in New Jersey  
has been growing strongly. Our Group has 
executed well in delivering operationally  
for Paddy Power Betfair plc in New Jersey, 
earning a well-deserved reputation in the  
US for technical competence, reflecting  
the reputation already hard earned in  
Europe’s toughest regulated Internet gaming 
markets. This reputation has translated  
into additional business secured in  
February 2017 for GAN in New Jersey  
with a major land-based New Jersey  
operator Ocean Resort Casino (formerly  
known as ‘Revel Casino’) nominating GAN as  
the future platform for regulated real money 
Internet gaming commencing in 2018.
GAN has become synonymous 
for quality and commitment 
to delivering the right solution 
for bricks and mortar US casino 
operators to move their retail 
business online.

Pennsylvania surprised the industry by 
legislating for major gaming expansion  
in Autumn 2017, including the regulation  
of real money Internet gaming which will  
now commence in Pennsylvania in 2018.  
The Group has long served the largest  
single casino operator in Pennsylvania,  
Parx Casino
®
 and looks forward to  
launching its real money Internet  
gaming business, subject to licensing.
Your Board of directors believes there  
is a significant opportunity for Simulated 
Gaming™ in the US. It has outperformed  
initial expectations and has become the 
centrepiece of the Group’s growth strategy.  
We commercially launched five US casino 
clients throughout the year. Outside the US, 
the Group extended its services agreement 
with a consortium of land-based gaming clubs 
in Queensland, Australia as clients of Simulated 
Gaming™ which is a market sharing many 
regulatory similarities to the US when it comes 
to Internet gaming.
We are excited about the prospects for 
Simulated Gaming™ and the performance we 
have achieved since its initial launch together 
with the increasingly compelling business  
case that Simulated Gaming™, suitably 
integrated with land-based casino operators’ 
loyalty programmes, greatly supports our 
clients’ core business of on-property real 
money gaming. We are also confident in the 
long-term potential for real money regulated 
gaming, and Pennsylvania’s recent adoption

of legislation enabling Internet gaming  
may prove to be a significant catalyst

Our consistent progress in 2017, with our  
core products of Simulated Gaming™ and 
regulated gaming in sustainable markets, in 
what was a year of continued investment for 
GAN as we developed both our real money 
regulated gaming and Simulated Gaming 
offering, would not have been possible without 
the dedicated and talented staff employed by 
the Group in London, Sofia and throughout the 
US. I thank them for their continued efforts 
and believe the Group has become established 
as a major Internet gaming technology, 
infrastructure and services provider to 
land-based casinos in the US, consistent with 
the strategy set out during the Group’s Initial 
Public Offering completed in November 2013.
After a multi-year period of necessary 
investment, GAN has now established 
itself as a significant and highly credible 
Internet gaming technology provider to 
the US casino industry.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  |  GOVERNANCE  |  STRATEGIC REPORT
GAN PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 9 CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S REVIEW
Focused on growing recurring revenues
Dear shareholders
Overview
GAN is successfully established as a leading 
provider of enterprise-level Internet gaming 
technology solutions to major US casino 
operators securing significant US market share. 
2017 was our fourth year of continued and 
necessary substantial investment, opening the 
Group to major commercial opportunities, 
including Ocean Resort Casino, our second 
client for real money regulated gaming in 
New Jersey, and The Chickasaw Nation for 
Simulated Gaming™ and its Overseas Internet 
Casino WinStar.com, both expected to deliver 
shareholder value future years.
Substantial continued investment has been 
made in the US operational structure to 
develop the Group’s US presence in both the  
real money regulated gaming and Simulated 
Gaming™ markets. In the UK and Bulgaria 
further substantial investment has been  
made in the Group’s software technology  
and its capability to deliver both Simulated 
Gaming™ and real money regulated gaming  
to US casino operators, integrated with the  
US casino operators’ existing land-based 
loyalty programme.
Intra-State regulation of real money Internet 
gaming re-started with Pennsylvania passing 
legislation in October 2017 to permit Internet 
gaming, nearly four years after New Jersey’s 
Internet gaming market commenced. 
Legislative actions also occurred in several 
other US States in 2017, which suggests the 
State-by-State regulation of Internet gaming 
may progress further in the US during the 
course of 2018. In the meantime, Simulated 
Gaming™ continued to materially outperform 
initial expectations and is positioned for 
significant profitable growth in 2018.
During the year the Group launched Simulated 
Gaming™ for five major US casinos located in 
the States of New York, New Jersey, Oklahoma 
and Nevada and signed an additional landmark 
deal with Ocean Resort Casino, a major casino 
property in Atlantic City, formerly known as 
‘Revel Casino’, which is expected to re-open 
as a casino in 2018 with a simultaneous 
launch of GAN’s Internet casino integrated 
with the on-property rewards programme in 
reliance on GAN’s US-patented convergence  
iBridge Framework™.
A multi-year extension for Simulated Gaming™ 
was agreed during the year with a consortium 
of casino operators in Queensland, Australia 
which have been operating Simulated Gaming™ 
focused on Australia since 2015. GAN and  
its clients stand to benefit from potential 
regulation of real money Internet gaming 
which, since September 2017, became 
effectively prohibited as Australian gaming 
legislation was updated to criminalise the 
long-standing activities of offshore Internet 
gaming operators. While other international 
opportunities are being developed the Group’s 
strategic focus remained firmly on the US 
market throughout 2017, emphasised by the 
relocation of selected key personnel from the 
UK to the US in order to better support the 
Group’s activity in its key geographic market.
In New Jersey, the Group delivered strongly  
for Betfair’s regulated Internet casino  
gaming website delivering over 100 
incremental games across desktop and mobile 
devices and consolidating BetfairCasino.com  
as a leading Internet casino operator in New 
Jersey’s regulated Internet gaming market.  
I would like to take this opportunity to thank 
staff at GAN, the regulators at the New Jersey 
Division of Gaming Enforcement, the 
management of Betfair’s New Jersey 
operations and the operational management  
of Golden Nugget Atlantic City for all their 
support during 2017.
GAN’s enterprise-level technology platform 
for Internet gaming is a scarce asset, managed 
by a team of experienced specialists managing 
one of a handful of fast-growing real money 
regulated gaming businesses in New Jersey. 
Real money regulated gaming in New Jersey 
has proved materially different in both general 
practice and specialist technical requirements 
when compared with European markets. This 
positions GAN to capture significant market 
share in any incremental US intra-State 
markets which may regulate Internet gaming 
over time, including Pennsylvania, New York 
and Michigan.
Navigating GAN back to 
positive clean EBITDA in 
2017, after a multi-year 
investment cycle, has proved 
to be a marathon of shared 
achievement of which directors, 
employees and shareholders 
can all be proud.

During the year, the Group achieved strong 
financial growth in recurring net revenues 
derived from the US and the regulated Italian 
market driven primarily by Simulated Gaming™ 
nationwide across the US and from regulated 
real money Internet gaming in both New Jersey 
and Italy. Overall net revenue grew by 17% to 
£9.1m (2016: £7.8m).

strategic priority for the Group with requisite 
increases in US infrastructure centred on Las 
Vegas comprising principally human resource 
and licensing investment in relevant US States, 
including New Jersey and Pennsylvania.
Aligned with the significant growth 
experienced in New Jersey’s real money 
Internet gaming market the Group increased 
its focus on real money Internet gaming 
product development, enhancements and 
optimisations while continuing to roll out 
additional new clients and product features  
for Simulated Gaming™. The continued 
contribution of Simulated Gaming™ to our net 
revenue growth in 2017 supports the Group’s 
internal focus on the US in delivering both  
real money Internet gaming and Simulated 
Gaming™ to as many major US casino 
properties as possible. Furthermore, the Group 
has received indications from collaborating 
clients that GAN’s unique Simulated Gaming™ 
platform has materially increased patrons’ 
visitation on-property, re-activated significant 
numbers of long-term inactive patrons and 
generally proved highly supportive of 
on-property real money land-based gaming.
The Group continues to pursue further 
Internet gaming platform sales discussions 
with casino equipment manufacturers in  
order to enable land-based casino slot 
manufacturers to manage the distribution  
of their content online. The slow pace of 
incremental regulation of Internet gaming in 
the US has materially contributed to ongoing 
delays in securing an Internet gaming platform 
sale and with the re-commencement of the 
regulatory cycle it appears possible that 
demand for a system sale may return, over time.
Investment in the Group’s technical capability 
in key areas such as back office, mobile  
and convergence with land-based casino 
management systems continued throughout 
2017 with significant continued growth of  
the Group’s mobile gaming portfolio in both 
HTML5 and native iOS and Android applications.
In Europe, the Group extended its market 
position in Italy with new clients integrated 
including Intralot Italia, together with new 
content portfolios delivered via the Group’s 
technical platform. Italy remains a crucial 
market for GAN as a comprehensively 
regulated Internet gaming market exhibiting 
continued organic growth throughout 2017 
as a result of the regulation of Internet casino 
slots gaming in 2013.
Products
The Group’s back office system iSight Back 
Office™ received continuing upgrades released 
throughout 2017 delivering a state-of-the-art 
back office player management capability  
with unique convergence features designed  
to complement a land-based casino’s existing 
gaming operations.
The product-related capabilities of Simulated 
Gaming™ took major strides in 2017 with a 
focus on monetisation of players and the 
introduction of gaming activity accelerants 
designed to extend player lifetimes, increase 
frequency of purchases and drive increased 
visitation to the US casino operators’ land-
based properties. Social gaming features 
including daily bonusing wheels, leaderboards, 
real time competition slot tournaments and 
experience points all launched in 2017, 
resulting in a significant increase in both 
monetisation and stickiness.
“Expansion  
in the US remains  
a continuing  
strategic priority 
for the Group.”
Dermot Smurfit, Chief Executive Officer
In 2017 the Group’s research and development 
function developed a comprehensive  
machine learning framework for delivering 
predictive analytics to clients for both real 
money Internet gaming and Simulated 
Gaming™. Analytics form a critical support  
for marketers in identifying high-value 
customers and maximising lifetime values  
and these capabilities have greatly enhanced  
the analytics tools already available within  
iSight Back Office™ as well as the efficiency  
of marketers using these tools daily to drive 
their respective businesses.
Marketing and support services
Throughout 2017, the Group continued  
to invest in establishing a wide range of 
secondary and tertiary services for US  
land-based casino clients designed to support 
the land-based casino operator in managing 
customers and growing through external user 
acquisition marketing and internal cross-sell 
marketing to existing patron databases and 
on-property traffic.
Marketing and support services remain a 
crucial component of the Group’s service 
portfolio, ensuring any land-based casino 
operator can cost-effectively launch a turnkey 
managed Internet gaming service and grow  
an online community extending beyond its 
existing audience of casino patrons.

platform comprising proprietary 
enterprise level software, hardware, 
and integrated components such 
as iSight Back Office™, SENSE3™ Mobile,

GAN’s open platform has undergone significant technical 
developments in the last three years, providing our partners

providers – with a technical ecosystem that has been 
awarded by EGR’s (North America) peer-juried Casino

GAN is licensed in various jurisdictions around the world 
and appreciates the role of regulation in the real money 
online space. GAN’s clean probity record enabled us to gain 
entry into the New Jersey market in 2013 and receive our 
full Casino Service Industry Enterprise licence in 2017,

hesitated to attempt market entry.

at the highest levels of probity to ensure successful long-term operations  
for all involved.

REAL MONEY GAMING
In the US, the standard European rulebook for Internet gaming 
was replaced with a brand new set of requirements, tools and 
capabilities. Very few companies in the global gaming industry  
have the experience, capability and track record in the US that 
GAN offers to clients, representing significant shareholder value.
When a US casino needs to move online, there 
is a very small group of potential technology 
vendors available to serve their needs, and 
an even smaller subset of companies which 
are B2B only and fully licensed for US Internet 
gaming. GAN is one of those very few 
companies, and the Company’s technical 
systems, operational know-how and proven 
track record of excellence represent a 
substantial competitive barrier to entry 
together with the Company’s strategic US 
Patent governing the all-important linkage 
of an Internet gaming account with an 
on-property rewards account. These are some 
of the reasons driving Ocean Resort Casino’s 
choice to nominate GAN as their partner for 
Internet gaming in early 2017, leveraging the 
Company’s proven successful track record in 
delivering material market share in New Jersey 
for one of the world’s largest Internet sports 
betting and gaming companies, Paddy Power 
Betfair. Ocean Resort Casino becomes GAN’s 
second client in New Jersey and the Company’s 
first land-based casino in New Jersey as well  
as the 14th US casino operator to license the 
Company’s strategic US Patent in order to link 
their on-property rewards programme to  
their forthcoming GAN-powered online  
gaming experience. 
In 2017 GAN focused internal resources  
on delivering optimisations to real money  
US Internet gaming geolocation tracking, 
Know- Your-Customer (KYC) processes and  
its market-leading US payments platform in 
order to deliver arguably the most efficient 
Internet traffic ‘funnel’ to Paddy Power 
Betfair in the US and increase the efficiency 
of its substantial marketing investments.  
This focus on optimisations, combined with  
a substantial commitment to delivering more 
games, gaming features and excellence in 
technical operations, has further developed 
GAN’s position in the fast-growing Internet 
gaming market of New Jersey. 
Real money Internet gaming expertise lies  
at the centre of GAN’s professional approach  
to deliver enterprise gaming solutions to  
clients in the US, and throughout 2017 this 
increased in importance as Pennsylvania’s 
rapid regulation in Autumn/Fall 2017 signalled 
the re commencement of the US regulatory  
cycle for Internet gaming.

SIMULATED GAMING
TM
Launched in 2014, Simulated Gaming™ accelerated in 2017  
with the launch of multiple major casino operators in diverse  
new regional gaming markets. Simulated Gaming™ remains  
one of the most exciting business opportunities available  
to GAN and its clients.
Simulated Gaming™ is a deliberate service name 
for GAN’s B2B social casino solution custom 
designed for US casino operators seeking to 
bring their retail brand online and create a new 
Internet gaming experience delivered as an 
amenity to their patrons and leveraging their 
on-property rewards programme. 
Furthermore, by launching Simulated Gaming™ 
GAN’s clients have the ability to engage with 
new demographics of potential customers with 
a view to engaging them online first and, over 
time, presenting those online customers with 
a range of incentives to bring them to their 
retail casino. No B2B vendor of social casino 
gaming in the US has more experience than 
GAN in supporting this macro business 
objective, shared by all the Company’s clients 
of Simulated Gaming™. GAN pioneered the 
Simulated Gaming™ model in January 2014 
and has accumulated an extraordinary depth of 
knowledge on US casino patrons, their gaming 
proclivities and behaviours and how best to drive 
them from the online to retail channels.
From a technical perspective, Simulated 
Gaming™ sits within and is powered by 
the same technology that enables clients  
to launch a real money Internet gaming 
experience. In fact, many of the new gaming 
features are developed by GAN first for 
Simulated Gaming™, trialled online, optimised 
and subsequently made available for clients 
using GAN’s same technology to power their 
real money Internet gaming business. This 
illustrates the conjoined nature of Simulated 
Gaming™ with real money Internet gaming and 
how GAN’s focus on Simulated Gaming™ also 
benefits clients of real money Internet gaming.

requirements and new regulation 
pending in US online gaming. 
Programme Director Michael Endres 
explains how GAN stays ahead of

Q. How does GAN personalise the

A. For some time GAN’s data systems  
and internal processes have locked down 
information with auditing capabilities to monitor 
and report on anything suspect. Alongside this 
we are developing our integrations and services 
to be as anonymous as possible externally, 
with no single identifying datum from GAN. 
Q. What is GAN’s strategy for  
product delivery? 
A. We approach it through a clear strategy.  
We have automated code change deployment, 
added event-triggered player interactions  
and built a new mailer service. The strategy: 
agnostic technology, custom styling.

Growth and investment
Summary
Revenue has continued to grow in 2017 
alongside which the Group has further 
developed its programme of necessary 
investment and development for the future. 
The Group has made further inroads into  
the US market, executing against our strategy 
to broaden our geographic footprint through 
the addition of casino operators in key States 
in advance of regulation. In Italy the Group 
continues to strengthen its market position 
through the distribution of additional content 
and full-year revenues from clients launched  
in the prior period. 
The Group has built upon its significant 
coast-to-coast presence in the US market in 
order to drive additional growth. The Group  
entered 2017 with nine Casino operators  
in the US and Australia and added a further five 
operators in the first half of the year. Launches 
of Winstar World Resort & Casino, MGM’s 
The Borgata, Oneida Nation’s Turning Stone 
Casino, Ocean Resort Casino and Station 
Casinos brings the total number of Simulated 
Gaming
TM
 clients operational entering 2018 to 
13. The US market remains the core strategic 
market for the Group as it seeks to continue to 
drive adoption from land-based casinos to the 
online digital market. Revenues from the US 
market continue to be a substantial proportion 
of the business and now account for 57% of 
total Group revenues. 
The Group remains focused on generating 
recurring revenue growth in both of its primary 
markets, the US and Italy. Recurring revenues 
accounted for 82% of total net revenue. In 
addition to the US market growth, the Group 
has benefited from continued recurring 
revenue growth in the regulated market of Italy 
where the launch of an additional operator and 
the full-year contribution of two new operators 
launched in the prior period has continued to 
drive revenue growth. Net revenues from the  
Italian market have grown and now represent 
over 31% of total net revenue. 
The Group continued to invest heavily in  
the underlying IGS and product capability to 
meet the ongoing market demand and ensure  
that it continues to be in position to capitalise 
on the immediate Simulated Gaming
TM
 
opportunity in the US market. 
The Group has continued to rationalise its 
cost base through the opening of a new 
technical development office in Bulgaria. 
The introduction of additional technical 
resource in a lower-cost location has enabled 
the Group to continue to enhance its delivery 
capability while reducing the underlying cost 
structure over time. 
The Group reports gross income of £41.1m,  
a 30% increase from 2016. Net revenue for  
the year was £9.1m compared with £7.8m in  
the same period last year, an increase of 17%. 
Clean EBITDA profit of £0.5m compares 
positively with a Clean EBITDA loss in 2016  
of £0.9m and a loss before taxation of £4.2m 
compares with a loss before taxation in the 
prior period of £5.2m. The loss after taxation of 
£3.5m reflects the expectation of a successful 
claim for research and development tax of 
£0.8m. This expectation is based on successful 
claims in respect of prior years, including 
£1.0m received in 2017 in relation to 2016. The 
2017 value is lower due to lower development 
costs associated with the transition to Bulgaria.
The Group ended the year with a cash balance 
of £2.7m compared with £3.2m for the year 
ended 31 December 2016 and net assets  
at 31 December 2017 of £7.6m compared  
with £10.9m in the previous year. On 28 April 
2017 the Group announced that it had raised 
gross proceeds of £2.0m through the 
successful placing of a 9% unsecured 
convertible loan note issue. 
An expanding customer base and client offering alongside robust 
cost control has ensured the Group capitalised on its investment, 
producing strong year-on-year increases in net revenue and Clean 
EBITDA in 2017.

STRATEGIC REPORT
18 GAN PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 The Group continued 
to invest heavily in the 
underlying IGS and 
product capability  
to position itself for  
future growth.
Revenue
Gross income from gaming operations and 
services increased by 30% to £41.1m in 2017. 
Gross income is a non-GAAP company specific 
measure that gives an indication of the extent 
of the transactions that have passed through 
the Group’s systems. 
Net revenue for the year of £9.1m has increased 
by 17% and is £1.3m higher than the net revenue 
generated in the previous year of £7.8m.
Real money gaming (RMG) revenues have 
increased by £0.3m, with the associated 
development fees reduced by £0.3m and 
revenue share increased by £0.6m. For 
Simulated Gaming
TM 
(SIMGAM) development 
fees again reduced year-on-year by £0.3m, 
while revenue share increased by £1.3m 
(54%) resulting in an overall 31% increase 
in this segment.
The increase in revenue share has been driven 
by the regulated gaming markets in New Jersey 
and Italy and by Simulated Gaming™ where the 
company now has 13 casinos operational, of 
which five launched in H1 2017. 
Expenses
Distribution costs include royalties payable  
to third parties, direct marketing expenditure 
and the direct costs of operating the hardware 
platforms deployed across the business, which 
in total increased from £7.4m to £8.0m for the 
year ended 31 December 2017. The increase 
is due primarily to increased royalties payable 
to providers of third party games content in 
Europe for real money gaming and in the US  
for Simulated Gaming™. 
Administration expenses include the costs  
of personnel and related expenditure for the 
London, Nevada and Sofia offices. The Group 
reports total administrative expenses for the 
year ended 31 December 2017 of £5.5m, 
£0.1m less than those incurred in 2016. 
This is despite foreign exchange losses of 
£0.2m contributing to costs as a result of the 
weakening of the US Dollar during the year. 
Clean EBITDA 
Clean EBITDA is a non-GAAP company 
specific measure and excludes interest,  
tax, depreciation, amortisation, share-based 
payment expense and other items which  
the directors consider reflects the underlying 
performance of the business, and excludes 
non-recurring and significant non cash  
items as disclosed in note 6 to the financial 
statements. The directors regard Clean 
EBITDA as a reliable measure of profits  
that is not unduly subjective.
Clean EBITDA profit of £0.5m in 2017 
compares with a clean EBITDA loss of  
£0.9m in 2016 reflecting the impact of 
continued investment in the underlying 
delivery and product capability.
Cash flow
The cash balance at 31 December 2017  
was £2.7m compared with £3.2m in 2016,  
a reduction of £0.5m. During the year the 
Group has continued to invest in the underlying 
IGS deployment and product capability. The 
Group raised gross proceeds of £2.0m through 
a convertible loan note issue which, together 
with operating cash inflow of £1.2m, partially 
offset expenditure of £3.5m in incremental 
investment in intangible fixed assets that 
related principally to the capitalisation of 
internal development time and related 
overheads. Excluding the impact of additional 
capital raised by the Group, cash outflow has 
decreased from £5m in 2016 to £2m in 2017. 
Key performance indicators
The directors regard Clean EBITDA as a 
reliable measure of profits and the Group’s  
key performance indicators are set out above. 
The Board also monitors client-related key 
performance indicators, including the number 
of active players, revenue by client, average 
revenue per daily active user and number of 
daily active users for both Simulated Gaming™, 
and real money Internet gaming business 
segment profitability and geographic split 
of turnover.

The risks outlined below are those risks and uncertainties that the Board 
considers material to the Group. They are not presented in any order of 
priority. There may be other risks that are either currently unknown, or 
considered by the Board to be immaterial, which could adversely affect  
the Group’s business, results of operation or financial condition.
Risk category Description Mitigation
LEGAL AND REGULATORY RISKS
Loss of licences
The Group holds a number of licences for  
its activities from regulators. The loss of  
all or any of these licences may adversely 
impact on the revenues and/or reputation 
of the Group.
The Group has established a compliance 
team, whose role is to develop relationships 
with regulators, monitor the regulatory 
environment closely, and ensure continuation 
of all necessary licences and permits to 
allow the Group to continue its business.
Changes in regulations Laws, regulations and taxation in the 
gambling sector are complex, inconsistent 
and evolving. The Group licenses its 
products to operators in the online gaming 
industry whose ability to operate in any 
jurisdiction may be impacted by changes  
in regulations, or failure to obtain any 
necessary licenses. In addition, there can  
be no guarantee that a jurisdiction will  
not change its licencing requirements  
nor that revenue streams that currently  
do not require a licence will continue 
without additional regulations or  
additional taxation or that further States 
will regulate online real money gaming.
As an established regulated supplier to  
the online gambling sector, the Group is 
vigilant over legal and regulatory issues 
that may apply to its activities, not only  
in those jurisdictions where the Group  
is located but also where its licensees  
are operating using GAN software  
and services. 
In addition, the Group has diversified its risk 
by obtaining multiple licences in the UK, 
Alderney, and New Jersey in the US.
New licensing requirements In newly regulated markets, new licensing 
regimes may impose licensing conditions, 
such as the requirement to locate significant 
technical infrastructure within the relevant 
territory or establish real time data 
interfaces with the regulator that present 
operational challenges, or may stop the 
licensee from being able to offer the full 
range of the Group’s products.
The Group closely monitors developments 
in jurisdictions seeking to introduce or 
change regulations. The Group works to 
establish close relationships and actively 
participates in groups such as the Remote 
Gambling Association to help shape new 
licensing regulations.
ADEQUACY OF FUNDING 
Liquidity
The Group has historically been loss making 
with negative cash flows and this trend 
continued in to 2017, albeit on an improved 
basis. Failure to improve trading in the 
medium term would raise doubts as to 
the adequacy of funding, liquidity and 
ultimately the Group’s ability to continue 
as a going concern.
The Group has reduced its cost base in 
2016 and 2017 and generated net cash 
flows from operating activities. The Board 
has stress tested future cash flows to 
ensure operational growth and delivery 
are not compromised. 
The Board routinely monitors risks that could materially and adversely affect the Group’s ability 
to achieve strategic goals, financial condition and results of operations. The Board is supported 
by senior management personnel who collectively play a key role in risk management and 
regularly report to the Board.
STRATEGIC REPORT
20 GAN PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 Risk category Description Mitigation
THE MARKET-PLACE 
Competition
The online gambling market is highly 
competitive. Failure to compete effectively 
may result in loss of licensees and also  
the inability to attract new licensees.
The Group closely monitors competition 
and continues to invest significant 
resources to improve its technology, 
products and services. In addition, the 
Group has a diversified geographic 
base which spreads the competitive risk.
TECHNOLOGY
Dependence on technology
The Group’s operations are highly 
dependent on technology and advanced 
information systems and there is a risk  
that such technology or systems could fail. 
The Group may be adversely affected  
by activities such as system intrusions, 
denial of service attacks, virus spreading 
and phishing.
The Group has in place data recovery  
and systems recovery procedures,  
security measures and business continuity 
plans in the event of failure or disruption  
or damage to, the Group’s technology  
or systems.
CUSTOMERS
Fraud
The Group experiences fraudulent activity 
on customer accounts in the form of 
deposits from stolen credit cards and debit 
cards. These amounts are written off as a 
loss to the business.
The Group has a compliance team whose 
role is to monitor transactions for signs  
of fraudulent activity and to carry out KYC 
procedures. Reports from the Management 
Information System are used by the 
compliance team to monitor possible 
fraudulent activities. The Group sources 
multiple payment providers to mitigate for 
risk of losing any single funding channel.
Risk of reliance on major licensees The Group operates a revenue share  
model with its licensees meaning results 
can be impacted by loss of licencees, poor 
performance of its licensees or by its 
licensees choosing to withdraw from 
a particular market.
The Group has continued to diversify its 
licensee base by developing its business  
in stable regulated markets and also by  
the expansion of its Simulated Gaming™

Reliance on key personnel
The Group’s future success depends on the 
continued service of senior management 
and key technical personnel, the retention 
of whom cannot be guaranteed.
The Group has a performance evaluation 
system to identify key talent and ensure 
that key personnel are appropriately 
rewarded and incentivised. This is through 
a mixture of annual bonuses and long-term 
incentives such as share options.
Risk of cash outflow from contractual 
arrangements
There is a risk of cash outflow from 
certain contractual arrangements with 
new customers
The Group closely monitors all current 
and future operational projects to ensure 
appropriate budgets and controls are in 
place, so these arrangements do not impact 
on the delivery of other Group activities.

GAN PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 21 CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY
Approach towards stakeholders
OUR TEAMS ARE EXTENSIVELY 
TRAINED IN THE AREA OF 
RESPONSIBLE GAMING
The Group has an open, honest and responsible 
approach towards its stakeholders which 
include its employees, suppliers, customers, 
investors and the wider community.
Responsible gaming
As both a direct to consumer and B2B  
provider of games of skill and chance in 
regulated markets, we have placed our 
responsible gaming policies and tools at the 
core of our vision to provide industry-leading 
entertainment in a socially responsible fashion.
We also, in conjunction with our partners, 
provide robust age verification processes to 
ensure that no minors can access our games.
Regulation
GAN plc is licensed and regulated by the  
UK Gambling Commission, the Alderney 
Gambling Control Commission, the 
Amministrazione autonoma dei monopoli  
di Stato (Autonomous Administration of  
State Monopolies) in Italy and the New  
Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement.  
We are also approved by GamCare, which is 
a leading UK charity advising and assisting 
those with a gambling problem.
All of the organisations above have different 
requirements and regulations and the Group 
is proud that we exceed these in all areas of 
responsible gaming.
All of our games are certified and tested by  
GLI (Gaming Laboratories International) 
and NMi Metrology & Gaming Ltd, both 
of which are leading industry providers for 
online gaming testing and certification.
Money laundering
GAN provides a range of proprietary and  
third party tools to our partners to identify 
and monitor fraud and money laundering.  
Our in-house analytics software monitors  
all deposit and withdrawal attempts as well 
as all gameplay. Our system has the ability 
to notify staff members of any suspicious 
transactions or gameplay and automatically 
suspend any account which has been involved 
in such activity. 
Our system also actively monitors all skill 
games to ensure no user can gain an unfair 
advantage by using bots or automated 
gameplay systems.
We also provide third party tools from  
leading payment processors such as  
Worldpay, CAMS, Vantiv and LexisNexis  
in order to perform verification checks on  
the source of all monies on our networks.
Employees
The Group is committed to maintaining a 
working environment in which diversity and 
equality of opportunity are actively promoted 
and all unlawful discrimination is not tolerated. 
The Group values diversity and to that end 
recognises the educational and business 
benefits of diversity amongst its employees, 
applicants and other people with whom we 
have dealings.
We are committed to ensuring employees are 
treated fairly and are not subjected to unfair  
or unlawful discrimination.
Software and reporting
Responsible gaming and player protection  
lie at the heart of our software. Our  
platform services allow our partners to  
offer their players an array of tools to  
control their spending, including deposit  
limits, wagering limits, time limits, self-
exclusion and cooling-off periods.
This, coupled with sophisticated reporting  
and analytics, allows our partners to identify 
potentially compulsive behaviour and take  
the required action to ensure the protection 
of any vulnerable players.
Our teams are extensively trained in the area 
of responsible gaming. Our team members  
are trained to effectively and sympathetically 
assist any player displaying signs of gambling 
addiction and guide them in the correct 
direction to seek assistance.
Environment
The Group has a relatively low environmental 
impact by virtue of the fact that it is an online 
business. We engage in office recycling for a 
wide range of materials to reduce the amount 
of waste sent to landfill.
We also offer a cycle to work scheme to our 
employees to help reduce the local congestion 
and pollution as well as to improve employees’ 
health through physical exercise. In addition, 
we provide a significant contribution towards  
employees’ gym membership.

STRATEGIC REPORT
22 GAN PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT
Leadership and effectiveness
As an AIM listed Group, GAN plc is not 
required to follow the provisions of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code (the Code). 
However, the Board recognises the importance 
and value of good corporate governance 
procedures and accordingly has selected those 
elements of the Code that it considers relevant 
and appropriate to the Group, given its size  
and structure.
The Board
The Board comprises four directors including 
one executive director and three non-
executive directors including the Chairman. 
The Board meets regularly to consider 
strategy, performance and the framework  
of internal controls. 
The Board of directors comprises a mix of the 
necessary skills, knowledge and experience 
required to provide leadership, control and 
oversight of the management of GAN plc  
and to contribute to the development and 
implementation of strategy. In particular, the 
Board comprises a group of directors with 
diverse backgrounds within the technology 
and related sectors, in both public and private 
companies, which combine to provide the 
Board with the resources and expertise to 
drive the continuing development of the 
Group and advance its commercial objectives.
The directors have established an audit 
committee, a remuneration committee  
and a nomination committee with formally 
delegated roles and responsibilities. Each of 
the committees currently comprises three 
non-executive directors and meets at least 
once each year.
Committees
The audit committee is responsible for 
ensuring that the financial performance of the 
Group is properly reported on and monitored, 
and meeting the auditors and reviewing the 
reports from the auditors relating to accounts 
and internal control systems. It meets at 
least once a year with the auditors without 
executive directors present. The audit 
committee comprises Roger Kendrick, Seamus 
McGill and Michael Smurfit Jr. and is chaired by 
Roger Kendrick. Roger Kendrick is deemed to 
have recent and relevant financial experience 
and is the audit committee financial expert. 
The remuneration committee reviews the 
performance of the executive director and 
sets and reviews the scale and structure of his 
remuneration. The committee also reviews the 
basis of the executive director’s remuneration 
and the terms of his service agreements with 
due regard to the interests of shareholders. 
In determining the remuneration of executive 
directors, the remuneration committee will 
seek to enable the Group to attract and retain 
staff of the highest calibre. 
The remuneration committee will also  
make recommendations to the Board 
concerning the allocation of share options  
to employees. No director is permitted  
to participate in discussions or decisions 
concerning his own remuneration. The 
remuneration committee comprises  
Seamus McGill, Roger Kendrick and Michael 
Smurfit Jr. and is chaired by Seamus McGill.
The nomination committee is responsible  
for reviewing the size, structure and 
composition of the Board, succession planning, 
the appointment of replacement and/or 
additional directors and making the 
appropriate recommendations to the Board. 
It meets at least once a year with the auditors 
without executive directors present. The 
nomination committee comprises Michael 
Smurfit Jr., Seamus McGill and Roger Kendrick 
and is chaired by Michael Smurfit Jr.
Internal control
The Group has adopted a share dealing code 
in conformity with the requirements of Rule 
21 of the AIM Rules and ESM Rules and will 
take steps to ensure compliance by the Board 
and the Group’s employees with the terms of 
the Code.
The Bribery Act 2010 which came into force  
in the UK on 1 July 2011 prescribes criminal 
offences for individuals and businesses relating 
to the payment of bribes and, in certain cases,  
a failure to prevent the payment of bribes. The 
Group has therefore established procedures 
designed to ensure that no member of the 
Group engages in conduct for which a 
prosecution under the Bribery Act 2010 
may result.
Although not required to  
follow the provisions of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code, the 
Board recognises the importance 
and value of good corporate 
governance procedures.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  |  GOVERNANCE  |  STRATEGIC REPORT
GAN PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 27 DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES
in the preparation of financial statements
The directors are responsible for preparing the 
annual report and the financial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and regulations. 
Company law requires the directors to 
prepare financial statements for each  
financial year. Under that law the directors 
have elected to prepare the Group and parent 
Company financial statements in accordance 
with applicable law and International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by  
the European Union. Under company law  
the directors must not approve the financial 
statements unless they are satisfied that  
they give a true and fair view of the state  
of affairs of the Group and Company and  
of the profit or loss of the Group for that 
period. The directors are also required to 
prepare financial statements in accordance 
with the rules of the London Stock Exchange 
for companies trading securities on the 
Alternative Investment Market (AIM). 
In preparing these financial statements,  
the directors are required to: 
• select suitable accounting policies and 
then apply them consistently; 
• make judgements and accounting estimates 
that are reasonable and prudent; 
• state whether they have been prepared in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the 
European Union, subject to any material 
departures disclosed and explained in  
the financial statements; and
• prepare the financial statements on  
the going concern basis unless it is 
inappropriate to presume that the Group 
and Company will continue in business. 
The directors are responsible for keeping 
adequate accounting records that are 
sufficient to show and explain the Group  
and Company’s transactions and disclose  
with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the Group and Company 
and enable them to ensure that the financial 
statements comply with the requirements  
of the Companies Act 2006. They are also 
responsible for safeguarding the assets of  
the Group and hence for taking reasonable 
steps for the prevention and detection of 
fraud and other irregularities. 
Website publication 
The directors are responsible for ensuring  
the annual report and the financial statements 
are made available on a website. Financial 
statements are published on the Group’s 
website in accordance with legislation in the 
United Kingdom governing the preparation 
and dissemination of financial statements, 
which may vary from legislation in other 
jurisdictions. The maintenance and integrity  
of the Group’s website is the responsibility  
of the directors. The directors’ responsibility 
also extends to the ongoing integrity of the 
financial statements contained therein.

28 GAN PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 Opinion
We have audited the financial statements 
of GAN plc (the ‘parent company’) and its 
subsidiaries (the ‘group’) for the year ended 
31 December 2017 which comprise the 
Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive 
Income, the Consolidated and Company 
Statement of Financial Position, the 
Consolidated and Company Statement of 
Changes in Equity, the Consolidated and 
Company Statement of Cash Flows and  
notes to the financial statements, including  
a summary of significant accounting policies.
The financial reporting framework that has 
been applied in the preparation of the financial 
statements is applicable law and International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as 
adopted by the European Union and, as 
regards the parent company financial 
statements, as applied in accordance with 
the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
In our opinion:
• the financial statements give a true and fair 
view of the state of the group’s and of the 
parent company’s affairs as at 31 December 
2017 and of the group’s loss for the year 
then ended;
• the group financial statements have been 
properly prepared in accordance with 
IFRSs as adopted by the European Union;
• the parent company financial statements 
have been properly prepared in accordance 
with IFRSs as adopted by the European 
Union and as applied in accordance with the 
provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and
• the financial statements have been 
prepared in accordance with the 
requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
Use of our report
This report is made solely to the parent 
company’s members, as a body, in accordance 
with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 
2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so 
that we might state to the parent company’s 
members those matters we are required to 
state to them in an auditor’s report and for no 
other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted 
by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility 
to anyone other than the parent company and 
the parent company’s members as a body, for 
our audit work, for this report, or for the 
opinions we have formed.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with 
International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs 
(UK)) and applicable law. Our responsibilities 
under those standards are further described  
in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of 
the financial statements section of our report. 
We are independent of the group and the 
parent company in accordance with the ethical 
requirements that are relevant to our audit of 
the financial statements in the UK, including 
the FRC’s Ethical Standard as applied to listed 
entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical 
responsibilities in accordance with these 
requirements. We believe that the audit 
evidence we have obtained is sufficient and 
appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Conclusions relating to going concern
We have nothing to report in respect of the 
following matters in relation to which the 
ISAs (UK) require us to report to you where:
• the directors’ use of the going concern basis 
of accounting in the preparation of the 
financial statements is not appropriate; or
• the directors have not disclosed in the 
financial statements any identified material 
uncertainties that may cast significant 
doubt about the group’s or the parent 
company’s ability to continue to adopt 
the going concern basis of accounting for 
a period of at least twelve months from 
the date when the financial statements 
are authorised for issue.
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, 
in our professional judgment, were of most 
significance in our audit of the financial 
statements of the current period and include 
the most significant assessed risks of material 
misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) 
we identified, including those which had the 
greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, 
the allocation of resources in the audit; and 
directing the efforts of the engagement team.
These matters were addressed in the context 
of our audit of the financial statements as a 
whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, 
and we do not provide a separate opinion  
on these matters.
Revenue recognition  
(with reference to note 2)
Key audit matter
The group has a number of revenue streams. 
The details of the accounting policies applied 
during the period are given in note 2 to the 
financial statements.
Management make certain judgements around 
revenue recognition and the treatment of 
contractual arrangements for revenue streams 
entered into. There is a potential risk that 
revenue is recorded incorrectly from a timing 
perspective (including in respect of the 
allocation of revenue between performance 
objectives)or that it is inappropriately 
recognised on a gross versus net basis.
Our response
We assessed the design and implementation of 
the controls over the group’s revenue cycles.
We assessed whether the revenue recognition 
policies adopted by the group comply with IFRS 
and Industry standards.
We tested revenue through substantive 
procedures. This included agreement to 
underlying source data, and the use of IT 
audit data analytic techniques to underpin our 
substantive testing of certain revenue streams.
We reviewed a sample of key contracts entered 
into during the year to assess whether the 
revenue had been recognised in accordance 
with the group’s accounting policy, and to 
assess the critical estimates and judgements, 
in particular in respect of the allocation of 
revenue between performance objectives, 
and whether any other terms within the 
contract had any material accounting or 
disclosure implications.
Impairment of capitalised  
development costs and other 
intangibles (with reference to note 10)
Key audit matter
In accordance with IAS 36, the group monitors 
the carrying value of development costs and 
other intangibles for indications of impairment. 
The group performs annual impairment reviews 
where there are indicators of impairment and 
for capitalised development costs relating to 
projects not launched as at the year end.
Impairment reviews require significant 
judgement from management and are based on 
assumptions in respect of future profitability.
If the carrying value of these assets exceeds 
their recoverable amount there is a risk of 
material misstatement.

indications of impairment in respect of 
intangible assets.
The audit team challenged the appropriateness 
of the key assumptions used in the discounted 
cash flow models prepared by management 
and applied sensitivities to assess the potential 
impairment of goodwill and those assets where 
indications of impairment were present. Our 
work was based on our assessment of the 
historical accuracy of the group’s estimates 
in previous periods, our understanding of 
the commercial prospects of the assets, 
identification and analysis of changes in 
assumptions from prior periods and 
an assessment of the consistency of 
assumptions across the impairment reviews.
We considered the appropriateness of the 
related disclosures provided in the group 
financial statements.
Capitalisation of development costs 
and other intangibles (with reference 
to note 10)
Key audit matter
The group has material expenditure on the 
internal development of intangible software 
assets. Such expenditure should only be 
capitalised when it qualifies under the specified 
criteria of IAS 38 and as such this is an area of 
judgement. For internally generated intangible 
assets, capitalised cost should meet the 
following criteria:
• Technical feasibility
• Intention to complete and use/sell
• Ability to use/sell
• Probable future economic benefits
• Technical, financial and other resources 
to complete
• Accurately identify and measure expenditure
Our response
We assessed the design and implementation of 
the controls over the group’s capitalisation cycles.
We assessed whether the capitalisation 
policies adopted by the group comply with 
IFRS and Industry standards.
The audit team tested a sample of costs 
capitalised in the year to ensure they met 
the criteria of IAS 38, including agreement 
of the costs to source documentation.
Going Concern (with reference to note 2)
Key audit matter
Given the growth phase of the business and the 
risks as noted on page 20 there is an inherent 
risk in respect of liquidity. The group has a 
history of periodically raising cash through 
equity and debt issues to fund the growth of 
the business and raised £2m in the current 
year as set out in note 14. For the year ended 
31 December 2017, as shown on the cash 
flow statement on page 35 the group had 
used £2.3m (2016: £5.1m) in the operations 
and investing activities before financing.  
As at the year end the group had cash of 
£2.7m. The Directors’ responsibilities include 
the requirement to prepare the financial 
statements on the going concern basis unless it 
is inappropriate to presume that the group and 
the Parent Company will continue in business 
for a period of at least 12 months from the 
date the financial statements are signed. In 
order to meet this assessment, the directors 
are required to prepare cashflow forecasts to 
determine if the group has sufficient existing 
cash resources or whether further funds will 
need to be raised.
As with any cash flow forecasts there is  
an inherent risk in the accuracy of the 
forecasts and in respect of the delivery 
against these projections.
For these reasons we considered going  
concern to be a key audit matter.
The directors’ disclosures in respect to  
going concern are set out in note 2.
Our response
The forecasts have been prepared on two 
bases, one being that there is a further equity 
fund-raise in the forecast period and one 
excluding any further fund-raising. Our work 
has included checking the calculations in the 
forecasts and challenging the key assumptions 
used by the directors in the cash flow forecasts 
and the sensitivities applied to those cash flow 
forecasts in coming to their conclusion.
We have considered the disclosures both 
within note 2 to the financial statements 
and within the directors’ report in respect 
of Going concern.
As noted within the Going Concern section 
of our report above, we have nothing to 
report in respect of the specific matters 
which the ISAs require us to report to you on.
Our application of materiality
We apply the concept of materiality both in 
planning and performing our audit, and in 
evaluating the effect of misstatements. For 
planning, we consider materiality to be the 
magnitude by which misstatements, including 
omissions, could influence the economic 
decisions of reasonable users that are taken  
on the basis of the financial statements. In 
order to reduce to an appropriately low level 
the probability that any misstatements exceed 
materiality, we use a lower materiality level, 
performance materiality, to determine the 
extent of testing needed. Importantly, 
misstatements below these levels will not 
necessarily be evaluated as immaterial as  
we also take account of the nature of 
identified misstatements, and the particular 
circumstances of their occurrence, when 
evaluating their effect on the financial 
statements as a whole.
Level of materiality applied 
and rationale
We consider Net Revenue to be the most 
appropriate performance measure for the  
basis of materiality in respect of the audit  
of the group. Using this benchmark, we set 
materiality at £127k (2016: £100k) being  
1.4% (2016: 1.5%) of Net Revenue.
Materiality in respect of the audit of the Parent 
Company has been set at £121k (2016: £95k) 
using a benchmark of 1.4% of Net Revenue, 
limited to 95% of group materiality (2016: 1.5% 
of Net Revenue, limited to 95% of group 
materiality). We consider Net Revenue to be 
the most appropriate measure for the basis 
of materiality as the Parent Company is the 
key trading entity in the group.
Performance materiality was set at 67% of 
materiality for both the group and parent 
company audits. In setting the level of 
performance materiality we considered  
a number of factors including the expected 
total value of known and likely misstatements 
(based on past experience and other factors) 
and management’s attitude towards proposed 
adjustments.
Component materiality
We set materiality for each component of 
the group, other than the parent company, 
at 50% of materiality to account for the 
aggregation risk.
Agreement with the Audit Committee
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we 
would report to the Committee all audit 
differences individually in excess of £4k (2016: 
£4k). We also agreed to report differences 
below this threshold that, in our view, 
warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
30 GAN PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 An overview of the scope of our audit
Our group audit was scoped by obtaining 
an understanding of the group and its 
environment, including the group’s system 
of internal control, and assessing the risks 
of material misstatement in the financial 
statements at the group level.
In determining the scope of our audit we 
considered the level of work to be performed 
at each component in order to ensure sufficient 
assurance was gained to allow us to express  
an opinion on the financial statements of the 
group as a whole.
The group consists of 4 components all 
of which were subject to a full audit by the 
group audit team.
We tailored the extent of the work to be 
performed on each component, which was 
performed by the group audit team, based 
on our assessment of the risk of material 
misstatement at each component.
We obtained an understanding of the 
entity-level controls of the group as a whole 
which assisted us in identifying and assessing 
risks of material misstatement due to fraud or 
error, as well as assisting us in determining the 
most appropriate audit strategy.
Other information
The directors are responsible for the other 
information. The other information comprises 
the information included in the annual report, 
other than the financial statements and our 
auditor’s report thereon. Our opinion on the 
financial statements does not cover the other 
information and, except to the extent otherwise 
explicitly stated in our report, we do not express 
any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the financial 
statements, our responsibility is to read the 
other information and, in doing so, consider 
whether the other information is materially 
inconsistent with the financial statements 
or our knowledge obtained in the audit or 
otherwise appears to be materially misstated. 
If we identify such material inconsistencies 
or apparent material misstatements, we are 
required to determine whether there is a 
material misstatement in the financial 
statements or a material misstatement of 
the other information. If, based on the work 
we have performed, we conclude that there 
is a material misstatement of this other 
information, we are required to report that 
fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.
Opinions on other matters prescribed 
by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken 
in the course of the audit:
• the information given in the strategic report 
and the directors’ report for the financial 
year for which the financial statements are 
prepared is consistent with the financial 
statements; and
• the strategic report and the directors’ 
report have been prepared in accordance 
with applicable legal requirements.
Matters on which we are  
required to report by exception
In the light of the knowledge and 
understanding of the group and the parent 
company and its environment obtained in the 
course of the audit, we have not identified 
material misstatements in the strategic report 
or the directors’ report.
We have nothing to report in respect of the 
following matters in relation to which the 
Companies Act 2006 requires us to report 
to you if, in our opinion:
• adequate accounting records have not been 
kept by the parent company, or returns 
adequate for our audit have not been 
received from branches not visited by us; or
• the parent company financial statements 
are not in agreement with the accounting 
records and returns; or
• certain disclosures of directors’ 
remuneration specified by law are not 
made; or
• we have not received all the information 
and explanations we require for our audit.
Responsibilities of directors
As explained more fully in the directors’ 
responsibilities statement set out on page 28, 
the directors are responsible for the preparation 
of the financial statements and for being 
satisfied that they give a true and fair view, 
and for such internal control as the directors 
determine is necessary to enable the preparation 
of financial statements that are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to  
fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the 
directors are responsible for assessing the 
group’s and the parent company’s ability to 
continue as a going concern, disclosing, as 
applicable, matters related to going concern 
and using the going concern basis of accounting 
unless the directors either intend to liquidate 
the group or the parent company or to cease 
operations, or have no realistic alternative but 
to do so.
Auditor’s responsibilities for the  
audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable 
assurance about whether the financial 
statements as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, 
and to issue an auditor’s report that includes 
our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high 
level of assurance, but is not a guarantee 
that an audit conducted in accordance with 
ISAs (UK) will always detect a material 
misstatement when it exists.
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error 
and are considered material if, individually 
or in the aggregate, they could reasonably 
be expected to influence the economic 
decisions of users taken on the basis of 
these financial statements
A further description of our responsibilities for 
the audit of the financial statements is located 
on the Financial Reporting Council’s website at: 
www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This 
description forms part of our auditor’s report.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
38 GAN PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
for the year ended 31 December 2017
1. Basis of preparation
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, International Accounting 
Standards and interpretations (collectively, “IFRS”) issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) as adopted by the European 
Union (“adopted IFRSs”).
Going concern
The directors consider that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason, 
they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
The directors have assessed the financial risks facing the business, and compared this risk assessment to the net current assets position and 
dividend policy. The directors have also reviewed relationships with key customers and software providers and are satisfied that the appropriate 
contracts and contingency plans are in place. The directors have prepared forecasts to assess whether the Group has adequate resources for the 
foreseeable future.
Adoption of new and revised standards
In the current year the Group has adopted all of the new and revised standards and interpretations issued by the IASB and the International 
Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) of the IASB, as they have been adopted by the European Union, that are relevant to  
its operations and effective for accounting years beginning from 1 January 2017. None of the new standards adopted had a material impact  
on the financial statements of the Group.
New accounting standards in issue but not yet effective
New standards, amendments to standards and interpretations have been issued but are not effective (and in some cases had not yet been 
adopted by the EU) for the financial year beginning 1 January 2017. The following new standards and amendments have been reviewed by  
the Directors:
IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’ – is effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. The standard establishes  
a principles based approach for revenue recognition and is based on the concept of recognising revenue for obligations only when they are 
satisfied and the control of goods or services is transferred.
Management has performed an assessment of the impact of IFRS 15 at a contract level and does not expect any material impact on the timing of 
revenue recognition for revenue share as a result of adopting this standard. Management is finalising its review of development revenues, which 
in 2017 comprised 20% of net revenues.
IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’ – adopting IFRS 9 will impact receivables provisioning as it moves from an incurred to an expected loss model. 
The Group’s largest exposure is trade receivables, which had a gross value of £2,005k at 31 December 2017, where the new model could impact 
the timing and value of provision recognition. Management does not expect any material impact from implementation of the new standard.
IFRS 16 ‘Leases’ – was issued on 13 January 2016 and is effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019.
The standard represents a significant change in the accounting and reporting of leases for lessees as it provides a single lessee accounting model. 
As such it requires lessees to recognise assets and liabilities for all leases unless the underlying asset has a low value or the lease term is 12 months 
or less. The standard may also require the capitalisation of a lease element of contracts held by the Group which under the existing accounting 
standard would not be considered a lease.
On adoption, lease agreements will give rise to both a right of use asset and a lease liability for future lease payments. Depreciation of the right 
of use asset will be recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis, with interest recognised on the lease liability. This will result  
in a change to the profile of the net charge taken to the income statement over the life of the lease. These charges will replace the lease costs 
currently charged to the income statement.
The Group continues to assess the full impact of IFRS 16; however, the impact will greatly depend on the facts and circumstances at the time  
of adoption. It is therefore not yet practical to provide a reliable estimate of the financial impact on the Group’s consolidated results.

The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
2.1 Basis of consolidation
Where the Company has control over an investee, it is classified as a subsidiary. The Company controls an investee if all three of the following 
elements are present: power over the investee, exposure to variable returns from investee and the ability of the investor to use its power to 
affect those variable returns. Control is reassessed whenever facts and circumstances indicate that there may be a change in any of these 
elements of control.
De-facto control exists in situations where the Company has the practical ability to direct the relevant activities of the investee without  
holding the majority of the voting rights. In determining whether de-facto control exists the Company considers all relevant facts and 
circumstances, including:
• the size of the Company’s voting rights relative to both the size and dispersion of other parties who hold voting rights;
• substantive potential voting rights held by the Company and by other parties;
• other contractual arrangements; and
• historical patterns in voting attendance.
The consolidated financial statements present the results of the Company and its subsidiaries (the Group) as if they formed a single entity. 
Intercompany transactions and balances between Group companies are therefore eliminated in full.
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the results of business combinations using the acquisition method. In the statement  
of financial position, the acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities are initially recognised at their fair values at the 
acquisition date. The results of acquired operations are included in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income from the date  
on which control is obtained. They are deconsolidated from the date on which control ceases.
Foreign currencies
(a) Functional and presentational currency
Items included in the financial statements are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Company 
operates (the functional currency) which is UK Pound Sterling (£). The financial statements are presented in UK Pound Sterling (£), which  
is the Group’s presentational currency.
(b) Transactions and balances
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. 
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year end exchange rates of 
monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in net profit or loss in the statement of comprehensive income.
Non-monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when  
the fair value was determined. 
(c) Group companies
On consolidation the results of overseas operations are translated at rates approximating to those ruling when the transactions took place. 
All assets and liabilities of overseas operations, including goodwill arising on the acquisition of those operations, are translated at the rate  
ruling at the reporting date. Exchange differences arising on translating the opening net assets at opening rate and the results of overseas 
operations at actual rate are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the foreign exchange reserve. 
Exchange differences recognised in profit or loss in Group entities’ separate financial statements on the translation of long-term monetary  
items forming part of the Group’s net investment in the overseas operation concerned are reclassified to other comprehensive income  
and accumulated in the foreign exchange reserve on consolidation. 
On disposal of a foreign operation, the cumulative exchange differences recognised in the foreign exchange reserve relating to that operation 
up to the date of disposal are transferred to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income as part of the profit or loss on disposal.

2.2 Revenue recognition
Net revenues comprise amounts earned from B2C and B2B activities. B2B activities include revenues derived from the use of the Group’s 
intellectual property in online gaming activities and revenues derived from the game and platform development and related services. All 
revenues relate to the supply of services.
(a) B2C
Net revenue from ‘business to consumer’ (B2C) activities represents the net house win, commission charged or tournament entry fees where the 
player has concluded his or her participation in a tournament. Net revenue is recognised in the accounting years in which the gaming transactions 
occur and is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, net of certain promotion bonuses and customer incentives.
 (b) B2B
Revenue share and other services
Net revenue receivable from ‘business to business’ (B2B) activities in respect of revenue share and other services comprises a percentage 
of the revenue generated by the contracting party from use of the Group’s IP in online gaming activities and from fees charged for services 
rendered. Net revenue is recognised in the accounting years in which the gaming transactions occur or the services are rendered.
Game, website and platform development
Net revenue receivable from B2B activities in respect of game and platform development comprises fees earned from development of games 
for customers for use on GAN’s platforms and from the sale of platform software website and related services.
Revenue in respect of game development, the sale of platform software and related hardware is recognised when certification for the game  
has been obtained or delivery has occurred and the fee is fixed, contractual or determinable and collectability is probable.
Services revenue principally relates to implementation services. Such services are generally separable from the other elements of arrangements. 
Revenue for such services is recognised over the period of the delivery of these services. Where an element of the fee is contingent on the 
successful delivery of the implementation project the revenue is not recognised until such time that it is probable that the requirements under 
that specific contract will be met.
Simulated Gaming™
Net revenue in respect of Simulated Gaming™ is recognised upon completion of purchase. Simulated Gaming™ involves customers purchasing 
virtual credits at fixed price levels in order to experience established casino games in an online environment. Players are unable to monetise their 
virtual balances and revenues are recognised at the point of purchase and are non-refundable.
2.3 Gross income from gaming operations and services
In order to provide further information to readers of the financial statements and in particular to give an indication of the extent of transactions 
that have passed through the Group’s systems, the statement of comprehensive income discloses gross income from gaming operations and 
services arising through the use of the Group’s IP in online gaming activities, which represents the total income of the Group, together with that 
derived by its contracting parties where the Group supplies its software directly to the online operator. This line item does not represent the 
Group’s revenue for the purposes of IFRS income recognition.
2.4 Distribution costs
Distribution costs represent the costs of delivering the service to the customer and primarily consist of technology infrastructure, promotional and 
advertising together with gaming and regulatory testing, all of which are recognised on an accruals basis, and depreciation and amortisation.
2.5 Administrative expenses
Sales and administrative expenses consist primarily of staff costs, corporate and professional expenses, all of which are recognised on an accruals 
basis, and impairment charges.
Exceptional items are disclosed separately in the financial statements where it is necessary to do so to provide further understanding of the 
financial performance of the Group. They are material items of income or expense that have been shown separately due to the significance  
of their nature or amount.

GAN PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 41 2. Summary of significant accounting policies continued
2.6 Intangible assets
Externally acquired intangible assets
Externally acquired intangible assets are initially recognised at cost and subsequently amortised on a straight line basis over their useful 
economic lives.
The significant intangibles recognised by the Group with their useful economic lives are as follows:
Licences and trademarks Shorter of licence term or 10 years 
Brand assets  3 years
Internally generated intangible assets (development costs)
Expenditure incurred on development activities, including the Group’s software development and related overheads, is capitalised only where 
the expenditure will lead to new or substantially improved products, the products are technically and commercially feasible and the Group has 
sufficient resources to complete development.
Capitalised development costs are amortised over the years the Group expects to benefit from selling the products developed, which is 
typically three to five years. The amortisation expense is included within the distribution cost line in the consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income.
Development expenditure not satisfying the above criteria and expenditure on the research phase of internal projects are recognised in the 
consolidated statement of comprehensive income as incurred.
Subsequent expenditure on capitalised intangible assets is capitalised only where it clearly increases the economic benefits to be derived from 
the asset to which it relates. All other expenditure, including that incurred in order to maintain an intangible asset’s current level of performance, 
is expensed as incurred.
2.7 Property, plant and equipment
Depreciation is calculated to write off the cost of fixed assets on a straight line basis over the expected useful lives of the assets concerned.  
The principal annual rates used for this purpose are:
Fixtures, fittings, equipment and leasehold improvements 20–33% straight line
Subsequent expenditures are included in the assets’ carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that 
future economic benefits will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All repairs and maintenance are charged to the 
consolidated statement of comprehensive income during the financial period in which they are incurred.
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing proceeds with carrying amount and are included in the consolidated statement  
of comprehensive income.
2.8 Impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets
At each statement of financial position date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether 
there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is 
estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent 
from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit to which the asset belongs. 
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less disposal costs and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows  
are discounted to their present value using a pre tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and  
the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the  
asset (cash generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately.
2.9 Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Group’s statement of financial position when the Group becomes party to the 
contractual provisions of the instrument. Financial assets are de recognised when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset 
expire or when the contractual rights to those assets are transferred. Financial liabilities are de recognised when the obligation specified in the 
contract is discharged, cancelled or expires.
Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method 
less provision for impairment. 
Impairment provisions are recognised when there is objective evidence (such as significant financial difficulties on the part of the counterparty 
or default or significant delay in payment) that the Group will be unable to collect all of the amounts due under the net carrying amount and  
the present value of the future expected cash flows associated with the impaired receivable. For trade receivables, which are reported net,  
such provisions are recorded in a separate allowance account with the loss being recognised within administrative expenses in the statement  
of comprehensive income. On confirmation that the trade receivable will not be collectable, the gross carrying value of the asset is written  
off against the associated provision.

for the year ended 31 December 2017
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
42 GAN PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 2. Summary of significant accounting policies continued
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand, demand deposits, and other short term highly liquid investments that have maturities of three 
months or less from inception, are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Classification of shares as debt or equity instruments
Financial instruments issued by the Group are classified as equity only to the extent that they do not meet the definition of a financial liability. 
An equity instrument is a contract that evidences a residual interest in assets or an entity after deducting all of its liabilities. Accordingly, 
a financial instrument is treated as equity if:
• there is no contractual obligation to deliver cash or other financial assets or to exchange financial assets or liabilities on terms that may be 
unfavourable; and
• the instrument is a non derivative that contains no contractual obligation to deliver a variable number of shares or is a derivative that will be 
settled only by the Company exchanging a fixed amount of cash or other assets for a fixed number of the Company’s own equity instruments.
Equity instruments issued by the Group are recorded at the time the proceeds are received, net of direct issue costs.
Trade and other payables
Trade payables are initially measured at their fair value and are subsequently measured at their amortised cost using the effective interest rate 
method; this method allocates interest expense over the relevant period by applying the ‘effective interest rate’ to the carrying amount of the liability.
2.10 Current and deferred tax
Taxation represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
Current tax
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit reported in the statement of comprehensive 
income because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never 
taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the 
statement of financial position date.
Research and development tax
Research and development taxation relief is recognised once management considers it probable that any amount claimable will be received. 
Deferred tax
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial 
information and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability 
method. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible 
temporary differences can be utilised. 
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability is settled based upon  
tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the statement of financial position date. Deferred tax is charged or credited in the 
statement of comprehensive income, except when it relates to items credited or charged directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also 
dealt with in equity.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each statement of financial position date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer 
probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is measured using tax rates that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the statement of financial position date and are 
expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset or liability is realised or settled.
2.11 Operating leases
All leases held by the Group are operating leases and, as such, are charged to the statement of comprehensive income on a straight line basis 
over the lease term. Rent free periods or other incentives received for entering into a lease are accounted for over the lease term, so as to 
spread the benefit received. Operating lease costs relating to rent are apportioned on a per head basis and, where this headcount is capitalised, 
cost is capitalised in line with the Group’s capitalisation policy.
2.12 Share based payments
The Group issues equity settled share based payments to certain employees (including directors).
Equity settled share based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant and expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting period, 
based upon the Group’s estimate of equity instruments that will eventually vest, along with a corresponding increase in equity. At each statement 
of financial position date, the Group revises its estimate of the number of equity instruments expected to vest as a result of the effect of non market 
based vesting conditions. The impact of the revision of the original estimates, if any, is recognised in profit or loss such that the cumulative expense 
reflects the revised estimate, with a corresponding adjustment to equity reserves.
The fair value of share options is determined using a Black Scholes model, taking into consideration management’s best estimate of the expected 
life of the option and the estimated number of shares that will eventually vest. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on 
management’s best estimate, for the effects of non transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations. Where existing share 
options are modified, the increase in fair value is spread over the remaining vesting period. Where options are reissued post vesting period with 
a new vesting period, the total fair value of the re-issue is spread over the new vesting period.
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  |  GOVERNANCE  |  STRATEGIC REPORT
GAN PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 43 3. Financial risk management (see also note 15)
3.1 Financial risk factors
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group’s overall risk management 
programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the Group’s 
financial performance.
Risk management is carried out by management under policies approved by the Board of directors. Management identifies and evaluates 
financial risks in close co operation with the Group’s operating segments. The Board provides principles for overall risk management, as 
well as policies covering specific areas, such as interest rate risk, non derivative financial instruments and investment of excess liquidity.
3.2 Market risk
Market risk is the risk of loss that may arise from changes in market factors such as interest rates and foreign exchange rates.
3.3 Contractual risk
In the ordinary course of business the Group contracts with various parties. These contracts may include performance obligations, indemnities 
and contractual commitments. Management monitors the performance of the Group and any relevant counterparties against such contractual 
conditions to mitigate the risk of material, adverse non compliance.
3.4 Credit risk
Credit risk is the financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to financial instruments fails to meet its contractual obligation.  
Credit risk arises from the Group’s cash and cash equivalents and receivables balances.
3.5 Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. This risk relates to the Group’s prudent 
liquidity risk management and implies maintaining sufficient cash. Management monitors rolling forecasts of the Group’s liquidity and cash  
and cash equivalents on the basis of expected cash flow.
3.6 Capital risk management
The Group’s capital structure is comprised entirely of the share capital and accumulated reserves.
The Group’s objective when managing capital is to maintain adequate financial flexibility to preserve its ability to meet financial obligations, 
both current and long term. The capital structure of the Group is managed and adjusted to reflect changes in economic conditions.
The Group funds its expenditures on commitments from existing cash and cash equivalent balances. There are no externally imposed  
capital requirements.
Financing decisions are made by the Board of Directors based on forecasts of the expected timing and level of capital and operating expenditure 
required to meet the Group’s commitments and development plans.
3.7 Fair value estimation
The carrying values less impairment provision of trade and other receivables and payables are assumed to approximate their fair values  
because of the short term nature of such assets and the effect of discounting liabilities is negligible.
3.8 Critical accounting estimates and judgements
The preparation of consolidated financial statements under IFRSs as adopted by the EU requires the Group to make estimates and judgements 
that affect the application of policies and reported amounts. Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical 
experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results 
may differ from these estimates. 
Reference is made in this note to accounting policies which cover areas that the directors consider require estimates and assumptions which have 
a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities within the next financial year. These policies 
together with references to the related notes to the financial statements can be found below:

Revenue recognition
The Group applies judgement in determining whether it acts as principal or agent where it provides services through its B2B operations.  
In making these judgements, the Group gives consideration to the contractual terms of each arrangement and consequently which party  
has the primary responsibility for providing the services and is exposed to the majority of the risks and rewards associated with providing  
the services. Game development and the sale of platform software are recognised when the Group has met its contractual obligations which  
is typically on customer acceptance or upon receipt of certification. Simulated Gaming™ revenues are recognised when a player deposits  
into the gaming system and not on gameplay. Further detail on this can be found in note 2.2. 
Capitalisation and impairment of internally generated intangible assets
The Group reviews expenditure incurred on development activities and assesses whether the expenditure meets the capitalisation criteria set 
out in IAS 38 and note 2.6. The Group specifically considers if additional expenditure on projects relates to maintenance or new development 
projects. The Group tests annually whether its assets have suffered any impairment. Further details of the Group’s accounting policy in relation 
to impairment are disclosed in note 2.8. 
The application of the policy requires the use of accounting estimates and judgements in determining the recoverable amount of cash-generating 
units to which the intangible assets are associated. The recoverable amount is represented by the fair value, or value in use. Value in use is 
calculated using estimated cash flow projections from financial budgets, discounted by selecting an appropriate rate for each cash-generating unit.
The Group has recognised one-off revenue amounting to £758k (2016: £nil) for the development of Overseas Internet Casino. This was delivered in 
H2 2017 and available in regulated European markets. The Group believes that this treatment is consistent with accounting standards and revenue 
recognition policies and is consistent with the stand-alone selling price of the transaction. This development also represents a separate and distinct 
performance obligation to any ongoing contractual obligations as referenced in note 3.8. 
Taxation
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary 
differences can be utilised. The key area of judgement is therefore an assessment of whether it is probable that there will be suitable  
taxable profits against which any deferred tax assets can be utilised. Further details of deferred tax assets recognised are disclosed in note 9.
Research and development tax relief is recognised as an asset once it is considered that there is sufficient assurance that any amount claimable 
will be received. The key judgement therefore arises in respect of the likelihood of a claim being successful when a claim has been quantified 
but has not been received. In making this judgement the Group considers the nature of the claim and in particular the track record of success  
of previous claims.

GAN PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 45 5. Segmental information
Information reported to the Group’s Chief Executive, the strategic chief operating decision maker, for the purposes of resource allocation  
and assessment of the Group’s segmental performance is primarily focused on the origination of the revenue stream. The Group’s operating 
segments under IFRS 8 are therefore as follows:
• Real money gaming operations (RMG)
• Simulated Gaming™ operations (SIMGAM)
In the prior year the Group reported principal statements of B2B and B2C. The current distinction between segments has been agreed by  
the Board in light of the continued strategic move towards a B2B only market and the relative insignificance of the B2C operation, and reflects  
the management reporting to the chief operating decision maker. The comparative segmental reporting has been restated to reflect the above 
operating segments.

The accounting policies of the reportable segments follow the same policies as described in note 2. Segment result represents the gross profit 
earned by each segment without allocation of the share of administration costs including directors’ salaries, finance costs and income tax expense. 
This is the measure reported to the Group’s Chief Executive for the purpose of resource allocation and assessment of segment performance.
Administration expenses comprise principally the employment and office costs incurred by the Group.
Segment assets and liabilities
Assets and liabilities are not separately analysed or reported to the Group’s Chief Executive and are not used to assist in decisions surrounding 
resource allocation and assessment of segment performance. As such, an analysis of segments and liabilities has not been included in this

12. Trade and other receivables continued
Standard credit terms are 60 days. Debtor days at each year end were:
At 
31 December 
2017
At 
31 December 
2016
Debtor days (Group and Company) 38 days 82 days
Debtor days is calculated by dividing the total sales invoices raised in the year, less credit notes, by the trade receivable outstanding at year end, 
multiplied by the number of days in the year.
In determining the recoverability of trade receivables the Group considers any change in the credit quality of the receivable from the date credit 
was granted up to the reporting date. As set out in note 15, credit risk is mitigated by the fact that:
• management monitors the debtor ledger closely on a frequent basis; and
• a significant proportion of the Group’s customers are either large, publicly listed companies or owned by such entities.
Of the trade and other receivables financial instruments as at 31 December 2017, the Group does not have a concentration of credit 
risk exposure to a single counterparty (2016: £nil). 
The following trade and other receivable amounts were held in foreign currencies. The remaining balance was denominated in UK Pound Sterling (£).

In April 2017, the Group raised £2.0m following issue of 2,001,483 £1 convertible unsecured loan notes. The loan notes have an interest rate 
of 9% payable quarterly in arrears from 1 January 2018, with redemption in April 2022. During the period interest of £30,000 was accrued in 
relation to the loan notes. 
The directors do not believe there is any equity component of the convertible loan notes as the interest rate reflects the fair value of the debt 
and therefore the loan note is treated as a liability.

15. Financial instruments
The Group is exposed to the risks that arise from its use of financial instruments. This note describes the objectives, policies and processes  
of the Group for managing those risks and the methods used to measure them. Further quantitative information in respect of these risks is 
presented throughout this financial information.
Capital risk management
The Group’s capital structure is comprised entirely of shareholders’ equity. 
The Group’s objective when managing capital is to maintain adequate financial flexibility to preserve its ability to meet financial obligations, 
both current and long term. The capital structure of the Group is managed and adjusted to reflect changes in economic conditions.
The Group funds its expenditures on commitments from existing cash and cash equivalent balances. There are no externally imposed  
capital requirements.
Financing decisions are made by the Board of Directors based on forecasts of the expected timing and level of capital and operating 
expenditure required to meet the Group’s commitments and development plans.
Principal financial instruments
The principal financial instruments used by the Group, from which financial instrument risk arises are as follows:
• Trade and other receivables
• Trade and other payables
• Convertible debt
• Cash and cash equivalents

The Group’s directors monitor and manage the financial risks relating to the operation of the Group. These risks include market risk  
(including foreign currency risk and interest rate risk), credit risk and liquidity risk.
Market risk
The Group’s activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
56 GAN PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 15. Financial instruments continued
Foreign currency risk management
The Group has exposure to foreign currency risk. Sales invoicing to customers is in UK Pound Sterling, United States Dollars and Euros  
and the majority of outgoing payments are in UK Pound Sterling and United States Dollar payments.
The Board carefully monitors exchange rate fluctuations and reviews their impact on the net assets and position of the Group. Exchange  
rates are negotiated with the Group’s main provider of banking services as and when needed. The Group does not enter into any derivative 
financial instruments to manage its exposure to foreign currency risk.
The carrying amount of the Group’s foreign currency denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities and details of the exposure  
at 31 December 2016 and 2017 are shown in notes 12, 13 and 14.
At each year end, if the United States Dollar, Euro and Australian Dollar had weakened by 10% and by 20% against the UK Pound Sterling 
with all other variables held constant, post tax loss for the year would have (increased)/decreased by:

At 31 December 2016 (354) (570)
At 31 December 2017 (312) (560)
10% to 20% is the sensitivity rate range that represents management’s assessment of the reasonable possible change in foreign exchange rates. 
The sensitivity analysis includes only outstanding foreign currency denominated monetary items and adjusts their translation at the year end 
for a 10% and a 20% change in foreign currency rates. A positive version of the numbers above indicates an increase in profit or other equity 
where the UK Pound Sterling strengthens by 10% and 20% against the relevant currency. For a 10% or 20% weakening of the UK Pound 
Sterling against the relevant currency, there would be an equal and opposite impact on the profit and other equity.
The differences are mainly as a result of foreign exchange gains/losses on translation of United States Dollar trade and other payables and Euro 
denominated trade and other receivables. 10% is deemed appropriate for the foreign exchange sensitivity analysis due to the current financial market.
Interest rate risk management
The Group has minimal exposure to interest rate risk. It is exposed to interest rate risk on some of its financial assets being its cash at bank 
balances. The interest rate receivable on these balances was at an average rate of 0.3% during the year to 31 December 2017 (31 December 
2016: 0.3%). The Group also has convertible loan notes in issue which incur a fixed interest rate of 9%. The directors currently believe that 
interest rate risk is at an acceptable level.
Due to its minimum exposure to interest rate risk, the Group has not prepared any sensitivity analysis.
Credit risk
Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group. Credit risk 
arises principally from the Group’s cash balances and trade and other receivables. The concentration of the Group’s credit risk is considered  
by counterparty, geography and currency.
The Group gives careful consideration to which organisations it uses for its banking services in order to minimise credit risk. The Group  
has a significant concentration of cash held on deposit with one large bank in the UK, an institution with an A2 credit rating (long term, as 
assessed by Moody’s). The amounts of cash held on deposit with that bank at each reporting date can be seen in the financial assets table.
An allowance for impairment is made where there is an identified loss event which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction  
in the recoverability of the cash flows, although there have been no such impairments over the review year. Management considers the above 
measures to be sufficient to control the credit risk exposure.
Liquidity risk management
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting its financial obligations as they fall due. Ultimate responsibility  
for liquidity risk management rests with the Board of directors. The Board manages liquidity risk by regularly reviewing the Group’s cash 
requirements by reference to short term cash flow forecasts and medium term working capital projections prepared by management. 
Convertible loan notes in issue with a fixed interest rate of 9% are not payable until 2022.
At 31 December 2017 the Group had £2.7m (31 December 2016: £3.2m) of cash reserves.
Maturity of financial assets and liabilities
With the exception of the lease deposits in note 12 and deferred consideration in note 14, all of the Group’s non derivative financial 
liabilities and its financial assets in the years to 31 December 2017 and 2016 are either payable or receivable within one year.

18. Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity shareholders of the Company by the weighted average  
number of ordinary shares in issue during the year. 
Diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding to assume conversion  
of all dilutive potential ordinary shares. The Company has issued convertible debt and a calculation is done to determine the number of shares 
that could have been acquired at fair value (determined as the average market share price for the period) based on the monetary value of the 
subscription rights attached to the outstanding share options. All share options are anti-dilutive at the current and prior year reporting dates 
and the number of shares calculated as above is compared with the number of shares that would have been issued assuming the exercise of  
the share options.
