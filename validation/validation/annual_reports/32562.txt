One year on
In our first Annual Report as U+I, we told you  
about a business with a vision to create  
long-lasting positive change for communities

What underpins this is our genuine passion for unlocking 
the potential of undervalued urban sites, transforming  
them into thriving communities and neighbourhoods.
At the end of our second year, we are on our way  
to achieving our ambitious targets with a focus on  
value creation and a clear strategy to get us there.

We are highly ambitious, not for ambition’s sake, but 
because we are clear about the need for the regeneration

As our business expands and develops, the combination 
of our operational focus and our financial model will 
deliver consistent, long-term value, driven by a dynamic 
blend of development, trading and investment activity.

We have a talent for buying well and delivering value through 
planning and development. We focus on opportunities where 
our size and expertise afford us competitive advantage. We 
are experts in managing the complexities of the planning system 
to deliver high quality, mixed-use regeneration projects. 
With a track record of over 25 years of investment and 
development, and a diverse team of property experts, our  
£6 billion portfolio contains a mixture of longer-term large-
scale regeneration projects, shorter-term trading 
opportunities and investment assets (see pages 22 to 39). 
This combination of projects allows us to generate consistent 
returns and income through the property cycles. 
We have an equity-efficient approach to development, whereby 
we limit our financial exposure through the Public Private  
Partnership (PPP) model (see pages 28 to 31). This reduces 
our risk exposure in any one individual project whilst allowing 
us to build a portfolio with significant upside potential.
Our activity is focused on three core geographical areas – the 
London City Region*, Manchester and Dublin – where we 
see liquidity and sufficient depth through the cycle as well as 
growth in demand. These locations have the talent, tenants 
and tourism to succeed. 
Placing people at the heart of everything we do, we are 
committed to delivering profitable projects that create a legacy 
and deliver socio-economic change for the communities in 
which we work (see pages 48 to 54).

A NEW CHAPTER FOR THE

This central London site, which overlooks the River 
Thames and the Houses of Parliament, is teeming with 
history and importance. First constructed in 1937,  
this Grade II listed building was originally the 
headquarters of the London Fire Brigade before 
becoming the home to Lambeth fire station. 
Our plans for 8 Albert Embankment will take the site 
into the next chapter of its life. We are completely 
redesigning the space to create a modern, fit-for-
purpose fire station and training yard within a wider 
mixed-use regeneration project, delivering a new 
landmark for London.

In this way, we learn more about the heritage and reality 
of these places and build deeper relationships with 
local communities. Ultimately, this allows us to develop
better proposals, more suited to the local context
resulting in a smoother, more successful journey through

U and I Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017  
This is my first statement as Chairman of U+I and I am 
pleased to report another solid set of annual results. 
We delivered a headline profit before tax and exceptional 
items of £0.4 million and development and trading gains 
of £35.0 million. These are profits realised from sales made 
during the year that demonstrate U+I’s highly effective 
origination activity, coupled with an ability to add value 
through the planning and development process.
The results are noteworthy, given the impact of the UK’s 
decision to leave the EU, following the referendum in June 
2016. In the months following that referendum, a pall of 
uncertainty hung over the property market, as investment 
decisions were delayed and activity stalled. More 
normalised conditions have begun to return but the 
environment remains unpredictable. 
At U+I, however, we are optimistic about the future and 
our ability to proactively drive value and generate strong 
cash flows as evidenced by the Board declaring a third 
consecutive supplemental dividend in addition to our 
ordinary dividend. 
There are strong grounds for our positive outlook, which 
reflect why I am excited to be chairing this company. U+I 
is distinctive. It stands out within the property sector both 
in what it does and the way it does it. The Group takes a 
creative approach to real estate. We dare to challenge the 
status quo and, as a result, we win business that others 
don’t and deliver results that others can’t. 
With my background in cutting-edge retail, these are 
attributes that I recognise and appreciate. They are already 
helping U+I to generate momentum, as evidenced by the 
four major regeneration projects that the Company won 
last year. These will not only deliver sustainable value; they 
are also an endorsement of U+I’s approach, strategy and 
growing reputation among public sector decision-makers. 
U+I’s focus on mixed-use regeneration makes sense on 
many levels. It chimes with government policy to deliver 
more homes and jobs, improve productivity and stimulate 
local communities. It encourages better use of brownfield 
and public land, which is in vast supply. It supports 
pressurised local authorities and public bodies in their  
drive to deliver the regeneration that their communities 
need but with limited resource to do so. It responds to 
consumer demand for mixed-use environments where they 
can live, work, play and study. It delivers tangible socio-
economic benefits and it creates value for shareholders. 
It is particularly inspiring to see the way that the U+I team 
approaches these projects. There is real care and conviction, 
a desire to build true partnerships with local communities 
and decision-makers but also a rigorous focus on risk 
management and value creation for shareholders. 
The Group’s portfolio, with a Gross Development Value 
(GDV) of £6 billion, is anchored by large-scale Public Private 
Partnership (PPP) projects, balanced with shorter-term 
trading activity to produce regular, consistent returns. 
These projects give us visibility on a pipeline that stretches 
to 2020 and beyond, with over £150 million of gains set to 
be delivered in the next three years. 
The investment portfolio is transitioning to a focus on 
regeneration to support development and trading activities, 
improve performance and drive stronger returns. And our 
specialist platforms are designed to leverage our equity 
and intellectual capital to drive growth and maximise 
financial efficiency. This spread of activity – with assets in 
the London City Region*, Manchester and Dublin – provides 
welcome diversification and several routes to value creation. 
In my nine months as Chairman, Matthew and Richard have 
continued to knit this company together, strengthen the 
team and create a unified whole. The energy, enthusiasm 
and drive across the business are palpable and symptomatic 
of a company that is progressing at pace. 
U+I’s values – audacity, imagination and intelligence – are 
rare in the property industry. Yet this Company lives by 
these values with integrity. It has the imagination to visualise 
a better, brighter future for the places in which it works. It 
has the audacity to make those transformations real. And 
it has the intelligence to know what is worth striving for. 
I am pleased and proud to see what the Group has achieved 
so far and I am confident that the team are developing 
a strong, sustainable and successful business.

CONFIDENT IN  
OUR AMBITIOUS 
TARGETS

U and I Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017  
As I look back over the past year, I am proud of what 
we have achieved and even more excited about what 
is yet to come. We are making measurable progress in 
our ambition to build a sustainable business, centred 
on mixed-use regeneration. These projects respond 
to real needs within our society and they are recognised 
as a priority by central and local government. There 
are growing opportunities in the regeneration market 
within which we play a leading role, with a strengthening 
competitive advantage in our chosen regions. 
In the year to February 2017, we delivered development 
and trading profits of £35.0 million (2016: £51.5 million)  
and a profit before tax and exceptional items of  
£0.4 million (2016: £25.8 million). The reduction in profit 
before tax was principally caused by a lower level of 
development and trading gains, a negative valuation 
performance of our investment portfolio in H1 and  
lower rental income as we disposed of non-core assets 
from our investment portfolio. After paying £17.4 million  
of dividends (13.9 pence per share) our net asset value 
(NAV) decreased to £347.6 million/278 pence per share 
(2016: £363.3 million/291 pence per share). 
The Board has recommended the payment of a final 
dividend of 3.5 pence per share payable on 17 August 2017 
to all shareholders on the register on 21 July 2017 bringing 
the total dividend for the financial year to 5.9 pence per 
share. In addition, we will pay a supplemental dividend of 
2.8 pence per share on 16 June 2017 to all shareholders 
on the register on 12 May 2017. This will be the third 
supplemental dividend paid to shareholders in the past 
three years and underlines our confidence in continuing to 
generate strong cash flows from our development and 
trading activities. 
Navigating the market
I am particularly pleased with our performance, given  
the unusual and unpredictable economic and political 
backdrop. The decision, last June, to leave the EU 
temporarily stalled the UK property market, creating 
headwinds throughout the summer and beyond. Although 
we have seen little evidence of a permanent impact on 
prices, we have experienced delays on the realisation of 
a number of projects as businesses paused to assess the 
revised environment. 
Looking ahead, even as market conditions remain deeply 
uncertain, we are confident that we can make significant 
progress. The need for creative, well-executed regeneration 
projects is clear. The UK faces a growing structural housing 
deficit, while consumers increasingly favour mixed-use  
real estate, where they can live, work, play and forge real 
communities. These are the schemes that U+I is  
focused on and where we are developing an increasingly 
competitive edge. 
Strengthening our portfolio 
During the year, we were highly focused, concentrating 
on: growing our portfolio of larger projects; improving our 
investment portfolio; and building efficient, capital-light 
specialist platforms. Our ambition remains unchanged: to 
generate robust, long-term, sustainable growth, quantified 
by our target to achieve annual post-tax total returns of 12 
per cent in the next three years. 
This ambition is centred on delivering a balance of PPP 
and trading projects, with a focus on mixed-use regeneration 
schemes in our chosen regions: the London City Region, 
Manchester and Dublin. Winning large, complex projects 
is a crucial element of our strategy and they are the 
foundations around which our business is based. 
Against that backdrop, winning four large-scale PPP 
projects during the year was particularly pleasing, namely 
8 Albert Embankment, Cockpit Yard and the Westminster 
Industrial Estate in London, and Mayfield in Manchester. 
These projects were won in competitive situations, 
underscoring our growing reputation in the mixed-use 
regeneration space. They add more than £1.5 billion of 
Gross Development Value (GDV) to our portfolio and an 
additional £90 million of development and trading gains to 
our pipeline in 2020 and beyond. 
These projects also indicate the extent to which U+I is 
functioning as a single, unified Group, capable of winning 
business that we would not have been able to secure in 
the past. Mayfield alone is valued at £850 million, testament 
to our ability to take on even the most sizeable regeneration 
projects. Notably too, these partnerships are built on trust 
and quality of execution, developed over the long term by 
forming genuine partnerships with public bodies and local 
communities. This blend of skill and reputation creates high 
barriers to entry, only overcome through genuine 
commitment and proven results. 
The £35.0 million of development and trading gains that 
we delivered this year were achieved through consistent

continued
effort and hard work on a number of projects. In each case, 
we have delivered tangible gains by buying well and then 
adding value through the planning and development 
processes. The full breakdown of projects that underpin 
this year’s gains is provided in the portfolio review. I am 
particularly proud of these results, which reflect genuine 
value uplift, evidenced by cash profits. 
I have every confidence that we will produce a record result 
in the current year, targeting £65-£70 million of development 
and trading gains. Over the next three years, we are 
targeting more than £150 million of gains. 
I am optimistic too about our investment portfolio, which 
is being steadily realigned to reflect the Group’s strategic 
focus on regeneration. Having assessed each of the assets 
within this portfolio, we are progressing the disposal of 
non-core assets, optimising the value of those we are 
retaining and reinvesting in new assets that make best use 
of our regeneration expertise.
During the year, we formed two specialist platforms – 
strategic joint ventures with majority capital partners. 
In August 2016, we signed a £200 million joint venture 
agreement with Proprium Capital Partners to secure 
income-generating assets in the London City Region. 
In November, we formed a €300 million partnership 
with Colony NorthStar, focused on adding value to 
underperforming office buildings in London, Manchester 
and Dublin. These platforms give us the ability to acquire 
and deliver projects off balance sheet, leveraging our equity 
and intellectual capital, whilst generating fees to the 
business which offset overhead. In effect, they enable us 
to do more than we could on our own.
A market-leading team
None of this would be possible without our people. This 
year, we formed our Executive Committee (ExCo), a step 
that should tangibly improve the way we do business and 
the results we achieve. Created to support the Company’s 
development, the ExCo is responsible for implementing 
our strategy on a day to day basis. As such, this committee 
plays a central role in helping the business to deliver results 
today and to ensure it is positioned for growth tomorrow. 
We have selectively strengthened this team with the 
appointment of Mark Richardson as Head of Delivery and 
Brenda Bates as Head of Communications and Business 
Services. Mark, previously pre-construction director at 
Laing O’Rourke, has worked on some of the most prestigious 
projects in London, whilst Brenda, who joined U+I from the 
World Gold Council, brings significant strategic expertise. 
We have also strengthened our team in Manchester with 
the appointment of experienced development professionals 
to oversee our Mayfield regeneration site, deepening our 
roots in this city.

U and I Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 While our senior people provide direction within our 
Company, they are supported by an experienced team 
bringing talent, enthusiasm and energy to the projects we 
undertake. Our work is not easy – if it were, we would not 
be in the unique position we are in – combining long-term 
regeneration, short-term trading and investment. But our 
work is exciting, audacious and rewarding. It demands 
intelligence and imagination. It delivers tangible change. 
As a result, we attract people at every level who share our 
vision, our desire for progress and our commitment to 
delivering returns both to our investors and the communities 
in which we work.
Well-positioned for the future
Our team’s energy and combination of skills will help us 
achieve our targets this year and beyond: growing our 
pipeline, driving value, delivering returns and maintaining 
capital efficiency. 
Having built a substantial regeneration platform, we are in 
a position where we can remain selective about the future 
projects we take on. We have a range of specific criteria 
that need to be satisfied before we consider new projects 
and we will only undertake those where we can deliver 
meaningful social change and significant shareholder value.
Looking ahead, I am optimistic that we can succeed in our 
ambitions. We operate in markets that will continue to grow, 
where we have built a genuine competitive advantage that 
will only intensify over time. We operate an equity-efficient 
model, designed to minimise balance sheet risk and 
maximise shareholder returns. As our business expands 
and develops, the combination of our operational leverage 
and our financial model should deliver consistent, long-term 
value, driven by a dynamic blend of development, trading 
and investment activity. 
We are highly ambitious, not for ambition’s sake, but 
because we are clear about the need for these projects; 
we are proud of our ability to deliver them and we understand 
the value, both financial and social, that can be generated 
from them. Our targets are stretching but, based on the 
work we have done so far, the team that we have created, 
the relationships we have built and the pipeline of 
opportunities ahead, I am confident of success.

U and I Group PLC  Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Our markets
The property market might have been 
expected to slump against such an 
unpromising backdrop – and certainly 
Brexit had a significant impact, with 
Q3 2016 being characterised by limited 
transactional activity. 
However, during Q4 2016, activity 
started to return and confidence grew, 
following a series of unexpectedly 
strong economic indicators. GDP 
growth was better than forecast,  
while consumer spending and  
business optimism were both greater 
than expected. 
In recent months, however, some 
worrying signs have begun to emerge. 
UK GDP growth is slowing, inflation 
is rising and wages are static, all 
trends that we expect to intensify  
during 2017. 
Business investment has been 
disappointing for several months and 
is likely to continue in that vein. The 
quarterly Deloitte CFO survey – a key 
measure of business confidence – 
shows that most finance directors 
would still prefer to retain cash than  
invest it in new projects. This is unlikely 
to change as Brexit negotiations  
get underway.
And consumers, who have buoyed the 
UK economy for years, are under 
pressure. Household budgets are 
being squeezed by the rising cost of 
everyday goods, as wage growth 
remains elusive. This creates a further 
challenge for retailers, many of which 
are already struggling as e-commerce 
becomes ever more prevalent and 
business rates rise. 
Opportunities remain
Despite these challenging conditions, 
our competitive advantages remain 
strong and we are confident that plenty 
of opportunities exist for us to make 
rewarding investments and generate 
value for our stakeholders. 
Our optimism is tempered with caution. 
We have raised our required rate of 
return on new projects and we  
have become even more forensic  
in our due diligence. However, a 
number of factors contribute to our 
sense of optimism – factors that hold  
This time last year, amid a multitude of 
economic, financial and social concerns, 
one specific issue stood out – the 
referendum on EU membership and the 
impact of a vote to leave. 
Today, Brexit is a fact of life. The full effects 
of that decision have yet to be  
felt but the UK has triggered Article 50 
and departure from the EU is inevitable. 
A challenging  
backdrop
10
U and I Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 good today and are likely to persist  
for several years in our core  
markets of the London City Region, 
Manchester and Dublin. 
Commercial – pockets of potential
Within the commercial property  
space, the cycle is at a point where 
rents are broadly stable and yields 
static but where construction costs 
are rising. Against this, development 
has been limited for almost a decade 
so the supply of office space is tight 
and vacancies are low. We believe 
there are some broad themes that will 
provide opportunities. 
First, there is a growing demand for 
interesting, high quality office space. 
With low unemployment, companies 
are striving to attract and retain top 
talent – dynamic, inspiring office  
space that encourages collaboration 
is one important way of doing so. 
Second, the growth of the gig 
economy is changing the work 
environment, driving demand for 
shared offices, both for individuals and 
for companies seeking flexible space. 
Third, investors the world over are 
searching for income-producing assets. 
Sterling’s weakness has enhanced the 
appeal of UK assets and this trend is 
likely to continue as long as the value 
of Sterling does not plummet. It is also 
worth noting that property yields 
remain materially above those of ten-
year gilts – as long as this continues, 
UK commercial real estate will remain 
an attractive investment. 
Looking ahead, rising construction  
costs and an uncertain economic 
environment are likely to limit the  
supply of central London office 
development. According to some 
estimates, construction costs 
increased by almost 20 per cent in 
2016, driven by rising commodity 
prices, wage inflation and a stronger 
Dollar (JP Morgan Cazenove, 
European Property review February 
2017). Our bias towards suburban 
London should shield us from this 
given that demand is growing but 
supply is weak – in outer London  
1.6 million sq. ft. of office space  
is required and only 700,000 sq. ft.  
is set to be delivered in the next  
five years (Savills). This presents  
clear opportunities for our office-
repositioning platform with Colony 
NorthStar, which focuses on reviving 
and reworking tired office buildings 
rather than new build office space, a 
process that is quicker to deliver and 
involves less cost risk. 
Retail – an experiential movement
The retail market has changed 
dramatically over the past decade, as 
e-commerce becomes a way of life 
and consumers become increasingly 
promiscuous about where, when and 
how they shop. 
The challenges facing retailers are 
exacerbated by shifting spending 
patterns, as consumers become  
more demanding, leaning towards 
experiences, rather than material 
possessions, and are happy to rent or 
share goods and services, rather than 
buy them outright. Such trends are 
making their presence felt across all 
demographics, but they are particularly 
prevalent among millennials. 
Against this backdrop, retailers are 
having to think carefully about where 
they are physically located, what  
they offer discerning consumers and 
how their offer is presented. 
Convenience, experience and value 
are all critical and across the board, 
retailers are challenged with working 
hard and thinking differently to attract 
and retain customers.
Our retail assets benefit from  
these trends, offering convenient 
experiences in attractive environments. 
Created as part of a bigger mixed-use 
environment, these developments are 
designed to capture growth in footfall 
over the long term as the quality of  
place improves. 
Interestingly too, local authorities are 
moving into this sector, purchasing 
assets such as shopping centres, in a 
bid to generate long-term income and 
influence the culture and soul of their 
towns. This is likely to have a material 
impact on the market and should 
benefit developers and owners of town 
centre leisure and retail developments, 
such as U+I, by creating a new form 
of investment demand. 
Residential – persistent demand 
at the right price point
The outlook for mid-market residential 
space remains strong. Both the UK  
and Ireland suffer from a structural 
supply deficit, a situation that will not 
change in the near term without a  
rapid supply response. 
The mismatch between demand and 
supply is particularly acute in the 
London City Region, but it is also 
apparent in Manchester and Dublin. 
The UK Government’s Housing White 
Paper may encourage an increase in 
supply over the long term but it is 
unlikely to have a material impact in 
the next few years. 
Across the UK, 225,000-275,000 new 
homes are required per annum to keep 
up with population growth. In 2015, 
around 168,000 new homes were built 
(DCLG). The gap between supply and 
demand persists. 
11
Strategic report + Corporate governance + Financial statements
U and I Group PLC  Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Our markets
continued
At the top end of the market, prices 
have come down and activity has 
slowed. However, well-located, 
affordable homes in the London 
suburbs continue to see strong 
demand and single digit price 
increases. Demand is both from end 
users and housebuilders wanting 
‘shovel-ready’ projects which we are 
able to deliver through our planning 
expertise. This mid-market sector is a 
key focus for U+I. 
London – a booming capital 
London remains a booming metropolis 
and the main driver of UK economic 
growth. In 2015, London’s gross value 
added per head was £43,629, more 
than double the national average 
(Office for National Statistics) and 
London’s economy is forecast to 
continue growing by a minimum of  
two per cent per year (Greater  
London Authority). 
Within the commercial market, the 
capital has reduced its reliance on 
financial services in recent years  
and become a TMT hub. Not only is 
home-grown tech talent blossoming 
in London but Apple, Snapchat, 
Google and Facebook have all taken 
space in the city, highlighting its 
resilience in a post-Brexit world. 
On the residential front, the  
city is growing by around 100,000 
people a year, a trend that will  
continue regardless of Brexit. That 
growth requires 40,000 – 50,000  
new residential units per annum and  
these are simply not being built. 
Demand is particularly strong within 
suburban locations and the sub-
£600,000 price points where we focus 
our regeneration efforts. 
Our focus on the London City Region 
– a catchment area that includes 
satellite towns within an hour’s 
commute of Central London – is well 
placed as we believe that it will 
continue to be the dominant force 
within the UK economy.
Manchester – the UK’s second city
Increasingly acknowledged as the 
UK’s second city, Manchester is 
now the third most influential city in 
Europe, according to the latest 
Cities  of Influence report from 
Colliers International. 
THESE TRENDS  
SUPPORT U+I’S FOCUS  
ON WELL-LOCATED, 
ATTRACTIVE AND HIGH 
QUALITY DEVELOPMENTS, 
PRIMARILY FORWARD-
FUNDED BY LONG-TERM 
CAPITAL PARTNERS. 
That position is hard won, reflecting 
strong leadership from the city council 
and a determined effort to create 
quality places to live and work. The 
council’s strategy has created a 
virtuous circle, which is changing 
perceptions of Manchester and driving 
demand for both office and residential 
real estate. 
The commercial office market has 
been strong for the past three years 
and demand is increasing, reaching 
its highest level since 2010 in the final 
quarter of 2016 (Manchester Office 
Agents Forum). 
Looking ahead, Manchester is 
expected to retain and consolidate its 
reputation as a leading European city, 
bolstered by continued efforts to 
improve the city’s commercial and 
residential infrastructure. Our 
regeneration of the Mayfield site will 
play a key role in the evolution of the 
Manchester Piccadilly area, acting as 
a catalyst for the regeneration of the 
wider city. 
Dublin – shining bright
In 2016, Ireland was yet again the 
fastest growing economy in the EU, 
delivering GDP growth of 5.2 per cent. 
Dublin is the key driver of that growth. 
Widely seen as an appealing city with 
strong links to the US, it benefits from 
a well thought out corporate tax policy 
which has attracted large numbers of 
international businesses in recent 
years. Dublin has already established 
itself as an international hub, ranked 
third in the FDI Global Cities of the  
Future and tenth in the Global Talent 
Competitiveness Index. 
Last year alone, global tech companies, 
including Microsoft, announced 
expansion plans in the city. Notably 
too, once Brexit takes place, Dublin 
will be the only major English-speaking 
city in the EU, a factor that should play 
in its favour. 
Commercial property investment is 
buoyant in the city, with Dublin ranked 
as a top five European city for property 
investment for the fourth consecutive 
year (Society of Chartered Surveyors, 
Ireland, Residential & Commercial 
Property Outlook 2017). Supply is 
increasing but rental rates are expected 
to continue rising this year before 
stabilising thereafter. 
As the city grows and its economy 
develops, the need for housing 
intensifies. Ireland is suffering from  
a national housing crisis, the 
Government is under pressure to 
address this and Dublin faces a 
substantial deficit of new homes. In 
the first nine months of 2016, fewer 
than 3,500 houses were completed, 
less than half the number required to 
address the current shortage. 
12
U and I Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Mixed-use projects – a growing need
Society is changing. Globalisation, technological 
advances and growing inequality are giving rise to 
tensions and pressures. Static wages, highly priced 
properties and a dearth of new supply have put home 
ownership increasingly out of reach. 
These developments are both unwelcome and potentially 
dangerous, as both central and local government 
increasingly recognise. Against this backdrop, consumer 
demand is also changing – people no longer want to 
live in one area, work in another and spend their leisure 
time somewhere else again. 
The mixed-use regeneration schemes that we deliver 
are designed to address these issues – providing the 
buzz of urban life within the more affordable areas of 
the London City Region, Manchester and Dublin, where 
people can live, work and play.
For local authorities and public landowners, mixed-use 
regeneration schemes offer the opportunity to rebuild 
communities and generate much-needed revenue. 
Forward-looking local authorities are increasingly 
interested in partnering with trusted developers, such 
as ourselves, to create projects in which they can have 
a direct long-term stake. The benefits for both public 
and private partners are significant. For our partners: 
revitalised places, valuable community assets, profit 
shares, business rates. For U+I: access to valuable, 
high-quality sites and the ability to generate substantial 
socio-economic value and financial returns. 
These agreements can be highly productive for  
both parties but they require trust. We have gained a 
hard-won reputation for creating quality spaces that 
stand the test of time and, importantly, delivering high 
quality results.
Demand for mixed-use regeneration schemes is widely 
expected to remain strong, boosted by social and 
structural change. This is U+I’s chosen sector and it is 
a sector in which we have already proven our ability. No 
real estate company is immune to the outside world but 
the space in which U+I operates is likely to remain 
relevant and in demand for years to come.

Sheet with appropriate gearing levels and a sizeable cash 
buffer to keep us stable throughout the property cycle.
The creation of specialist platforms allows us to deliver 
projects in a capital-efficient manner through joint ventures 
with majority capital partners. These generate management 
fees which enable us to offset overhead costs and to 
monetise the land within our portfolio.
In November 2016 we 
formed a JV with Colony 
Northstar Inc to target office 
repositioning opportunities 
in London, Manchester  
and Dublin. 
We also formed a JV with 
Proprium Capital Partners  
to target income-producing 
long-term development 
sites within the London  
City Region.

Our key performance indicators
The following KPIs are used by the 
Board to measure the success of the Group’s
performance against its strategic objectives
Development and trading gains 
Definition
Development and trading (D+T) gains are 
profits realised as we sell land and assets, 
having added value through planning, 
asset management or development. 
Comment 
In 2017 we delivered £35 million of D+T 
gains which was within our guidance 
range. The delivery of gains in FY2017 was 
impacted by the result of the EU 
referendum which delayed the realisation 
of a number of projects into FY2018. 
Remuneration linkage
D+T gains are the principal contributor  
to our total return, the key metric against 
which our Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) 
is determined. The level at which  
our LTIP vests relies on a consistent level 
of performance over a number of years, 
hence delivering a steady level of D+T 
gains is a key focus for the business.  
30% of the Directors’ annual bonus is 
determined by D+T gains being achieved 
within the range of guidance given at the 
start of each financial year.

Gains realised in 2017
£35.0m
Target
£50 million minimum per annum and 
a minimum of £150 million in the next

Investment portfolio total return 
Definition
The investment portfolio total return 
includes the capital growth and income 
growth realised during the financial year 
across our investment assets. 
Comment 
During the year, investment income 
reduced from £203.3 million to £179.2 
million as we disposed of a number of 
assets in line with our strategy. Values 
declined by 5.1% as a result of weakness 
in some of our secondary retail markets. 
As a result our investment portfolio 
total return was 1.7%. As outlined in 
our portfolio review, we are proactively 
transitioning our investment portfolio 
in order to drive growth and support 
our overall returns target.
Remuneration linkage
Our investment portfolio performance  
is a key driver of our NAV growth which 
underpins our LTIP. Improving the 
performance of our investment portfolio  
is a key focus for the Board.

Total returns
Definition
Total return is the growth in our basic NAV 
including dividends, and is the most direct 
way of measuring returns to shareholders 
during the year. 
Comment 
In 2017, we delivered a total return of 
0.2% due to the negative performance 
of our investment portfolio.
Remuneration linkage
Under the Group’s Remuneration Policy, 
the Directors’ LTIP is calculated according 
to a scale of total returns targets. As such, 
total return is considered a key 
performance measure for the Group.

Total return in 2017
0.2%
Target
12% per annum in the next three years.
Gearing
Definition
The Group seeks to maintain a 
conservative level of gearing appropriate 
to the size of our Balance Sheet in order  
to maintain capital efficiency. At certain 
points, the Group’s gearing may increase 
as a result of a higher level of construction  
debt against specific assets. However, 
construction finance is usually only ever 
secured on properties where the exit has 
been guaranteed through pre-sales or 
forward-funding. This enables us to 
maintain a low risk financial structure and 
to protect shareholder value throughout 
the property and economic cycles. 
Comment 
During the year, gearing fell from 44.4% 
to 34.8%. This was primarily driven by 
the disposal of the pre-sold residential 
units at Deptford in February 2016 and 
the subsequent repayment of the related 
debt facilities in March 2016. 
2017 Gearing
34.8%
Target
40-50% on balance sheet and 50-60% 
including our share of joint venture debt.

Risk management structure
The Group’s risk profile is maintained under continual  
review by its Audit and Risk Committee and by the Board. 
In addition, the Group has a Risk Management Committee, 
which oversees the Group’s risk register and risk control 
processes on behalf of the Audit and Risk Committee.  
The Risk Management Committee comprises senior 
employees from across the Group, covering all areas of 
the Group’s operations.
Mapping our risks
The Group categorises risks according to the likelihood of 
occurrence and the potential impact on the Group. The 
Directors consider the following to be the principal risks 
and uncertainties facing the Group.
These risks have been grouped as either:
 − External risks – whose occurrence is beyond the control 
of the Group; or
 − Business risks – which the Directors choose to manage 
as part of the Group’s operations.
18
U and I Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 EXTERNAL RISKS
RISK IMPACT MITIGATION
RISK EXPOSURE 
CHANGE YEAR  
ON YEAR
a. Market risk
The real estate market is 
directly linked to the health  
of the local, national and 
increasingly international 
economies. Lack of economic 
growth, recessionary conditions 
or economic uncertainty  
can translate into negative 
sentiment towards the 
performance of real estate.
 – Lack of liquidity available  
to prospective purchasers  
of completed projects may 
delay ability to realise 
planned disposals or reduce 
prices, leading to significantly 
reduced cash inflows. 
 – Higher occupier risk leading  
to significantly reduced values.
 – Lack of occupier demand 
resulting in inability to  
realise gains.
 – Risk-averse property 
development strategy 
whereby projects are 
pre-funded, pre-let, or 
pre-sold where appropriate. 
 – Long maturities of debt 
finance facilities.
 – Moderate level of gearing.
 – Regular meetings with 
economic forecasters to 
gauge economic trends. 
The UK economy remains 
supportive to our activities 
however, continuing 
political uncertainty following 
the result of the EU referendum 
and the triggering of Article 50 
by the UK Government, 
together with escalating 
geopolitical risks continue 
to overshadow the market.
b. Scarcity of viable 
investment and development 
opportunities
The Group’s business is 
predominantly transactional 
and requires a flow of PPP, 
trading and investment 
opportunities to generate 
consistent returns. The risk  
is that the flow of suitably 
priced opportunities either 
reduces or stops.
 – Inability to source new  
deals leads to decline in 
development and trading 
profits in future years.
 – Higher pricing of acquisition 
opportunities leads to 
reduced ability to add value.
 – Flexible approach to market 
opportunities, seeking out 
sectors where value can be 
generated and seeking 
funding partners with 
different return requirements.
 – Stringent deal underwriting 
procedures with minimum 
return hurdles.
 – Maintaining broad industry 
contacts for acquisitions 
rather than being dependent 
on a single source of 
opportunity. 
 – Use of PPP model to secure 
regeneration opportunities  
in an innovative way.
Opportunities continue  
to be sourced for 
development, trading and 
investment which satisfy  
Group underwriting criteria.
The Group is now focusing  
on increasing the number  
of short-term trading 
opportunities following the 
successful PPP wins during  
the year. Due to its deep 
relationships and acquisition 
expertise, the Group is able  
to source a steady stream of 
opportunities despite lower 
cost overseas capital making 
the market more ‘expensive’.
c. Counterparty risk
Transaction counterparties,  
be they joint venture partners, 
purchasers under sale 
contracts or banks in respect 
of cash deposits or derivative 
arrangements, may suffer  
or fail financially. 
 – Failure of sales transaction 
counterparties may lead to  
an inability to produce  
trading profits.
 – Failure of financial 
counterparties may impact  
on effectiveness of hedging 
or recoverability of deposits.
 – Proof of funding required 
prior to agreeing sales 
contracts. 
 – The Board regularly assesses 
the credit worthiness of 
financial counterparties  
prior to placing deposits  
and hedging transactions.
 – Substantial deposits are 
required for pre-sold 
residential developments. 
The Group continues 
to have exposure to the 
private residential market 
through the development 
of pre-sold residential units 
both on and  off balance 
sheet. The risk of purchasers 
failing to complete has not 
changed to any material 
extent during the year.
d. Bank funding risk
The pressure on a large number 
of traditional real estate lending 
banks to reduce their exposure 
to real estate reduces the 
capacity and liquidity within  
the lending market and can 
impact upon the availability of 
debt to deliver business plans.
 – Inability to secure funding  
for new opportunities.
 – Inability to refinance  
existing facilities leading  
to disposals at the wrong 
time in business plans and 
failing to maximise profits.
 – Unpredictability of cash flows.
 – Inability for buyers  
to complete.
 – The Group maintains 
relationships with a  
wide range of both bank  
and non-bank lenders, 
reducing over reliance  
on any one partner.
 – The Group is constantly 
seeking to widen its range of 
funding sources and liaises 
with new entrants into the real 
estate lending market.
The lending market 
continues to see new 
entrants. Competitive 
pressures have led to a 
reduction in margins and an 
increase in maturities available. 
Through the year there has 
been a gradual reduction in 
lenders’ appetite for 
development risk particularly 
on a speculative basis post  
the EU referendum result.

BUSINESS RISKS:
RISK IMPACT MITIGATION
RISK EXPOSURE 
CHANGE YEAR  
ON YEAR
e. Construction risk
There is a risk of being unable 
to secure a viable construction 
contract post receipt of 
planning permission.
Real estate construction is 
subject to the risk of cost 
overruns, delay and the 
financial failure of an  
appointed contractor.
 – Reduced profitability or 
potential loss on individual 
projects and/or guarantees 
being called. 
 – Projects becoming unviable 
leading to loss of WIP.
 – Construction work ceasing 
whilst a suitable replacement 
contractor is found leading to 
delays in project completion 
and a reduction in profit.
 – The Group retains in-house 
experienced project managers 
throughout the life of individual 
projects to ensure that costs 
are appropriately budgeted, 
timetables are adhered to and 
hence the impact of these risks 
is minimised.
 – The Group performs 
appropriate pre-contract due 
diligence on the capabilities 
and financial security of its 
material contractors and key 
sub-contractors.
 – The Group continually monitors 
the financial position of key 
contractors to anticipate 
financial difficulties.
 – If issues arise with contractors, 
the Group uses its professional 
teams and in-house expertise 
to mitigate the impact.
 – The Group requires detailed 
design and specification 
throughout the tender process 
to enable it to maximise the 
risk transfer to contractors.
 – The Group requires that all 
construction contracts include 
provisions for Liquidated 
Ascertained Damages in the 
case of performance failures by 
contractors and that contractors 
provide performance bonds, 
typically to a level of 100% of 
the contract sum. 
Since the result of the EU 
referendum in June 2016, 
there has been a fall in the value 
of sterling against the Euro which 
has resulted in an increase in 
construction material prices.  
At the same time, construction 
workforce shortages and 
increasing labour costs are 
anticipated, reflecting 
uncertainty about the long-term 
status of EU nationals working 
in the UK. These are both 
impacting upon pricing and 
making the placement of 
construction contracts more 
difficult in terms of cost certainty 
with a resulting impact on margin.
Tender periods are also under 
pressure, as more detailed 
designs are required before a 
viable construction contract 
can be agreed.
The time and cost of provision 
of supporting off site 
infrastructure is often outside 
our direct control.
f. Planning risk
Procuring an appropriate and 
valuable planning consent is 
often a key element of the 
creation of value through 
property development.
Securing planning permission 
in a changing political and 
regulatory environment is  
a complex and uncertain 
process, with applications 
subject to objection from 
a wide range of potential 
stakeholders, and hence, 
consent is prone to delay, 
modification and rejection.
Even when consent has been 
granted, the time and cost taken 
to agree local infrastructure 
isses is impacted by a lack of 
capacity which can lead to 
considerable delays in 
implementing consent.
 – Failure to secure planning 
consent can either cause 
delay or render a project 
unviable/unprofitable and 
lead to the write off of 
considerable costs or 
reduced profit potential.
 – Delay in the period between 
consent and start on site  
can reduce profitability.
 – The Group retains a team  
with extensive experience of 
achieving planning consents 
and local knowledge, 
supplemented by advisors 
and sector specialist partners, 
to maximise the chance of 
success and reduce the risks 
and costs of failure.
 – An alternative exit strategy  
is always considered in case 
of planning failure. 
 – The Group’s PPP model seeks 
to build partnerships with 
local statutory and planning 
authorities as a way of 
mitigating risk.
The ability to obtain  
clear planning decisions  
is increasingly compromised  
by key political events such as 
the constant cycle of regional 
and national elections. It is  
also hampered by under- 
resourced planning 
departments. As projects  
and planning regulations 
become ever more complex, 
particularly where more dense 
mixed-use schemes are 
concerned, there is an urgent 
need to professionalise 
planning departments and 
decision making committees. 
This was ignored by the recent 
White Paper. 
20
U and I Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Introduction
U+I’s business model is to deliver returns through regeneration, realising 
profits by successfully repositioning undervalued land and assets into 
new places that deliver social and economic value to a wide range  
of stakeholders.
The key drivers in delivering the model are:
 − Ability to source a regular supply of new business opportunities 
which can deliver profits in future years.
 − Sourcing debt finance to leverage both new business opportunities 
and refinance existing facilities where appropriate.
 − Access to a wide range of capital partners to both co-invest in 
larger schemes and forward fund larger speculative developments.
 − Successfully delivering new planning permissions.
 − A high yielding investment portfolio generating a sustainable cash 
yield both to support business activities and sustain corporate 
overheads.
 − Maintaining a diversified portfolio of projects so as to reduce 
property specific risk across the overall portfolio.
Assessment period
The Group’s business planning process consists of a five-year look 
forward. The rationale for this is that the main driver of success is the 
generation of development and trading gains from projects, with the 
exception of two outliers:
 − Short-term pure trading and
 − Long-term land strategies
The majority of projects have a duration of between two and five years 
from acquisition to exit. Therefore from any starting point, over a five-
year period the vast majority of projects will have moved through to 
exit. To plan for a period longer than five years would lead to the 
construction of a purely theoretical model in years 5+ rather than one 
underpinned by specific existing projects in the initial five-year period.
Therefore for the purposes of this review, the business has been 
considered and stress tested over a five-year period.
Consideration of principal risks
The nature of the Group’s business and the industry in which it operates 
expose it to a variety of risks. The principal risks and uncertainties 
facing the Group are detailed on pages 18 to 20. The Board regularly 
reviews the principal risks and assesses the appropriate controls and 
mitigating actions required to manage the operations of the Group 
within an appropriate risk environment. The Board has further considered 
their impact within the context of the Group’s viability.
Assumptions
In assessing the long-term viability of the Group, the Board has made 
the following assumptions:
 − Property investment valuations continue to be broadly stable with 
no prolonged significant downwards movements.
 − The Group continues to be able to deliver cash backed development 
and trading gains from its existing portfolio of projects sufficient 
to meet its operational requirements, principally driven by securing 
new planning permissions.
 − The Group continues to be able to source new business opportunities 
capable of delivering both short-term trading gains and longer-term 
development gains to replace existing projects as they are exited.
 − The Group continues with its policy of having a mixture of long-term 
debt associated with its long-term investment portfolio and  
shorter-term stand-alone debt associated with its development 
and trading projects.
 − The Group continues, as it did throughout the previous recession, 
to be able to source both replacement and new debt facilities as 
they are required from both existing and new lenders.
 − The Group continues with its policy of maintaining a broad range 
of counterparties, including financial, contractor and purchaser, 
so as to mitigate the impact of potential counterparty failure.
 − The Group continues its policy of de-risking developments by 
obtaining forward-funding for larger schemes and only carrying 
out limited on balance sheet development.
 − Construction contracts are entered into on a guaranteed maximum 
price basis where possible.
The Group maintains its current conservative gearing strategy.
In addition, the Group’s five-year business model was stress tested 
to simulate either a deterioration in market conditions or a failure of 
these assumptions. In particular consideration was given to:
 − Persistent valuation falls of 2.5%, 5.0% and 10.0% per annum  
for each of the next five years and the resultant impact upon  
NAV, gearing covenants and cash levels i.e. a fall of 25% in  
property values.
 − Inability to win any new business opportunities over the next five 
years and hence the only profits that can be generated are from 
existing schemes.
 − Debt facilities were stress tested to see at what level of property 
valuation fall loan covenants would be breached and how much 
cash would be required to cure any loan covenant defaults.
Conclusion
As a result of the work performed above, including the consideration 
of the key assumptions and the subsequent stress testing, the Board 
believes that the Group’s strategy of maintaining a broad portfolio of 
development and trading projects, a core investment portfolio and a 
diverse range of financial and operational counterparties provides the 
Group with a strong platform on which to continue its business.
The Directors therefore have a reasonable expectation that the Group 
will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall 
due over the five-year period to February 2022.

DEVELOPING A 
LEADING EDGE
Richard Upton, Deputy Chief Executive photographed at Charlton
22
U and I Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017  
Regeneration can be hard work,  
particularly in the unloved, overlooked  
and neglected suburban areas in  
which we often work. It requires a blend 
of creativity, experience, understanding 
and integrity. 
But it is rewarding work – changing the  
lives of those who live and work in these 
revitalised places; inspiring public 
landowners who act as enablers for change 
and delivering value for shareholders,  
who benefit as we realise gains through 
planning and development. 
This is where U+I is building a leading edge. 
Projects that are all too often dismissed as 
dull and distant by Central London 
developers or considered too large and 
complicated for local or regional developers. 
Projects which require imagination, 
innovation and connection to unlock value.
For the Government, these projects are a 
priority and local authorities are under 
pressure to deliver them – in partnership 
with private sector developers. Given that 
these local authorities own £370 billion of 
developable land – 40 per cent of the total 
– the scale of the opportunity is immense, 
particularly in our chosen areas, the London 
City Region, Manchester and Dublin.
These cities are peppered with industrial 
and retail wastelands, overlooked spaces 
that can become thriving places, where 
people genuinely want to live and work.  
In essence, the sites are there and the  
need is clear – the need for affordable 
homes, the need to improve productivity, 
the need to stimulate local economies  
and drive value. Successful, mixed-use 
regeneration projects can address all these 
issues, while generating returns for our 
shareholders too. 
Not everyone can do this work and  
many have chosen not to – so how do we 
unlock potential and deliver value where 
others cannot? 
As seasoned property entrepreneurs, we 
hunt better than many, looking in places 
that have been ignored by others. As 
creative, imaginative thinkers, we see value 
in places that may not always be obvious 
to others. As responsible partners, we 
recognise that the best way to unlock 
potential is by engaging with communities 
and public bodies in a way that builds trust 
and understanding. 
PPP projects rely on trust and the more we 
prove our ability to deliver places of lasting 
value, the more we become a partner of 
23

Portfolio review
continued
choice for the public sector with whom we 
work, and the more we create barriers to 
entry for our competitors. And the more 
we foster that virtuous circle, the more 
opportunities come our way and the more 
we can deliver great places and long-
lasting shareholder value.  
Our portfolio, with a GDV of £6 billion, 
comprises a mix of major PPP projects, our 
trading schemes and investment assets, 
all centred on value creation through 
regeneration. This pipeline is well balanced, 
combining large-scale, longer-term PPP 
projects, which provide sustainable growth 
with shorter-term trading projects, which 
deliver consistent, strong cash flows. We 
have won four major projects in the past 
year. These give us a pipeline of growth 
stretching out to 2020 and beyond. 
Our portfolio also carries significant latent 
value, given that value enhancement  
within regeneration projects is not reflected 
in our NAV until profit is realised. 
The moving parts are many – buying well, 
having the imagination to see how the  
grey can be transformed to the great, and 
digging deep into the provenance of the 
places where we build to deliver schemes 
that are truly relevant to those who live and 
work there. We are not afraid to challenge 
convention in pursuit of the best results. 
We are not afraid to engage with local 
authorities and local people to build a true 
partnership. And we are not afraid to admit 
that we care about the outcome.
We made real progress this year and  
we intend to do even better as we move 
forward – unlocking potential to create 
value for our shareholders and the 
communities in which we work.

U and I Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 How we manage our portfolio
The mixed-use nature of our portfolio is one of our biggest 
advantages. It gives us several routes to market and 
different options for driving value from our projects. As 
outlined in the following diagram, we deliver growth as we 
realise gains from development and trading activity, and 
drive income and capital growth through our investment 
activities. Importantly, these portfolios are not run in 
isolation. By thinking about our portfolio as one, we apply 
our skills in land buying, planning, asset management and 
development across all of our projects, driving maximum 
value and creating more routes to market. 
For example, we hold income-producing assets with longer-
term regeneration potential within our investment portfolio 
that can ultimately feed our development pipeline 
(warehouse assets). We also retain elements of our 
completed developments within our investment portfolio  
where we see opportunities for medium to long-term  
asset management potential (retained assets). In this  
way, our investment activities feed our development 
activities and vice versa, capitalising on the mix of skills 
within the business.

The following table shows the main projects driving our development and trading gains for the year. The majority of 
these profits are driven by the value gain captured from planning improvements.  
PPP development
The PPP model reflects our core strengths as a business 
and is responding to a real need within the UK regeneration 
market. We are experts in this field in which there are 
significant barriers to entry. One of the keys to this form 
of development is that the public sector is not completely 
price sensitive. It is driven by its definition of ‘best value’ 
which differs from project to project. This plays to our 
strengths and focus on delivering places that put people 
at their heart and which embrace good design at their 
foundation. The mixed-use nature of these sites is also 
best suited to development partners such as ourselves 
with a 25-year track record of delivering complex urban 
regeneration projects. 
One of the benefits of the PPP model to U+I lies in the 
equity-light nature of these partnerships. Typically the 
public sector partner seeds the partnership with land and 
U+I applies its planning and development expertise to 
deliver a completed, regenerated place. Importantly, risk 
and equity is spread across the development phases  
as outlined in the facing diagram. U+I commits a  
maximum of £20 million of equity in any one project  
spread across the planning, viability and development 
phases and manages the associated risks. Ultimately, the 
public and private sector partners share in the profit 
delivered by the development. This allows us to control 
risk, limit our equity exposure in any one project and deliver 
large scale projects in a capital efficient manner. The details 
of this model are outlined in a case study on 8 Albert 
Embankment on p.30-31. 
This has been a highly successful year for the business, 
winning four PPP projects: 8 Albert Embankment, Mayfield, 
Cockpit Yard and Westminster Industrial Estate. These 
projects taken together have added more than £1.5 billion 
of GDV to our pipeline and further cemented our reputation 
as a leading regeneration developer and the public sector’s 
partner of choice.

U and I Group PLC  Annual Report and Accounts 2017 OUR BUSINESS IN ACTION: 8 ALBERT EMBANKMENT
In April 2016, we were given the mandate for the regeneration 
of 8 Albert Embankment in partnership with the London 
Fire and Emergency Planning Authority (LFEPA). The 
selection process was competitive, detailed and 
challenging, given the status of this project and the high 
expectations from LFEPA to deliver a transformational 
project. During the bid process, we were assessed 
alongside other leading regeneration developers and 
contractors. We were highly commended, and ultimately 
selected, based on our approach to placemaking and 
community consultation, two areas that really separated 
us from our competitors.  
LFEPA has seeded the partnership with a 2.5 acre site next 
to the River Thames and overlooking the Houses of 
Parliament. This has allowed us to secure a prime 
regeneration opportunity with limited upfront equity. The 
site has been home to Lambeth fire station and the Fire 
Brigade’s Headquarters since 1937, although nowadays, 
the site is underused. There is a working fire station on the 
riverfront element of the site. To the back of the site, 
industrial buildings sit empty, in search of a modern use 
that will fill them once again with life and activity. Working 
with LFEPA, our objective is to breathe new life into the 
site, taking the fire station into the next chapter of its life 
whilst delivering a wider mixed-use regeneration scheme 
that opens up this prominent location to the community 
once again.
We are now preparing a planning application for the 
regeneration of the site and aim to submit our planning 
proposals in summer 2017. U+I will manage the development 
process and deliver this landmark development which 
includes residential apartments both private and affordable, 
a hotel, office space and a brand new fire station designed 
by Pilbrow & Partners. 
At this early stage of the project’s life, U+I is engaging with 
the local community, council and other stakeholders to 
shape the development. To facilitate better collaboration, 
in November 2016 we opened up the site with a meanwhile-
use community and events space – The Workshop. 
Alongside a London Fire Brigade pop-up museum, the 
space is home to charities, social and start-up enterprises 
and artists who host events for the local community, all 
with creativity at their heart.
This project demonstrates our reputation as a leading 
development partner for public sector bodies and adds to 
our portfolio of significant PPP projects.

Trading
We also apply our core skills to a pipeline of trading activity, 
whereby we source undervalued land and buildings with 
potential for value creation through improved planning 
consents. Typically these projects allow us to acquire assets 
and realise gains over the short term. We focus on 
opportunities where terms of trade are in our favour and 
where we can efficiently unlock value via planning and/or 
asset management. We have a strong track record in being 
able to source well-priced land, drive value through planning 
and monetise this value through disposals. 
Birmingham International Park exemplifies this approach, 
generating £8.4 million of gains to the Company this year 
(as outlined below), with the profitable realisation 
demonstrating the importance of planning as the value 
trigger, enabling us to capture gain from the land and assets 
within our portfolio.
OUR BUSINESS IN ACTION:
BIRMINGHAM  
INTERNATIONAL  
PARK
Birmingham International Park generated  
£8.4 million of gains to the Company this year. This 
was a 16-acre non-income producing site, the final 
undeveloped piece of land from a larger piece of 
strategic land held at close to nil cost on our Balance 
Sheet. The land was within the green belt and we 
successfully argued a needs-based case allowing 
the land to be designated for development. In 
December 2016, we secured outline planning 
consent which enabled a sale of the site to Prologis. 
The site, which is close to Birmingham International 
railway station and airport, will now be developed 
by Prologis into a 310,000 sq. ft. distribution park 
for much-needed logistics space.

U and I Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Our investment portfolio size reduced from £203.3 million 
to £179.2 million, largely as a result of disposing of £18.0 
million of non-core assets. On a like for like basis, our 
portfolio valuation declined by 5.1 per cent. Though values 
stabilised in the second half of the year, our portfolio 
suffered a 4.6 per cent decline in H1 as a result of weakness 
in the regional retail markets in which we operate, partly 
impacted by the slowdown after the EU referendum. We 
expect values to remain stable across the market in the 
next 12 months. Disposing of non-core assets was a focus 
for us during the year and a key part of our strategy to 
transition the portfolio. On a like for like basis, our rental 
income decreased to £12.7 million and we maintained low 
void rates of 4.7 per cent across the portfolio through our 
proactive asset management activities. To support our 
strategy of transitioning our investment portfolio our focus 
for the year ahead is as follows:
 − Acquisitions: Target a minimum of £50 million of new 
assets that align to our regeneration focus and retention 
of assets from our development portfolio
 − Drive value: Continue to create value through selective 
planning change of use and proactive asset management 
– £5.5 million of management-driven capital growth to 
be delivered in FY2018 
 − Disposals: Where we have reached the end of our asset 
business plan, we will dispose of mature assets, targeting 
a further £50 million of sales in the year ahead

Investment portfolio strategy
We are repositioning our investment portfolio over the next 
four years, with the following objectives: 
 − Drive growth from our investment portfolio with a target 
of 10 per cent return per annum to support our overall 
12 per cent total returns target 
 − Use our collective intellectual capital and regeneration 
expertise to drive value from overlooked and undervalued 
investment assets 
 − Provide the business with a stable rental income stream 
 − Provide greater optionality within our portfolio: 
 − Store income-producing assets with longer-term 
potential for regeneration (warehouse assets - see p.35)
 − Retain elements of our completed developments or 
acquire assets close to development projects that 
will benefit from the halo effect of our regeneration 
Rationalisation: This year, within our current portfolio, we 
have made continued progress to dispose of mature assets. 
During the year we sold £18.0 million of investment assets, 
disposing of a number of properties and elements of 
schemes that no longer fit our strategic objectives for the 
overall business plan for the asset. Since the year end, we 
have agreed terms on a further £8.0 million of non-core 
asset disposals and a new acquisition of £10.0 million.
Optimisation: We have also made good progress to 
optimise the value of specific assets for example at  
our retail scheme in Killingworth. Matalan currently  
occupy a large unit within the scheme that no longer fits 
their space requirements. Terms have now been  
agreed with Matalan to split this unit, downsize their  
store, and to re-let the remaining space to a national retailer, 
with an anticipated resultant yield shift from 7.75 per cent 
to 6.75 per cent on this element. There are also two drive-
through restaurants within the site which were valued at a 
7.5 per cent yield in line with the whole scheme. However, 
these well-let, self-contained assets can be separated  
from the scheme, allowing us to sell into the strong  
private investor market. By carving out these units from the 
overall scheme, we will realise disposals at a yield of circa 
5.8 per cent.
Reinvestment: Going forward, our investment strategy is 
aligned with our core strengths as a regeneration specialist.
We will continue to invest in our core markets, focusing on 
assets where performance can be driven through a specific 
regeneration process. We will look to reposition assets 
through active asset management, refurbishment and 
development whilst also focusing on investment assets 
where there is redevelopment upside that can be unlocked 
in the future via the planning process (warehouse assets). 
We will also retain elements of our completed regeneration 
projects where we believe there is more value to be created, 
allowing us to benefit from the positive impact we have 
created in that location (retained assets). 
These strategies are laid out in full on the opposite page.

Warehouse assets: Income-producing assets that have 
longer-term regeneration potential.
Warehouse assets lie at the very early stages of the 
regeneration process and are income-producing assets 
with future redevelopment potential and an ability to secure 
land improvement profit. They may also allow us to add to 
our development pipeline in a risk-controlled and capital 
efficient manner, generating consistent income throughout. 
Charlton Riverside
Charlton is an area that fits our acquisition strategy perfectly 
– located in a well-connected, growing area of London, 
where demand for affordable residential homes is growing 
and where the local authority has ambitious regeneration 
plans for the wider area. To date, we have acquired 10-acres 
of riverside land in joint venture, with future development 
potential. The sites are for the most part occupied by low 
density industrial units generating a blended yield of  
3.5 per cent. Over the next few years we will develop a 
masterplan for the sites to bring forward a mixed-use 
redevelopment that complements the Council’s wider vision.

Retained assets: Identifying opportunities where asset 
management and maturity can add further value, we will 
retain certain elements of our completed developments 
within our investment portfolio. Where we have worked to 
develop or regenerate an area and we believe there is more 
value to come, we will bring these assets into our portfolio 
and nurture their value over time. Typically, these will be 
the ground floor retail, leisure and commercial elements 
of mixed-use projects which, through creative and proactive 
asset management, can be cultivated to enhance the sense 
of place and drive further value. 
Deptford Market Yard
Having completed The Deptford Project, a mixed-use 
regeneration project next to Deptford train station in spring 
2016, we officially opened Deptford Market Yard (DMY) 
in November 2016. DMY lies at the heart of The Deptford 
Project and is home to 14 local start-up retail and leisure 
operators, who occupy the historic railway arches that run 
along the ground floor level of the development. 
Our priorities for DMY were to transform a forgotten corner 
of Deptford into a new destination for London, drive footfall 
and investment to the area and add value to the asset, all 
the while retaining and protecting the character of the local 
area. From a specialist in African womenswear to sellers 
of gourmet cheese toasties, an eclectic range of tenants 
has brought vibrancy to this bustling, up-and-coming area. 
There is further value to be created as we prove the strength 
of this location, let the remaining vacant units and help to 
establish DMY. In the year ahead, our priorities are to fully 
let the remaining commercial and restaurant space as well 
as launching a regular weekend food market and weekly 
themed markets. This will help to drive critical mass and 
create a vibrant and full retail experience. We are also in 
negotiation with Network Rail to open up one of the exits 
to Deptford station directly onto the railway ramp that leads 
to DMY. This is expected to boost footfall numbers as well 
as giving the retailers greater visibility to the hundreds of 
thousands of commuters who pass through Deptford 
station each week.

Specialist platforms
As set out in our strategic objectives, specialist platforms 
are a way for us to deliver a greater number of projects in 
a capital-efficient manner. 
By creating off balance sheet funding with large-scale 
capital partners, we focus on building a portfolio of 
opportunities within a specific asset class where we have 
a competitive advantage. We invest a minority equity stake 
in the joint venture (JV) and take responsibility for 
development, planning, letting and asset management in 
order to complete the business plan for each asset within 
the JV. In return, we receive a promoted position and annual 
management fees. The management fees help to offset 
central overhead costs, effectively allowing us to leverage 
our existing overhead more productively. 
This year, we established two specialist platforms with 
substantial capital partners: 
 − A JV with Colony NorthStar focused on office 
repositioning in London, Manchester and Dublin 
 − A JV with Proprium Capital Partners focused on income-
producing assets in the London City Region with long-
term development potential (our share of JV held within 
our investment portfolio)

OFFICE REPOSITIONING
In JV with Colony NorthStar, we are targeting opportunities 
to reposition and refurbish functionally obsolete office 
blocks in London, Manchester and Dublin. With build 
costs continuing to rise and office rents expected to fall, 
notably in London, medium-term commercial real estate 
development is expected to slow. Against this backdrop, 
we see an opportunity to deliver short to medium-term 
office refurbishments that renovate standing but out 
of date office stock. This would deliver high quality 
office space to the market that suits the needs of the 
modern occupier.  
We have seeded the partnership with two of our assets 
– The Record Store at The Old Vinyl Factory, and 
Donnybrook House in Dublin – and have acquired  
a second office building in Dublin (Ballymoss House). 
We are proactively looking for further opportunities with 
the capacity to grow this JV to €300 million in the next 
2-3 years.

Results for the year
During the year, the Group focused on delivering on its 
strategic initiatives of fewer, larger projects, improving the 
performance of the investment portfolio and launching 
specialist platforms. At the same time, it continued to deliver 
gains from its development and trading portfolio albeit 
within the context of greater economic and political 
uncertainty resulting from the EU referendum.
Below is a summary of the Group’s results for the year 
ended 28 February 2017:
2017 2016
Development and trading gains £35.0m £51.1m
Basic net asset value (NAV) £347.6m £363.3m
Basic NAV per share 278p 291p
Total declared dividends per share 8.7p 13.9p
(Loss)/profit before tax £(1.7)m* £25.8m
Total return 0.2% 7.2%
Balance sheet gearing 34.8% 44.4%
* After exceptional item of £2.1m
The loss before tax for the year to 28 February 2017 is  
£1.7 million (2016: £25.8 million profit), a reduction of  
£27.5 million from  the previous year, after an exceptional 
charge of £2.1 million in respect of the Group’s serviced 
office business (refer note 2b). 
The total development and trading gains for the year were 
£35.0 million (2016: £51.1 million), at the lower end of our 
guidance, but once again demonstrating the benefit of a 
diversified portfolio of projects in a challenging market.
As reported in the first half of the year, we suffered a 
valuation decline of £8.6 million in our investment portfolio. 
Capital values have stabilised over the second half of the 
year to deliver a full-year valuation decline of £9.5 million 
(2016: £0.2 million gain). The challenge now for our 
investment portfolio is to reinvest proceeds from the 
strategic disposals during the year into assets more closely 
aligned with our regeneration model. During the year, delays 
in the ability to reinvest approximately £24.4 million of 
restricted cash reserves has meant that rental income has 
been approximately £1.5 million less than in 2016. This 
should be addressed during the first half of our 2018 
financial year.

Development and trading gains
During the year, we have realised a total of £35.0 million of 
trading and development gains. The key components of 
these gains are:
 − £8.4 million – Birmingham International Park: disposal 
of a land holding post receipt of planning permission 
for £9.6 million.
 − £5.3 million – Elizabeth House, Woking: surrender 
premium from the existing tenant and subsequent 
disposal of the office building with residential consent.
 − £4.3 million – The Vertium Building, Dublin: pre-letting 
of the building in course of construction.
 − £3.8 million – Ashford Powergen site: disposal of land 
post receipt of residential planning consent.
 − £2.3 million – Maidstone: disposal of land post receipt 
of residential planning consent.
 − £3.0 million – Percy Place, Dublin: disposal of mixed-use 
scheme post construction and letting.
These results were achieved against a backdrop of both 
political and economic uncertainty following the EU

Overheads
We have announced that, during 2018 we intend to produce 
savings of £2.0 million in our net recurring overheads from 
a combination of cost efficiencies and the generation of 
management fees from specialist platforms.
During the year, the launch of specialist platforms with 
Colony NorthStar and Proprium Capital Partners has set 
us well on the way to delivering the fee target and we 
continue to look at ways to drive efficiencies across the 
business, focusing particularly on simplifying our corporate 
structure, reducing the number of corporate entities and 
leveraging our intellectual capital.
The overheads during 2017 comprised:

Core recurring overheads 20.3
Non-recurring staff costs 0.5
LTIP charge (net) 0.9
Closedown of historical tax structuring 0.4

Net finance costs
Net finance costs for the year of £10.8 million (2016: £12.9 
million) include foreign exchange deficit of £3.4 million  
(2016: £3.2 million deficit) in respect of the retranslation of 
Euro-denominated loans and deposits.
For entities where the reporting currency is in Euros, 
retranslation differences are charged to reserves.  
The movement for 2017 was a gain of £3.0 million  
(2016: £2.4 million gain). The net impact of these 
movements on NAV during the year was £0.4 million 
loss (2016: £0.8 million loss).
Debt
We use debt finance to leverage the use of our equity in 
property transactions. We continue to borrow from a wide 
range of financial institutions, including UK clearing banks, 
insurance company-backed lenders, debt funds and 
financial institutions. The availability of debt finance has 
not impacted our ability to transact new property deals. 
We are currently seeking to negotiate greater flexibility into 
our investment property facility with Aviva so as to facilitate 
the restructure of our investment portfolio in line with   
Group strategy.

U and I Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 During the year, the following facilities were re-negotiated 
or drawn down:
On balance sheet
 − Refinance of the £28.0 million Lloyds facility, secured 
on investment assets in Ringwood and Thatcham. This 
is a two-year investment facility with substitution rights 
and a cost of 2.5%.
 − New development funding from Quadrant for the build-
out of Valentine House, Ilford: a facility of £30.7 million 
at a fixed rate of 7.5%. This facility is for the build-out 
of the pre-sold residential units.
In joint venture
 − In our Office Repositioning Platform with Colony 
NorthStar, we have signed a €42.2 million facility with 
Quadrant to fund the acquisition and refurbishment of 
the first three properties.
 − In our Income Producing Development Assets Platform 
with Proprium Capital Partners, we have signed a  
£11.3 million loan facility with RBS.

Our debt policy can be summarised as follows:
 − Longer-term fixed rate facilities are used to fund longer-
term income-producing assets. Target loan to value 
(LTV): 60-65%.
 − Shorter-term asset-specific debt aligned to the business 
plan for shorter-term trading assets. Target LTV: 50-55%.
 − Long-term Euro-denominated corporate debt to support 
our investment into Euro-denominated assets in Dublin. 
No LTV target as this is corporate level debt.
 − The Group has no specific debt on non-income 
producing assets or investments into PPP schemes.
 − Joint venture arrangements are designed to leverage 
both our operational expertise and our Balance Sheet. 
When acting with third party capital we deploy asset 
specific debt, which is often at a higher LTV (65-75%), 
reflecting the risk appetite and cost of capital of 
our partners.
A summary of the Group’s gearing is shown below:
Target

Gearing (incl. 
share of JVs) 50-60% 47.4% 50.2% 56.4%
The greatest fluctuation in gearing occurs where we utilise 
debt to fund the build-out of pre-sold residential 
developments on our own Balance Sheet. This peaked at 
59.2% during FY2017.
Our overall gearing targets therefore act as a limit on the 
amount of development that we can undertake on our own 
Balance Sheet.

U and I Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 The Group maintains a mix of variable and fixed rate facilities

Joint venture arrangements
The Group has a policy of working in joint venture  
arrangements as a way of:
 − Leveraging our equity so we can participate in projects  
that would otherwise would be of too large for our 
Balance Sheet;
 − Accessing deals with specialist partners who have 
secured positions on projects but require further equity 
and the planning and structuring skills, which are a key 
part of our business.
During the year, the Group entered into two new large-scale 
joint ventures (specialist platforms): 
 − A joint venture with Colony NorthStar, targeting  
€300 million of office refurbishment and repositioning 
opportunities in London, Manchester and Dublin. The 
Group has a 50.0% holding in the joint venture, 
Luxembourg Investment Company 112 Sarl, and gearing 
was 18.5% as at 28 February 2017. Gearing is below  
the target range as both joint venture partners have 
deposited large cash balances in the entity to cover 
future development spend.
 − A joint venture with Proprium Capital Partners targeting 
up to £200 million of income-producing assets with 
development potential in the London City Region.  
The Group has a 20.0% holding in the joint venture, 
UAIP (Drum) BV, and gearing was 85.6% as at  
28 February 2017, in accordance with the capital 
structure agreed with our joint venture partner.

Taxation 
Our tax strategy is aligned with our overall business strategy 
and is principled, transparent and sustainable for the long 
term. The key components of this strategy are:
 − A commitment to ensure full compliance with all statutory 
obligations including full disclosure to all relevant  
tax authorities;
 − Any tax planning strategy entered into is only implemented 
after full consideration of the risks. Those findings are 
recorded in any relevant structuring document;
 − The maintenance of good relationships with tax 
authorities and a clear interaction between tax planning 
and the Group’s wider corporate reputation and 
responsibility; and  
 − Management of tax affairs in a manner that seeks to 
maximise shareholder value whilst operating within the 
parameters of existing tax legislation.
The Group has operations in certain jurisdictions that have 
been dictated to us by our majority capital partners. Under 
most circumstances the Group does not enjoy any fiscal 
advantage by being in those jurisdictions. The Group  
undertakes an annual Transfer Pricing Review to ensure 
that all cross-border services provided are conducted at 
the appropriate arm’s length market rate.
The suitability of our tax strategy is kept under constant 
review to ensure compliance with both the fiscal needs of 
the Group and the constant evolution of tax legislation.
Dividends
Our dividend policy consists of two elements as follows:
 − An Ordinary dividend, comprising interim and final at 
2.4 pence and 3.5 pence per share respectively; and
 − A supplemental dividend related to the net free level of 
cash flow generated during the financial year.
A final dividend of 3.5 pence per share will be recommended 
to shareholders at the Annual General Meeting (AGM) on 
11 July 2017, to be paid on 17 August 2017 to shareholders  
on the  register on 21 July 2017 (2016: 3.5 pence per share).
On 25 April 2017, the Board approved the payment of  
a supplemental dividend of 3.5 pence per share, to be  
paid on 16 June 2017 to shareholders on the register on 
12 May 2017.
Foreign currency movements
The Group’s operations are conducted primarily in the UK. 
However, as one of its three core regions is Dublin, the 
Group is exposed to movements in foreign exchange rates 
between Sterling and Euros.
The Group’s principal exposure to foreign currency 
movements is in respect of its €47.0 million Euro-
denominated loan notes, Euro-denominated bank loans 
and property assets. 
At 28 February 2017, the Group had net Euro-denominated 
liabilities of €16.6 million (2016: €9.7 million).
The details of the Group’s sensitivity to exchange 
rate movements are set out in note 17(d) of the Group 
financial statements.
During the year, the value of Sterling against the Euro fell 
significantly, following the EU referendum in June 2016. 
The impact on our NAV during the period was a reduction 
of £0.4 million, which is the net result of a loss of £3.4 million 
recorded in finance costs in the profit and loss account 
and a gain through reserves of £3.0 million.
EPRA
This year we have committed to provide more detailed 
disclosure in respect of our EPRA NAV, by adjusting to fair 
value both our trading properties and the property interests 
where we have obtained planning consent - planning being 
the main driver of value in the portfolio.
Unlike a real estate investment business, a significant part 
of our regeneration business model seeks to optimise the 
use of our Balance Sheet by entering into either conditional 
purchase agreements, land option agreements or 
development management agreements where we incur the 
design costs and fees associated with obtaining a planning 
consent,  without purchasing the land up front. These types 
of structures mean that for a significant part (70%) of our 
development portfolio, we are not able to produce a reliable 
fair value in accordance with EPRA guidelines until such 
time as planning consent is obtained and land becomes 
unconditionally owned. 
The table below provides a summary of the assets valued 
in our directly owned and joint venture development and 
trading portfolio.

We understand that EPRA NAV is the accepted valuation metric for real estate investment companies. However, U+I’s 
business model and our preference for developing assets using third-party capital rather than our own, mean that EPRA 
NAV does not deliver a complete picture of the potential value within both our portfolio of assets and various contractual 
arrangements. We will continue to give guidance as to expected development and trading gains over the next three 
years as a more complete picture of the potential value within the Group’s projects.

We measure and monitor our sustainability impact at the  
building level and deliver regular, transparent reporting on  
our performance. We seek to support our tenants and suppliers  
to monitor and reduce their environmental impact, including 
energy and water usage and waste management.
We maximise the positive 
place-making impacts of our 
projects, striving to improve 
well-being and pride within 
communities by providing new 
and valuable facilities, jobs and 
investments, as well as bringing 
people together from the very

Our sustainability focus areas
Our approach to sustainability
The illuminated words ‘Everything is Connected’ hang 
above the entrance to our headquarters in London. They 
say as much about our approach to sustainability as  
they do about the way we do business. They capture the 
way we view the world, how we operate and the culture 
that we want to create. They reflect our love of the daring 
and the imaginative, and our desire to stimulate  
new thinking, encouraging people to pause and reflect  
on their individual contribution to something bigger  
in our work, our relationships and society – aspects that 
we see as a fundamental requirement for successful 
regeneration projects. 
In short, ‘connection’ lies at the heart of everything we do. 
We connect people, places and communities to create 
developments that deliver sustainable socio-economic 
growth for the communities in which we build, and long 
term value for our shareholders. We do this by transforming 
unloved town centres and brownfield sites into vibrant 
neighbourhoods, delivering a positive legacy for local 
residents, or investing in our people. 
Our approach to sustainability is built around the most 
material impacts arising from mixed-use regeneration.  
It covers:
 − The places we create 
 − The buildings we own and operate 
 − The people who work for us
Maintaining a first-rate approach to community engagement 
and delivering the greatest possible social and environmental 
value across all of our places remains our priority. 
Managing and reducing the most significant environmental 
impacts of our buildings is also a focus area across our 
development and investment portfolios, targeting 
reductions in energy, water and waste.  
The success of the projects we deliver relies in turn on  
our ability to harness the creativity, innovation and flair of 
our people. 
 OUR PLACES 
 OUR BUILDINGS 
 OUR PEOPLE 
 COMMUNITIES  ENVIRONMENT 
The connection between the social, environmental and 
financial aspects of our performance means our  
approach to sustainability is integrated into our governance 
structures and management procedures. As such, social 
and environmental aspects are considered as part of  
the broader conversation around specific projects  
at Board level, and are incorporated into the overarching  
brief used for all regeneration projects and asset 
management strategies.  
We recognise that the health, well-being, productivity and  
skills of our people are vital to our future success. We invest in 
staff training, educational development and wellness initiatives.  
We provide a stimulating workplace and foster an engaging, 
collegiate culture.
48
U and I Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Community
Connecting people, businesses and places to create 
dynamic, sustainable communities is a fundamental 
component of our approach. When regeneration is done 
well, it adds long-term value to neighbourhoods and cities 
by breathing life into underutilised and neglected sites. 
We believe that the best regeneration projects can only 
be delivered if the broadest range of influences and trends 
that impact people’s daily lives, aspirations and wellbeing 
are taken into account from the earliest stages of a project. 
We work with communities to keep them informed, listening 
to what they say to make the scheme the best it can be for 
the people that will live, work and play there, while also 
being respectful of the history and provenance of the 
location that together contribute to a positive sense  
of place.  
At the same time, we seek to generate positive socio-
economic returns for local communities by integrating  
novel commercial solutions, with a view to their long-term 
sustainability. We add value during the development 
process by identifying opportunities to support and 
encourage local businesses through the innovative use of 
low-cost space via our meanwhile use activities. 
FIELD at Preston Barracks in Brighton illustrates our focus 
on generating value from the outset by providing work 
space for local entrepreneurs. During the design phase of 
the regeneration of the former military barracks, we believed 
that it was imperative that the site-in-waiting be opened 
to the residents of Brighton and that it serve as a home for 
a community of ecologically aware and technologically 
evolving fledgling businesses. The building houses flexible 
work space for up to twelve start-ups in a dynamic and 
collaborative environment. It forms the first stage of a much 
larger 50,000 sq. ft. campus which is set to create over 
7,000 product design and technology jobs over the next 
ten years, alongside a sustainable community of 369  
new homes. 
FIELD Brighton
Based at the Preston Barracks regeneration site 
in Brighton, FIELD is a hub for start ups that design 
and make physical products
Providing this kind of temporary commercial space allows 
us to transform disused areas into creative zones and trial 
features that can be reflected in the final scheme. This in 
turn helps us to prove the feasibility of our approach and 
strengthen our track record of creating sustainable growth 
and commercially successful projects. 
FIELD is by no means unique, and it builds on the success 
of other developments such as the Old Vinyl Factory 
development in Hayes, west London. Here, we revived the 
site’s industrial heritage by creating the first Central 
Research Laboratory (CRL).  The CRL is a 10,000 sq. ft. 
fully equipped incubator space for hardware start-ups and 
a hub for creative commercial innovation. Since opening 
in 2015, CRL has supported approximately 30 early stage 
start-ups, split between more intensive ‘accelerator’ 
support, covering product development, business 
development, access to finance and acquiring first 
customers, and less intensive ‘incubator’ support that 
provides workshop facilities and light-touch advisory 
services. Since its inception, resident ventures have  
won investment, grants and prizes worth more  
than £350,000.

This respect for the local heritage embedded in a site was 
central to our winning proposal for the redevelopment of 
Mayfield in Manchester. Conserving and exploiting the 
site’s industrial and natural heritage was a core part of our 
vision for this £850 million regeneration project. Our 
proposal incorporates historical buildings into a vibrant 
mixed-use development that plays on the themes of river, 
railway and architecture which are so synonymous with 
this part of Manchester. In our capacity as development 
partner, we are working in a Public Private Partnership 
alongside London Continental Railways, Manchester City 
Council and Transport for Greater Manchester as the 
Mayfield Partnership.
Environment
Our commitment to delivering sustainable communities 
extends to managing and improving the environmental 
impact of the places we create. Measures to improve the 
environmental sustainability of our projects are integrated 
into our template brief for development and construction. 
We take a practical approach, guided by the National 
Planning Policy Framework, which ensures a consistent 
focus on improving our impact in relation to energy, carbon, 
water and waste across our development portfolio.  
The greatest opportunity for us to improve the environmental 
impact of our portfolio is during the design phase, for 
example by finding opportunities to incorporate sustainable 
features including green rooftop spaces, cycling facilities, 
photo-voltaic panels, LED lighting, water efficient fittings 
and integrating developments within existing public 
transport networks where feasible. We have not set project-
specific environmental performance targets, but we have 
begun to measure the energy, carbon, water and waste 
performance of our schemes’ construction works and we 
seek solutions that minimise environmental impacts and 
maximise resource efficiencies. As our approach develops, 
we are investigating opportunities to integrate sustainable 
product selection and responsible sourcing into our 
procurement activities. This includes goals to procure 100 
per cent FSC certified timber and for 70 per cent of building 
materials to achieve a Green Guide rating of at least A. 
Beyond ensuring that we comply with statutory and  
industry standards as a minimum, we target BREEAM 
and LEED certifications on a project-by-project basis.  
Additional environmental features are determined by our 
stakeholders, market expectations and the specific 
circumstances of each project. For example, the wider 
action plan for our Preston Barracks redevelopment 
includes ten environmental and socio-economic 
sustainability principles that align with the city of 
Brighton’s wider sustainability goals. The principles dictate 
how sustainability will be embedded into the design, 
construction and operational phases of the development’s 
life, and cover objectives to enhance the health and 
wellbeing of its residents, boost economic development 
and reduce its environmental footprint,including a goal to 
be zero carbon and zero waste. Once complete, we estimate 
that the ecological footprint of the site’s residents will be 
38 per cent lower than the benchmark for Brighton.   
As part of a long-standing focus on our greenhouse gas 
(GHG) emissions, we calculate the embodied carbon of 
all our developments up to practical completion. Collecting 
this data and comparing the performance of each project 
“We teamed up with U+I on our first forward
funding deal in Dublin and the partnership
has been very successful. Both U+I and
Union have been early movers in the Dublin
market and it’s exciting to be delivering one
of the best office buildings in the city, 
evidenced by our success in pre-letting
the whole building.”

The options for reducing the environmental impact of our 
investment portfolio are more limited because they are not 
buildings we have designed or built ourselves.  Nonetheless, 
we focus on improvements to energy efficiency, waste and 
water consumption as part of our broader objective to 
sustain asset values and reduce operating costs.  
To mitigate risk in the context of environmental legislation, 
we aim to have only EPC ‘C’ rated assets within our 
portfolio, and to ensure that, before 2018, we have no 
remaining properties rated ‘F’ or below in terms of energy 
performance.  We have ongoing programmes for energy 
reduction in place across six assets, which are yielding 
positive results. We are also striving to divert 100% of 
waste from landfill, and we have appointed a single waste 
removal contractor, covering approximately 80% of our 
assets to help deliver this target. 
In addition to reporting energy, water and waste 
performance data, we have established a number of long 
term key performance indicators that we will implement 
over the coming years to support our goals. These include 
investigating the feasibility of rolling out smart meters to 
facilitate the collection of more accurate energy 
consumption data. 
Our tenants account for the majority of the energy use and 
waste generated at our investment portfolio. A challenge 
across the property sector is the split incentive between 
landlord and tenants to invest in environmental 
improvements. To increase the energy performance of our 
portfolio, we need to introduce energy-efficient equipment 
and management practices in tenant demised areas, but 
tenants are often unwilling to share the investment cost, 
even when they will reap returns within reasonable payback 
periods. We are tackling this through a range of measures 
including the introduction of green leases, such as BREEAM 
Green Lease Agreements and ‘green’ fit-out design 
guidance for tenants at 399 Edgware Road.

portfolio in line with EPRA’s Sustainability Best Practice 
Recommendations. Tables detailing our performance in

U and I Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Our goal is to build a culture where people are proud to 
work for us and share our values of intelligence, imagination 
and audacity. This can only be achieved by fostering a real 
sense of belonging among our employees, connected by 
strong internal communications and high levels of 
engagement. We are proud of what we have achieved in 
this respect following our merger, and this goal continued 
to influence our activities in 2016/17. 
People thrive when they are engaged, inspired and 
continually learning, so we challenge people to think 
creatively and encourage our employees to further their 
professional and personal development. 
U+I Think is one example of how we promote an intellectually 
stimulating environment, where new ideas are explored 
and everyday thinking questioned. Held in the spirit of 
challenging the status quo within the real estate sector, 
U+I Think provides a forum to connect employees with 
experts from backgrounds in public policy, government, 
design, architecture and finance. Sessions take place over 
breakfast or early evening drinks in our auditorium, and 
speakers are tasked with showcasing original research 
from their area of expertise to inspire new and original 
thinking in our people and the industry.  
In 2016 we formalised our commitment to investing in the 
future of our talent by publishing our study policy. We 
encourage employees to develop their relevant skills and 
knowledge. We provide financial support for employees, 
including fees and other costs relating to their programme 
of study, along with paid study leave. 
This approach is supported by our learning and development 
strategy and performance management framework.  These 
combine to provide a clear framework for our team that 
identifies their individual roles and responsibilities as well 
as providing clarity on what is expected of them in 
accordance with the business strategy.

During the year, we supported four employees studying 
further education qualifications including RICS, CIPD, MA 
in Construction Management and ICSA (Institute of 
Chartered Secretaries and Administrators). Seventy four 
employees (equivalent to 64% of our workforce) attended 
at least one of the 20 different training events we organised 
on themes ranging from technical training (i.e. InDesign, 
Excel) to Having Productive Conversations. Beginning in 
2016 we offered three work experience placements to 
extend these learning opportunities to young people 
outside of the workplace, and we will offer a further four 
placements in 2017. We also plan to establish a formal 
internship programme for young people in 2018.
Our Sabbatical Policy enables employees with more than 
seven years’ continuous employment to take up to three 
months extended leave. We recognise the value sabbaticals 
add as a flexible and cost-effective development tool with 
the potential to improve recruitment, retention and increase 
levels of team motivation and performance. As such, 
employees are encouraged to use the time to undertake 
activities that promote their individual development, as this 
will ultimately benefit U+I. 
To get the best out of our team, we also encourage them 
to stay fit, healthy and well. We offer a wide range of benefits 
designed to promote better health and wellbeing including 
daily fruit supplies and free yoga classes; we subsidise 
gym membership; participate in the cycle2work scheme; 
and provide excellent health insurance and health checks 
which are subsidised for all. We offer an employee 
assistance programme for people to use if they are suffering 
from stress and/or have financial, domestic or work-related 
concerns. This includes access to counselling.

U and I Group PLC  Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Chairman’s Introduction to Corporate Governance
Dear Shareholder,
On behalf of the Board,  
I am pleased to introduce 
my first report on the 
governance and stewardship 
of the Company for the  
year ended 28 February 
2017. As your new Chairman 
I have spent my time getting 
to know the U+I business, 
visiting our projects and 
meeting with our 
stakeholders. During  
this time, I have been 
continually impressed with 
the quality, experience, 
dedication and enthusiasm 
of our people, from  
Director level to employees 
throughout the Company. 
Sustainable governance
As a Board, we are committed to building and leading the 
responsible, transparent, transformational and sustainable 
business discussed in the previous pages of this Annual 
Report. We believe that by maintaining high standards of 
corporate governance, aligned with the strategic aims of 
the business both at Board level and throughout the Group, 
we will deliver value for our stakeholders over the short 
and longer term. Good governance is an essential tool to 
enhance and sustain business performance, while raising 
our reputation both in the sector in which we operate and 
among our wider stakeholders. The principles of leadership, 
accountability and effectiveness, along with remuneration 
and the relationships we have with our shareholders, as 
defined under the UK Corporate Governance Code (the 
Code), are integrated throughout our business. The 
implementation of these principles is set out in this report. 
Board succession
Succession at Board level was a key focus during the year. 
I took over from David Jenkins as Chairman of the Board, 
following the AGM in July 2016. Lynn Krige was appointed 
as a new independent Non-executive Director in March 
2016, taking over from Sarah Bates as Chairman of the Audit 
and Risk Committee, following the 2016 AGM. This smooth 
transition highlights the effectiveness of our succession 
policy at Board level. As Chairman of the Nomination 
Committee, it is my responsibility to ensure the Board 
continues to hold the 
necessary skills and 
experience to oversee  
the effective running of  
the business. Further 
information on this can be 
found in the Nomination 
Committee report on pages 
70 to 71. 
Strategy
Alongside succession, the 
Board continued its focus 
on strategy, with newly 
established bi-annual Board 
strategy days. Dedicated 
entirely to strategy, these 
days give Directors an 
excellent opportunity to 
focus their time and energy, 
along with that of the 
Executive Committee, to obtain a deeper understanding 
of what success looks like for our business, and the 
associated risks and challenges. 
Risk management
As set out in my letter on page 5, the impact of the UK’s 
decision to leave the EU has created significant  uncertainty 
in the property market. The changing nature of the economic 
environment, and with that the markets in which we operate, 
is one of our key risks. This, and other key risks, are set out 
on pages 19 and 20, and are considered as part of U+I’s 
risk management and internal control framework, which is 
focused on by our Risk Management Committee and our 
Audit and Risk Committee. The framework has been 
reviewed during the year to ensure those risks remain 
appropriate and proportionate, and that our risk 
management systems remain robust, with identified risks 
being mitigated to the fullest extent possible. Further 
information on this can be found in the Audit and Risk 
Committee Report on pages 73 to 77.
Board evaluation
The Board evaluation process, led by myself, with the 
assistance of the Company Secretary, confirmed that the 
Board and its Committees continue to operate effectively 
and there were no significant issues to address.  However, 
I understand that there are always ways in which we can 
improve as a Board, and I will look at the implementation 
Peter Williams photographed at U+I offices
56
U and I Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 of recommendations from the evaluation process, set out 
on page 69, during the year. I am satisfied that our Directors, 
all of whom will be standing for re-election at the 2017 
AGM, continue to be effective and show the required 
commitment to their roles, and I will be recommending their 
re-appointment to shareholders. 
Remuneration
At this year’s AGM, we will be proposing a resolution to 
shareholders to approve our Remuneration Policy. This 
approval is required every three years and, whilst no 
significant changes are being proposed, we consulted with 
shareholders accounting for 60% of our register as part 
of this process. The Remuneration Committee has listened 
to shareholders and taken on board the feedback received, 
and we have amended the proposed Policy where we 
believed this was appropriate. Further information on this 
can be found in the Remuneration Report on pages 80 to 
104. An explanation of all resolutions being  proposed to 
shareholders at the AGM can be found on pages 107 to 1 10. 
I trust that you will find this governance report helpful 
and informative, and I look forward to meeting those of 
you attending our AGM.

EFFECTIVENESS
Director independence 
Peter Williams was appointed as Chairman of the Board 
following the AGM on 14 July 2016. Peter had previously 
been appointed as a Non-executive Director and Chairman 
designate with effect from 4 January 2016. On appointment 
the Board considered that Peter met the independence 
criteria set out in the Code. The Chairman’s biography can 
be found on page 59. Lynn Krige was appointed an 
independent Non-executive Director during the year; further 
details can be found in the Nomination Committee report 
on pages 70 to 71.
The independence of each Non-executive Director 
has been assessed during the year, in line with the 
independence criteria contained within provision B.1.1 of 
the Code. The Board considered all the Non-executive 
Directors to be independent during the year with the 
exception of Barry Bennett, who was the co-founder of 
Cathedral Group. David Jenkins, who retired as Chairman 
in July 2016, was considered independent on appointment 
as Chairman, and, as discussed above, Peter Williams was 
considered independent on appointment to the Board. The  
current ratio of Executive and independent Non-executive 
Directors is permissible for a smaller company under  
Code provision B.1.2.

Induction, training and professional development
The Chairman, assisted by the Company Secretary, is 
responsible for the formal induction of all new Directors. 
On joining the Board a Director receives a comprehensive 
induction pack prepared by the Company Secretary, which 
includes material relating to the Director’s obligations as 
a Director of the Company, the Company structure and 
governance, and Board and Committee powers and 
authorities. Induction meetings are arranged with Executive 
Directors, Non-executive Directors and other relevant 
individuals, including members of the Executive Committee, 
where required, for briefings around business strategy, 
performance, and the Company’s projects. Visits to key 
project sites are arranged. Peter Williams and Lynn Krige 
received full inductions following their appointment as 
Non-executive Directors. As part of Peter’s induction as 
Chairman, following his appointment in July 2016, individual 
meetings were arranged with the majority of U+I’s major 
shareholders. 
All Directors are given the opportunity to receive ongoing 
training and development whilst in office. Directors may 
request this as part of the annual performance evaluation, 
or by discussion with the Chairman or Company Secretary. 
The Chairman agrees with each Director their training and 
development needs as and when required. Development 
activities include regular presentations and updates on the 
Company’s projects and portfolio by Executive Directors 
and members of the Executive Committee, updates on the 
market and economic trends, share price and trading 
performance, and governance matters. 
Professional advice and support
All Directors have access to the advice and services of 
the Company Secretary, who is responsible for advising 
the Board, through the Chairman, on corporate governance 
matters. Directors are also able to seek independent 
professional advice as necessary, at the Company’s 
expense, in respect of their duties.
Time commitment
On appointment Directors are advised of, and requested 
to make, the necessary time commitment required to 
discharge their responsibilities effectively. This time 
commitment is also outlined in the letters of appointment 
issued to the Chairman and Non-executive Directors. 
As part of the annual performance evaluation each Director 
is appraised on their time commitment dedicated to the 
Company. The Board is satisfied that individual Directors 
have dedicated the required amount of time to the Company 
to effectively fulfil their role. The Board as a whole is 
content that the Chairman’s external appointments do not 
impact on his ability to allocate sufficient time to discharge 
his responsibilities to U+I.
68
U and I Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Performance evaluation
As in previous years, the Board has undertaken a formal 
performance evaluation of the Board and its Committees 
to ensure they continue to be effective. Also reviewed as 
part of this process is the effectiveness of individual 
Directors, and their commitment to their respective roles. 
The Board believes that annual evaluations are helpful, and 
provide a valuable opportunity for continuous improvement. 
Consideration was given as to whether the evaluation 
should be externally facilitated; the Board maintained that 
the current arrangements were appropriate, but will keep 
this area under review. 
The Board evaluation was carried out through a detailed 
questionnaire, the responses to which were collated by 
the Company Secretary. The evaluation focused on the 
Board as a whole, its composition and effectiveness, as 
well as on the Committees and individual Directors. The 
responses were considered by the Chairman, or the Senior 
Independent Director in relation to the Chairman’s 
performance. Following the results of the evaluation being 
disclosed to the Board, Peter Williams chaired a meeting 
of the Non-executive Directors without Executive Directors 
present where the performance of the Executive Directors 
was reviewed. Nick Thomlinson chaired a meeting of the 
Non-executive Directors without the Chairman or Executive 
Directors present, at which the performance of the 
Chairman was reviewed. The outcome was then discussed 
by the Chairman and Senior Independent Director. No 
significant issues arose as a result of this review. It was 
confirmed that the Chairman, having been in place since 
the departure of David Jenkins following the 2016 AGM, 
was leading the Board effectively. 
A presentation, by the Company Secretary, of the results 
from the 2017 Board evaluation, together with the progress 
made on the areas highlighted through the 2016 Board 
evaluation process, was discussed by the Board. Where 
considered relevant, suggestions for areas of improvement 
have, or will, be implemented as detailed opposite.
2016 Board evaluation results: The 2016 Board evaluation 
noted that, whilst the Board was operating efficiently, there 
had been a large amount of change which had taken place 
both within the Board itself, and with regard to the overall 
governance structure within the Company over the course 
of the year. These changes, for example the introduction 
of the new Executive Committee, were in the process of 
being embedded, and the Board’s focus for 2016 should 
be to ensure these changes were implemented effectively. 
It was agreed that consideration should also be given as 
to whether a new independent Non-executive Director 
would be beneficial following the changes to the Board at 
the 2016 AGM.
Progress made: The new governance structure continues 
to embed itself within the business. The changes to the 
Board during the year were successfully implemented and 
managed, as seen with the departure of David Jenkins and 
Sarah Bates, and the introduction of Peter Williams and 
Lynn Krige as Chairman and Chairman of the Audit and 
Risk Committee respectively. The Executive Committee 
continues to evolve as the body that assists the Executive 
Directors in driving the implementation of strategy on a 
day to day basis. Members of the Committee attend each 
Board meeting to update the Board on the progress made 
against agreed strategic goals and project performance. 
The search for a new Non-Executive Director is active  
and ongoing. 
2017 Board evaluation results: No major issues were 
identified during the 2017 Board evaluation; however, the 
Board noted that the governance structure was still evolving 
with a new Chairman and Non-executive Director and new 
hires at Executive Committee level. This would be kept 
under close scrutiny throughout the year. The potential 
benefit of adding an additional independent Non-executive 
Director to the Board was again highlighted, and it was 
confirmed that this process was being actively managed 
by the Nomination Committee. The Board agreed that the 
introduction of two Board strategy days per year, involving 
the Board and the Executive Committee, was a positive 
step forward to ensure an alignment in the values, vision 
and strategy of the Board and the Company as a whole.

David Jenkins and Sarah Bates both stood down from the 
Committee on their retirement from the Board at the AGM 
on 14 July 2016. Peter Williams, who became a member of 
the Committee on appointment to the Board in January 
2016, took over as Chairman, and Lynn Krige was appointed 
as a member of the Committee at this time. 
Following a review of the Committee’s composition during 
2015/16 it was agreed that, in accordance with provision 
B2.1 of the UK Corporate Governance Code, the Chief 
Executive, Matthew Weiner, should stand down as a member 
of the Committee with effect from 29 February 2016, 
although Matthew would continue to attend meetings when 
requested to do so by the Chairman. During the year ended 
28 February 2017 the Committee was made up entirely of 
independent Non-executive Directors and the Chairman, 
who was considered independent on appointment. 
Role of the Nomination Committee
The Committee is responsible for making  
recommendations to the Board, within its agreed terms  
of reference, on appointments to the Board. The  
Board appointment process is fulfilled through an  
effective search, interview and evaluation process led  
by an external consultant based upon objective criteria  
set out by the Committee. The Committee’s role as  
set out in its terms of reference includes:
 − Reviewing the structure, size and composition of the 
Board as a whole;
 − Succession planning for Executive Directors, Non-
executive Directors, and the roles of the Chairman and 
Chief Executive;
 − Consideration of the balance of skills, knowledge, 
experience, time commitment and diversity of the Board;
 − Recommending suitable candidates for the role of Senior 
Independent Director;
 − Devising descriptions of the role and capabilities 
required for a particular appointment; and
 − Providing recommendations on the composition of both 
the Audit and Risk and Remuneration Committees,  
in consultation with the Chairs of those Committees.

U and I Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Activities of the Nomination Committee
The Committee meets as and when necessary. Following 
on from a busy 2016, during which the Committee appointed 
a new Chairman designate and a new Audit and Risk 
Committee Chairman designate, the Committee met twice 
during the year ended 28 February 2017 to discuss Board 
structure, size, composition and the potential appointment 
of a new Non-executive Director as discussed in the Board 
evaluation results on page 69. 
The specifications of the role have been discussed, and 
the services of the consultant search firm Norman Broadbent 
are being used to consider a wide range of potential external 
candidates for the position. Norman Broadbent has no 
other connection with the Company. A list of candidates 
has been presented to the Committee. Recommendations 
on any new appointment would be made by the Committee 
to the Board, which would approve the appointment.

New Director inductions
As discussed on page 68, the Chairman, assisted by the 
Company Secretary, is responsible for the formal induction 
of all new Directors. Lynn Krige, who joined the Board 
during the year, received a full induction, which included 
a comprehensive induction pack prepared by the Company 
Secretary, induction meetings with Executive Directors, 
Non-executive Directors and other relevant individuals, 
and also visits to project sites. As part of Peter Williams’ 
induction as Chairman, following his appointment in July 
2016, individual meetings were arranged with the majority 
of U+I’s major shareholders.
Directors standing for election or re-election
The Committee met once following the end of the financial 
year under review to discuss the re-election of all Directors 
and recommended to the Board that each Director, being 
eligible, should be put forward for annual re-election by 
shareholders. Following the annual performance reviews 
of individual Directors, the Chairman considers that each 
Director continues to operate as an effective member of 
the Board and has the skills, knowledge, experience and 
time to enable them to discharge their duties properly. 
Upon election, or re-election, Non-executive Directors are 
invited to serve for three-year fixed terms, subject to annual 
re-election by shareholders. All Non-executive Directors 
have confirmed that they have sufficient time to dedicate 
to their role. The terms of their appointment are available 
from the Company Secretary and details of the Non-
executive Directors’ letters of appointment are detailed in 
the Remuneration Report on page 90. 
On the advice of the Committee, the Board recommends 
the re-election of each Director to shareholders at the 2017 
AGM in line with provision B.7.1 of the Code. The Company 
believes that sufficient biographical details, and other 
relevant information, for the Directors seeking annual re-
election is provided on page 59 in order for shareholders 
to make an informed decision on each Director’s re-election.

Composition of the Board
The Committee has reviewed the size, structure and 
composition of the Board and concluded that, whilst it is 
an appropriate and effective Board, the addition of an 
independent Non-executive Director in due course would 
be beneficial.
Diversity
As part of its role the Committee will review the diversity 
on the Board. The Committee recognises the benefits of 
diversity in its broadest sense and the value this brings to 
the Board and the Company as a whole in terms of skills, 
knowledge and experience. Details of the gender diversity 
of the Board and across the Company are set out in the 
Sustainability Report on page 54.

ACCOUNTABILITY
Risk management and internal control
The Board has overall responsibility for the Group’s risk 
management and internal control systems and monitors 
these on an ongoing basis. The risk management and 
internal control systems put in place are designed to identify, 
evaluate and mitigate risks while at the same enabling 
business objectives to be achieved. Further information 
on the Company’s internal control framework is set out in 
the Audit and Risk Committee Report on pages 76 and 77.
Risk Management Committee
The regular process of identifying, evaluating and managing 
significant corporate risks has been delegated by the Board 
to the Audit and Risk Committee which, in turn, has 
delegated responsibility for overseeing the day to day risk 
management of the Company to the Risk Management 
Committee. The Committee is an Executive Committee 
and comprises the Executive Directors, members of 
the Executive Committee, the Legal Counsel and the 
Company Secretary.
The Committee’s principal role, as set out in its terms of 
reference, includes:
 − Advising the Audit and Risk Committee on the Company’s 
risk appetite, tolerance and strategy, taking into account 
the current and prospective macro-economic and 
financial environment;
 − Reviewing the Company’s risk register, including 
identification of new risks, continuous assessment, and 
identification of early warning factors and mitigating 
actions and controls;
 − Reviewing the effectiveness of the Company’s internal 
financial controls, internal controls and risk management 
systems; and
 − Reviewing the Company’s procedures for detecting 
fraud and prevention of bribery.
Annual activities of the Risk Management Committee
The Committee meets quarterly during the year to ensure 
that the Group’s risk management procedures are 
comprehensive and appropriate for the current economic 
climate, regulatory requirements and business operations.
During the year, the Committee performed a full review of 
all the risks facing the Company as set out on the risk 
register. The significant risks facing the Company have 
been identified and are set out on pages 19 and 20.
At each meeting the Committee reviews those risks with 
the highest impact and highest likelihood of occurrence, 
and the actions in place to ensure mitigation of the risks 
to the fullest extent. Those risks with less impact or 
likelihood of occurring are reviewed on a six-monthly basis. 
The Committee’s remit includes all of the Group’s 
subsidiaries and those joint ventures and associates which 
are administered by the Company. Risks arising from 
externally managed joint ventures are managed at the 
boards of the joint venture companies. The Committee 
reports into the Audit and Risk Committee. In addition to 
the activities of the Risk Management Committee, a risk 
evaluation on each significant prospective development, 
investment or joint venture opportunity is evaluated by the 
Board. The Executive Directors regularly evaluate the 
Group’s risk-weighted development exposure, which is 
then considered by the Board. All necessary actions have 
been, or are being, taken to remedy any weaknesses 
acknowledged from the quarterly reviews. No significant 
failings or weaknesses were identified over the year.

Role of the Audit and Risk Committee
The Committee plays a crucial role in assisting the Board 
to discharge its responsibilities for the management of 
business risk by monitoring, reviewing and challenging the 
effectiveness and the integrity of the Group’s financial 
reporting and audit process, and the development and 
maintenance of sound systems of risk management and 
internal control. The Committee currently consists of two 
independent Non-executive Directors, and the Company’s 
Chairman Peter Williams, who was considered independent 
on appointment. The Board has determined that Lynn Krige

Annual activities of the Audit and Risk Committee
The Committee met four times during the year. One meeting 
was held to agree the external audit terms of engagement, 
the auditors’ scope and proposed approach, and the fees 
of the annual audit. As is standard each year, two of the 
meetings take place prior to the issue of the preliminary 
full year and interim results to review audit recommendations 
and consider any significant issues arising from the audit 
and review process. The Committee also reviews the 
performance of the external auditors. 
The Committee reviewed the following items during  
the year and, where required, made recommendations to 
the Board:
April: Year end financial results and Annual Report, Viability 
and Going Concern Statements, external auditors’ report, 
external property valuations, significant project risks, 
internal audit requirements, risk appetite and review of  
key risks, non-audit fees, and the re-appointment of the 
external auditors.
October: External auditors’ interim report, interim results 
and financial statements, internal and external portfolio 
valuations, tax-related matters, risk management, internal 
audit requirements and external audit tender.
December: Delegated authority review, external audit 
planning, risk management appetite and review of key risks, 
Viability Statement requirements, internal audit review and    
terms of reference review.
January: Internal controls and control processes, risk 
assessment review, whistleblowing policy review, update 
on internal audit, and audit fees.
Cyber security
Cyber security continued to be a high priority issue for the 
Committee during the year. An external consultant was 
engaged to provide Company-wide training on cyber 
threats to both the Company and individual employees. 
This educational training included phishing emails being 
sent to employees to highlight the dangers posed. The 
Company also reviewed and introduced new hardware 
and software systems during the year to minimise the risks 
associated around cyber threats; these systems perform 
continuous penetration testing checking for weaknesses 
and potential attacks.

U and I Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Risk management
The Committee has responsibility for overseeing the risk 
management process for the Company. This entails 
reviewing the risk appetite, the principal risks and risk 
mitigation on behalf of the Board. The Committee delegates 
the day to day management of risk throughout the business 
to the Risk Management Committee (see page 72), which 
reports into the Committee. The Committee reviews the 
key risks of the Company, the risk register, and the mitigation 
processes in place. 
A full review of the effectiveness of the risk management 
and risk mitigation processes was carried out by the  
Risk Management Committee during the year at the  
request of the Committee. This included a robust 
assessment of the principal risks facing the Company, 
including those that would threaten its business model, 
future performance, solvency or liquidity. The results of 
this review and changes to the risk register were  
approved by the Committee. The significant risks facing 
the Company are set out on pages 19 and 20.
The Committee dedicated its meeting in January to a review 
of internal control processes and procedures within  
the Group. This included analysing the internal control 
structure, delegated authorities throughout the Group, 
and the major business processes covering areas such as 
operations, borrowings, cash management, accounting 
and reporting, statutory compliance and employment. 
Other areas of review overseen by the Committee included 
IT, cyber security, corporate structure, gifts and 
entertainment, and organisational design.
The Committee considered the Company’s internal audit 
requirements at each meeting during the year. After a 
thorough review of the Company’s requirements, a  
peer group review and consultation with the external  
auditors, the Committee concluded that a permanent  
internal audit function, or an outsourced function, was not 
required by the Company. Further details of this can be 
found on page 77.
The Committee also met without Executive Directors 
present during the year, and Lynn Krige, as Chairman of 
the Committee, met separately with the external auditors, 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP.

Significant judgements
Before recommending the interim and annual financial 
statements to the Board for approval, the Committee 
considered, amongst other things, the following matters 
and significant judgements:
 − Direct property investments, the development and trading 
portfolios and the valuation of the investment properties: 
The Committee challenged executive management in 
respect of both independent external valuations and 
Directors’ valuations across the entire property portfolio. 
In addition, the Committee challenged the external 
auditors in respect of the work they had conducted in 
connection with the internal and external valuations. The 
Committee was satisfied that there were no significant 
areas of contention and that the valuation procedures 
and methodologies used and the valuations themselves 
were appropriate. In respect of impairment charges 
recognised, the Committee was satisfied that, where 
applicable, the written down values reflected the assets’ 
net realisable value.
 − Indirect property investments, accounting for investments 
in property secured loans and recoverability of financial 
assets: The Committee again discussed with executive 
management the valuation and recoverability of these 
assets along with the external auditors as to the work 
they had conducted. As a result, the Committee 
concluded that the assets were appropriately  
recognised in the Group’s financial statements.
 − Construction risk: The Committee considered 
developments under construction both on balance sheet 
and in joint ventures, the recoverability of work in progress 
and the associated construction risks. The Committee 
challenged management in respect of the assumptions 
made relating to the completion of all material developments, 
including the ability of contractors to deliver the  
completed buildings, the likely financial outcome of each 
development and the recoverability of all work in progress 
on balance sheet. As a result the Committee concluded 
that the assets were appropriately recognised in the 
Group’s financial statements.

Strategic report + Corporate governance + Financial statements
U and I Group PLC  Annual Report and Accounts 2017  − Serviced office business:  The Committee considered  
a management review of the Group’s investment in the 
serviced office business in line with investment strategy.  
Significant judgements with regard to recoverability and 
impairment  were made in relation to the business. 
Concluding this review an impairment was made, see 
note 2b on page 140.  
 − Other reporting matters: The Committee considered 
the internal controls environment, management oversight 
of indirect property investments, and accounting and 
regulatory developments.
Fair, balanced and understandable
One of the significant requirements of the Code is that the 
Board confirms that the Annual Report presents a fair, 
balanced and understandable assessment of the 
Company’s position and performance, business model 
and strategy. The Board requested that the Committee 
provide advice in this regard and, with this in mind, the 
Committee considered management’s analysis and were 
content to recommend to the Board that the Annual Report 
taken as a whole was fair, balanced and understandable, 
and provided the necessary information for shareholders 
to assess the Company’s position and performance, 
business model and strategy. The Board’s statement to 
this effect is set out in the Statement of Directors’ 
Responsibilities on page 113.
Non-audit services
The Non-Audit Services Policy was adhered to throughout 
the year, providing additional control measures around the 
instruction of the auditors to undertake non-audit work. The 
policy requires that all non-audit fee work be reported to 
the Committee and that all non-audit fee work falling into 
certain categories and above certain thresholds be reported 
prior to the work being undertaken as detailed below:
 − Up to £25,000: Approval required by the Chief Financial 
Officer, or Chief Executive in his absence.
 − In excess of £25,000 and up to £100,000: Approval 
required by the Chief Financial Officer and Chairman 
of the Committee.
 − In excess of £100,000: Approval required from the  
full  Committee.
In addition, the policy prohibits the auditors from being 
considered for providing the following services: internal 
audit; bookkeeping services; and the design and 
implementation of financial information systems, with 
additional requirements from March 2016.
An analysis of the non-audit fees can be found in note 3 
to the Consolidated financial statements. The Committee 
scrutinises these payments, but recognises that, due to 
the nature of the business and complexity of deals, there 
are certain assurance and advisory services that may be 
best performed by the external auditors as a result of their 
unique knowledge of the Company, without compromising 
their independence or objectivity. The total value paid 
during the year for tax advice and all other services 
amounted to £56,000.
Auditors’ re-appointment
It is within the Committee’s remit to recommend  
the appointment of the external auditors 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP. Additional scrutiny was 
placed on the independence and objectivity of 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP. In accordance with 
professional and regulatory standards, the lead audit 
partner is rotated at least every five years in order to    
p r o t e c t a u d i t i nd e p e n d e n c e a nd o bje c t i v i t y . J u l ia n        
Jenkins was the lead audit partner for the financial year 
under review and has been lead audit partner for the 
Company for four years. The Committee was satisfied as 
to PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP’s independence, 
performance and effectiveness and, following a review of 
their tenure, quality and fees, recommended their re-
appointment as auditors. This was subsequently ratified 
by the Board and accordingly the re-appointment of 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as auditors will be proposed 
at the forthcoming AGM.
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP have been the independent 
auditors of the Company since 2008, which is the last time 
the audit went out to tender. The audit will be put out to 
tender at least every ten years in accordance with the 
Code, and this will be a focus of the Committee during the 
year ending 28 February 2018.
Internal control
The Directors acknowledge their responsibility for reviewing 
the effectiveness of the Group’s system of internal control 
to safeguard shareholders’ investments and protect the 
Company’s assets. The Directors acknowledge that they 
are responsible for determining the nature and extent of 
the principal risks the Company is willing to take in achieving 
its strategic objectives. The operational, financial and 
compliance risk controls are designed to manage rather 
than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business 
objectives, and can only provide reasonable and not 
absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss. 
Corporate governance

76
U and I Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 The Board, through the Committee and Risk Management 
Committee, has conducted a thorough and robust risk 
assessment of the business, identifying principal risks, 
their potential impact, likelihood of occurrence, controls 
and mitigating actions, together with early warning systems 
and further actions which need to be implemented. Detailed 
below is a description of the Group’s internal control and 
risk management used in the process of preparing the 
Consolidated financial statements.
The key features of U+I’s system of internal control include:
 − A comprehensive system of financial reporting and 
business planning with appropriate sensitivity analysis;
 − A detailed authorisation process which ensures that no 
material commitments are entered into without 
competent and extensive approval;
 − A defined schedule of matters reserved for the  
Board, and clear defined roles of the Chairman and 
Chief Executive;
 − An organisational structure with clearly defined levels 
of authority;
 − Formal documentation of procedures;
 − The close involvement of the Executive Directors  
in all aspects of the day to day operations, including 
regular meetings with senior management to review all 
operational aspects of the business and risk  
management systems;
 − A review of the Group strategy and progress on 
developments at each scheduled Board meeting;
 − A comprehensive insurance programme; and
 − A formal whistleblowing policy.
Internal auditors
H W Fisher & Company acted as the Company’s internal 
auditors for the year ending 29 February 2016. From April 
2016 the Committee stood H W Fisher down as internal 
auditors. A full review of the Company’s requirements for 
an internal audit function was undertaken by the Chief 
Financial Officer in conjunction with the Committee 
Chairman, and discussions took place on this issue at each 
Committee meeting during the year. The Committee took 
into account the size and complexity of the business; it 
also sought the advice of the external auditors and 
conducted a review of internal audit functions within its 
peer group. The Committee agreed that it did not consider 
a permanent internal audit function, either in-house or 
outsourced, was required at this time. The Committee 
confirmed that a process was in place to regularly review 
this evaluation, and also a mechanism was in place to 
adequately cover areas that may need additional review 
and focus as circumstances and the nature of risks change. 
Any such review would be carried out by using experienced 
staff or external advisors. The Committee will annually 
review the requirement for an internal audit function. 
The Board has conducted a review of the effectiveness of 
the systems of internal control for the year ended 28 
February 2017, and to the date of this report, and considers 
that there is a sound system of internal control which 
accords with the ‘FRC Guidance on Risk Management, 
Internal Control and Related Financial and Business 
Reporting’. The Board is satisfied that there is an ongoing 
process for identifying, evaluating and managing the 
Group’s principal risks, including financial, operational and 
compliance controls, and that it is regularly reviewed.
Going concern
The Directors have reviewed the current and projected 
financial position of the Group, making reasonable 
assumptions about future trading performance.  The key 
areas of sensitivity are:
 − Receipt, amount and timings of development profits;
 − Timing and value of property sales;
 − Availability of loan finance and related cash flows;
 − Committed future expenditure;
 − Future property valuations and their impacts on 
covenants and potential loan repayments; 
 − Committed future expenditure; and
 − Future rental income.
The forecast cash flows have been sensitised to reflect those 
cash flows which are less certain and to take account of a 
potential deterioration of property valuations. In addition, the 
forecasts have been subject to sensitivity analysis in which 
the impact of significant reductions to the property portfolio 
fair value and associated rental income on the Group’s loan 
covenants was assessed.  From their review, the Directors 
believe that the Group has adequate resources to continue 
to be operational as a going concern for the foreseeable 
future and therefore have adopted the going concern basis 
in preparing the Group’s 2017 financial statements.

RELATIONS WITH SHAREHOLDERS
The Board prioritised engagement throughout the year with 
existing and potential shareholders, led by the Executive 
Directors and supported by the Non-executive Directors. 
Peter Williams assumed the role of Chairman at the 2016 
AGM and has met with key shareholders; Nick Thomlinson 
assumed the role of Senior Independent Director, replacing 
Sarah Bates.
Regular calls and meetings were facilitated with institutional 
shareholders who, in aggregate, held over 90% of the 
issued share capital of the Group. These discussions 
covered the Company’s strategy, management, 
remuneration and governance. A number of shareholders 
visited key development sites, and the executive 
management team hosted a site visit at 8 Albert    
Embankment in November 2016, which was well attended 
by analysts and shareholders. The Board also received 
feedback from shareholders via a ‘perceptions audit’ 
undertaken during the year. 
Presentations were made by the Executive Directors to 
analysts, shareholders and the media following the release 
of the preliminary and interim results. Copies of these 
presentations, together with the Annual Report and trading 
updates, are published on the Company’s website at 
www.uandiplc.com. Regular announcements of the 
Group’s significant transactions are made to enhance 
shareholders’ understanding of the Company’s execution 
of its business strategy. 
The Company ensures that the Board has an up-to-date 
perspective on the views and opinions of shareholders 
and the investment market. A report summarising share 
price performance compared to the market, feedback 
received from the buy and sell sides, changes to the 
shareholder register and key sector news is produced for 
each Board meeting.
During the year a shareholder consultation process was 
undertaken by the Remuneration Committee with 
shareholders owning an aggregate total of 60% of the 
share register. The results of this consultation were taken 
into account when revising the Remuneration Policy  
(see pages 80 to 91), to be put to shareholder vote at the 
2017 AGM. 
The Company’s website contains up-to-date information 
for shareholders and other interested parties, including 
annual reports, share price information, news releases, the 
financial calendar, presentations to the investment 
community and information on shareholder services.

U and I Group PLC  Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Annual Statement from the Remuneration Committee Chairman
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
Highlights
 − Increased shareholding guidelines. 
 − Extension of LTIP holding period to five years.
 − New disclosure of annual bonus financial targets 
and increased disclosure of strategic/individual 
performance.
 − No salary increases for 2017/18.
I am pleased to present our Directors’ Remuneration Report 
for the year ended 28 February 2017. This report has been 
prepared in accordance with the remuneration reporting 
regulations and includes the following:
 − The Remuneration Policy (the Policy) sets out details of 
our new Directors’ Remuneration Policy which will be  
subject to a binding vote at our 2017 AGM.
 − The Annual Remuneration Report provides details on 
how our Directors were paid in respect of the year ended 
28 February 2017, and how we intend to apply our 
Remuneration Policy for Directors in the financial year 
ended 28 February 2018.
Remuneration Policy renewal
Prior to our existing Policy being tabled for approval in 
2014, the Remuneration Committee (the Committee) 
undertook a comprehensive review of our executive 
remuneration framework. This resulted in a significant shift 
in our incentive structure, and our Long-Term Incentive Plan 
(LTIP) replaced a number of legacy cash-based plans. As 
part of this transition, the Committee determined that the 
existing Policy would be effective from 1 March 2015.
As a result, notwithstanding that the Policy was approved 
at the 2014 AGM, it has only been in effect for the last two 
financial years. Following a review of our current approach 
in 2016/17, it was agreed that it was too early in the lifetime 
of the Policy to propose significant changes. During the 
review we engaged with our major shareholders and took 
into account their views when agreeing the final proposed 
Policy which is being tabled for approval at the 2017 AGM. 
We are proposing some amendments to the Policy to ensure 
it is aligned with evolving investor expectations. These are 
explained in more detail below.
Holding periods
We have extended the holding period that applies to our 
LTIP awards so that the combined performance and holding 
period for the entire award is five years. This applies to 
awards granted from 1 March 2017.
Annual bonus performance measures
As disclosed last year, for the financial year ended 28 
February 2017 we changed our approach to the annual 
bonus. This has now been formalised in our Policy and we 
have introduced a minimum weighting for financial measures 
of 50% of the total bonus. In line with our approach last 
year, for 2017/18, 60% of the annual bonus will be based 
on financial measures, with the remaining 40% based on 
strategic/personal measures. 
Shareholding guidelines
Under our existing policy, Executive Directors are required 
to build up a shareholding of 50% of salary within two years 
of appointment and 100% of salary within four years of 
“WE HAVE CONSULTED OUR 
SHAREHOLDERS DURING THE YEAR  
TO ENSURE THAT THE CHANGES  
WE ARE PROPOSING TO OUR POLICY  
AND THE EXPECTATIONS OF OUR 
SHAREHOLDERS ARE ALIGNED WITH 
EXECUTIVES IN THE CREATION OF  
VALUE OVER THE LONGER TERM”
Nick Thomlinson
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee

U and I Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Remuneration policy
REMUNERATION POLICY 
The key objectives of the Company’s Remuneration Policy 
are as follows:
 − To ensure that Executive Directors and senior managers 
are rewarded in a way that attracts, retains, motivates 
and rewards management of the highest quality.
 − To operate incentive plans designed to encourage 
Executive Directors and senior managers to align their 
long-term career aspirations with the long-term interests 
of the Company and shareholders’ expectations.
 − To promote the attainment of both individual and 
corporate achievements, measured against performance 
criteria required to deliver the long-term growth and 
sustainability of the business.
 − To encourage sustained performance over the medium 
and long term without taking undue risk.
The total pay framework is based on a mixture of fixed and 
variable elements considered on a meritocratic basis at 
individual and Group level, taking into account the remuneration 
awarded to employees in the Group. The balance between 
fixed and variable pay is considered appropriate, given that 
the various incentive plans/schemes ensure a significant 
proportion of a key individual’s remuneration package is 
performance related, thereby correlating with the strategic 
aims of the business and the performance of the Company.
The Policy will apply from the 2017 AGM subject to 
shareholder approval.
Changes to the Policy
The key changes between this Policy and the policy which 
was approved by shareholders at our 2014 AGM are 
as follows:
 − Extending the holding period that applies to our LTIP 
awards such that the combined performance and holding 
period will be five years in total for the entire award for 
awards from 1 March 2017.
 − From 2016/17 we changed our approach to the annual 
bonus, moving to a structure with financial and strategic/
personal targets set at the beginning of each year. 
To reflect this change in operation, we have introduced 
a minimum weighting for financial measures of 50% for 
the annual bonus.
 − We have introduced an additional shareholding guideline 
requiring Executive Directors to retain 50% of net vested 
shares from the LTIP until they build up shareholdings 
of 200% of salary for the CEO and 150% of salary for 
the Deputy CEO and CFO.
appointment. We are strengthening our guidelines such 
that, over time, Executive Directors will be required to build 
shareholdings of 200% of salary for the Chief Executive, 
and 150% of salary for the Deputy Chief Executive and 
Chief Financial Officer.
Remuneration out-turns
2016/17 was the first year of operation of our new annual 
bonus structure with financial and strategic/personal targets 
set at the beginning of the year. The threshold targets set 
in relation to NAV growth and development and trading 
gains were not achieved and consequently no annual bonus 
payments were made in respect of these elements. Good 
performance was achieved against the personal and strategic 
objectives. As a result the Executive Directors received 
annual bonus payments ranging from 19.5% to 20.1% of 
salary. Further disclosure is set out on pages 96 and 97. 
An assessment of the performance conditions for the award 
made under the Performance Share Plan (PSP) on 22 May 
2014 resulted in nil vesting.
During the year the CEO received payouts under the legacy 
Development Profit Plan. These relate to awards granted in 
previous years and reflects the successful realisation of profits, 
above a notional cost of equity threshold, from five projects.
Implementation of Policy in 2017/18
We are not making any changes to the operation of our Policy 
for 2017/18, save for those outlined above. No increases are 
being made to the Executive Directors’ salaries for the financial 
year beginning 1 March 2017. This represents the second 
consecutive year for which we have not increased salaries.
As a Committee, we are committed to ongoing dialogue 
with our shareholders, and I hope to receive your support 
for our Policy Report and Annual Remuneration Report at 
our forthcoming Annual General Meeting.

LEGACY ARRANGEMENTS AND TRANSITION
Prior to the Policy being approved in 2014, the Committee undertook a review of incentive arrangements and the

the Development Profit Plan as there are awards outstanding. Any subsisting awards for legacy plans will continue 
in accordance with the relevant plan rules. 
PURPOSE OF COMPONENT 
AND LINK TO STRATEGY OPERATION MAXIMUM
PERFORMANCE
MEASURES
Development Profit 
Plan (DPP) 
Incentivises and rewards 
Executive Directors for 
the performance of their 
portfolio of projects.
No awards have been made to 
Executive Directors for projects 
which commence following 
1 March 2015.
Awards may pay out once a 
project makes a realised profit. 
No payments will be made in 
respect of profits realised after 
1 March 2018.
50% of the payment is made  
in cash or shares at the time 
profit is realised.
The remaining 50% is deferred 
until the end of the financial 
year and paid in cash or shares 
at this point. 
The maximum aggregate pool 
available for distribution to 
Executive Directors and the 
wider team is 10% of the 
realised profit above a hurdle 
for each development project.
Payments are only made 
under this plan once profit 
has been realised on a 
development above a 
threshold return (a notional 
cost of equity).
Losses attributable to other 
projects in which a Director has 
been made an award  
are also taken into account 
when calculating payments  
to ensure that participants are 
incentivised to mitigate losses 
while maximising project 
profits. This calculation is at the 
Committee’s discretion and will 
not apply in respect of certain 
legacy awards and projects. 
Where unrealised losses are 
deducted in the calculation but 
a profit is subsequently 
recognised a balancing 
payment may be made.
There are no subsisting awards under either the Strategic Profit Plan or the Investment Growth Plan. No further awards will be made 
to Executive Directors under these two plans.

Notes to the Policy table
Application of Policy
The Committee reserves the right to make any remuneration 
payments and payments for loss of office (including 
exercising any discretions available to it in connection with 
such payments) that are not in line with the Policy set out 
above where the terms of the payment were (i) agreed 
before 1 March 2015 (the date our first shareholder-
approved policy came into effect); (ii) before the Policy set 
out in this report comes into effect, provided that the terms 
of the payment were consistent with the shareholder-
approved policy in force at the time they were agreed; or 
(iii) at a time when the relevant individual was not a Director 
of the Company and, in the opinion of the Committee, the 
payment was not in consideration for the individual 
becoming a Director of the Company. For these purposes, 
‘payments’ includes the Committee satisfying awards of 
variable remuneration and an award of shares or cash is 
‘agreed’ at the time the award is granted.
Discretion
The Committee will operate the LTIP and DPP in accordance 
with the relevant plan rules. In particular, the Committee 
retains discretion on the operation and administration of 
these plans as follows:
 − Dividend equivalents may be paid on awards including 
on a reinvested basis.
 − While LTIP awards will normally be delivered in shares, 
the Committee may settle an award in cash. 
 − In the event of a variation of the Company’s share capital, 
a demerger, special dividend or distribution or any other 
corporate event which, in the Committee’s opinion, 
might affect the current or future value of awards, the 
Committee may adjust the number of shares, the 
exercise price and the performance condition.
Awards may be amended in accordance with the rules 
approved by shareholders.
Payment in shares
Where cumulative payments under the Development Profit 
Plan exceed £1.0 million in one financial year, two thirds of 
the payments above £1.0 million will be made in shares 
which the Director is expected to hold for at least two 
years. This will apply if the Director’s shareholdings are 
less than two times salary. The Chief Executive is the only 
Director with outstanding Development Profit Plan awards.
The Committee may increase the level of share deferral for 
incentives at any time.
Takeover or other corporate event
For outstanding LTIP awards, on a takeover or other 
corporate event, generally the performance period will end 
on the date of the event. The Committee will determine 
vesting having regard to the extent to which performance 
conditions have been achieved at this point taking into 
account any other factors they consider relevant. Awards 
will generally vest on a time pro-rata basis taking into 
account the shortened performance period, unless the 
Committee determines otherwise. Awards subject to a 
holding period will be released as part of the transaction.
Alternatively, outstanding LTIP awards may be subject to 
rollover, with the agreement of the acquiring company.
Other corporate events may include, but are not limited 
to, a demerger, delisting, distribution (other than an  
Ordinary dividend), reverse takeover and merger by way 
of dual listing.
Under the DPP, on a takeover, the Committee can bring 
forward payments. The amount of the payments 
will not exceed the bonus pool and, subject to that, 
are determined by the Committee on the basis of 
estimated profits.
86
U and I Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Minor changes
The Committee may make minor amendments to the Policy 
(for example for regulatory, exchange control, tax or 
administrative purposes or to take account of a change  
in legislation) without obtaining shareholder approval for 
the amendment.
Performance measures and target setting
Annual bonus
As discussed in last year’s report, from 2016/17 we changed 
our approach to the annual bonus, moving to a structure 
with financial and strategic/personal targets set at the 
beginning of each year, with measures and targets aligned 
with the Company’s annual objectives. 
Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)
The Company’s overarching objective is to build shareholder 
value over the long term. The LTIP measures the Company’s 
NAV per share growth over three and four years. This will 
ensure that Directors are closely aligned with the 
shareholder experience as our NAV per share growth 
performance is a key indicator of the performance of the 
business and is closely related to share price performance.
Targets are positioned at a level which the Committee 
considers to be stretching but which do not incentivise a 
change in our risk approach.

Differences in Remuneration Policy for Executive 
Directors compared with other employees
As for our Executive Directors, a sizeable proportion of 
employee pay is dependent on Company, team and 
individual performance. All employees participate in the 
annual bonus, with the weighting of individual and corporate 
measures dependent on an individual’s role and their ability 
to directly influence the Company’s results.
Individuals below the Board who are involved in the 
organisation and management of our development and 
trading projects may be invited to participate in the DPP 
as appropriate. While this plan was discontinued for 
Executive Directors with effect from 1 March 2015, it 
continues to operate below the Board to ensure that 
individuals at this level are rewarded for profit realisation 
from development projects.

U and I Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Expenses incurred in the performance of Non-executive 
Directors’ duties may be reimbursed or paid for directly by 
the Company, including any tax due on those expenses.
No Director plays a role in determining their own 
remuneration. Fees for all Non-executive Directors are set 
at a level sufficient to attract and retain individuals with the 
required skills, experience and knowledge to allow the 
Board to carry out its duties. The fees set out above are 
the sole element of Non-executive Director remuneration. 
They are not eligible for participation in the Company’s 
incentive or pension plans.
The fees are set within the aggregate limits set out in  
the Company’s Articles of Association and approved  
by shareholders.
Approach to remuneration on recruitment
The Committee will apply the following principles on the 
recruitment of a new Executive Director:
 − Although the Company operates in a highly competitive 
market for talent, the Committee is mindful of the need 
to avoid paying more than is necessary on recruitment.
 − The package of a new Executive Director would, so far 
as practical, be aligned with the Policy table.
 − Salaries would reflect the skills and experience of the 
individual, and may be set at a level to allow future salary 
progression to reflect performance in the role. For interim 
positions a cash supplement may be paid rather than 
salary (for example a Non-executive Director taking on 
an executive function on a short-term basis).
 − It would be expected that the structure and quantum of 
the variable pay elements would reflect those set out 
in the Policy table. However, at recruitment, the 
Committee may flex the balance between annual 
and long-term incentives and the measures used to  
assess performance.
 − Variable pay on recruitment (excluding buy-outs) would 
be subject to the maximums in line with the ongoing 
incentive policy maximums set out in the Policy table; 
being 150% of salary for annual bonus and 300% of 
salary for the LTIP.
In the event that an individual is internally promoted to the 
Board (including if an Executive Director is appointed 
following an acquisition or merger), the Company would 
normally honour all legacy arrangements in line with their 
original terms.
Buy-outs
To facilitate recruitment, the Committee may make 
compensatory payments and/or awards for any remuneration 
arrangements subject to forfeit on leaving a previous 
employer. Any buy-out would take into consideration the 
terms of the arrangement being forfeited and would take 
into account all relevant factors such as the form, expected 
value, performance conditions, anticipated vesting and 
timing of the forfeited remuneration. There is no limit on 
the value of such awards, but the Committee’s intention is 
that the value awarded would be no more than the 
commercial value forfeited.
Recruitment of Non-executive Directors
On the appointment of a new Chairman or Non-executive 
Director, remuneration arrangements will be consistent 
with the Policy set out in this report.
Service contracts – Executive Directors
The dates of the current contracts in place for the Executive 
Directors are as follows:
Executive Director Date of contract
M S Weiner 23 July 2015
R Upton 19 May 2014
M O Shepherd 23 July 2015
The Executive Directors’ service contracts do not specify 
an expiry date and may be terminated upon twelve months’ 
notice by either the Director or the Company. 
In the event of early termination, a payment in lieu of notice 
may be made which may include salary, pension 
and benefits.
89
Strategic report + Corporate governance + Financial statements
U and I Group PLC  Annual Report and Accounts 2017 The Company’s policy on termination payments is to 
consider the circumstances on a case-by-case basis, taking 
into account the relevant contractual provisions, the 
circumstances of termination and any applicable duty 
to mitigate.
An Executive Director may be hired on a contract that has 
a longer notice period (up to 18 months) during an initial 
pre-determined period.
The Chairman and Non-executive Directors have letters 
of appointment rather than service contracts. Details of 
the dates of appointment are set out below:
Non-executive Director Date of appointment
N H Thomlinson 3 January 2012
B Bennett 19 May 2014
P W Williams (Chairman) 4 January 2016
L G Krige 10 March 2016
The Non-executive Directors’ appointments are terminable 
at the will of the parties but are envisaged to establish 
an initial term of three years, after which they will be 
reviewed annually.
The notice periods are currently twelve months in the 
case of the Chairman and six months for other 
Non-executive Directors.
The Executive Directors’ service contracts and the 
Non-executive Directors’ letters of appointment are 
available at the Company’s registered office from the 
Company Secretary.
Policy on payment for loss of office
Where an Executive Director leaves employment, the 
Committee’s approach to determining any payment 
for loss of office will normally be based on the 
following principles:
 − The Committee’s objective is to find an outcome which 
is in the best interests of both the Company and its 
shareholders while taking into account the specific 
circumstances of cessation of employment.
 − The Committee reserves the right to make any other 
payments in connection with an Executive Director’s 
cessation of office or employment where the payments 
are made in good faith in discharge of an existing legal 
obligation (or by way of damages for breach of such an 
obligation) or by way of a compromise or settlement of 
any claim arising in connection with the cessation of an 
Executive Director’s office or employment. Any such 
payments may include, but are not limited to, paying 
any reasonable level of fees for outplacement assistance 
and/or the Executive Director’s legal or professional 
advice fees in connection with his cessation of office 
or employment.
 − The Committee may make an annual bonus payment 
for the year of cessation depending on the reason for 
leaving. Typically, the Committee will take into 
consideration the period served during the year and the 
individual and the Company’s performance up 
to cessation. Any such payment is at the discretion of 
the Committee.
 − The treatment of outstanding share awards will be 
governed by the relevant plan rules as set out in the 
table below. For the purposes of this table, good leaver 
reasons include, but are not limited to, cessation due 
to ill-health, redundancy, retirement, death and any other 
reason at the discretion of the Committee.
 − If awards are made on recruitment (such as buy-outs) 
the treatment on leaving would be determined at  
that time.

U and I Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 ONGOING PLANS
PLAN TREATMENT ON CESSATION OF EMPLOYMENT
Long-Term Incentive Plan Unvested awards will normally lapse in full unless a participant is a good leaver.
If the Committee determines that a participant is a good leaver, it will determine the proportion of 
the award that vests to the extent that any performance condition is satisfied on the vesting date 
and it will take into account the time elapsed between the start of the performance period and 
cessation of employment unless it determines otherwise.
The vesting date for such awards will normally be the original vesting date, although the Committee 
has the flexibility to determine that awards can vest early upon cessation of employment or at a later 
date. In the event of death, awards vest on cessation.
Where options are granted, vested options will typically remain exercisable for twelve months from 
the date of vesting. In the event of death, awards remain exercisable for 24 months.
Where an individual leaves during the holding period of an award, the award will usually be released 
at the normal time, except in the case of death or if the Committee disapplies the holding period. In 
the event of an individual’s dismissal for misconduct during the holding period, all awards will lapse.
HMRC approved all 
employee share plans
In line with the HMRC approved plan rules.
LEGACY PLAN
PLAN TREATMENT ON CESSATION OF EMPLOYMENT
Development Profit Plan Awards will normally lapse in full unless a participant is a good leaver.
If a participant is treated as a good leaver and ceases employment before the bonus is paid, the 
Committee may decide that some, or all, of the participant’s bonus is paid to him at the same time 
as they are paid to other participants.
Consideration of pay and employment conditions elsewhere in the Company
The Committee considers pay and employment conditions elsewhere in the Company when developing policies for 
Executive Directors. The Committee does not view formal comparison metrics when considering policy. However, 
the Committee is kept updated and has input into the remuneration decisions for the wider employee population. 
For example, the Committee will typically review the annual bonuses for all employees.
Consideration of shareholder views 
We consulted with our major shareholders in advance of the renewal of our Policy at the 2017 AGM and the proposed 
Policy has been shaped by the recent dialogue with our shareholders.

1 March 2017.
Annual bonus
Last year the Committee moved to an annual bonus 
structure with financial and strategic/personal targets set 
at the beginning of each year. The targets set for 2016/17 
are disclosed in the incentive out-turns section on pages 
95 to 97. For 2017/18 we will continue with this structure.

For awards following 1 March 2017, the holding period will 
be extended such that the entire award will have a combined 
performance and holding period of five years.
Awards will be subject to a risk underpin. For awards to 
vest, the Committee must be satisfied that performance 
has not been achieved as a result of inappropriate financial 
risk (e.g. very high levels of gearing), and that the level of 
financial and business risk is in line with the Company’s 
stated strategy. 
Clawback and malus
In line with the revised 2014 UK Corporate Governance 
Code, incentive awards made following 1 March 2016 are 
subject to both malus and clawback.
Clawback and/or malus provisions may be applied at the 
discretion of the Committee if an exceptional event occurs, 
such as a material misstatement of results, serious 
misconduct or an error/material misstatement resulting in 
overpayment. 
Malus provisions may also be applied in the event of serious 
reputational damage to the Company or a material failure 
of risk management. 
Clawback provisions will apply to the annual bonus for 
up to two years following the payment of cash/shares. 
For LTIP awards, malus and clawback provisions may be 
applied for up to five years post grant.
Transitional arrangements
The remuneration framework that has applied since 1 March 
2015 involved a significant departure from our historical 
approach which has been focused on cash-based 
profit plans.
As previously reported, to balance fairness to participants 
and shareholders as well as reflect legacy contractual 
entitlements, transitional arrangements will apply as  
outlined below.
Development Profit Plan
While no new awards will be made under this plan, or have 
been made since 1 March 2015, payments in respect of 
profits realised up to 1 March 2018 may be made. 
Awards become payable once profits have been 
realised on a development project. The maximum bonus 
pool available for distribution to Executive Directors and 
the wider team is 10.0% of the realised profit for 
each development. This is calculated once a notional 
cost  of equity of 12.5% is deducted, so that the 
pool generated only relates to profits over and above 
a threshold return.
In 2013, the concept of netting off was introduced for all 
projects from August 2009 so that any realised and 
unrealised losses in respect of an Executive Director's 
portfolio will be taken into account when a profit is realised 
on a project. Projects prior to 2009 and certain other legacy 
projects are excluded.
Performance Share Plan
Historic awards made under the PSP will continue to run 
and will vest on their normal vesting date subject to the 
satisfaction of the required performance conditions.
No further awards will be made under the PSP. The 
performance period for the final award made under the 
PSP ended on 28 February 2017.
Savings-related option scheme
Executive Directors will continue to participate in our  
Save As You Earn Option Plan on the same basis as  
other employees.

Performance Share Plan
Awards were made under the PSP in 2014 subject to the Company’s relative total shareholder return (TSR) performance 
and growth in NAV per share over the period 1 March 2014 to 28 February 2017. U+I’s TSR performance was below the 
median of the comparator group, the Company’s NAV per share growth was below the required threshold, therefore 
the 2014 PSP award lapsed in full. This was the final award made under this plan.

Executive Directors’ shareholdings (audited)
Executive Directors are subject to a shareholding requirement of one half basic salary within two years of appointment, 
rising to an amount equivalent to one times basic salary after four years. 
Executive Directors will be subject to an additional shareholding requirement of two times basic salary for the CEO 
and one and a half times basic salary for the Deputy CEO and CFO. 50% of net vested shares will be retained until 
these guidelines are achieved.
Executive Directors participating in the Company’s focused profit plans are also subject to an additional shareholding 
requirement. Where payments under the profit plans exceed £1.0 million in a financial year, two thirds of the payment 
above £1.0 million will be made in shares. This will apply if the Executive Director’s shareholding is less than two times 
salary. The amount paid in shares will be subject to a two-year retention period.

U and I Group PLC  Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Role and constitution of the Committee
The Committee’s full terms of reference are set out on the Company’s website www.uandiplc.com and are available 
on request from the Company Secretary. Its principal role is to determine the total remuneration of the Executive 
Directors and to ensure that senior management remuneration is consistent with corporate policy.
Advisors 
The Committee sought professional advice from external remuneration consultant Deloitte LLP (which is a member of 
the Remuneration Consultants Group and, as such, voluntarily operates under the code of conduct in relation to 
executive remuneration consulting). 
The Committee is satisfied that the advice it receives is objective and independent. Deloitte’s fees for providing advice 
to the Committee amounted to £48,450. Representatives of Deloitte LLP attended four meetings of the Committee by 
invitation. During the year Deloitte LLP also provided services to the Company in relation to planning and development 
real estate advice. 
M S Weiner, Chief Executive, provided recommendations in respect of the remuneration of the other Executive Directors 
but was not in attendance when his own remuneration was discussed.

The Company remains committed to ongoing shareholder dialogue and takes an active interest in voting outcomes. 
The following table sets out the actual voting in respect of the advisory vote to approve the Annual Report on Remuneration 
at the Company’s AGM on 14 July 2016 as well as the binding vote to approve the Remuneration Policy at the Company’s 
AGM on 16 July 2014.

One of our largest shareholders operates a general policy of voting against remuneration reports and policies where, 
for long-term incentives, the performance period plus holding period is less than five years. At the time of the above 
votes our performance plus holding period for the LTIP was five years for two thirds of the award. As a result of its 
voting policy guidelines it was unable to support our Remuneration Policy at the 2014 AGM, or the implementation of 
our Policy at the 2016 AGM. This had a significant impact on the overall voting out-turn at both AGMs. Our revised 
Policy updates the holding period so that the combined performance and holding period for the entire LTIP award 
is five years.

Results and dividends
The loss for the financial year attributable to shareholders 
amounted to £3,003,000 (2016: £21,828,000 profit). An 
interim Ordinary dividend of £3,003,000 representing 2.40 
pence per Ordinary share was paid on 25 November 2016 
(27 November 2015: £2,999,000 representing 2.40 pence 
per Ordinary share). The Board recommends a final Ordinary 
dividend of 3.50 pence per Ordinary share amounting to 
£4,379,000 payable on 17 August 2017 to shareholders on 
the register at 21 July 2017 (19 August 2016: £4,378,000 
representing 3.50 pence per Ordinary share). A further 
supplemental dividend of 2.80 pence per Ordinary share 
was announced to market on 26 April 2017 amounting to 
£3,506,000 payable on 16 June 2017 to shareholders on 
the register at 12 May 2017 . Subject to shareholder approval, 
this makes a total dividend declared of 8.70 pence per 
Ordinary share for the financial year (2016: 13.90 pence 
per Ordinary share). Further information on the Company’s 
dividend policy can be found on page 46.

alternatively may be governed by statute. There are no 
restrictions on the transfer of shares in the Company other 
than those specified by law or regulation. There are no 
restrictions on voting rights other than as specified by the

Three resolutions relating to share capital will be proposed 
as Special Business at the forthcoming Annual General 
Meeting. The full text of the resolutions can be found in 
the Notice of the Annual General Meeting. At a General 
Meeting of the Company, every member has one vote on 
a show of hands and, on a poll, one vote for each share 
held. The Notice of General Meeting specifies deadlines 
for exercising voting rights, either by proxy or being present 
in person, in relation to the resolutions proposed at the 
General Meeting.
Purchase of the Company’s shares
At the Annual General Meeting held on 14 July 2016, 
members authorised the Company to make market 
purchases of up to 12,507,428 of its own Ordinary shares 
of 50 pence each. That authority expires at the forthcoming 
Annual General Meeting of the Company on 11 July 2017 
when a resolution will be put to shareholders to renew it 
so as to allow purchases of up to a maximum of no more 
than 10% of the Company’s issued share capital. No shares 
in the Company have been purchased by the Company in 
the period from 14 July 2016 (the date the current authority 
was granted) to the date of this report. The Company 
currently holds 118,792 shares in treasury.
Change of control
The Group has entered into significant agreements with 
its commercial partners, which contain change of control 
clauses and which may give rise to termination or 
renegotiation in that event. If enforced, the Company may 
be deprived of potential future earning capacity from such 
schemes. The Company is party to a number of committed 
bank facilities which, upon a change of control, are 
terminable at the banks’ discretion. In addition, under such 
circumstances, the Company’s share option schemes 
would normally vest or become exercisable subject to the 
satisfaction of the performance conditions.

situation where he or she has, or can have, a direct or 
indirect interest that conflicts, or possibly may conflict, 
with the Company’s interests. The Directors are required 
to notify the Board as soon as they become aware of any 
actual or potential conflicts of interest with their duties to 
the Company, or of any material changes in any existing 
actual or potential conflicts that may have been authorised 
by the Board. No significant conflicts of interest arose 
during the year under review.

provides, among other things, that, insofar as permitted 
by law, every Director shall be indemnified by the Company 
against all costs, charges, expenses, losses or liabilities 
incurred in the execution and discharge of the Directors’ 
duties, power or office. The Company maintains, at its 
expense, a Directors’ and Officers’ liability insurance policy 
at an adequate level which is reviewed annually. This 
insurance policy does not provide cover where a Director 
or Officer is proved to have acted fraudulently or dishonestly.
This third party indemnity insurance was in force during 
the financial year and also at the date of approval of the 
financial statements.
Articles of Association
The Articles of Association may be amended by a Special 
Resolution of the shareholders.
Annual General Meeting
The Annual General Meeting will be held on 11 July 2017 
at 12 noon at 7A Howick Place, London SW1P 1DZ.
At the Annual General Meeting, the following resolutions 
will be proposed:
Ordinary Resolution 1 – Report and Accounts
The Directors will present the financial statements and 
Reports of the Directors and Auditors for the financial year 
ended 28 February 2017.
Ordinary Resolutions 2 and 3 – To approve the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report and Policy
In accordance with the directors’ remuneration reporting 
regime as set out in Schedule 8 to the Large and Medium-
sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) 
Regulations 2008 (as amended), the Company’s 2017 
Directors’ Remuneration Report comprises the Remuneration 
Committee Chairman’s Annual Statement, the Annual 
Report on Remuneration (the Annual Remuneration Report), 
and the Directors’ Remuneration Policy (the Policy).
Resolution 2 seeks shareholder approval for the Annual 
Remuneration Report. This is set out on pages 92 to 104 
of the Annual Report and sets out details on how our 
Directors were paid in the financial year ended 28 February

107

continued
Report will be prepared on an annual basis and is subject 
to an advisory shareholder vote.
Resolution 3 seeks shareholder approval for the Policy as 
set out on pages 81 to 91, this is a binding vote. The Policy 
was previously approved by shareholders at the 2014 AGM 
and was effective from 1 March 2015. The Policy, if 
approved, will take effect from 11 July 2017, following the 
2017 AGM, and will apply until replaced by a new or 
amended Policy. The Policy is subject to a shareholder vote 
at least once every three years. Once the Policy is effective, 
the Company will not be able to make remuneration or loss 
of office payments to a current or past Director, unless the 
payment is consistent with the approved Policy or has been 
otherwise approved by shareholders.
Ordinary Resolutions 4 to 10 – Re-election of Directors
The Directors seek to maintain the highest standards of 
corporate governance and, in accordance with the 
recommendations of the UK Corporate Governance Code, 
those Directors elected or re-elected at the 2016 Annual 
General Meeting will voluntarily retire and those wishing 
to serve again shall submit themselves for re-election by 
the shareholders at the 2017 Annual General Meeting. The 
Chairman is satisfied that, following individual formal 
performance evaluations, the performance of the Directors 
standing for re-election continues to be effective and 
demonstrates commitment to the role. The Nomination 
Committee has considered each of the Non-executive 
Directors seeking re-election and concluded that  
their collective background, skills, experience, 
independence and knowledge of the Company enables 
the Board and Committees to discharge their respective 
duties and responsibilities effectively. The workings of the 
Board and Committees are more particularly detailed in 
the Corporate Governance section on pages 56 to 104. 
Biographical details of all the Directors appear on page  
59 of the Annual Report.
Ordinary Resolution 11 – Declaration of final dividend
A final dividend can only be paid after the shareholders at 
a general meeting have approved it. A final dividend of 
3.50 pence per Ordinary share is recommended by the 
Directors for payment to shareholders who are on the 
register at the close of business on 21 July 2017.
Ordinary Resolutions 12 and 13 – Re-appointment 
and remuneration of auditors
Resolutions 12 and 13 propose the re-appointment of 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as auditors of the Company 
and authorise the Directors to set their remuneration.
Special Resolution 14 – Authority to purchase 
own shares
The Company is seeking authority to purchase up to 10% 
of the Company’s issued Ordinary share capital at, or 
between, the minimum and maximum prices specified in 
this Resolution. This power would only be used after careful 
consideration by the Directors, having taken into account 
market conditions prevailing at that time, the investment 
needs of the Company, its opportunity for expansion and 
its overall financial position. The Directors have no present 
intention of making any market purchases of the Company’s 
shares, but if they believed such action would be in the 
best interests of shareholders and would enhance net 
assets or earnings per share, they would consider exercising 
their authority. As at 25 April 2017 (being the latest 
practicable date prior to publication of the Notice of Annual 
General Meeting), the Company has an unexpired authority 
to repurchase 12,507,428 Ordinary shares of which 
12,507,428 Ordinary shares remain outstanding.
As at 25 April 2017 (being the latest practicable date prior 
to publication of the Notice of the Annual General Meeting), 
the total number of options to subscribe for shares in the 
capital of the Company was 228,172 (approximately 0.18% 
of the Company’s issued share capital and approximately 
0.20% of the Company’s issued share capital if the full 
authority proposed by Resolution 14 was used).
Under the Companies Act 2006, the Company is allowed 
to hold its own shares in treasury following a buyback, 
instead of cancelling them. Such shares may be re-sold 
for cash or used for the purpose of employee share 
schemes, but all rights attaching to them, including voting 
rights and any right to receive dividends, are suspended 
whilst they are held in treasury. Accordingly, if the Directors 
exercise the authority conferred by Resolution 14, the 
Company will have the option of holding these shares in 
treasury, rather than cancelling them. The authority sought 
at the Annual General Meeting will expire at the conclusion 
108
U and I Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 of the next Annual General Meeting of the Company or on 
1 September 2018 (being the latest date by which the 
Company must hold an Annual General Meeting in 2018). 
The Company currently holds 118,792 shares in treasury.
Ordinary Resolution 15 – Allotment of shares
The Directors may only allot Ordinary shares or grant rights 
over Ordinary shares if authorised to do so by shareholders. 
The authority granted to the Directors at the Company’s 
previous Annual General Meeting in 2016 to allot shares 
or grant rights to subscribe for, or convert any securities 
into, shares is due to expire at the conclusion of this year’s 
Annual General Meeting. Accordingly, the Directors will 
be seeking new authority under Section 551 of the 
Companies Act 2006 to allot shares (including treasury 
shares) or grant rights to subscribe for, or to convert any 
security into, shares which will expire at the conclusion of 
the next Annual General Meeting of the Company or on 
1 September 2018 (being the latest date by which the 
Company must hold an Annual General Meeting in 2018).
If passed, paragraph (a) of Resolution 15 would give the 
Directors authority to allot Ordinary shares or grant rights 
to subscribe for, or convert any security into, Ordinary 
shares up to an aggregate nominal amount of £20,851,325 
representing approximately one third (33.33%) of the 
Company’s issued Ordinary share capital (excluding shares 
held in treasury) and calculated as at 25 April 2017 (being 
the last practicable date prior to publication of the Notice 
of the Annual General Meeting). In accordance with the 
latest institutional guidelines issued by the Association of 
British Insurers (ABI), paragraph (b) of Resolution 15, if 
passed, would give the Directors authority to allot further 
shares in connection with a fully pre-emptive offer by way 
of a rights issue to shareholders up to a further aggregate 
nominal amount of £20,851,325 representing approximately 
one third (33.33%) of the Company’s issued Ordinary share 
capital (excluding shares held in treasury) and calculated 
as at 25 April 2017 (being the last practicable date prior to 
publication of the Notice of the Annual General Meeting). 
As at 25 April 2017 (being the last practicable date prior 
to publication of the Notice of the Annual General Meeting), 
the Company held 118,792 shares in treasury which 
represent approximately 0.10% of the total Ordinary  
share capital of the Company in issue (excluding shares 
held in treasury).
The Directors are currently giving consideration to the 
possible exercise of this authority. The Directors consider 
it desirable to have the maximum flexibility permitted by 
corporate governance guidelines to respond to market 
developments and to enable allotments to take place to 
finance business opportunities as they arise. Accordingly, 
the Directors intend to renew this authority annually.
Special Resolution 16 – Disapplication of 
pre-emption rights
Under Section 561(1) of the Companies Act 2006, if the 
Directors wish to allot any shares and other relevant 
securities, grant rights over shares, or sell treasury shares 
for cash (other than in connection with an employee share 
scheme), they must in the first instance offer them to existing 
shareholders in proportion to their holdings. The Directors 
seek authority to renew the disapplication of shareholders’ 
pre-emptive rights. The purpose of paragraph (i) of 
Resolution 16 is to authorise the Directors to allot any 
shares pursuant to the authority given by paragraph (a) of 
Resolution 15 for cash either (a) in connection with a pre-
emptive offer or rights issue or (b) otherwise up to an 
aggregate nominal value of £3,130,669 (being equivalent 
to 5.0% of the total issued Ordinary share capital of the 
Company as at 25 April 2017 (being the latest practicable 
date prior to publication of the Notice of the Annual General 
Meeting)) and which includes the sale on a non-preemptive 
basis of any shares held in treasury, in each case without 
the shares first being offered to existing members in 
proportion to their existing holdings.
The purpose of paragraph (ii) of Resolution 16 is to authorise 
the Directors to allot any shares pursuant to the authority 
given by paragraph (b) of Resolution 15 for cash in 
connection with a rights issue without the shares first being 
offered to existing members in proportion to their existing 
holdings. This is in line with corporate governance guidelines 
issued by the Pre-emption Group. The Board considers 
the authority sought to be appropriate in order to allow the 
Company flexibility to finance business opportunities or 
to conduct a pre-emptive offer or rights issue without the 
need to comply with the strict requirements of the statutory 
pre-emption provisions. The Board intends to adhere to 
the provisions in the Pre-emption Group’s Statement of 
Principles not to allot shares on a non-preemptive basis 
(other than pursuant to a rights issue or pre-emptive offer) 
109

a rolling three-year period without prior consultation  
with shareholders.
Special Resolution 17 – Notice period  
for general meetings
The Companies (Shareholders’ Rights) Regulations 2009 
increased the notice period for general meetings of a 
company to 21 clear days unless shareholders approve a 
shorter period, which cannot be less than 14 clear days.
At the Annual General Meeting of the Company held on 
14 July 2016, shareholders authorised the calling of general 
meetings, other than an Annual General Meeting, on not 
less than 14 clear working days’ notice. Resolution 17 seeks 
the approval of shareholders to renew the authority to be 
able to call general meetings (other than an Annual General 
Meeting) on 14 clear days’ notice. The shorter notice period 
would not be used as a matter of routine for general 
meetings, but only where the flexibility is merited by the 
business of the meeting and is thought to be to the 
advantage of shareholders as a whole. If the proposals at 
a given meeting are not time sensitive, the Company will 
not normally use the shorter notice period. The approval 
will be effective until the Company’s next Annual General 
Meeting, when it is expected that a similar resolution will 
be proposed. It should also be noted that the changes to 
the Companies Act 2006 mean that, in order to be able to 
call a general meeting on less than 21 clear days’ notice, 
the Company must make a means of electronic voting 
available to all shareholders for that meeting. 
Ordinary Resolution 18 – Political donations
Part 14 of the Companies Act 2006, amongst other things, 
prohibits the Company and its subsidiaries from making 
political donations or from incurring political expenditure 
in respect of a political party or other political organisation 
or an independent election candidate unless authorised 
by the Company’s shareholders. Aggregate donations 
made by the Group of £5,000 or less in any twelve-month 
period will not be caught.
Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries has any 
intention of making any political donation or incurring any 
political expenditure. However, the Companies Act 2006 
defines ‘political organisation’, ‘political party’, ‘political 
donation’ and ‘political expenditure’ widely. Accordingly, 
the Company wishes to ensure that neither it nor its 
subsidiaries inadvertently commits any breaches of the 
Companies Act 2006 through the undertaking of routine 
activities, which would not normally be considered to result 
in the making of political donations and political expenditure 
being incurred.
The Resolution authorises the Company and its 
subsidiaries to:
 − make political donations to political parties or 
independent election candidates, not exceeding £10,000 
in total;
 − make political donations to political organisations,  
other than political parties, not exceeding £10,000 
in total; and
 − incur political expenditure, not exceeding £10,000 in 
total, provided that the aggregate amount of any such 
donations and expenditure shall not exceed £10,000 
during the period beginning with the date of the passing 
of the Resolution and ending on the date of the 
Company’s next Annual General Meeting.

Charitable and political donations

(2016: £34,350). The Group supported a number of charities 
serving the community in which the Group operates. These 
included national and local charitable organisations and 
covered a wide range of causes, including education, public 
services, community support schemes and events 
organised on behalf of major charities.

112
U and I Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual 
Report, the Directors’ remuneration report and the 
financial statements in accordance with applicable law 
and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial 
statements for each financial year. Under that law, the 
Directors have prepared the Group financial statements 
in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union, and 
the Company financial statements in accordance with 
United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice 
(United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable 
law). Under company law the Directors must not approve 
the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they 
give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group 
and the Company and of the profit or loss of the Group 
for that period. In preparing these financial statements, 
the Directors are required to:
 − select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently;
 − make judgements and accounting estimates that are 
reasonable and prudent;
 − state whether IFRSs as adopted by the European Union 
have been followed, subject to any material departures 
disclosed and explained in the Group financial 
statements; and
 − prepare the financial statements on the going concern 
basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the 
Company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate 
accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain 
the Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable 
accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company 
and the Group and enable them to ensure that the financial 
statements and the Directors’ remuneration report comply 
with the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group 
financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. They 
are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the 
Company and the Group and hence for taking reasonable 
steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and 
other irregularities.
Having taken advice from the Audit and Risk Committee, 
the Directors consider that the Annual Report, taken as a 
whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides 
the information necessary for shareholders to assess the 
Company’s position and performance, business model 
and strategy.
Each of the Directors, whose names are listed on page 59 
of the Directors’ Report, confirm that, to the best of each 
person’s knowledge and belief:
 − the financial statements, prepared in accordance with 
IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, give a true 
and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position 
and profit of the Group and Company; and
 − the Strategic Report contained in the Annual Report 
includes a fair review of the development and 
performance of the business and the position of the 
Company and Group, together with a description of the 
principal risks and uncertainties that they face.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and 
integrity of the Company’s website, www.uandiplc.com. 
Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and 
dissemination of financial statements may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions.

Report on the Group financial statements
Our opinion
In our opinion U and I Group PLC’s Group financial statements (the “financial statements”): 
 − give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 28 February 2017 and of its loss and cash flows for 
the year then ended;
 − have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”) as adopted 
by the European Union;
 − have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
What we have audited
The financial statements, included within the Annual Report and Accounts (the “Annual Report”), comprise:
 − the Consolidated Balance Sheet as at 28 February 2017;
 − the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income for the year then ended;
 − the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement for the year then ended;
 − the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity for the year then ended; and
 − the notes to the financial statements, which include a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory 
information.
Certain required disclosures have been presented elsewhere in the Annual Report, rather than in the notes to the 
financial statements. These are cross-referenced from the financial statements and are identified as audited.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the financial statements is IFRSs as adopted 
by the European Union, and applicable law.

before tax before net finance costs and investment property valuation movements.
 − All work in support of the Group audit opinion is performed by the Group audit team.
 − Valuation of investment properties.
 − Valuation of development and trading properties.
 − Recoverability of financial assets.
114
U and I Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 The scope of our audit and our areas of focus
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) (“ISAs (UK & Ireland)”).
We designed our audit by determining materiality and assessing the risks of material misstatement in the financial 
statements. In particular, we looked at where the Directors made subjective judgements, for example in respect of 
significant accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently 
uncertain. As in all of our audits we also addressed the risk of management override of internal controls, including 
evaluating whether there was evidence of bias by the Directors that represented a risk of material misstatement due 
to fraud. 
The risks of material misstatement that had the greatest effect on our audit, including the allocation of our resources 
and effort, are identified as “areas of focus” in the table below. We have also set out how we tailored our audit to 
address these specific areas in order to provide an opinion on the financial statements as a whole, and any comments 
we make on the results of our procedures should be read in this context. This is not a complete list of all risks identified 
by our audit. 
Area of focus How our audit addressed the area of focus
Valuation of investment properties
The Group’s investment properties were valued at 
£179.2 million as at 28 February 2017 and a revaluation loss 
of £9.5 million was accounted for under ‘Loss on revaluation 
of property portfolio’ in the Consolidated Statement of 
Comprehensive Income. The portfolio consists of a 
variety of assets located throughout the UK and Ireland, 
predominantly retail units and shopping centres.
The majority of valuations are carried out by third party 
valuers in accordance with the RICS Valuation – Professional 
Standards and IAS 40. A small element of the portfolio 
(£15.1 million) is valued internally by the Directors.
There are significant judgements and estimates inherent 
in the valuation of the Group’s investment properties. 
Where available, the valuations take into account evidence 
of market transactions for properties and locations 
comparable to those of the Group’s properties.
The most significant judgements and estimates affecting 
all the valuations include yields and estimated rental value 
(“ERV”) growth (as described in note 9 of the Consolidated 
Financial Statements).
The investment property portfolio is heavily dominated 
by retail assets, with a number of shopping centres, retail 
parades and a factory outlet. 
Yields and ERVs have generally remained stable or improved 
in prime high street retail locations. However, secondary 
or tertiary locations and shopping centres have performed 
poorly in the year. A majority of the revaluation loss of 
£9.5 million is attributable to shopping centres.
The valuers used by the Group are CBRE Limited. They  
are a well-known and established firm. We assessed the 
competence and capabilities of the firm and verified their 
qualifications. We also assessed their independence by 
discussing the scope of their work and reviewing the  
terms of their engagements for unusual terms or fee 
arrangements. Based on this work, we are satisfied that  
CBRE Limited remains independent and competent and 
that the scope of their work was appropriate. 
We tested the data in the investment property valuation for 
a sample of properties, including rental income, acquisitions 
and capital expenditure data, by agreeing this to the 
underlying property records held by the Group. The 
underlying property records were themselves tested back 
to signed and approved lease contracts or sale/purchase 
contracts and approved third party invoices as applicable. 
We met with the external valuers independently of 
management and obtained the valuation reports for all 
material properties. We read the valuation reports and 
confirmed that the valuation approach for each was in 
accordance with RICS Valuation – Professional Standards 
and IAS 40 and suitable for use in determining the carrying 
value for the purpose of the financial statements. We involved 
our internal valuation specialists to compare the valuations 
of each property to our independently formed market 
expectations and to discuss and challenge the valuation 
methodology and assumptions. In doing this we used 
evidence of comparable market transactions and focused 
in particular on properties where the growth in capital 
values was higher or lower than our expectations based 
on market indices. 
115
Strategic report + Corporate governance + Financial statements
U and I Group PLC  Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Area of focus How our audit addressed the area of focus
Valuation of investment properties continued
The existence of significant estimation uncertainty, coupled 
with the fact that only a small percentage difference in 
individual property valuations when aggregated could result 
in material misstatement, is why we have given specific 
audit focus and attention to this area.
Refer also to note 9 to the financial statements, pages  
146 to 149 in the Report of the Audit and Risk Committee, 
and pages 73 to 77.
We found that yield rates and ERVs were predominantly 
consistent with comparable information for the location  
of the assets and assumptions appropriately reflected 
comparable market information. Where assumptions fell 
outside of our expected range, we assessed whether 
additional evidence presented in arriving at the final 
valuations was appropriate, and, whether this was 
corroborated by the external independent valuers where 
appropriate. Variances were predominantly due to property 
specific factors such as assets under offer or tenants 
entering into administration. We verified the movements  
to supporting documentation including evidence of 
comparable market transactions where appropriate. 
We challenged the Directors on the movements in the 
valuations and found that they were able to provide 
explanations and appropriate supporting evidence.
Valuation of development and trading properties
The Group’s development and trading properties were 
valued at £208.3 million as at 28 February 2017. These 
properties are held at the lower of cost and net realisable 
value, in accordance with IAS 2 – Inventory. As qualifying 
costs are incurred on existing developments, these are 
added to the asset balance.
The portfolio consists of a variety of assets located 
throughout the UK and Ireland, and while several disposals 
were recorded during the year, the portfolio includes certain 
assets acquired prior to the economic downturn of 2008, 
which could indicate a higher risk that the carrying value 
is higher than net realisable value. In addition, there are 
assets subject to significant judgements as a result of 
contractor and development risk, assets acquired in 2016 
and still held, since which period the market has declined, 
and assets valued by the external valuers below their 
carrying value.
The UK property market has seen falling capital values and 
ERVs during the year across many sectors and geographic 
locations, increasing the risk of impairment across the 
portfolio due to market conditions. A change in conditions 
for specific assets or a relatively small percentage change 
in the either the property or construction markets could 
result in a material impact to the financial statements.
(Refer also to note 14 to the financial statements, page 158 
in the Report of the Audit and Risk Committee and pages  
73 to 77.
Management performed an assessment of the net realisable 
value for each individual asset, including producing and 
reviewing development appraisals. We assessed the 
competence and capabilities of management and were 
satisfied that the individuals are sufficiently qualified.
We met with management to understand the status and 
future plans for each asset and challenge key assumptions 
inherent in the appraisals. We also visited a sample of 
assets with management.
We sensitised cost and revenue assumptions on significant 
developments, and compared assumptions to readily-
available market data and recent comparable market 
transactions. Where applicable due to the advanced  
stage of the development, we also agreed third party 
documentation supporting the book value through a review 
of pre-letting agreements, forward sales, quantity surveyor 
cost to complete estimates, board minutes and planning 
consent forms.
Additionally, we performed a look-back test, comparing 
historic book values of assets to disposal proceeds 
following their sale. There have been no significant losses 
made on disposals in recent years, including assets 
previously subject to write-downs. 
Based on this work we are satisfied with the evidence 
that development and trading properties are held at the 
lower of cost and net realisable value.

U and I Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Area of focus How our audit addressed the area of focus
Recoverability of financial assets
The Group holds a number of loans with joint ventures, 
associates and other third parties that must be assessed 
for recoverability at each period end. Financial assets, 
which include loans to joint ventures, associates and other 
third parties totalled £38.4 million at 28 February 2017, split 
between £19.9 million in non-current and £18.5 million  
within current assets. We focused on this area as the 
recoverability of the financial assets is assessed through 
cash flow models, which can be complex with a number 
of different inputs and judgement involved.
There continues to be risk associated with certain  
financial assets and, in particular, the recoverability  
of the working capital and project-specific loans to 
Northpoint Developments Limited, which rely on a number 
of property developments being completed over the next 
five year period.
Refer also to note 17 to the financial statements and pages 
73 to 77 in the Report of the Audit and Risk Committee.
 
We obtained management’s assessment of the 
recoverability of the loans, which includes cash flow 
projections over the next five years for each of the loans. 
These projections are based on underlying property 
development appraisals. 
We benchmarked and sensitised management’s 
assumptions and expectations for future disposals, 
including the comparison of expected sales prices to 
publically available market data and the benchmarking 
of future cost assumptions to current live developments 
within the portfolio. 
We tested cash receipts received in relation to these 
loans during the year and post year end through to 
bank statements.
In relation to the loans to Northpoint Developments Limited, 
we held discussions with management, obtained the 
appraisals supporting the profitability of the underlying 
scheme and corroborated this to publicly available market 
data and costs incurred to date. 
Based on this work, we are satisfied that the financial assets 
are recoverable.
How we tailored the audit scope
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the 
financial statements as a whole, taking into account the geographic structure of the Group, the accounting processes 
and controls, and the industry in which the Group operates. 
The Group is structured across over 200 statutory entities and joint ventures in the UK, Republic of Ireland, Jersey, 
Guernsey, the Netherlands and Luxembourg. These statutory entities and joint ventures represent the reporting units, 
which are included in the Group financial statements.
The preparation of the Group financial statements is managed on a consolidated basis, and the audit team carries out 
all the work in support of the Group audit opinion and the consolidation for the purposes of the Group audit. In 
establishing the overall approach to our audit, we assessed the risk of material misstatement, taking into account the 
nature, likelihood or potential magnitude of any misstatement. Following this assessment, we applied professional 
judgement to determine the extent of testing required over each balance in the financial statements.
This work, all of which was carried out by the Group audit team, together with additional procedures performed on the 
consolidation, gave us sufficient appropriate audit evidence for our opinion on the Group financial statements as a whole.
Materiality
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for 
materiality. These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the 
nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures on the individual financial statement line items and disclosures and 
in evaluating the effect of misstatements, both individually and on the financial statements as a whole. 
117
Strategic report + Corporate governance + Financial statements
U and I Group PLC  Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:
Overall Group materiality £4.4 million (2016: £4.8 million).
How we determined it Consistent with prior year, 0.75% of total assets.
Specific materiality £0.8 million (2016: £1.8 million).
How we determined it Consistent with prior year, 5% of profit before tax before net finance costs 
and investment property valuation movements.
Rationale for benchmark applied The key driver of the business and determinant of the Group’s value is direct 
property investments. Due to this, the key area of focus in the audit is the 
investment, development and trading properties. On this basis, we set an 
overall Group materiality level based on total assets. In addition, a number  
of key performance indicators of the Group are driven by income statement 
items and we therefore also applied a lower specific materiality for testing 
determinants of profit, excluding the revaluation movements of investment 
properties, gain on disposal of investment properties and net finance costs.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above 
£0.2 million (2016: £0.3 million) as well as misstatements below that amount that, in our view, warranted reporting for 
qualitative reasons.
Going concern
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the Directors’ statement, set out on page 77, in relation to going 
concern. We have nothing to report having performed our review. 
Under ISAs (UK & Ireland) we are required to report to you if we have anything material to add or to draw attention to 
in relation to the Directors’ statement about whether they considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis 
in preparing the financial statements. We have nothing material to add or to draw attention to. 
As noted in the Directors’ statement, the Directors have concluded that it is appropriate to adopt the going concern 
basis in preparing the financial statements. The going concern basis presumes that the Group has adequate resources 
to remain in operation, and that the Directors intend it to do so, for at least one year from the date the financial statements 
were signed. As part of our audit we have concluded that the Directors’ use of the going concern basis is appropriate. 
However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, these statements are not a guarantee as to the 
Group’s ability to continue as a going concern.
Other required reporting
Consistency of other information and compliance with applicable requirements
Companies Act 2006 reporting
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:
 − the information given in the Strategic report and the Directors’ report for the financial year for which the financial 
statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and
 − the Strategic report and the Directors’ report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.
In addition, in light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group, the Company and their environment obtained 
in the course of the audit, we are required to report if we have identified any material misstatements in the Strategic 
report and the Directors’ report. We have nothing to report in this respect.
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:
 − the information given in the Corporate Governance Statement set out on page 60 with respect to internal control 
and risk management systems and about share capital structures is consistent with the financial statements and 
has been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements; and
 − the information given in the Corporate Governance Statement set out on page 60 with respect to the Company’s 
corporate governance code and practices and about its administrative, management and supervisory bodies

 − apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, our 
knowledge of the Group acquired in the course of performing our audit; or
 − otherwise misleading.
We have no exceptions to report.
 − the statement given by the Directors on page 60, in accordance with provision 
C.1.1 of the UK Corporate Governance Code (the “Code”), that they consider  
the Annual Report taken as a whole to be fair, balanced and understandable and 
provides the information necessary for members to assess the Group’s and 
Company’s position and performance, business model and strategy is materially 
inconsistent with our knowledge of the Group acquired in the course of performing 
our audit.
We have no exceptions to report.
 − the section of the Annual Report on pages 73 and 74, as required by provision 
C.3.8 of the Code, describing the work of the Audit Committee does not 
appropriately address matters communicated by us to the Audit Committee.
We have no exceptions to report.
The Directors’ assessment of the prospects of the Group and of the principal risks that would threaten the 
solvency or liquidity of the Group
Under ISAs (UK & Ireland) we are required to report to you if we have anything material to add or to draw attention 
to in relation to:
 − the Directors’ confirmation on page 75 of the Annual Report, in accordance  
with provision C.2.1 of the Code, that they have carried out a robust assessment  
of the principal risks facing the Group, including those that would threaten its 
business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity.
We have nothing material to add 
or to draw attention to.
 − the disclosures in the Annual Report that describe those risks and explain how  
they are being managed or mitigated.
We have nothing material to add 
or to draw attention to.
 − the Directors’ explanation on page 77 of the Annual Report, in accordance with

to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have a reasonable 
expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its 
liabilities as they fall due over the period of their assessment, including any related 
disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.
We have nothing material to add 
or to draw attention to.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the Directors’ statement that they have carried out a robust assessment 
of the principal risks facing the Group and the Directors’ statement in relation to the longer-term viability of the Group. 
Our review was substantially less in scope than an audit and only consisted of making inquiries and considering the 
Directors’ process supporting their statements; checking that the statements are in alignment with the relevant provisions 
of the Code; and considering whether the statements are consistent with the knowledge acquired by us in the course 
of performing our audit. We have nothing to report having performed our review.
Adequacy of accounting records and information and explanations received
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion we have not received all the information 
and explanations we require for our audit. We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.

Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit
Our responsibilities and those of the Directors
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement set out on page 113, the Directors are responsible 
for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view.
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and 
ISAs (UK & Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards 
for Auditors.
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the Company’s members as a body in accordance 
with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, 
accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into 
whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
What an audit of financial statements involves
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give 
reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or 
error. This includes an assessment of: 
 − whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s circumstances and have been consistently applied 
and adequately disclosed; 
 − the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the Directors; and
 − the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
We primarily focus our work in these areas by assessing the Directors’ judgements against available evidence, forming 
our own judgements, and evaluating the disclosures in the financial statements.
We test and examine information, using sampling and other auditing techniques, to the extent we consider necessary 
to provide a reasonable basis for us to draw conclusions. We obtain audit evidence through testing the effectiveness 
of controls, substantive procedures or a combination of both. 
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report to identify material inconsistencies 
with the audited financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, 
or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware 
of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report. With respect to 
the Strategic report and Directors’ report, and Corporate Governance Statement, we consider whether those reports 
include the disclosures required by applicable legal requirements.
Other matter
We have reported separately on the Company financial statements of U and I Group PLC for the year ended 28 February 
2017 and on the information in the Director’s remuneration report that is described as have been audited.

U and I Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Notes to the Consolidated financial statements
For the year ended 28 February 2017
1 Basis of preparation and accounting policies
a)
(i) General information
The Consolidated financial statements of the Group for 
the year ended 28 February 2017 comprise the results of 
U and I Group PLC and its subsidiaries and were authorised 
by the Board for issue on 25 April 2017.
The Company is a public limited company which is listed 
on the London Stock Exchange and is incorporated and 
domiciled in the UK. The address of its registered office is 
7A Howick Place, London SW1P 1DZ.
(ii) Going concern
The Group adopts the going concern basis in preparing 
its Consolidated financial statements.
b) Basis of preparation
The Group’s financial statements have been prepared in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards 
Board (IASB), interpretations issued by the IFRS 
Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) and the Companies Act 
2006. The accounting policies which follow set out those 
policies which were applied consistently in preparing the 
financial statements for the year ended 28 February 2017 
and 29 February 2016.
The Consolidated financial statements have been prepared 
on a going concern basis and under the historical cost 
convention, as modified by the revaluation of investment 
property, operating property, available-for-sale financial 
assets and derivative instruments at fair value through profit 
and loss.
c) Critical accounting judgements and estimates
When preparing the Group financial statements, management 
are required to make judgements, assumptions and estimates 
concerning the future. These judgements and assumptions 
are made at the time the financial statements are prepared 
and adopted based on the best information available. Actual 
outcomes may be different from initial estimates and are 
reflected in the financial statements as soon as they become 
apparent. Management believe that the underlying 
assumptions are appropriate. Areas requiring judgements 
or estimates are discussed in the following section.
Judgements other than estimates
1.1 Classification of directly owned property assets
The Group earns revenue from property development, 
trading and investment, and operating serviced offices.
Property development includes the entire development 
process from identification of an opportunity through to 
construction, letting and sale of a completed scheme. This 
activity is undertaken both on the Group’s own Balance 
Sheet and in partnership with institutional investors, usually 
via a pre-sale of the completed development.
Property trading refers to participation in the development 
process, where the Group acquires an interest in land and 
enhances the potential development, for instance by 
procuring or changing planning permission, before selling 
on to a third party to complete the development.
Property investment represents the acquisition of income-
generating real estate which is held for the purposes of 
income and capital gain, through active asset management.
In most cases the property interest is held directly by the 
Group and is classified either as investment property (refer 
note 9) or as inventory for development and trading 
properties (refer note 14).
The varied nature of the Group’s properties is such that a 
number exhibit characteristics consistent with more than 
one classification; also, the Directors’ strategy for an asset 
may change during its ownership. The Directors determine 
the status of each asset according to their intention on 
acquisition. A change in classification is made only in 
exceptional circumstances, where the strategy has 
demonstrably changed for a period of over one year.

continued
1.2 Classification of projects in partnership
In addition to its directly owned and managed activities, 
the Group participates in similar activities in partnership 
with others, typically to access expertise in different 
locations or market sectors. The Group’s financial 
participation may be by way of equity investment or loan. 
In each case a judgement is required as to the status of 
the Group’s interest, as an associate, a joint venture, a joint 
operation or a financial asset, typically focusing on the 
extent of control exercised by the Group.
The Group’s share of control is governed and achieved by 
a mixture of rights set out in agreements and participation 
in the management of each business. The exercise of 
control in practice does not always follow the legal structure. 
The Directors have considered the position in respect of 
each venture, taking account of the operation in practice, 
and have determined the status of each accordingly.
These investments are reported under the relevant balance 
sheet headings, with a summary in note 26.
1.3 Acquisition of subsidiaries
The Group sometimes acquires properties through the 
purchase of entities which own real estate. At the time of 
acquisition, the Group considers whether the transaction 
represents the acquisition of a business. In cases where 
the entity is capable of being operated as a business, or 
an integrated set of activities is acquired in addition to the 
property, the Group accounts for the acquisition as a 
business combination. When the acquisition does not 
represent a business, it is accounted for as the purchase 
of a group of assets and liabilities. In making this distinction, 
the Group considers the number of items of land and 
buildings owned by the entity, the extent of ancillary 
services provided by the entity, and whether the entity has 
its own staff to manage the property (over and above the 
maintenance and security of the premises).
1.4 Accounting for pre-sold development assets
Where development is undertaken on the Group’s Balance 
Sheet under a contract for a pre-sale, a judgement is 
required as to whether this represents a sale of property 
or a contract for construction as described in note 1(h)(vi). 
As at 28 February 2017 and 29 February 2016 the Group 
does not have any construction contracts (under IAS 11).
Estimates
1.5 Valuation of property assets
The key source of estimation uncertainty rests in the values 
of property assets, which affects several categories of 
asset in the Balance Sheet.
The investment property portfolio (and the operating 
property) are stated at fair value, which requires a number 
of judgements and estimates in assessing the qualities of 
the Group’s assets relative to market transactions. Details 
of the judgements and assumptions made are set out in 
notes 1(i), 1(j), 9 and 10.
The same uncertainties affect the determination of fair 
value of certain available-for-sale financial instruments, 
described in note 17, with the further complexity that the 
value of these assets requires estimates of future 
construction costs, tenant demand and market yields.
The Group’s development and trading properties are carried 
at the lower of cost and net realisable value. The 
determination of net realisable value relies upon similar 
estimates, with the added challenge, in some cases, of 
judgements about uncertain planning outcomes. These 
amounts are disclosed in note 14.
1.6 Impairment reviews
The Group’s Curzon Park Limited joint venture owns a 
development site in Birmingham known as Curzon Street. 
The current proposal for the high-speed train link between 
London and Birmingham (HS2) indicates that the planned 
route of HS2 passes through the site, including provision 
for part of the prospective station. In view of this, the ultimate 
value of the site is uncertain. It is not clear what impact HS2 
will have on the development of the 10.5-acre site. The 
Directors believe that the site will recover at least its carrying 
value in the books of the joint venture, although the interim 
and ultimate uses of the site and timing of its development 
remain unclear. The site is discussed in note 17(a).
Following a review of investment strategy and in view of 
operating losses at Executive Communication Centres 
(ECC), the Group’s serviced office subsidiary, the Group 
has conducted a review of its investment in the business. 
During the year, the Group decided to exit two centres and 
carried out a full impairment review on this basis. The review 
required significant judgements and estimates concerning 
customer demand, competitor behaviour and discount 
126
U and I Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 rates for the sites that will continue to operate. The review 
determined that a net impairment of £2,150,000 was 
required against the closure certain centres and future 
losses across the business. This impairment has been 
shown as an exceptional item (refer note 2b).
1.7 Derivative financial instruments
The Group is party to a number of interest rate swap and 
foreign currency agreements which are accounted for as 
derivatives and measured at fair value. The estimation of 
this figure is based upon market assumptions about future 
movements in interest and exchange rates. The estimated 
fair values and the movements in the year are set out in 
note 17(c).
1.8 Group Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)
During the year, the Group made awards to staff under the 
Group’s LTIP. The awards vest according to a number of 
performance criteria, the primary measure being net asset 
value growth over a three-year period. In calculating the 
provision to accrue, management are required to estimate 
net asset growth over the vesting period. The estimate is 
reassessed at each reporting date.
d) New and amended accounting standards
The following standards have been adopted by the Group 
for the first time for the financial year beginning on 1 March 
2016. The adoption of these amendments did not have any 
impact on the financial statements of the Group.
 − Accounting for acquisitions of interests in joint operations 
– Amendment to IFRS 11.
 − Clarification of acceptable methods of depreciation and 
amortization – Amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 38.
 − Annual Improvements to IFRSs – 2012-2014 cycle. 
 − Disclosure Initiative – Amendments to IAS 1.
A number of new standards, amendments and interpretations 
are effective for annual periods beginning after 1 March 2017 
and have not been applied in preparing these Consolidated 
financial statements. None of these are expected to have 
a significant impact on the Group’s operations.
 − IAS 12, ‘Income taxes’, was amended to clarify the 
accounting for deferred tax where an asset is measured 
at fair value and that fair value is below the asset’s tax 
base. The amendment confirms that:
(i) A temporary difference exists whenever the carrying 
amount of an asset is less than its tax base at the end 
of the reporting period;
(ii) An entity can assume that it will recover an amount 
higher than the carrying amount of an asset to estimate 
its future taxable profit;
(iii) Where the tax law restricts the source of taxable 
profits against which particular types of deferred tax 
assets can be recovered, the recoverability of the 
deferred tax can only be assessed in combination 
with other deferred tax assets of the same type; and
(iv) Tax deductions resulting from the reversal of deferred 
tax assets are excluded from the estimated future 
taxable profit that is used to evaluate the recoverability 
of those assets.
This amendment is effective for accounting period 
commencing 1 March 2017 . The Group does not expect the 
amendment to have a material impact on its financial 
statements since fair value exceeds the cost for almost all 
of its Investment Properties as at 1 March 2015, 29 February 
2016 and 28 February 2017. The Group is monitoring fair 
value movements below cost to assess the impact of the 
amendment in future periods. 
 − IFRS 9, ‘Financial Instruments’, addresses the 
classification, measurement and recognition of financial 
assets and financial liabilities and replaces parts of IAS 
39. IFRS 9 requires financial assets to be classified into 
two measurement categories: those measured at fair 
value and those measured at amortised cost. The 
determination is made at initial recognition and will 
depend on characteristics of the instrument. For financial 
liabilities, the main change from IAS 39 is where the fair 
value option is taken for financial liabilities, the part of 
the fair value change due to an entity’s own credit risk 
is recorded in Other comprehensive income rather than 
the Income Statement, unless it creates an accounting 
mismatch. The standard is effective for the accounting 
period commencing 1 March 2018. The Group expects 
IFRS 9 to have an immaterial impact on accounting for 
financial instruments.

1  Basis of preparation and accounting policies 
continued
d)  New and amended accounting standards 
continued
 − IFRS 15, ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’, 
deals with revenue recognition and sets out principles 
for reporting the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty 
of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with 
customers. Revenue is recognised when a customer 
gains control of goods or services and has the ability 
to use and benefit from the goods or services. The 
standard replaces IAS 18, ‘Revenue’, and IAS 11, 
‘Construction Contracts’. The standard is effective for 
the accounting period commencing 1 March 2018. The 
Group expects IFRS 15 to have an immaterial impact 
on accounting for revenue. 
 − IFRS 16, ‘Leases’, was issued in January 2016 and will 
become mandatory for the accounting period 
commencing 1 March 2019, with early adoption 
permitted. Under the new standard, an asset, ‘right of 
use asset’, and the financial liability to pay rentals are 
recognised, with the exception of short-term and low 
value leases. The accounting for lessors will not 
significantly change. The Group is assessing the full 
impact of IFRS 16 and expects it to have an immaterial 
impact on its accounting practices.
There are no other IFRSs or IFRIC interpretations that are 
not yet effective that would be expected to have a material 
impact on the Group.
Summary of significant accounting policies
e) Basis of consolidation
The Consolidated financial statements of the Group include 
the financial statements of U and I Group PLC (the 
Company), its subsidiaries and its share of results of joint 
ventures and associates.
Subsidiaries are all entities (including special purpose 
entities) over which the Group has control. The Group has 
control when it has rights to variable returns from its 
involvement in the entity and has the ability to affect those 
returns through its power over the entity. The Group is 
deemed to have control where it does not have more than 
50% of the voting power but is able to govern the financial 
and operating policies by virtue of de facto control, taking 
account of how the entity operates in practice.
The results of subsidiaries acquired during the year are 
included from the effective date of acquisition, being the 
date on which the Group obtains control. They are 
deconsolidated on the date that control ceases. 
Where property is acquired, via corporate acquisition or 
otherwise, management considers the substance of the assets 
and activities of the acquired entity in determining whether 
the acquisition represents the acquisition of a business. 
The basis of the judgement is set out in note 1(c), 1.3.
Where such acquisitions are not judged to be an acquisition 
of a business, they are not treated as business combinations. 
Rather, the cost to acquire the corporate entity is allocated 
between the identifiable assets and liabilities of the entity 
based on their relative fair values at the acquisition date. 
Accordingly, no goodwill or additional deferred taxation 
arises. Otherwise, acquisitions are accounted for as 
business combinations.
Business combinations are accounted for under the 
acquisition method. Any excess of the purchase price of 
the business combination over the fair value of the 
identifiable assets and liabilities acquired is recognised as 
goodwill. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment and 
carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
If the business combination is achieved in stages, the 
acquisition date carrying value of the acquirer’s previously 
held interest in the acquiree is re-measured to fair value at 
the acquisition date. Any gains or losses arising from 
re-measurement are recognised in profit or loss.
The consideration transferred for the acquisition of a 
subsidiary is the fair value of the assets transferred, the 
liabilities incurred and the equity interests issued by the 
Group. This fair value includes any contingent consideration 
at the acquisition date. Any subsequent change to the fair 
value of the contingent consideration that is deemed to 
be an asset or liability is recognised with either the profit 
or loss recognised in the income statement.
Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.
The Group recognises any non-controlling interest on an 
acquisition-by-acquisition basis either at fair value or at 
the non-controlling interest’s proportionate share of the 
identifiable net assets acquired.
128
U and I Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Intra-group balances and any unrealised gains and losses 
arising from intra-group transactions are eliminated in 
preparing the Consolidated financial statements. Where 
necessary, adjustments have been made to the financial 
statements of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures 
to bring the accounting policies used and accounting 
periods into line with those of the Group.
f) Associates and joint ventures
An associated company is defined as an undertaking other 
than a subsidiary or joint venture over which the Group has 
significant influence but not control, generally accompanying 
a shareholding of between 20% and 50% of the voting 
rights. Investments in associates are accounted using the 
equity method of accounting. The Group’s investment in 
associates includes goodwill identified on acquisition.
The Group applies IFRS 11 to all joint arrangements. Under 
IFRS 11, investments in joint arrangements are classified 
as either joint operations or joint ventures depending on 
the contractual rights and obligations of each investor. The 
Group has assessed all of its joint arrangements and 
determined them to be joint ventures, accounted for using 
the equity method.
Under the equity method, the interest in associates or joint 
ventures is carried in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at 
cost adjusted thereafter for the Group’s share of post-
acquisition profits or losses and movements in Other 
comprehensive income. When the Group’s share of losses 
in an associate or joint venture equals or exceeds the 
Group’s interest, including any unsecured receivables, the 
Group does not recognise further losses unless it has 
incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the 
associate or joint venture.
g) Intangible assets
(i) Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition 
over the fair value of the Group’s share of the net identifiable 
assets of the acquired subsidiary at the date of acquisition. 
Goodwill on acquisitions of subsidiaries is included in 
Intangible assets. Goodwill is tested annually, or more 
frequently if circumstances change, for impairment and 
carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Any 
impairment is recognised immediately as an expense and 
is not subsequently reversed. Gains and losses on the 
disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill 
relating to the entity sold.
Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units (CGUs) for 
the purpose of impairment testing. The allocation is made 
to those CGUs that are expected to benefit from the 
business combination in which the goodwill arose, identified 
according to operating segment.
(ii) Impairment of non-financial assets
Assets that have an indefinite useful life, for example 
goodwill, are not subject to amortisation and are tested 
annually for impairment. Assets that are subject to 
amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events 
or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying 
amount may not be subsequently reversed. An impairment 
loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s 
carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The 
recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value 
less costs to sell and value-in-use. For the purposes of 
assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest 
levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows 
(CGUs). Prior impairment of non-financial assets, other 
than goodwill, are reviewed for possible reversal at each 
reporting date.
h) Revenue recognition
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration 
received or receivable. The Group recognises revenue 
when the amount of the revenue can be reliably measured; 
when it is probable that future economic benefits will flow 
to the entity; and when the specific criteria have been met 
for each of the Group’s activities as described below.
(i) Rental income is recognised on a straight-line basis 
over the term of the lease. Incentives for lessees to 
enter into lease agreements are spread evenly over 
the lease term, even if payments are not made on 
such a basis. The lease term is the non-cancellable 
period of the lease together with any further term for 
which the tenant has the option to continue the lease, 
where, at inception of the lease, the Directors are 
reasonably certain that the tenant will exercise that 
option. Lease incentives are usually in the form of 
rent-free periods or capital contributions. Assets held 
within both the investment and development and 
trading segments earn rental income.
(ii) Lease surrender payments from tenants are recognised 
in income when they are contractually agreed.
(iii) Sales of property classified as Inventory are 
recognised when the risks and rewards of ownership 
have been transferred to the purchaser, which is 
normally on unconditional exchange of contracts. For 
conditional exchanges, sales are recognised only 
when all of the significant conditions are satisfied.

h) Revenue recognition continued
(iv) Licence fee income from serviced offices is recognised 
on a straight-line basis over the term of the licence. 
Other income from serviced offices is recognised 
when the service is provided. The income is classified 
within the operating segment.
(v) Project management fee income is recognised on a 
straight-line basis over the contract term for which 
project management services are provided.
(vi) Development revenue and profits are recognised in 
accordance with IAS 11, ‘Construction Contracts’, 
or IAS 18, ‘Revenue’, depending on whether all 
development risks, apart from the construction risk, 
have passed to the purchaser under the terms of the 
development agreement. Where only the construction 
risk remains, the revenue and profit on the development 
is recognised under IAS 11 so as to match the 
proportion of development work completed on a 
percentage completion basis as determined by 
consultant monitoring surveyors or using a suitable 
method particular to the contract concerned. Profits 
are only recognised where the outcome can be 
determined with reasonable certainty. Full provision 
is made for losses as soon as such losses are foreseen. 
Where revenue and profit is recognised under IAS 18, 
disposals are recognised where the risks and rewards 
of ownership are considered to have been transferred 
to the purchaser. Profits are recognised within the 
development and trading segment.
(vii) Finance income is recognised by reference to the 
principal outstanding using the effective interest 
method and is included in Finance income in the 
income statement.
(viii) Dividend income from investments is recognised 
when the Group’s right to receive income has been 
established.
i) Investment properties
(i) Investment properties are those properties, including 
land holdings, that are held for long-term rental yields 
or for capital appreciation or both. Investment 
properties may be freehold or leasehold properties 
and must not be occupied by members of the Group. 
For leasehold properties that are classified as 
investment properties, the associated leasehold 
obligations are accounted for as finance lease 
obligations if they qualify to be treated as such.
(ii) Investment properties are measured initially at cost, 
including directly attributable transaction costs, and 
thereafter are stated at fair value. Surpluses and 
deficits arising from changes in the fair value of 
investment properties are recognised in the income 
statement in the year in which they arise.
(iii) Completed investment properties are valued, at each 
reporting date, by professional valuers who hold 
recognised and relevant professional qualifications 
and have recent experience in the location and 
category of the investment property being valued. In 
determining the fair value, the capitalisation of net 
income method and the discounting of future cash 
flows to their present value have been used, which 
are based upon assumptions including future rental 
income, anticipated maintenance costs and 
appropriate discount rate, and make reference to 
market evidence of transaction prices for similar 
properties. A deduction is made to reflect purchaser’s 
acquisition costs.
(iv) Investment properties under construction are valued 
by the Directors on the basis of the expected value 
of the property when complete, less deductions for 
the costs required to complete the project and 
appropriate adjustments for risk and finance costs. 
In preparing these valuations, the Directors consult 
with agents and other advisors to derive appropriate 
assumptions specific to each asset.
(v) Gains or losses on disposal of investment properties 
are calculated by reference to carrying value and 
recognised when the risks and rewards of ownership 
are considered to have passed to the purchaser, which 
is normally on unconditional exchange of contracts. 
For conditional exchanges, sales are recognised only 
when all of the significant conditions are satisfied. 
Gains and losses are recognised within Gains or 
losses on disposal of investment properties in the 
income statement.
(vi) Investment properties held for sale are held at fair 
value and classified separately within current assets 
in the Balance Sheet. 
130
U and I Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 j) Property, plant and equipment
(i) Operating properties – serviced offices
Operating properties are held for business purposes rather 
than for investment, generating revenue by way of licence 
fees and ancillary services. These properties are recognised 
initially at cost, which includes the original purchase price 
of the asset and the costs attributable to bringing the asset 
to its working condition for its intended use. Thereafter, 
the asset is carried at valuation less depreciation and 
impairment charged subsequent to the date of revaluation. 
A revaluation surplus is credited to Other comprehensive 
income and accumulated in equity under the heading of 
Net unrealised gain/(loss) reserve, unless it reverses a 
revaluation decrease on the same asset previously 
recognised as an expense, where it is first credited to the 
income statement to that extent.
Operating properties are valued at each reporting date by 
independent, professional valuers on the basis of Existing 
Use Value. Surpluses and deficits in the period are included 
in the Property revaluation reserve within equity, except 
where carrying value is below depreciated cost, in which 
case surpluses and deficits are included in the income 
statement. Depreciation is provided so as to write off the 
value of the properties, excluding land, over their expected 
useful lives, usually 25 years.
(ii) Other plant and equipment
Other plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated 
depreciation and any provision for impairment. Cost 
includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the 
acquisition of the assets. Depreciation is provided so as 
to write off the cost less estimated residual value of the 
assets over their expected useful lives on a straight-line 
method. The principal annual rates used for this purpose 
are as follows:
Fixtures, fittings and computer equipment – 10% to 33%
Motor vehicles  – 20%
The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed 
and adjusted if appropriate at the end of each reporting 
period. An asset’s carrying amount is written down 
immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset’s carrying 
amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount.
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing 
the net proceeds with the carrying amount and are recognised 
within Other gains and losses in the income statement.
k) Leases – Group as lessee
Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards 
of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as 
operating leases. Rents payable under operating leases, 
net of any incentives received from the lessor, are charged 
to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the 
term of the lease.
l) Inventory – development and trading properties
Property and development interests acquired or being 
constructed for sale in the ordinary course of business, 
rather than to be held for rental or capital appreciation, are 
held as inventory and are measured at the lower of cost 
and estimated net realisable value.
Cost includes directly attributable expenditure and interest. 
No element of overhead is included in cost, since it is not 
practical to identify overhead amounts in respect of particular 
assets. Where the Directors consider that the costs are not 
recoverable from the sale or development of the asset, the 
project or site is written down to its net realisable value, with 
the write down taken to the income statement.
Net realisable value is calculated as the estimated selling 
price of the project or site, based upon the current plans, 
less all further costs to be incurred in making the sale.
m) Current and deferred income tax
The tax expense for the year comprises current and deferred 
tax. Tax is recognised in the income statement, except to 
the extent that it relates to items recognised in Other 
comprehensive income or directly in equity. In this case, 
the tax is also recognised in Other comprehensive income 
or directly in equity.
The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis 
of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the 
balance sheet date, together with any adjustment in respect 
of previous years, in the jurisdiction where the Company 
and its subsidiaries operate and generate taxable income. 
Appropriate provisions are made based on the amounts 
expected to be paid to the tax authorities.

m) Current and deferred income tax continued
Deferred income tax is recognised using the liability method 
on all temporary differences arising between the tax bases 
of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for 
financial reporting purposes at the reporting date, with the 
following exceptions:
 − Where the temporary differences arise from the initial 
recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a 
transaction that is not a business combination that, at 
the time of the transaction, affects neither accounting 
nor taxable profit or loss.
 − In respect of taxable temporary differences associated 
with investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and 
associates where the timing of the reversal of the 
temporary difference can be controlled by the Parent, 
venture partner or investor respectively, and it is probable 
that the temporary difference will not reverse in the 
foreseeable future.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at 
the tax rates that are expected to apply to the year when 
the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax 
rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively 
enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent 
that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available 
against which the temporary difference can be utilised.
n) Financial assets and financial liabilities
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on 
the Group’s Balance Sheet when the Group becomes a 
party to the contractual terms of the instrument.
(i) Financial assets
The Group determines the classification of its financial 
assets at initial recognition. The classification depends on 
the purpose for which the financial assets were acquired 
as follows:
 − Loans and other receivables with fixed or determinable 
payments that are not quoted on an active market. The 
Group’s loans and receivables are included within Trade 
and other receivables, Cash and cash equivalents, 
Monies held in restricted accounts and deposits and 
Other financial assets in the Consolidated Balance 
Sheet.
 − Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss. This 
represents interest and currency swaps which are 
categorised as held for trading unless they are 
designated as hedges.
 − Available-for-sale financial assets are non-derivatives 
that are designated as such or are not classified in any 
other category. After initial recognition at cost, available-
for-sale assets are measured at fair value, with gains or 
losses being recognised as a separate component of 
equity until the investment is derecognised or until the 
investment is determined to be impaired, at which time 
the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in 
equity is included in the income statement. Equity 
instrument financial assets are held at cost in the event 
that the fair value of the instruments is not reliably 
measurable.
Trade receivables are recognised and carried at the lower 
of their original invoiced value and recoverable amount. 
Where the time value of money is material, receivables are 
carried at amortised cost. Provision is made when there is 
objective evidence that the Group will not be able to recover 
balances in full. Balances are written off when the probability 
of recovery is assessed as being remote. Subsequent 
recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited 
against the appropriate cost line in the income statement.
Amounts due from customers for contract work are included 
in Trade and other receivables and represent revenue 
recognised in excess of payments on account received.
Monies held in restricted accounts and deposits represent 
cash held by the Group in accounts with conditions that 
restrict the use of these monies by the Group and, as such, 
does not meet the definition of Cash and cash equivalents 
as defined in IAS 7, ‘Statement of Cash Flows’.
132
U and I Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Cash and cash equivalents comprise deposits held at call 
with banks and other short-term highly liquid investments 
with no significant risk of changes in value. Bank overdrafts 
that are repayable on demand and which form an integral 
part of the Group’s cash management are included as a 
financial liability. For the purposes of the Consolidated 
Cash Flow Statement, cash and cash equivalents are stated 
net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
Financial assets are included within current assets except 
for assets maturing after one year, which will be classified 
as non-current.
Financial assets are assessed for impairment at each 
reporting date. Assets are impaired where there is evidence 
that as a result of events that occurred after initial 
recognition, the estimated future cash flows from the assets 
have been adversely affected. The carrying amount of the 
asset is reduced and the amount of the loss is recognised 
in the income statement. If, in a subsequent period, the 
amount of the impairment decreases, the reversal of the 
previously recognised impairment is recognised in the 
income statement.
(ii) Financial liabilities
Loans and borrowings are initially recognised at fair value, 
net of directly attributable transaction costs, and 
subsequently measured at amortised cost using the 
effective interest method. Gains and losses arising on the 
repurchase, settlement or otherwise cancellation of 
liabilities are recognised respectively in Finance income 
and Finance costs.
Other financial liabilities, including trade and other payables, 
are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently at 
amortised cost and are classified as current liabilities if 
payment is due within one year or less. If not, they are 
presented as non-current liabilities.
(iii) Derivatives
The Group enters into derivative financial instruments, 
including interest rate swaps, caps and collars and cross-
currency swaps, to manage its exposure to interest rate 
and foreign exchange rate risk.
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date 
a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently 
re-measured to their fair value at each reporting date. The 
resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss 
immediately unless the derivative is designated as an 
effective hedging instrument, in which case the fair value 
is taken through Other comprehensive income.
(iv) Hedging
The fair value of hedging derivatives is classified as a non-
current asset or a non-current liability if the remaining 
maturity of the hedge relationship is more than twelve 
months, and as a current asset or a current liability if the 
remaining maturity of the hedge relationship is less than 
twelve months.
At the inception of the hedge relationship the Group 
documents the relationship between the hedging instrument 
and hedged item, along with its risk management objectives 
and its strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions, 
the nature of the risk being hedged and how effectiveness 
will be measured throughout its duration. Furthermore, at 
the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, the 
Group documents whether the hedging instruments that 
are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in 
offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows of hedged 
items. The gain or loss of the effective portion of changes 
in the fair value of the hedging instrument is recognised in 
Other comprehensive income. The gain or loss relating to 
an ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the 
income statement. Amounts taken to equity are recycled 
to the income statement in the periods when the hedged 
item is recognised in profit or loss.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the Group revokes 
the hedging relationship or the hedging instrument expires 
or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies 
for hedge accounting.
The Group does not have any hedging instruments as at 
28 February 2017.

o) Borrowing costs
Gross borrowing costs relating to direct expenditure on 
investment properties and inventories under development 
are capitalised. The interest capitalised is calculated using 
the rate of interest on the loan to fund the expenditure, or 
the Group’s weighted average cost of borrowings where 
appropriate, over the period from commencement of the 
development work until substantially all the activities 
necessary to prepare the qualifying asset for its intended 
use or sale are complete. The capitalisation of finance 
costs is suspended if there are prolonged periods when 
development activity is interrupted.
Capitalised interest is written off to direct costs on 
disposal of inventory or to operating profit on disposal 
of investment properties.
Other borrowing costs are recognised in profit or loss in 
the period in which they are incurred.
Fees paid on establishment of loan facilities are capitalised 
as a prepayment for liquidity services and amortised over 
the period of the facility to which it relates. All other 
borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement 
in the period in which they are incurred.
p) Provisions
A provision is recognised when the Group has a present 
legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it 
is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to 
settle the obligation and the amount can be reliably estimated.
Onerous lease provisions are created for properties that 
are unoccupied, sub-let at below the rent payable on the 
head lease or for operating sites where the projected future 
trading revenue is insufficient to cover the value-in-use.
Provisions are measured at the present value of the 
expenditure expected to be required to settle the obligation. 
The amortisation in the discount is recognised as an 
interest expense.
q) Employee benefits
(i) Pensions
The Group operates a defined contribution scheme whereby 
the Group pays fixed contributions into a pension fund. 
The Group has no legal or constructive obligation to pay 
further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient 
assets to pay all employees relating to employee service 
in the current or prior periods. The charge to the income 
statement in the year represents the actual amount payable 
to the scheme in the year. Differences between contributions 
payable in the year and contributions paid are shown as 
either accruals or prepayments in the Balance Sheet.
(ii) Profit-sharing and bonus plans
The Group recognises a liability and expense for bonus 
and profit-sharing in accordance with the bonus plans 
outlined in the Remuneration report on pages 80 to 104. 
The Group recognises a liability when contractually obliged.
r) Foreign currencies
The Consolidated financial statements of the Group are 
presented in UK Sterling, the Company’s functional and 
presentation currency. Transactions denominated in foreign 
currencies are translated into Sterling at the rates of 
exchange ruling at the dates of the transactions or valuation 
when items are re-measured.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign 
currencies at the balance sheet date are translated at the 
rates ruling at that date. Exchange movements are dealt 
within the income statement, with exchange differences 
on borrowings taken to Finance income or Finance costs, 
except when deferred in equity as qualifying cash flow 
hedges and qualifying net investment hedges.
s) Segmental reporting
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent 
with the internal reporting provided to the Chief Operating 
Decision-Maker (CODM). The CODM, who is responsible 
for allocating resources and assessing performance of the 
operating segments, has been identified as the Board.
134
U and I Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 t) Share capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new 
Ordinary shares or options are shown in equity as a 
deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
Where a Group company purchases its own share capital 
out of distributable reserves, the shares can be held as 
treasury shares. The shares are carried at the consideration 
paid, including any directly attributable costs of acquiring 
the shares. The value of the shares is deducted from the 
equity attributable to the Company’s equity holders until 
the shares are cancelled or re-issued. If the shares are 
subsequently re-issued, their value is re-attributed to the 
Company’s equity holders.
u) Share-based payments
The Group operates a number of share-based compensation 
plans, both equity and cash settled, under which the entity 
receives services from employees as consideration for 
cash or equity-settled instruments of the Group.
The fair value of the employee services received in exchange 
for the grant of the option is recognised as an expense. 
The total amount to be expensed is determined by reference 
to the fair value of the options granted.
Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)
The LTIP commenced on 1 March 2015 and replaced the 
Performance Share Plan (PSP). 
Under the scheme, Ordinary shares are conditionally 
awarded based on the performance of the Group over a 
four-year period for Executive Directors and a three-year 
period for staff. The performance of the Group is referenced 
to the net asset value per share growth over the vesting 
period and is based on non-market conditions. The 
Directors assess the likelihood of the award vesting and 
the maximum amount that will vest based on forward-
looking forecast of the Group.
Ordinary shares conditionally awarded under the PSP are 
valued at their fair value on the date of the award, taking into 
account the probability of the Ordinary shares vesting based 
on an equal probability of achieving appropriate total 
shareholder return ranking as determined under the 
performance condition.
The Group has used a Black-Scholes option valuation 
model to determine the fair value of share options granted. 
The cost of cash-settled transactions with employees and 
Directors is measured by reference to the fair value at the 
date at which they are granted and is recognised as an 
expense over the vesting period, which ends on the date 
on which the relevant employees become fully entitled to 
the award.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately 
vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon 
a market condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective 
of whether or not the market condition is satisfied, provided 
that all other performance conditions are satisfied. 
At each balance sheet date before vesting, the cumulative 
expense is calculated, representing the extent to which the 
vesting period has expired and management’s best estimate 
of the achievement or otherwise of non-market conditions 
and of the number of options that will ultimately vest or, in 
the case of an instrument subject to a market condition, be 
treated as vesting as described above. The movement in 
cumulative expense since the previous balance sheet date 
is recognised in the income statement, with a corresponding 
entry in accruals o reserves as appropriate.
v) Dividend distribution
Dividend distributions to the Company’s shareholders are 
recognised as a liability in the Group’s financial statements 
in the period in which the dividends are approved by the 
Company’s shareholders.
w) Exceptional items
Exceptional items are disclosed separately in the financial 
statements where it is necessary to do so to provide further 
understanding of the financial performance of the Group. 
They are material items of income or expense that have 
been shown separately due to the significance of their 
nature or amount.

Operating profit: stated after loss on disposal of investment properties, the revaluation of the investment property 
portfolio and exceptional items and before the results of associates, jointly controlled entities and finance income 
and costs.
IPD Index and Total Portfolio Return: total return from the completed investment property portfolio, comprising net 
rental income or expenditure, capital gains or losses from disposals and revaluation surpluses or deficits, divided by 
the average capital employed during the financial year, as defined and measured by Investment Property Databank 
Limited (IPD), a company that produces independent benchmarks of property returns.
Total shareholder return: movement in share price over the year plus dividends paid as a percentage of the opening 
share price.
Gearing: expressed as a percentage, and measured as net debt divided by total shareholders’ funds.
Loan to value gearing: expressed as a percentage of net debt as a proportion of total property assets, including shares 
of properties and net debt in all projects in partnership (refer note 26).
Net debt: total debt less cash and short-term deposits, including cash held in restricted accounts. 
2 Segmental analysis
a) The segmental information presented consistently follows the information provided to the CODM and reflects 
the three sectors in which the Group operates. The CODM, which is responsible for allocating resources and 
assessing performance of the operating segments, has been identified as the Executive Committee. The three operating 
divisions are:
 − Investment – management of the Group’s investment property portfolio, generating rental income and valuation 
movements from property management;
 − Development and trading – managing the Group’s development and trading projects. Revenue is received from 
project management fees, development profits and the disposal of inventory; and
 − Operating – serviced office operations. Revenue is principally received from short-term licence fee income.
Unallocated assets and liabilities comprise amounts that cannot be specifically allocated to operating segments; 
an analysis is provided below.
136
U and I Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 These divisions are the basis on which the Group reports its primary segmental information. All operations occur and 
all assets are located in the United Kingdom, except assets of £30,193,000 (2016: £38,871,000) which are located in the 
Republic of Ireland. All revenue arises from continuing operations.

b) Exceptional item
In view of the operating losses at the Group’s serviced office subsidiary, the Group conducted a review of the business. 
The review concluded that as this business sector was not core to Group strategy, it should be exited by way of either 
trade sale or phased closure of individual centres. The business operates across six separate centres. A provision of 
£2,150,000 has been made in this respect.

8 Earnings per share and net assets per share
Basic earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing profit or loss for the year attributable to owners of the 
Parent by the weighted average number of Ordinary shares outstanding during the year, excluding shares purchased 
by the Parent and held as treasury shares.
Diluted earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing the profit or loss attributable to owners of the Parent by 
the weighted average number of Ordinary shares outstanding during the year plus the weighted average number of 
Ordinary shares that would be issued on the conversion of all the dilutive potential Ordinary shares into Ordinary shares.
Basic net assets per share amounts are calculated by dividing net assets by the number of Ordinary shares in issue 
at the balance sheet date excluding shares purchased by the Parent and held as treasury shares.
Diluted net assets per share amounts are calculated by dividing net assets by the number of Ordinary shares in issue 
at the balance sheet date plus the number of Ordinary shares that would be issued on the conversion of all the dilutive 
potential Ordinary shares into Ordinary shares.
Management have chosen to disclose the European Public Real Estate (EPRA) adjusted net assets per share and 
earnings per share from continuing activities in order to provide an indication of the Group’s underlying business 
performance and to assist comparison between European property companies.
EPRA earnings is the profit or loss after taxation excluding investment property revaluations (including valuations of 
joint venture investment properties), impairment of development and trading properties, exceptional items and mark-
to-market movements of derivative financial instruments (including those of joint ventures) and intangible asset movements 
and their related taxation.
144
U and I Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 EPRA net assets (EPRA NAV) are the Balance Sheet net assets adjusted to reflect the fair value of development 
and trading assets, excluding mark-to-market adjustment on effective cash flow hedges and related debt adjustments 
and deferred taxation on revaluations and diluting for the effect of those shares potentially issuable under employee 
share schemes.
EPRA NAV per share is EPRA NAV divided by the number of Ordinary shares in issue at the balance sheet date.
EPRA triple net assets (EPRA NNNAV) is EPRA NAV adjusted to reflect the fair value of debt and derivatives and 
to include deferred taxation on revaluations. 
EPRA NNNAV per share is EPRA NNNAV divided by the number of Ordinary shares in issue at the balance sheet date.

Net book amount of Investment properties – non-current assets 179,199 203,318
At 28 February and 31 August each year, the Group engages professionally qualified valuers who hold a recognised 
professional qualification and who have recent experience in the locations and sectors of the investment portfolio. 
As at 28 February 2017, completed investment properties have been valued by CBRE Ltd at a value of £164,106,000 
(2016: £180,888,000). The current value equates to the highest and best use of the asset.
The valuers have consented to the use of their name in the financial statements.
Included within Investment properties are freehold land and buildings representing investment properties under 
development, amounting to £15,093,000 (2016: £18,830,000), which have been valued by the Directors. These properties 
comprise buildings and landholdings for current or future development as investment properties. This approach has 
been taken because the value of these properties is dependent on a detailed knowledge of the planning status, the 
competitive position of these assets and a range of complex project development appraisals.
Investment properties under development include £8,075,000 (2016: £8,065,000) of landholdings adjacent to retail 
properties within the Group’s portfolio, acquired for the purpose of extending the existing shopping centres. The fair 
value of these properties rests in the planned extensions, and is difficult to estimate pending confirmation of designs 
and planning permission, and hence has been estimated by the Directors at cost as an approximation to fair value.
£167,205,000 (2016: £192,613,000) of total investment properties are charged as security against the Group’s borrowings.
Valuation methodology
Our valuers are engaged as external valuers, as defined in the current edition of the RICS Valuation Professional 
Standards. The valuation process involves the Investment Team, our asset services provider and valuers. Prior to the 
valuation date full tenancy information verified by both the Investment Team and asset services provider is provided to 
the valuers. New lettings, completed and pending lease events and asset management proposals are provided by the 
Investment Team on an asset-by-asset basis. The valuers assimilated income information is checked by the Investment 
Team before the valuers report numbers.
The valuers benefit from their own internal databases and proprietary/external resources for both rental and capital 
evidence/yield evidence. 
The comparator method is used for establishing rental values. Rental evidence is either self-generating for multi-let 
assets, in particular shopping centres, or sourced through market evidence. Where appropriate, net effective rents are 
applied during extant lease terms and market rents applied at reversion.

U and I Group PLC  Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Notes to the Consolidated financial statements continued

9 Investment properties continued
With the majority of the investment portfolio comprising income-producing property, fair value is established using an 
investment method of valuation. Appropriate capitalisation rates are applied to the asset’s income stream in order to arrive 
at a yield profile, i.e. net initial yield, equivalent yield and reversionary yield that can be reconciled with market evidence. 
For multi-let properties, generally the approach involves applying differential capitalisation rates to the income stream, 
making adjustments for tenant covenant, term to expiry and unit quality, in order to arrive at a blended position. For example, 
a foodstore anchor tenant with a strong covenant could be capitalised at a rate of 4.75% and an independent/sole trader 
could be capitalised at a rate of 10.00% at the same property. Similarly, outward adjustments to capitalisation rates applied 
to vacant units in multi-let properties are made to reflect letting and covenant risk associated with future tenants.
There were no changes to valuation techniques during the year.
The following table analyses the non-financial assets carried at fair value, by valuation method. The different hierarchy 
levels have been defined as follows:
(i) Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. This may be the agreed sales price 
of an asset where exchange has occurred after the year-end date (Level 1).
(ii) Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly 
(that is, as prices) or indirectly (that is, derived from prices) (Level 2).
(iii) Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (that is, unobservable inputs). These 
assets are valued by external valuers and Directors (Level 3). An analysis of Level 3 assets is provided below.
It is the Group’s policy to recognise transfers into and out of hierarchy levels at the date of the change in circumstance.
There are no Level 1 assets or transfers between Levels 1 and 3 during the year ended 28 February 2017 or 29 February 2016.

U and I Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 The Group engages external, independent and qualified valuers to determine the fair value of Level 3 assets. The valuers

rental terms. Valuers will also review comparable transactions in the market. The fair value of Level 3 assets is also 
determined by reviewing local sales data or, where the assets are held for the purpose of extending an existing retail 
asset, by reviewing appraisals relating to the proposed scheme.

Adjustment to goodwill in respect of business combination 269
At 29 February 2016 and 28 February 2017 2,328
On 19 May 2014, the Group acquired 100% of the issued shares in Cathedral Group (Holdings) Limited, Cathedral 
Special Projects (Holdings) Limited and Cathedral (ESCO) Limited and 95% of the shares issued in Deadhare Limited, 
a property development group specialising in mixed-use regeneration schemes in the South East. The goodwill of 
£2,328,000 represents the unrecognised asset of the highly skilled workforce and specialist development knowledge 
acquired with Cathedral. 
Goodwill has been tested for impairment at the reporting date.
Goodwill is allocated to the Group’s cash-generating units (CGUs) identified according to the operating segment. The 
recoverable amount of all CGUs has been determined based on value-in-use calculations. The calculations use pre-tax 
cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management covering a period up to the completion 
of each project (or less than five years). The pre-tax discount rate used was 11.0%. No provision for impairment 
was considered necessary. No reasonable change in any assumption would give rise to a material impairment.

Included in the above amounts are projects stated at net realisable value of £5,486,000 (2016: £7,583,000).
Net realisable value has been estimated by the Directors, taking account of the plans for each project, the planning 
status and competitive position of each asset, and the anticipated market for the scheme. For material developments, 
the Directors have consulted with third party chartered surveyors in setting their market assumptions.
Interest of £2, 180,000 (2016: £2,937 ,000) was capitalised on development and trading properties during the year. Capitalised 
interest included within the carrying value of such properties on the Balance Sheet is £3,614,000 (2016: £2,629,000). 
This year, the Group engaged CBRE Ltd to provide valuations in respect of its development and trading assets. A large 
proportion of the Group’s development and trading portfolio falls outside of the criteria for a reliable fair value exercise. 
For example, the Group often has conditional land options in place to purchase land at a future date rather than ownership 
whilst planning is progressed at the Group’s expense.

Net derivative financial assets 257 315
At 28 February 2017, the Group held interest rate swaps, caps and collars designated as economic hedges and not 
qualifying as effective hedges under IAS 39. The derivatives are used to mitigate the Group’s interest rate exposure to 
variable rate loans of £51,972,000 (2016: £64,951,000). The fair value of the derivatives amounting to £36,000 are 
recorded as financial assets at 28 February 2017 (2016: £57,000 asset and £267,000 liability) with the fair value loss 
taken to finance costs.
Fair value estimation
The table below analyses financial instruments carried at fair value, by valuation method. The different levels are defined 
as follows:
(i) Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1).
(ii) Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly 
(that is, as prices) or indirectly (that is, derived from prices) (Level 2).
(iii) Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (that is, unobservable inputs)  
(Level 3). Discounted cash flows are used to determine fair values of these instruments.

d) Financial risk management
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including fair value interest rate risk, cash 
flow interest rate risk and foreign currency risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group’s overall risk management 
focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the Group’s 
financial performance. The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures.
The nature and extent of the Group’s financial risks, and the Directors’ approach to managing those risks, are described 
in the Financial review on pages 40 to 47 and below. This note provides further detailed information on these risks.
The Group defines capital as total equity and monitors this on the basis of gearing.

Interest on financial instruments classified as variable rate is re-priced at intervals of less than one year. Interest on 
financial instruments classified as fixed rate is fixed until the maturity of the instrument. The other financial assets and 
financial liabilities of the Group that are not included above are non-interest bearing and are therefore not subject 
to interest rate risk.
Foreign currency risk
During the year the Group has continued to invest in the Republic of Ireland. Foreign currency exposure is monitored 
by the Board. Foreign currency risk arises from future commercial transactions, recognised assets and liabilities and 
net investments in foreign operations.
The Board has set up a policy to manage foreign currency risk against the Group’s functional currency. When the Group 
acquires property assets denominated in Euros, any associated borrowings will also be denominated in Euros to limit 
exposure. Where appropriate, the Board will also require the foreign exchange risk to be hedged.
As at 28 February 2017, the Group was exposed to foreign currency risk from €47,000,000 (2016: €47,000,000) loan 
notes denominated in Euros and two Euro-denominated loan facilities of €24,307,000 and €20,000,000 (2016: three 
facilities totalling €49,737,000). The Sterling amount drawn against the Euro-denominated loans as at 28 February 2017 
was £5,637,000 (2016: £22,761,000).
During the year to 28 February 2017, the movement of Sterling against the Euro was approximately 20.0%. Management 
consider this movement to be exceptional following the EU referendum. Management have therefore increased the 
Euro sensitivity, from 8.0% to 10.0%, to be a prudent measure of sensitivity on this basis. Sensitivity for the year ended 
29 February 2016 has been restated on the same basis.
The following table demonstrates the possible effect of changes in Sterling and Euro exchange rates on loan balances 
with all other variables held constant:

U and I Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Interest rate risk
The Group’s interest rate risk arises from long-term borrowings. Borrowings issued at variable rates are partially offset 
by cash held at variable rates. The Board closely monitors interest rate risk and considers whether to fix or cap interest 
rates on a loan-by-loan basis. Longer-term facilities tend to be structured with fixed rates, whereas for shorter-term 
loans, a cap may be preferred. Similar principles are also employed in respect of joint ventures.
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity in respect of variable rate debt obligations to a change in interest rates, 
with other variables held constant, of the Group’s profit before income tax.
The sensitivity analysis excludes all non derivative fixed rate financial instruments carried at amortised cost as well 
as variable rate financial instruments.
Fair value interest rate hedging instruments that are part of a hedging relationship have been excluded. Variable rate 
non-derivative financial instruments where the associated interest has been capitalised have also been excluded.
As at 28 February 2017, a movement of 50 basis points higher or lower, with all other variables held constant, would 
have the following effect on profit before tax. Management consider a movement of 50 basis points to be a reasonable 
guide to sensitivity in the current interest rate environment.

Market risk
A summary of market risk and its effect on the Group is set out in the Risk review on page 19 and further discussed 
in the market review on pages 10 to 13 and in the Portfolio review on pages 22 to 39.
Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities except as detailed below, in respect of fixed rate loan facilities, 
the Directors consider the carrying amount to be either fair value or a reasonable approximation of fair value apart from 
equity instruments classified as available-for-sale assets under IAS 39, where fair value cannot be reliably measured.
Fixed rate debt
A valuation was carried out as at 28 February 2017 by J C Rathbone Associates Limited, to calculate the market value 
of the Group’s fixed rate debt on a replacement basis, taking into account the difference between fixed interest rates 
for the Group’s borrowings and the market value and prevailing interest rate of appropriate debt instruments. Whilst 
the replacement basis provides a consistent method for valuation of fixed rate debt, such financing facilities are in 
place to provide continuing funding for the Group’s activities. The valuation is therefore only an indication of a notional 
effect on the net asset value of the Group as at 28 February 2017, and may be subject to daily fluctuations in line with 
money market movements.
J C Rathbone Associates Limited have consented to the use of their name in the financial statements.
The fair value compared with the carrying amounts of the Group’s fixed rate financial liabilities as at 28 February 2017 
and 29 February 2016 is analysed below:

Total fixed rate financial liabilities 68,419 82,764 70,638 85,351
The fair value difference of £14,345,000 at 28 February 2017 (2016: £14,713,000) represents approximately 21.0% 
of gross, fixed rate borrowings (2016: 20.8%). The effect on net assets per share after tax of this adjustment would 
be a decrease of 9.2 pence after tax (2016: 9.4 pence decrease).

Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are only offset where there is a legally enforceable right of offset and there 
is an intention to settle the balances net. Deferred income tax assets arising from the Group’s trading and capital losses 
are recognised on the basis that there will be sufficient profits in the foreseeable future to utilise such losses. The Group 
has not recognised deferred income tax assets of £4,909,000 (2016: £5,928,000) in respect of losses amounting 
to £24,549,000 (2016: £29,642,000) that can be carried forward against future taxable income.
Movements in deferred income tax assets and liabilities (prior to the offsetting of balances) are shown above.

170
U and I Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 The fair value of grants is measured at the grant date using a Black-Scholes pricing model, taking into account the 
terms and conditions upon which the instruments were granted. The services received and a liability to pay for those 
services are recognised over the expected vesting period. The main assumptions of the Black-Scholes pricing model 
are as follows:
Grant date 22.12.14
Exercise price (pence) 179.2
Term (years) 3
Expected volatility 24%
Expected dividend yield p.a. 2.3%
Risk-free rate 0.9%
Expected forfeiture p.a. Nil
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the U and I Group PLC share price over 
multiple time periods. The expected volatility reflects the assumption that the historical volatility is indicative of future 
trends, which may not necessarily be the actual outcome.
The expected life of the options is based on historical data and is not necessarily indicative of exercise patterns that 
may occur.
Conditional awards under the Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) and the Performance Share Plan (PSP)
The LTIP commenced on 1 March 2016 and replaced the PSP. The terms of these plans are set out in the Remuneration 
report on pages 80 to 104.
The first award made under the LTIP was on 5 June 2015. Under the scheme, Ordinary shares are conditionally awarded 
based on the performance of the Group over a four-year period for Executive Directors and a three-year period for 
staff. The performance of the Group is referenced to the net asset value per share growth over the vesting period and 
is based on non-market conditions. The Directors assess the likelihood of the award vesting with the maximum amount 
that will vest based on forward-looking forecast of the Group.
The final award made under the PSP has now lapsed.
The principal assumptions for calculating the fair value of the Ordinary shares conditionally awarded are:

U and I Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 23 Contingent liabilities
In the normal course of its development activity, the Group is required to guarantee performance bonds provided 
by banks in respect of certain obligations of Group companies. At 28 February 2017, such guarantees amounted 
to £6,917,000 (2016: £6,917,000).
The Group has provided guarantees for rent liabilities in respect of properties previously occupied by Group companies. 
In the event that the current tenants ceased to pay rent, the Group would be liable to cover any shortfall until the building 
could be re-let. The Group has made provision against crystallised liabilities in this regard. In respect of potential 
liabilities where no provision has been made, the annual rent-roll of the buildings benefiting from such guarantees 
is £7,000 (2016: £165,000) with an average unexpired lease period of 70 years (2016: 3.7 years).
The Group has guaranteed its share of interest up to a maximum of £575,000 in respect of the £26,000,000 loan 
in Notting Hill (Guernsey Holdco) Limited. 
24 Pension scheme
The Company operates a defined contribution scheme for Directors and employees. Monthly premiums are invested 
in an independent insured fund.

to you if, in our opinion:

we require for our audit; or
 − adequate accounting records have not been kept by 
the Company, or returns adequate for our audit have 
not been received from branches not visited by us; or

Report on the Company financial statements
Our opinion
In our opinion, U and I Group PLC’s Company financial 
statements (the “financial statements”):
 − give a true and fair view of the state of the Company’s 
affairs as at 28 February 2017;
 − have been properly prepared in accordance with United 
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and
 − have been prepared in accordance with the requirements 
of the Companies Act 2006.
What we have audited
The financial statements, included within the Annual Report 
and Accounts (the “Annual Report”), comprise:
 − the Company Balance Sheet as at 28 February 2017;
 − the Company Statement of Changes in Equity for the 
year then ended; and
 − the notes to the financial statements, which include a 
summary of significant accounting policies and other 
explanatory information.
Certain required disclosures have been presented 
elsewhere in the Annual Report, rather than in the notes to 
the financial statements. These are cross-referenced from 
the financial statements and are identified as audited.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied 
in the preparation of the financial statements is United 
Kingdom Accounting Standards, comprising FRS 102 “The 
Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and 
Republic of Ireland”, and applicable law (United Kingdom 
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
Other required reporting
Consistency of other information and compliance  
with applicable requirements
Companies Act 2006 reporting
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course 
of the audit:
 − the information given in the Strategic report and the 
Directors’ report for the financial year for which the 
financial statements are prepared is consistent with the 
financial statements; and
 − the Strategic report and the Directors’ report have been 
prepared in accordance with applicable legal 
requirements.
178
U and I Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 We test and examine information, using sampling and other 
auditing techniques, to the extent we consider necessary 
to provide a reasonable basis for us to draw conclusions. 
We obtain audit evidence through testing the effectiveness 
of controls, substantive procedures or a combination 
of both. 
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial 
information in the Annual Report to identify material 
inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and 
to identify any information that is apparently materially 
incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the 
knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the 
audit. If we become aware of any apparent material 
misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the 
implications for our report. With respect to the Strategic 
report, Directors’ report and Corporate Governance 
statement, we consider whether those reports include the 
disclosures required by applicable legal requirements.
Other matter
We have reported separately on the Group financial 
statements of U and I Group PLC for the year ended 
28 February 2017.

Other Companies Act 2006 reporting
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report 
to you if, in our opinion, certain disclosures of Directors’ 
remuneration specified by law are not made. We have no 
exceptions to report arising from this responsibility. 
Responsibilities for the financial statements  
and the audit
Our responsibilities and those of the Directors
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities 
Statement set out on page 113, the Directors are responsible 
for the preparation of the financial statements and for being 
satisfied that they give a true and fair view.
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on 
the financial statements in accordance with applicable law 
and ISAs (UK & Ireland). Those standards require us to 
comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical 
Standards for Auditors.
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for 
and only for the Company’s members as a body in 
accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies 
Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving 
these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any 
other purpose or to any other person to whom this report 
is shown or into whose hands it may come save where 
expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
What an audit of financial statements involves
We conducted our audit in accordance with ISAs (UK & 
Ireland). An audit involves obtaining evidence about the 
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements 
sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the financial 
statements are free from material misstatement, whether 
caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: 
 − whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the 
Company’s circumstances and have been consistently 
applied and adequately disclosed; 
 − the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates 
made by the Directors; and 
 − the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
We primarily focus our work in these areas by assessing 
the Directors’ judgements against available evidence, 
forming our own judgements, and evaluating the disclosures 
in the financial statements.

For the year ended 28 February 2017
ii) Critical accounting judgements and estimates
When preparing the Company financial statements, 
management are required to make judgements, assumptions 
and estimates concerning the future. These judgements and 
assumptions are made at the time the financial statements 
are prepared and adopted based on the best information 
available. Actual outcomes may be different from initial 
estimates and are reflected in the financial statements as 
soon as they become apparent. Management believe that 
the underlying assumptions are appropriate. Areas requiring 
judgements or estimates are discussed below.
Judgements other than estimates
1.1 Derivative financial instruments
The Company is party to a number of interest rate swap 
and foreign currency agreements which are accounted for 
as derivatives and measured at fair value. The estimation 
of this figure is based upon market assumptions about 
future movements in interest and exchange rates. The 
estimated fair values and the movements in the year are 
set out in note 17(c) to the Group financial statements.
1.2 Group Long-Term Incentive Plan (LPIT)
During the year, the Company made awards to staff under 
the Group’s LTIP. The awards vest according to a number 
of performance criteria, the primary measure being net 
asset value growth over a three-year period. In calculating 
the provision to accrue, management are required to 
estimate net asset growth over the vesting period. 
The estimate is reassessed at each reporting date.
b) Investments
The Company’s investments in subsidiaries, associates 
and joint ventures are accounted for in the financial 
statements at cost less any provision for impairment.
Loans and receivables are initially recognised at fair value 
and subsequently at amortised cost using the effective 
interest method.
c) Operating leases
Rental payments under operating leases are charged on a 
straight-line basis to the profit and loss account over the lease 
term even if the payments are not made on such a basis.
28 Accounting policies
a) General information
The Company is a public limited company which is listed 
on the London Stock Exchange and is incorporated and 
domiciled in the UK. U and I Group PLC is the holding 
company for the U and I Group of companies.
i) Basis of preparation
The Company’s financial statements have been prepared 
in compliance with United Kingdom Accounting Standards, 
including Financial Reporting Standard 102, ‘The Financial 
Reporting Standard applicable in the United Kingdom and 
the Republic of Ireland’ (FRS 102) and the Companies Act 
2006. Accounting policies adopted are consistent with the 
previous year, unless otherwise stated, and are set out below. 
The Company has not presented its own profit and loss 
account, as permitted by Section 408 of the Companies 
Act 2006. 
The Company has also taken advantage of the  
following exemptions:
(i) from presenting a reconciliation of the number of shares 
outstanding at the beginning and end of the year;
(ii) from preparing a statement of cash flows on the basis 
that it is a qualifying entity and the Consolidated Cash 
Flow Statement, included in these financial statements, 
includes the Company’s cash flows;
(iii) from the financial instrument disclosures required 
under FRS 102 as the information is provided in the 
Consolidated financial statements;
(iv) from disclosing the share-based payment 
arrangements, required under FRS 102 concerning 
its own equity instruments. The Company financial 
statements are presented within the Consolidated 
financial statements and the relevant disclosures are 
included therein; and
(v) from disclosing key management personnel 
compensation as required by FRS 102.
The financial statements were approved by the Directors 
for issue on 26 April 2017.
182
U and I Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 d) Tangible assets
Tangible assets are held at cost less accumulated 
depreciation and any provision for impairment. Cost 
includes the original purchase price of the asset and the 
costs attributable to bringing the asset to its working 
condition for its intended use. Depreciation is provided so 
as to write off the cost less estimated residual value of 
such assets over their expected useful lives on a straight-
line basis. The principal annual rates used for this purpose 
are as follows:
Fixtures, fittings and computer equipment – 10% to 33%
Motor vehicles – 20%
e) Provisions for liabilities
A provision is recognised when the Company has a present 
legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it 
is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to 
settle the obligation and the amount can be reliably estimated.
Provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditure 
expected to be required to settle the obligation. The accretion 
in the discount is recognised as an interest expense.
f) Taxation
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable 
income for the year, using tax rates applicable at the balance 
sheet date, together with any adjustment in respect of 
previous periods.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable 
on differences between the carrying amount of assets and 
liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding 
tax basis used in the computation of taxable profit, and is 
accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. 
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all 
taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are 
recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable 
profits will be available against which deductible temporary 
differences or unutilised tax losses can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax 
rates that are expected to apply to the year when the asset 
is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates and 
tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted 
at the balance sheet date. Income tax relating to items 
recognised directly in equity is recognised in equity and 
not in the profit and loss account. Deferred tax is measured 
on a non-discounted basis.
g) Pension schemes
The Company operates a defined contribution scheme on 
behalf of the U and I Group. The charge to the profit and 
loss in the year represents the actual amount payable to 
the scheme in the year. Differences between contributions 
payable in the year and contributions paid are shown as 
either accruals or prepayments in the Balance Sheet.
h) Foreign currencies
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are 
translated into UK Sterling at the rates ruling at the dates 
of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet 
date are translated at the rates ruling at that date. Exchange 
movements are dealt with in the profit and loss account.
i) Financial instruments
Derivatives, including interest rate swaps and foreign 
exchange contracts, are not basic financial instruments.
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date 
a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently 
re-measured at their fair value. Changes in the fair value 
of derivatives are recognised in profit or loss in financial 
costs or income as appropriate.
The Company does not currently apply hedge accounting 
for interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives.

Strategic report + Corporate governance + Financial statements
U and I Group PLC  Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Notes to the Company financial statements continued
For the year ended 28 February 2017
At each balance sheet date before vesting, the cumulative 
expense is calculated, representing the extent to which the 
vesting period has expired and management’s best estimate 
of the achievement or otherwise of non-market conditions 
and of the number of cash-settled share-based instruments 
that will ultimately vest or, in the case of an instrument subject 
to a market condition, be treated as vesting as described 
above. The movement in cumulative expense since the 
previous balance sheet date is recognised in the income 
statement, with a corresponding entry in accruals.
29 Operating profit
Details relating to staff costs can be found in note 4 to the 
Consolidated financial statements.
Auditors’ remuneration in respect of the audit for the 
Company was £15,000 (2016: £15,000).

28 Accounting policies continued
j) Share-based payments
The Group operates a number of share-based compensation 
plans, both equity and cash settled, under which the entity 
receives services from employees as consideration for 
cash or equity-settled instruments of the Group.
The fair value of the employee services received in exchange 
for the grant of the option is recognised as an expense. 
The total amount to be expensed is determined by reference 
to the fair value of the options granted.
Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)
The LTIP commenced on 1 March 2015 and replaced the 
Performance Share Plan (PSP). 
Under the scheme, Ordinary shares are conditionally 
awarded based on the performance of the Group over a 
four-year period for Executive Directors and a three-year 
period for staff. The performance of the Group is referenced 
to the net asset value per share growth over the vesting 
period and is based on non-market conditions. The 
Directors assess the likelihood of the award vesting and 
the maximum amount that will vest based on forward-
looking forecast of the Group.
Ordinary shares conditionally awarded under the PSP are 
valued at their fair value on the date of the award taking into 
account the probability of the Ordinary shares vesting based 
on an equal probability of achieving appropriate total 
shareholder return ranking as determined under the 
performance condition.
The Group has used a Black-Scholes option valuation 
model to determine the fair value of share options granted. 
The cost of cash-settled transactions with employees and 
Directors is measured by reference to the fair value at the 
date at which they are granted and is recognised as an 
expense over the vesting period, which ends on the date 
on which the relevant employees become fully entitled to 
the award.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately 
vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon 
a market condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective 
of whether or not the market condition is satisfied, provided 
that all other performance conditions are satisfied.
