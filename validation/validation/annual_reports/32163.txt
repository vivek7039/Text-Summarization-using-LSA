 (phase 2/3) Our customer offer
Workspace has a customer-
first culture and builds 
direct relationships with the 
companies and individuals 
in our business centres. 
The data and insight this 
provides allow us to remain 
ahead of the industry in 
constantly enhancing our 
offer and facilities. 
This is the Workspace 
Advantage and it sits at 
the centre of our strategy.
With the customer every step of the way 
Workspace is unique in that every 
touch point with its customers, 
from their initial enquiry to the lease 
negotiation, is handled by a member 
of the in-house team.
1. Search for space 
The majority of customers find 
Workspace online thanks to our in-house 
Marketing team and digital marketing 
strategy, while we also have a strong 
recommendation rate from existing 
customers and their clients. 
2. Enquiry 
The Enquiries team speaks to the 
customer about their requirements  
and outlines available options.
3. Viewings 
Centre Managers show the customer 
around multiple sites and units, enabling 
them to make the right decision.
4. Lease negotiation 
The Lettings team draws up an offer 
letter for the chosen office space and 
negotiates the lease with the customer.
5. Moving day 
The customer moves in with support 
from their dedicated Centre Manager 
and immediately becomes a member 
of the Workspace community.
6. Renewal 
If a customer wants to stay, the Renewals 
team draws up a new lease and, in many 
cases, supports an expansion or move to 
another Workspace centre.

There are no constraints placed on 
our customers, with flexible lease terms, 
a range of spaces and secure, unlimited 
data downloads and uploads.
3. Communities 
Workspace customers are connected 
to each other via a range of networking 
and business insight events managed by 
our Centre Managers.

Overview
1 Workspace Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Additional Information Financial Statements Our Governance Strategic Report
The Workspace 
Advantage is our 
unique customer offer. 
Alongside the intensive 
management of our 
properties, it helps 
us to drive income 
growth and long-term 
value for shareholders. 2 Workspace Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Chairman’s statement
In a year characterised by 
significant political events and 
the market uncertainty that 
inevitably comes with that, I am 
pleased to say that Workspace 
has performed strongly. The 
resilience of the business, 
underpinned by the right 
strategy and a clear customer 
focus resulting in ongoing 
demand for our offer, reinforces 
our conviction around our 
business model.
As Jamie, our Chief Executive, 
outlines in his statement, we 
have seen the market move 
more and more towards our 
proven strategy. Over the year, it 
has become clear that the 
Workspace Advantage, our high 
quality, connected space and 
tailored customer offer, is 
attractive to businesses from 
many different sectors at any 
stage in their life cycle.
We have continued to deliver 
strong results with a 6.9% 
increase in net rental income, to 
£79.2m, and a 3.3% increase in 
EPRA NAV per share, to £9.53.
Our focus is on driving income 
across our portfolio, efforts 
which have been enhanced 
during the year by the successful 
letting up of our completed 
projects. Thanks to this focus, 
and the strong trading profit 
growth we delivered as a result, 
the Board is recommending a 
40% increase in the interim and 
final dividend for the period. This 
is in line with our progressive 
dividend policy and, of course, 
our distribution requirements as 
a Real Estate Investment Trust 
(“REIT”). It also demonstrates 
the Board’s confidence in the 
future success of the business.
Looking forward, with a strong 
pipeline of refurbishments and 
redevelopments, ongoing 
demand for our space from a 
growing customer market and a 
strong balance sheet to take 
advantage of further acquisition 
opportunities, I feel confident in 
Workspace’s ability to deliver 
value to shareholders over the 
long term.
Daniel Kitchen
Non-Executive Chairman
This success was delivered 
through the hard work and 
commitment of everyone at 
Workspace. We genuinely think 
differently in this business, with 
each individual adopting a 
customer-first mentality, 
innovative thinking and bringing 
deep market knowledge to their 
various roles, whether on the 
ground in our centres or in our 
marketing, systems development 
or finance teams at head office. 
The Board and I thank all our 
colleagues, as well as our 
suppliers and partners, for their 
part in delivering the Workspace 
Advantage.
We work hard to deliver that 
advantage to our customers but 
also to all the stakeholders we 
have relationships with. I am 
particularly proud of the work 
the business has done this year 
in inspiring London’s young 
people through providing work 
experience placements with our 
customers, helping to place 
apprentices with our suppliers 
and holding CV workshops in 
our centres. We regularly 
consider the positive role we can 
play in London and the duty of 
care we have to the wider 
community in which we operate.
London continues to be the right 
market for Workspace and it 
holds significant growth 
opportunities for us. Clearly, this 
is not without risk, and share 
prices across the real estate 
sector were impacted following 
the EU Referendum last June 
amid concerns that London 
would lose its unique attraction 
as a centre for business. 
Operationally, we saw no such 
impact on demand but we 
remain alert to the risks that 
further political and economic 
uncertainty could bring to the 
business. 3 Workspace Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Our market
2016: The impact of political change
2016 was one of the most politically turbulent 
years of the last decade, thanks in no small part 
to Britain’s vote to leave the EU. The property 
market was not immune and London commercial 
and residential property prices fell as an 
immediate reaction to the EU vote, while listed 
London office companies saw share price falls.
Looking up
However, investors seem to have warmed to 
commercial property in London once again 
as they see that it can offer stability in this 
politically challenging time, particularly with 
further political uncertainty emerging in other 
international markets. A return to commercial 
property investment in the first quarter of 
2017 – a total of £4.9bn worth of transactions
1
 
– shows investors have not been deterred in 
the longer term.
 
In London, a total of 13 deals of more than 
£100m transacted in Q1 2017 compared with 
11 in Q4 2016. Overseas investors once again 
dominated these deals; accounting for 80% 
of all transactions by volume in Q1 2017
2
. 
The Central London office market remains 
an attractive option for investors as prime 
West End and City yields remained stable 
at 3.50% and 4.25% respectively in Q1 2017
3
.
London Bridge: well connected
It is vital for our properties to 
be well connected and many are 
situated in clusters around major 
transport hubs. Within walking 
distance of London Bridge, one 
of the busiest commuter areas 
of London, we have four business 
centres, including the Metal Box 
Factory and The Leather Market.

London’s opportunity
The resilience of the flexible London office 
market is clear. The Capital continues to be a 
vibrant home for business, with a growing base 
of more than one million Small or Medium-Sized 
Enterprises
4
. Furthermore, a survey conducted 
in 2015 found that more than 90% of jobs in 
London were in the service sectors that primarily 
fill Workspace business centres.
As companies embrace collaboration, agility, 
networking and state-of-the-art design, 
Workspace is well positioned to capitalise on 
the opportunities presented by London’s real 
estate market. As information technology rapidly 
advances, technology that supports knowledge 
sharing and connectivity is now the most 
important factor in workplace performance
5
. 
Mobile devices and applications have enabled 
high mobility and continuous remote access 
to networks and data, raising expectations of 
workplace connectivity. Workspace’s world-
class technology infrastructure – tailored to 
individual business needs with unlimited data 
usage and connectivity speed – continues to 
drive repeat business with existing tenants.

The Workspace Advantage
Amidst the shifting economic climate, 
Workspace’s leading-edge offering is proving 
increasingly appealing to small and growing 
businesses looking for stability and commercial 
advantage in London. This year the real estate 
market has seen an even greater demand for 
the principles that underpin the Workspace 
Advantage: greater flexibility; technology 
infrastructure without limits; and dynamic 
environments that encourage networking 
and knowledge exchange. 
As more companies seek to reduce overheads 
and grow, the movement towards flexibility 
offers an attractive opportunity. Now, larger 
companies are embracing new ways of working, 
prioritising flexible and co-working spaces to 
help drive growth – while avoiding getting tied 
into longer leases. By the end of this year, nearly 
1.2 million people worldwide will have worked in 
a co-working space – rising to an expected four 
million by 2020

.
Responding to market trends
Market trend
The number of small businesses is expanding. 
Workspace response
We have an established brand and unique offer, allowing us to 
capitalise on this growing pool of prospective customers. We 
continue to add business centre space across London and expect 
to deliver more than one million sq. ft. of new and upgraded space 
over the next three years.
Market trend
Expectations for commercial property rental growth are tapering.
Workspace response
Our completed refurbishments and redevelopments are continuing 
to attract strong customer demand – and delivered double-digit 
rental growth this year. We have a pipeline of refurbishments and 
redevelopments to meet the ongoing demand and are targeting 
acquisitions in areas where we expect to see robust growth.
Market trend
The business rates revaluation saw rates in many sub-markets 
significantly increase. 
Workspace response
More than half of our customers may qualify for Small Business 
Rates Relief given their size and that they pay rates directly to the 
local council. In addition, we could see increased demand for our 
space in areas of London with lower business rates.
Market trend
The continued growth of the digital economy and rapid technological 
advancements are driving demand for cutting-edge connected 
services infrastructure in the workplace.
Workspace response
We offer best-in-class technology infrastructure to suit our digitally 
disruptive customers. Ownership of the buildings allows constant 
evolution of the model in order to meet changing customer 
requirements, including installation of technology infrastructure 
that places no limits on customers’ business activity.
Market trend
Sustainability – both environmental and social – is increasingly 
embraced by all businesses, who want to ensure they are having a 
positive impact on their environment and on the wider community.
Workspace response
We are driving employee and customer engagement on 
sustainability through a variety of initiatives, such as ‘waste 
roadshows’ (see page 30). We are part of the Better Building 
Partnership, helping to share industry best practice and ideas via 
quarterly working groups. In addition, we have set a number of 
robust new environmental targets this year, including to reduce 
energy and water consumption in our building operations and to 
further enhance customer engagement to improve the environmental 
performance of our buildings.
Market trend
Office occupiers are expressing an interest in healthy workplaces, 
which increase staff engagement and productivity whilst reducing 
absenteeism.
Workspace response
Our offer is personalised, with each space tailored to the individual 
customer’s needs. Staff wellbeing is central to the Workspace 
product – with office space designed with natural light, clean 
air and agile co-working spaces to encourage movement, social 
interaction and to deter sedentary working.

How it works:
Connectivity
Powering all businesses
Workspace customers are ‘wired differently’. 
Their attitude to office space is that it can be an 
asset to their business and can deliver long-term 
growth and success. At Workspace, we share 
that attitude and are wired to heed customer 
needs, which is why the business has invested in 
equipping our business centres with a state-of-
the-art, futureproofed technological infrastructure.
Personalisation
Customers choose what they need to grow
There are ‘no limits’ placed on our customers. 
We understand that businesses are dynamic 
and require tailored business environments. We 
don’t constrain customers within the four walls 
of their office – Workspace business centres are 
equipped with well-designed breakout areas, 
co-working lounges and meeting rooms, ideal 
for brainstorming or networking. Unlimited data 
downloads and uploads, at superfast speeds, 
allow customers to work however they choose.
Communities
Open to all of London
Businesses choose Workspace to be ‘super 
connected’. Our customers have access to 
a range of networking and social events 
and opportunities to meet the neighbours 
often lead to business growth and fruitful 
partnerships. In addition, our dedicated Wi-Fi 
network installed throughout our portfolio 
keeps customers connected wherever and 
however they choose to work. Who it’s for:
A broad appeal
The Workspace Advantage can apply 
to every type of business. For freelancers 
and start-ups, for established small 
companies and larger corporates, 
Workspace provides a tailored offer that 
allows our customers to focus on running 
their business.
Under one umbrella, there are 
so many different companies. 
People feel that energy. For us, 
it was all about the diversity 
and versatility. It feels like a 
mini-Google and... we really 
loved how interactive it felt.

Our business model
What we need to be able 
to create value
Workspace has a number of 
key resources and relationships 
that enable us to do business 
and deliver value to all our 
stakeholders. 
  For more on our resources 
and relationships, see pages 
26 to 31.
Add value to our properties
We own all our properties 
and operate them to generate 
income over the long term. 
We have a strong pipeline 
of refurbishment and 
redevelopment projects 
and will also take advantage 
of acquisition opportunities 
to further grow the business. 
  For more on how we 
have added value to our 
properties over the last year, 
turn to our Business Review 
on pages 41 to 47.
Financial strength 
Strong cash flow and prudent 
balance sheet management 
allow us to execute our strategy.
The right people
Workspace employees have a 
customer-first mentality and 
specialist expertise in their fields.
Our properties
We have a portfolio of high 
quality, well-located assets 
in London.
Market insight
Our 30-year history provides 
deep knowledge of London 
real estate and customer insight.
Sustainable approach
We work hard to improve our 
practices internally and actively 
encourage contractors and 
customers to do the same.
A thriving community
Our success is dependent on 
the strong relationships we build 
with our customers, suppliers 
and partners and our local 
communities.
Acquisition and ongoing 
ownership of freehold
Workspace acquires the freehold 
of properties across London. 
Owning the freehold enables 
us to constantly upgrade and 
transform our properties to 
increase their value and drive 
rental growth. We will dispose of 
properties where we believe we 
can no longer add value or if the 
property falls below our robust 
return targets.
We reposition
We carry out light internal 
refurbishments to enhance both 
pricing and property values.
We refurbish
We have a rolling programme 
of refurbishments to upgrade or 
expand our existing properties 
and grow our footprint in 
London.
We redevelop
We generate value through 
intensifying use at existing 
sites, often creating brand new 
business centres in partnership 
with residential developers.
Centre Managers
Our Centre Managers play a crucial 
role in building a community in our 
business centres, this year hosting 
180 customer events.
Clerkenwell Workshops

three core elements.
  For more information on the 
Workspace Advantage, see

people to ensure that we attract,

We carefully select partners who 
add value to our customer offer,

Value creation for

Chief Executive’s strategic review

17 Workspace Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017
This year, more than ever before, 
we have seen increasing 
evidence to give us confidence 
in our strategy and business 
model. The commercial real 
estate market is swinging on an 
axis and the pendulum of 
demand is moving firmly 
towards highly designed and 
super connected space let on 
flexible terms. 
Business owners all over London 
are looking at their space 
requirements and considering a 
range of new factors when 
assessing their occupational 
requirements. They are taking 
into account employee 
commutes, availability of 
meeting and breakout space 
outside the four walls of their 
office, proximity to excellent 
coffee, gyms and safe cycling 
routes, as well as the quality of 
the technology infrastructure 
and the neighbourhood 
community which can provide so 
many additional benefits to their 
business.
This trend is positive for us as it 
means that almost any business 
could be a Workspace customer 
and we are marketing to a much 
wider audience as a result. With 
our space attracting freelancers, 
start-ups, established businesses 
and larger, more traditional 
organisations, the opportunities 
for us to grow our business are 
significant. 
Workspace is a property 
company; however, we are also 
an online retailer of space and a 
technology provider with 
customer service at the centre of 
what we do. As we bring new 
and upgraded space to the 
market, it is clear that while the 
quality of the real estate is 
critical, the facilities that we are 
able to offer our customers are 
just as important. 
Recognising that Workspace has 
a true advantage, in May 2017 we 
launched the Workspace 
Advantage marketing campaign. 
This involved a wide-reaching 
presence across digital and 
social platforms, as well as 
creative visuals placed in tube 
carriages and stations all over 
London to target commuters on 
their way to and from work.
The “advantage” that Workspace 
customers have access to is 
three-fold: business-grade 
connectivity with no constraints, 
personalisation of space, lease 
terms and facilities, and a 
community that fosters business 
growth. And all of that is set 
within the inspiring spaces 
created in our business centres. 
As we directly manage our 
relationships with our customers, 
we can be confident that our 
offer meets the criteria they 
value in searching for a home for 
their business. However, with 
businesses constantly evolving, 
these criteria are not static and it 
is crucial that we continue to 
innovate and upgrade our 
systems and practices to ensure 
we are always enhancing our 
offer.
Our results this year give a clear 
indication of how we’ve been 
able to capture these 
opportunities. We’ve seen 
consistently strong demand for 
our space, with high levels of 
enquiries despite the uncertainty 
that followed the outcome of the 
EU Referendum. Our rental 
growth has outperformed the 
market, with like-for-like rent roll 
up 13.7% in the year and rent per 
sq. ft. up 12.9%. A tight control 
over costs means that the 
growth achieved in rental 
income falls straight to the 
bottom line and, as a result, 
trading profit increased 15.5% to 
£50.7m in the year.
It’s been another active year for 
the Workspace team, with a 
number of new buildings coming 
on stream, all of which have 
performed ahead of 
expectations. We have also been 
successful in achieving several 
planning consents during the 
year, while continuing to manage 
some exciting refurbishment 
projects that will be launching 
soon. We have continued to 
seize opportunities to expand 
and, more recently, we acquired 
a prime office building in the 
heart of Fitzrovia.
Looking forward, there’s a huge 
amount more to come. We have 
a strong pipeline of 
refurbishment and 
redevelopment projects, which 
will deliver more than one million 
sq. ft. of new and upgraded 
space over the next three years, 
and we continue to have great 
confidence in our ability to 
expand and grow our business. 
We celebrate our 30th 
anniversary this year and we are 
proud to have supported many 
businesses in achieving their 
success over that time. The 
insight and deep market 
knowledge that comes from our 
long history in London, alongside 
an inherent culture of innovation, 
has created a powerful 
combination that positions us 
well for future growth.

Chief Executive’s strategic review
continued 
The right 
strategy  
drives future 
performance.
This strategy has been in 
place for over five years now. 
Its relevance and different 
component parts are discussed 
and debated regularly at Board 
and Executive Committee 
meetings and we continue 
to believe that it is the right 
strategy for the business. 
In fact, as outlined by our 
Chief Executive on page 17, 
we believe that the wider real 
estate market is moving ever 
closer towards our strategy 
with companies adapting in order 
to meet the increasing demand 
for flexibility, well-designed 
office space with all the right 
amenities and a secure, reliable 
technology offer.
Right market
We continue to believe that 
London is the right market 
for our business. As explained 
on page 5, the opportunity 
in London is extremely attractive 
with growing demand from all 
types of businesses for our 
offer. In addition, our deep 
knowledge of the real estate 
market in London means 
we have been successful in 
acquiring new properties that 
meet the demand for space 
and will deliver attractive 
returns to shareholders.
Right properties
One of the principal growth drivers 
of our business is the letting 
up of new and upgraded space 
delivered by our refurbishment 
and redevelopment pipeline. We 
remain focused on creating and, 
opportunistically, acquiring the 
right properties that will attract 
our customers. 
Right customers
When we defined our current 
strategy, we defined our 
customer market as New and 
Growing Companies. Over the 
years, this has evolved and 
we now find that our offer is 
relevant to all businesses, from 
freelancers and early stage 
businesses right up to well 
known brands and established 
companies from all industries.
Right people
Employing the right people 
continues to be critical for 
the success of the business. 
Workspace’s operational nature 
means our teams are managing 
a huge amount of activity every 
day and are tirelessly focused on 
servicing our customers. See 
some of the unique roles held by 
our employees in the resources 
and relationships section on 
pages 28 and 29.
Right brand
Workspace has a strong brand 
and we work hard to ensure 
that our offer is highly visible 
to prospective customers as 
they embark on their search for 
office space. Digital marketing, 
a strong social media presence 
and employees who live the 
brand values are all key to 
attracting and retaining 
customers and ensuring high 
levels of customer satisfaction.
Case studies on the following 
pages demonstrate the strategy 
in action over the last year and 
outline how our strategy will 
continue to deliver results in 
the future.

Key performance indicators
1.
Net rental income growth
Definition
Net rental income is the rental 
income receivable after payment 
of direct property expenses, 
such as service charge costs, 
and other direct unrecoverable 
property expenses.
Why this is important 
to Workspace
This is one of the most important 
metrics for Workspace as it 
drives our trading profit, which 
in turn determines dividend 
growth.
Movement in 2016/17
The increase in the year was 
driven by significant growth in 
rental income at our like-for-like 
properties and an increase in 
rental income from completed 
projects thanks to the letting 
up of new and upgraded space.
Time period measured
Six monthly
2.
Trading profit after interest*
Definition
Trading profit after interest is 
net rental income, joint venture 
trading income and finance 
income less administrative 
expenses and finance costs.
Why this is important 
to Workspace
Trading profit after interest is a 
key measure for Workspace and 
determines dividend growth. 
We report and review this figure 
at Board level on a monthly basis 
compared to previous years and 
to budget. 
Trading profit after interest 
demonstrates the underlying 
performance of the trading 
business and strength of our 
business model. Both the CEO 
and CFO are incentivised on 
Trading profit after interest.
Movement in 2016/17
Trading profit after interest 
for the year stands at £50.7m, 
a 16% increase compared to 
the previous year. Income for 
the year has been enhanced 
by growth in rental income at 
our like-for-like properties and 
the successful letting up of new 
and upgraded space.
Time period measured
Monthly
3.
EPRA NAV per share
Definition
EPRA NAV per share is a 
definition of net asset value 
as set out by the European 
Public Real Estate Association. 
It represents net assets after 
excluding financial derivatives 
and deferred taxation relating 
to valuation movements and 
derivatives.
Why this is important 
to Workspace
EPRA NAV is a key external 
measure for property companies 
and is used to benchmark against 
share price. It is a useful measure 
for Workspace as it excludes any 
exceptional items and movements 
on financial derivatives.
Movement in 2016/17
Our EPRA NAV at 31 March 2017 
was £9.53, up 3% from the prior 
year. 
Time period measured
Six monthly
4.
Dividend Per Share
Definition
The dividend payment per share 
in issue.
Why this is important 
to Workspace
We aim to provide good returns 
for our shareholders, and also 
work within our REIT requirements 
for income distribution. Dividend

the returns we are providing to 
our investors.

Movement in 2016/17
Due to the growth we have seen 
in trading profit after interest 
and in line with our distribution 
requirements as a REIT, we have 
increased our interim and final 
dividends for 2016/17 by 40%. 
Time period measured

5.
Like-for-like rent roll growth**
Definition
Like-for-like properties are 
those which have been held 
throughout a 12-month period 
and have not been subject to a 
refurbishment or redevelopment 
programme in the last 24 months.
Rent roll is the current annualised 
net rents receivable for occupied 
units at the date of reporting.
Why this is important 
to Workspace
Like-for-like rent roll growth 
is an important measure for 
our business and shows the 
performance of our core 
portfolio of properties. We 
monitor the like-for-like rent 
roll on a weekly basis in weekly 
management meetings and also 
as a key performance indicator 
in our monthly Board meetings. 
Movement in 2016/17
Like-for-like rent roll has 
continued to grow, increasing 
by 14% compared to March 2017. 
This demonstrates the strong 
performance of our core assets 
and our ability to drive rents 
across our portfolio. 
Time period measured
Weekly
6.
Like-for-like rent per sq. ft. 
growth**
Definition
Like-for-like rent per sq. ft. is the 
like-for-like rent roll divided by 
the occupied area generating 
that rent roll.
Why this is important 
to Workspace
Like-for-like occupancy, pricing 
and rent roll give us vital 
information on the performance 
of our core properties and early 
indicators of any decline in these 
KPIs mean we can be timely in 
investigating and reacting to 
these changes.
Movement in 2016/17
Like-for-like rent per sq. ft. has 
increased significantly in the 
year, up 13%, with average rent 
up from £24.96 to £28.17.
Time period measured
Weekly
7.
Property valuation†
Definition
The independent valuation of 
our property portfolio, currently 
valued by CBRE Limited.
Why this is important 
to Workspace
Our properties are critical 
to our business and the valuation 
demonstrates the value we are 
delivering to our shareholders 
and a measure of how well we 
are managing our buildings and 
driving rental income. Whilst we 
cannot control yield movements, 
we can enhance the value of 
our properties through active 
asset management, including 
refurbishment and redevelopment 
activity.
Movement in 2016/17
We have achieved an underlying 
gain for the year of 2%, driven 
largely by pricing growth which 
offset the outward yield shift.
Time period measured
Six monthly
8.
Total property return
Definition
Total property return is the 
return for the year combining 
the valuation movement on 
our portfolio and the income 
achieved in the year.
Why this is important 
to Workspace
This measure shows how 
our property portfolio has 
performed in terms of both 
valuation change and income 
generated. This figure is 
produced by MSCI, an 
independent Investment 
Property Databank (‘IPD’), 
and is compared to a benchmark 
group so that we can see how 
we are performing relative to 
similar companies. Total Return, 
and performance against the 
benchmark, forms part of the 
Board’s bonus objectives.
Movement in 2016/17
We have outperformed 
compared to the IPD benchmark. 
Time period measured
Six monthly
9.
Total Shareholder Return
Definition
Total Shareholder Return is the 
return obtained by a shareholder, 
calculated by combining both 
share price movements and 
dividend receipts.
Why this is important 
to Workspace
This measure is important to 
Workspace as it shows the value 
that our shareholders receive 
from investing in Workspace 
shares. This measure forms 
part of the performance criteria 
within our LTIP scheme for 
Directors and Senior Managers.
Movement in 2016/17
While we have grown the 
dividend in the year, Total 
Shareholder Return was flat due 
to fluctuations in our share price 
particularly following the 
EU referendum in June 2016.
Time period measured
Annually
10.
Customer advocacy
Definition
Our customer advocacy score is 
based on responses to customer 
surveys.
Why this is important 
to Workspace
Our customers are at the heart 
of our business and we regularly 
seek to obtain their comments 
and feedback to understand 
their overall satisfaction with 
our offering. We use the findings 
from the survey results to 
prompt changes to what we 
offer our customers and for 
training and development 
plans for our staff and how 
likely they would be to 
recommend Workspace.
Movement in 2016/17
This is a new metric this year 
as we previously measured 
customer satisfaction. We have 
upgraded the methodology this 
year to bring it in line with best 
practice and are now focusing 
on customer advocacy.

Resources and relationships
26 Workspace Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017
A belief in ‘doing the 
right thing’ underpins 
the resources and 
relationships we 
need to make our 
business model work.
Workspace is committed to 
doing the right thing by our 
customers, investors, employees, 
suppliers, local communities 
and wider stakeholders. We take 
seriously our responsibility for 
maintaining strong and mutually 
beneficial relationships with all 
our stakeholders while protecting 
and enhancing the resources we 
rely on to do business.
In recognition of this commitment, 
the business decided during the 
year to adopt ‘Doing the Right 
Thing’ as our new corporate 
responsibility strategy. In addition, 
we reviewed our objectives and 
targets to ensure that they align 
and are closely linked to our 
corporate strategy. For each 
pillar in the corporate strategy, 
we have outlined an environmental 
and a social objective, which we 
believe will help to create value 
for our business and the wider 
communities in which we operate.
We have an internal committee, 
consisting of members from 
different departments within 
the business and including the 
Chief Executive Officer, which 
is responsible for ensuring 
the objectives are delivered and 
that there is regular reporting 
on all activities.

Our properties
We have a fantastic portfolio of 
properties, many of which are 
character buildings with historic 
significance. Workspace is not 
a trader of assets; we own and 
operate our properties to drive 
income and capital value over 
the long-term. We take pride 
in the work we do to reposition, 
refurbish or redevelop our 
buildings to ensure they meet 
customer needs and are fit for 
their modern purpose. 
Under our ‘Doing the Right Thing’ 
strategy, we are committed 
to reducing the environmental 
impact of our properties and 
their related supply chains. 
In addition, from a social point 
of view, we aim to ensure our 
properties create healthy and 
productive communities. 
Case study: 
Optergy rollout
Following the successful trial 
at The Light Bulb, Grand Union 
Studios and Barley Mow Centre, 
the new Optergy Building and 
Energy Management System 
has also been installed in our 
latest refurbishment, The Record 
Hall. The system will enable our 
Facilities Managers to control 
the building remotely and review 
detailed energy consumption 
profiles, helping us to manage 
our systems more intelligently 
and efficiently. We have been 
billing customers using readings 
from the new system, and will 
soon launch customer logins 
which will allow them to view 
their energy profiles directly, 
giving them more control over 
their consumption.
 
Case study: 
Chester House
We have updated the Whole 
Lifecycle Carbon Analysis on 
Chester House in Kennington. 
The analysis found that the 
refurbishment of the property 
has given a new lease of life to 
the historic building, cutting its 
whole lifecycle carbon emissions 
by 35% compared to a new 
central London building. This 
will save more than 15,000 
tonnes of CO2 over the building’s 
60-year lifespan.
Case study: 
The Record Hall
This is a prime example of a 
refurbishment project to bring 
an old building up to the modern 
standards that our customers 
require, and we were committed 
to maintaining high environmental 
standards throughout the 
project. We were proud to have 
achieved BREEAM Excellent 
Design Stage, scoring 
particularly high in the Transport 
and Land Use and Ecology 
categories, and a Considerate 
Constructors Scheme (‘CCS’) 
score of 43/50, well above our 
target. 
The project was designed to 
retain much of the masonry 
brickwork, thereby saving 
carbon emissions during the 
product manufacture stage of 
the building’s lifecycle. The 
refurbished building has a mixed 
ventilation strategy of mechanical 
ventilation with heat recovery 
and natural ventilation to reduce 
emissions during operation and 
the roofs are a mixture of warm 
roof-deck coverings, timber 
decking and green roof space, 
designed to support London 
Biodiversity Action Plan. While 
the majority of the building is 
open to any business, as the site 
is located in the Hatton Garden 
conservation area, we have 
designated 14% to be let to 
jewellery businesses. 
Targets for the coming year
 – Ensure that 100% of electricity 
contracted by Workspace is 
from renewable sources.
 – Retrofit five sites with Optergy 
by March 2019.
 – Undertake solar PV 
feasibility studies for all 
new developments.
Our suppliers and partners 
Maintaining positive relationships 
with our suppliers is critical to 
the success of our business model. 
As well as the contractors and 
partners who help us to execute 
our day-to-day business, we also 
carefully select partners who can 
add value to our customer offer. 
Preferential access to providers 
of storage solutions, office 
design and furniture and, of 
course, data and technology 
helps our customers to focus 
on their business.
Case study: 
Apprenticeships
We encourage all our suppliers 
and partners to adopt the same 
commitment to doing the right 
thing in their operations. One of 
our most exciting endeavours 
during the year has been in 
facilitating apprenticeships. In 
February 2017, we invited eight 
of our suppliers to an ‘Introduction 
to Apprenticeships’ evening to 
meet XLP, one of our charity 
partners, and the amazing young 
people they work with. The group 
had an open discussion about 
the opportunities and huge 
benefits but also the harsh 
realities and challenges of offering 
apprenticeships to the young 
people that XLP works with. 
It was a huge success and we 
currently have three apprentice 
positions now formally agreed 
for XLP’s young people – two 
as trainee engineers and one in 
administration – and four further 
opportunities being explored. 
Targets for the coming year
 – Achieve a CCS score of at 
least 37/50 for all 
developments and major 
refurbishments in 2017/18.
 – Divert at least 90% of non-
hazardous demolition waste 
and construction waste by 
weight from landfill for all 
developments and major 
refurbishments in 2017/18.
 – Hold a second ‘Introduction 
to Apprenticeships’ event 
for additional suppliers and 
partners.

Our people
One of the key pillars of our 
recent London-wide advertising 
campaign was that Workspace 
is ‘Wired Differently’. This has 
several connotations but one 
of the most important is a 
reflection of the mindset that 
our internal teams adopt. We 
genuinely think differently in 
our customer-first approach 
and focus on innovation and 
this drives long-term value 
both for our customers and in 
helping the business to attract 
and retain talent.
Values and culture
Workspace has a strong, 
performance-led culture, 
which drives talent retention 
and is evident in the way we 
do business with customers, 
suppliers and partners. Our 
staff have a sense of pride in 
the Workspace Advantage 
and, following the launch of 
our new creative campaign, 
we aim to hold workshops 
across the business to ensure 
employees understand what 
the Workspace Advantage is 
and how they can bring it to 
life in their day-to-day work. 
The culture begins with the 
behaviour and outlook of 
our Executive and senior 
management teams and is 
then communicated through 
the business via corporate 
induction days for new joiners, 
regular training opportunities, 
news updates on our intranet 
and team workshops and 
Company-wide events. 
For example, we held a series 
of workshops last year for 
our team of roving Facilities 
Managers who work across 
our 68 properties. The sessions, 
which analysed how the role 
interacts with the rest of the 
business, were successful in 
reinforcing the importance of 
the Facilities Management team 
to the Company and developing 
the existing communication links 
with the teams in head office.
We are proud that our culture 
encourages long-term service 
and that our employees have 
the opportunity to build their 
careers with us. During the year, 
17 members of staff achieved 
long service awards, five of 
which were for more than 
10 years of service.

Diversity
Creating a thriving and diverse 
workforce is a high priority 
for our business. A diverse 
workforce means we are 
attracting the best people and 
that the business is benefiting 
from broad experience and a 
range of different backgrounds 
and skill sets. 
Strong team with a diverse 
skillset
Workspace is unique in that 
we have built up a huge amount 
of in-house expertise over 
the years. This gives us better 
control, means we hold direct 
relationships with customers 
and can move quickly to adapt 
and innovate in line with market 
trends.

Five members of staff

Workspace employs enthusiastic, 
committed and well-trained 
people. We recognise the 
benefits of diversity of skills, 
knowledge and independence, 
as well as gender, ethnicity and 
sexual orientation and are fully 
committed to an active Equal 
Opportunities Policy covering 
recruitment and selection, 
training and development, 
performance reviews and 
promotion. All decisions relating 
to employment practices are 
objective, free from bias and 
based solely upon work criteria 
and individual merit. 
Case study: 
Health and wellbeing
In conjunction with JLL and 
following our move into a new 
head office, we conducted an 
Indoor Environmental Quality 
(‘IEQ’) assessment and a health 
and wellbeing survey for all 
employees. The IEQ assessment 
provided useful objective data, 
while the survey encompassed 
questions on the design and 
availability of diverse work spaces. 
Some quick wins were 
implemented following the 
survey, including installation 
of blinds to reduce screen 
glare, investment in more 
video conferencing facilities 
and the introduction of plants 
for visual impact and to reduce 
CO2 emissions. In the longer 
term, the business intends to 
trial real-time IEQ sensors in 
Workspace properties to 
enhance employee and 
customer experience, improve 
operations and maximise use 
of space. The results of the 
survey were included in the 
UK-GBC Wellbeing Lab’s 
Offices report. Strategic Report

Learning and development
There are many different 
ways in which we encourage 
our employees to develop their 
careers. We have a rigorous 
training programme in place, 
lead by both internal and external 
providers and covering a wide 
range of topics.
Last year, training sessions and 
presentations were provided 
on the following areas: 
 – People management.
 – Customer services.
 – Networking and events.
 – Business rates.
 – Data protection.
 – Energy and sustainability.
The overall number of training 
days has fallen year on year 
as the social media training 
programme, which was rolled 
out widely across the business, 
completed in 2016.
Training days
2016/17 2015/16
Training days 889 1,237
Training 
days per 
employee 4.38 5.78
We also recognise the 
importance of supporting 
our people to pursue wider 
learning passions. We support 
a range of development 
activities, providing coaching 
and mentoring, sponsorship 
of further education and 
professional qualifications, 
as well as providing paid 
leave to complete recognised 
training courses that support 
career aspirations. 
Over the last year, we supported 
10 people in undertaking externally 
recognised courses as part of 
our strong commitment to 
attracting and retaining the 
very best talent, and making 
Workspace a great place to work. 
Courses taken during the year 
included:
 – Facilities Management (BIFM –  
British Institute of Facilities 
Management).
 – Accountancy (ACCA –
Association of Chartered 
Certified Accountants, CIMA –  
Chartered Institute of 
Management Accountants 
and AAT – Association of 
Accounting Technicians).
 – HR Management and Practice.
 – Real Estate (MSc).
Supporting our team to do 
the right thing
One of the key objectives 
under our ‘Doing the Right 
Thing’ strategy is to provide 
opportunities for Workspace 
employees to support the wider 
community through fundraising 
and volunteering initiatives. 
During the year, members of our 
team carried out 48 volunteering 
days and along with customers, 
raised £31,489 for our selected 
charity partners.
Case study: 
Clothing recycling
Many individuals also take the 
initiative to run local community 
projects in their centres, 
encouraging customers to get 
involved as well. For example, 
at Parkhall Business Centre in 
Dulwich, the Centre Manager, 
Nick Bright, has introduced 
clothing recycling bins for 
Scope, collecting 671kg worth 
of clothing during the year. 
Targets for the coming year
 – Encourage Centre Managers 
to roll out clothing recycling 
initiative at other business 
centres.
 – Continue to support 
employees through training 
and professional development 
programmes.
Our customers
The relationships we build and 
maintain with our customers 
are perhaps the most critical 
for the business, and constantly 
enhancing these relationships is 
central to our strategy. We work 
hard to deliver an advantage 
to the companies that choose 
Workspace, through a mix of 
the right facilities and a series 
of benefits that we believe truly 
add value to their business. 
We continue to roll out 
our programme of business 
insight events, with lively panel 
discussions held on product 
innovation, augmented and 
virtual reality and the power 
of networking during the year. 
These events bring customers 
together from across the whole 
portfolio, providing valuable 
insight and learning alongside 
networking opportunities.
We hear from our customers 
that they are keen to have 
a positive impact on their 
communities and the environment, 
and therefore work with them 
to facilitate that. This year, we 
have focused on reducing the 
amount of waste produced 
at our business centres and 
launched a series of waste 
roadshows at several properties 
to educate and engage our 
customers on the importance 
of recycling. 55
55 customers attended our 
first waste roadshow at 
The Light Box.
Case study: 
Waste roadshow
At one such event, held at 
The Light Box in Chiswick, 
55 customers took to our energy 
bicycle and used pedal-power 
to drive a blender, creating 
their own healthy and delicious 
smoothies. We used the 
opportunity to talk to the 
attendees about their recycling 
strategies, and 50 newly 
engaged customers left with 
new recycling bins in hand. 
We saw an immediate impact 
from this event, with the 
recycling rate at The Light Box 
rising from 60% to 80% since the 
roadshow, and we will continue 
to run these events at other sites 
in the coming year.
Targets for the coming year
 – Work with our customers to 
increase the average recycling 
rate across all buildings to 65% 
by 31 March 2018.
 – Introduce an online benefits 
platform encouraging 
customers to offer each other 
preferential rates and discounts 
on products and services.
 – Continue to expand the 
Workspace events programme. Case study: 
AHOY
In October 2016, three 
Workspace teams took on the 
Meridian Pull Challenge in aid of 
AHOY. The race saw 18 teams in 
total take on an 8.5 mile rowing 
battle down the Thames, past 
the Houses of Parliament, under 
Tower Bridge and through to 
a finish at The AHOY Centre 
in Greenwich. It was a tough 
challenge but the competitive 
Workspace teams won the race 
and, in doing so, raised over 
£8,300 for AHOY. 
Case study: 
InspiresMe
InspiresMe Week also gave us a 
great opportunity to work more 
closely with our other charity 
partners, including B3 Media, 
which brings together multi-
cultural communities with the 
creative industries. They created 
a short highlights film following 
the event which demonstrates 
the value of the programme 
for all involved as well as 
encourage our customers 
to support young people.

Our communities
With 68 properties spread 
across several London boroughs, 
our business engages with many 
different communities and we 
aim to have a positive impact on 
these groups. As a major London 
landlord, we believe we have 
a responsibility to enhance 
the communities in which we 
operate. Our refurbishment 
and redevelopment schemes 
are sensitively designed to fit 
in with the character of the local 
area and we believe our business 
centres bring a vibrancy to a 
location, often including exciting 
new restaurants and cafés 
open to the public, and in 
some cases gyms.
There are several programmes 
and initiatives that we run in 
support of our communities. 
We have a long-term relationship 
with XLP, a charity which creates 
positive futures for young people 
growing up on deprived inner- 
city estates, often struggling with 
issues such as family breakdown, 
poverty, unemployment and 
educational failure. Workspace 
supports XLP through a wide 
variety of means, including 
financial support, mentoring 
for young people, providing 
work experience and facilitating 
employment opportunities. This 
year, we raised over £30,000 
for XLP with a Workspace 
team completing a sponsored 
London-to-Brussels bike ride 
and helped to facilitate 
apprenticeship opportunities 
for XLP’s young people (see 
page 27).
Other community projects 
carried out during the year 
included work with AHOY, 
a watersports-based charity 
which supports disadvantaged 
and at-risk youths, using the 
medium of sailing and rowing to 
help break down social barriers 
and provide innovative training 
to help them create a positive 
future (see case study).
In February 2017, Workspace 
once again ran the 5th 
consecutive annual InspiresMe 
Week, providing 79 students 
with four days’ work experience 
in 39 of our customers’ businesses. 
The programme was hugely 
successful in showing the 
students that they don’t have 
to limit themselves to traditional 
career progression in order to 
make a difference and enjoy 
work. It also provided businesses 
with invaluable insight into the 
fresh, creative thinking that 
a young person can bring to 
a business.
Targets for the coming year
 – Explore volunteering 
opportunities with new charity 
partner, Groundwork, which 
aims to create better places 
to live and work in a greener, 
more sustainable way.
 – Pilot the Workspace Lifeskills 
programme with St Gabriel’s 
College in Camberwell, to 
include assembly talks, CV 
workshops and workplace 
visits.
Our brand
It is vital that our brand resonates 
strongly with the stakeholders 
that the business has relationships 
with, including customers and 
employees. The strength of our 
brand sets us apart from our 
peers in the Real Estate industry. 
While our brand is not hugely 
visible inside our buildings, as they 
often have their own brand and 
identity, the efforts of our 
in-house Marketing team ensure 
that our brand is highly visible 
to businesses as they start their 
search for office space. 
Following the year end, in May 
2017, we launched our first ever 
London-wide advertising 
campaign involving a far reaching 
presence across digital and social 
platforms, as well as creative 
visuals placed in tube carriages 
and stations all over London to 
target commuters to and from 
work. The Workspace Advantage 
seeks to highlight the three pillars 
of our customer offer: we are 
‘wired differently’ and understand 
that our customers are too; we 
place ‘no limits’ on customers 
with flexible lease terms and 
personalised space and tailored 
technology offers; and we provide 
space that is ‘super connected’ 
both in terms of technology 
infrastructure and the communities 
created in our buildings. We 
saw real engagement with the 
campaign from employees and 
customers, who themselves were 
featured in the advertisements. 
Targets for the coming year
 – Build on the Workspace 
Advantage positioning to 
ensure our differentiated offer is 
well understood by the market.
 – Put in place a brand tracker to 
analyse awareness and 
perceptions of the Workspace 
brand. 32 Workspace Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Principal risks and uncertainties
Risk culture
Risk Management continues 
to be an integral part of all 
our activities. Risks and 
opportunities are considered 
in every business decision we 
make. We focus on key risks 
which could impact on the 
achievement of our strategic 
goals and therefore on the 
performance of our business. 
Risks are considered at every 
level of the business including 
when approving corporate 
transactions, property acquisitions 
and disposals and whenever 
undertaking refurbishment 
and redevelopment projects. 
The Executive Committee meets 
weekly to discuss key performance 
measures and any change in 
these, meaning they are ideally 
placed to notice any concerning 
changes or early warnings. 
Further information on our 
KPIs can be found on pages 
24 and 25.
We are fortunate to have a close 
and open communication culture 
within Workspace. This enables 
staff from all areas of the business 
to feel free to raise risks and 
issues, no matter how small, 
to their managers and teams. 
Risk appetite
Risk appetite reflects the overall 
level of risk acceptable with 
regards to our principal business 
risks. The Board is responsible 
for deciding the amount of risk 
it is willing to take.
High risk, after considering 
the controls we have in place 
to mitigate risks, is not generally 
tolerated. We work towards 
a medium to low risk profile, 
ensuring that we have mitigating 
actions in place to bring each 
risk down to within the agreed 
risk appetite. Currently all our 
Principal Strategic risks are 
subject to the same moderate 
risk appetite. 
Risks and delivering 
our strategy
In order to deliver our strategy 
and the Workspace Advantage 
throughout the business we 
must ensure that we maintain 
a balance between safeguarding 
against potential risks, and 
taking advantage of potential 
opportunities.
Our Key Strategic Aims are:
 – Right market
 – Right properties
 – Right brand
 – Right customers
 – Right people
We operate within the London 
market which continues to be 
a resilient and vibrant market 
in which to operate.
We want our properties to be 
safe, secure and well maintained.
Our customers are at the heart 
of everything we do and we 
want them safe and secure and 
to create an environment in for 
them which they can thrive. 
We need our brand to be 
reflective of our product, 
our customers and our culture. 
We aim to take opportunities 
to promote our brand efficiently 
and effectively.
We also need the right staff and 
expertise to deliver our strategy, 
with adequate succession 
planning where needed so 
we invest time and effort into 
our employees. 
Further details on the Risk 
Committee can be found in 
our Governance section on 
page 81.
Activities in 2016/17
We continue to focus on our annual rolling risk objectives, 
undertaking the following work streams:
1. 2. 3.
Site reviews
We have undertaken 
around 30 site reviews 
at our properties 
covering financial and 
operational areas. We 
have used the results 
of these reviews to: 
 – amend procedures 
if they are not 
working adequately.
 – increase training for 
centre staff.
 – mostly to provide 
positive feedback 
to our centre staff 
who are achieving 
high scores on 
these reviews.
Adhoc audits
We continue to 
instruct detailed 
reviews by third parties 
on key areas including:
 – VAT
 – CIS compliance
 – Payroll taxes 
 – Data Protection
We review and action 
any findings and 
recommendations 
from these reviews. 
This helps enhance 
our underlying control 
environment. 
Cyber security
Cyber security 
has become 
an increasingly 
important risk area. 
During the year 
we have prepared a 
detailed paper on the 
risks we face and also 
a draft response plan 
if we were to face a 
cyber security breach. 
This is an evolving area 
and we will continue to 
work to enhance and 
refine our controls in 
this area.
4. 5.
Social media
We have considered 
the increasing impact 
of social media, as 
part of our Brand risk.
We continue to 
provide updates to 
the Board and our 
staff about awareness 
of social media risks 
and opportunities.
Brexit
During the year the 
Board and Audit 
Committee have 
considered the 
potential impact of 
exiting the European 
Union on our business 
and strategy. It is hard 
to predict the impact 
of this, but there could 
be an impact on each 
of our Principal Business 
Risks. At this stage 
the Board and Audit 
Committee agreed 
that this wouldn’t 
become a stand-alone 
risk but something 
which will continue 
to be considered and 
assessed across all 
risk areas.
Areas of focus for 2017/18
We have a rolling plan of risk management objectives and over the 
coming year plan the following activities:
1. 2. 3.
Ongoing data 
protection review and 
training across the 
organisation. Review 
of our information 
asset register.
Implementing risk 
management 
software to help 
effectively capture 
findings from our 
internal property site 
reviews, third party 
audits and detailed 
information to show 
our key controls are 
operating. 
Continuing to conduct 
third party reviews 
and audits of key 
business areas. Overview Our Governance Strategic Report Financial Statements Additional Information
33 Workspace Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Overall, we review risks from 
two angles:
1. Principal Business (Strategic) 
Risks
 – These are risks which impact 
achievement of our strategy 
and objectives.
 – They are identified, assessed 
and managed by the 
Executive Committee.
 – Strategic risks are ultimately 
owned by the Board.
 – The Board and the Audit 
Committee receive regular 
updates on these Principal 
Risks three times a year.
 – The Board is satisfied that we 
continue to operate within our 
desired risk appetite for our 
Strategic Risks.
Our Strategic Risks are shown 
in the heat map and in detail on 
pages 34 to 39.
2. Operational risks
 – These are lower level 
risks covering day-to-day 
processes and procedures 
and regulation requirements.
 – These cover all areas of the 
business, such as Finance, 
Operations, Investment and 
Development.
 – These risks are assessed, 
managed and owned by 
the Executive Committee.
 – Day-to-day operational risks 
are closely reviewed and 
managed by the Executive 
Committee and Senior 
Management.
 – Changes in operational risks 
are reported to the Board 
and Audit Committee as 
appropriate.

Risk Management Structure
We have an established Risk 
Management Structure in place 
to help us capture, document 
and manage risks facing our 
business, We monitor this 
structure to ensure it is 
appropriate for our company 
size, culture and business model. 
Our aim is to manage each 
of our risks and mitigate them 
so that they fall within the risk 
appetite level we are prepared 
to tolerate for each risk area.
The Risk Management Structure 
is underpinned by close working 
relationships between the 
Executive Directors, Senior 
Management and other team 
members, which enhances our 
ability to efficiently capture, 
communicate and action any 
risk issues identified.
We have a Risk Committee, 
which meets monthly and has 
responsibility for co-ordinating 
risk management activities 
throughout the Group. It 
prepares regular reports to the 
Board and Audit Committee. 
The Risk Committee comprises 
the Chief Executive Officer, 
the Operations Director and 
Company Secretary, alongside 
The Head of Finance and 
other Senior Managers and 
representatives from across the 
Company. The Risk Committee 
engages with staff throughout 
the business and our small 
size helps to ensure good 
communication between 
each business area. In addition, 
frequent visits by head office 
staff to our business centres 
help to ensure awareness and 
understanding of any property-
specific risks and issues. We also 
invite Centre Managers to attend 
Risk Committee meetings on a 
rolling basis.
Risk registers for all business 
areas are maintained and risks 
are assessed against a defined 
scoring mechanism to ensure 
consistency. 34 Workspace Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017

We have a broad range of 
funding relationships in place 
and regularly review our 
refinancing strategy.
We also maintain a specific 
interest rate profile via use of 
fixed rates and swaps on our 
loan facilities so that our interest 
payment profile is stable.
What we have done in 2016/17
We continue to review 
and monitor our financing 
arrangements to ensure we 
have sufficient headroom and 
a good interest rate profile to 
help ensure we can fund our 
plans to refurbish and acquire 
new buildings. 
We repaid our UK fund debt 
of £45m in September 2016,

Mitigation
Market-related valuation risk is 
largely dependent on external 
factors which we cannot 
influence. However, we continue 
to do the following to ensure we 
are aware of any market changes, 
and are generating the maximum 
value from our portfolio:
 – Monitor the investment 
market mood.
 – Monitor market yields 
and pricing of property 
transactions across the 
London market.
 – Alternative use opportunities 
pursued across the portfolio 
and continue to drive progress 
made in achieving planning 
consent for mixed-use 
development schemes.
What we have done in 2016/17
We have maintained a low LTV 
ratio, protecting us from any 
potential adverse changes in 
the market.
During the year we have made 
significant progress with our 
programme of refurbishment 
works, enhancing the standard 
and desirability of our properties.

Mitigation
Every week the Executive 
Committee meet with Senior 
Management to monitor 
occupancy levels, pricing, 
demand levels and reasons 
for customers vacating. 
This ensures we react quickly 
to changes in any of these 
indicators. 
Our extensive marketing 
programme ensures that 
we are in control of our own 
customer leads and pipeline 
of deals. We also utilise social 
media, backed up by a busy 
events programme which has 
further helped us to engage with 
customers. This differentiates us 
as we provide not only space but 
also an opportunity to network 
with other businesses based in 
our portfolio.
We also stress test our business 
plans to assess the sensitivity we 
could tolerate if demand from 
our customers reduced. This can 
be found in the Viability 
Statement on page 40.
What we have done in 2016/17

For every potential development 
scheme we work hard to gain a 
thorough understanding of the 
planning environment and 
ensure we seek counsel from 
appropriate advisers.
We undertake a detailed 
development analysis and 
appraisal prior to commencing a 
development scheme. Appraisals 
are presented for Investment 
Committee approval and 
sign-off is required for every 
project.
The Investment Committee reviews 
progress on refurbishments and 
redevelopments every fortnight, 
against project timings and cost 
budgets both during and after 
the completion of a project. 
What we have done in 2016/17

we are interacting with our 
customers in a variety of ways, 
including the use of social media.
We maintain regular 
communication with 
all stakeholders and key 
shareholders. We hold investor

an annual Capital Markets Day.
What we have done in 2016/17
The use of social media channels, 
such as Twitter, to engage with

we operate to ensure that we are 
aware of any changes coming 
through ahead of time.
What we have done in 2016/17
We have undertaken an enhanced 
review of our five-year plan, 
aligned to work undertaken on 
the Viability Statement. This has 
included some stress testing of 
key performance measures and 
covenants, were there to be a 
major incident affecting London, 
or major changes in demand for

Going Concern and Viability Statement
Going Concern
The Group’s activities, strategy 
and performance are explained 
in the Strategic Report on pages 
2 to 47.
Further detail on the financial 
performance and financial 
position of the Group is provided 
in the financial statements on 
pages 121 to 163.
The Directors, having made 
appropriate enquiries, have a 
reasonable expectation that 
the Group and the Company 
have adequate resources and 
sufficient headroom on the 
Group’s bank loan facilities 
to continue in operational 
existence. For this reason, 
the Directors believe that it is 
appropriate to continue to adopt 
the Going Concern basis in 
preparing the Group’s accounts.
Viability Statement
In accordance with provision C.2.2 
of the 2014 revision of the Code, 
the Board has assessed the 
prospects of the Group over a 
longer period than the 12 months 
that has in practice been the focus 
of the ‘Going Concern’ statement.
The assessment is based on the 
Group’s Strategic Review which 
is performed on an annual basis 
by the Board and Executive 
Committee. The Strategic 
Review includes a debate of the 
Group’s strategy and business 
model, which are central to 
understanding the future 
prospects of the business and 
a review of the Group’s five-year 
plan. Particular attention is given 
to existing development and 
redevelopment commitments, 
long-term financing arrangements, 
compliance with financing and 
REIT covenants and existing 
macro-economic factors.
The latest strategy day was held 
in September 2016 and reviewed 
the detailed business plan for the 
five years to 2021. The plan was 
updated in April 2017 to extend it 
to 2022 and to include the Fitzroy 
Street acquisition. This plan was 
reviewed at the Audit Committee 
meeting on 24 May 2016.
The business plan is underpinned 
by a detailed financial model 
based on assumptions around 
the key drivers of revenue, profit, 
capital expenditure and cash flow. 
The Group continually reviews 
funding requirements and 
maintains a close relationship 
with existing and potential 
funding partners to ensure the 
continuing availability of debt 
finance. In addition, there are 
a number of mitigating factors 
that were not considered in the 
scenarios tested but which could 
be actioned:
 – Disposal of assets
 – Reduction in dividend
 – Reduction in refurbishment 
programme
The Board conducted this 
review for the five-year period 
to 31 March 2022 which was 
selected for the following 
reasons:
a)  The Group’s strategic review 
covers a five-year period.
The key assumptions 
underpinning the plan are:
 – Conservative growth in pricing 
with stable occupancy levels 
for the like-for-like properties.
 – Refurbishment and 
redevelopment schemes are 
delivered in line with current 
plans and reach stabilised 
occupancy levels within 
one to two years at current 
market-based pricing levels.
 – The Retail Bond, which 
becomes repayable in 
October 2019 and revolver 
bank facilities of £150m, which 
become repayable in June 
2022, can be extended on 
acceptable terms.
The Group’s Strategy and 
business model are described 
on pages 18 to 23 and on pages 
14 and 15.
The Board has considered the 
key risks and mitigating factors 
that could impact the Group, 
details of which can be found on 
pages 32 to 39. Those risks that 
could have an impact on the 
ongoing success of the Group’s 
strategy were identified and the 
resilience of the Group to the 
impact of these risks in severe 
yet plausible scenarios has been 
evaluated.
Sensitivity analyses are prepared 
to understand the impact of the 
identified risks on solvency and 
liquidity. The specific risks which 
were evaluated are shown in the 
table on the right.
The Group benefits from having 
some 4,000 customers spread 
across 68 locations in London. 
These customers are in a wide 
range of sectors with no sector 
representing more than 10% of 
total rent roll and no individual 
customer representing more than 
1% of total rent roll. For this 
reason, the highest risk to the 
group is an event or series of 
events that would impact on the 
London economy and property 
market.
Of the scenarios tested, the most 
significant impact would be to 
the level of available facilities 
resulting from either an inability 
to refinance existing facilities or a 
significant reduction in proceeds 
from redevelopments. 
b)  Our current project pipeline 
spans five years. This covers 
the time for the currently 
planned major refurbishments 
and redevelopments to 
progress from initiation 
to completion.
c)  The average period to maturity 
of the Group’s committed 
facilities is 5.2 years.
The conclusion of these 
sensitivity analyses is that the 
Group would have adequate 
means to maintain headroom 
in its facilities and covenants 
to continue operations for the 
period under review. On this 
basis, the Directors have a 
reasonable expectation that the 
Group will be able to continue in 
operation and meet its liabilities 
as they fall due over the five-year 
period stated above.

Business review
Enquiries and lettings 
We continue to see very strong 
demand from customers for 
space at our business centres. 
Enquiries averaged 1,060 per 
month (2016: 1,029) in the year 
to 31 March 2017, and lettings 
averaged 99 per month (2016: 
100). Fluctuations occur from 
quarter to quarter linked to 
seasonal impacts and the timing 
of marketing initiatives, 
particularly around the launch of 
new buildings.
See Table 1, below.
Good levels of enquiries and 
lettings have continued into the 
current financial year with 
enquiries averaging 1,070 per 
month and lettings 86 per month 
to the end of May 2017. We have 
not yet seen an impact on 
demand from the business rates 
revaluation which came into 
effect in April 2017. While many 
of our customers may be able to 
take advantage of Small 
Business Rates Relief, it is too 
early to gauge the future impact 
of the revaluation and we 
continue to closely monitor both 
demand and customer feedback.
Rent roll
Total rent roll is up 14.5% (£11.3m) 
to £89.5m over the year. The key 
drivers of this growth have been 
the 13.7% (£7.2m) increase in rent 
roll at our like-for-like properties, 
and a £4.0m uplift in rent roll at 
recently completed projects.

Completed projects 4.0
Projects underway (1.3)
Acquisitions 1.8
Disposals (0.4)
At 31 March 2017 89.5
Like-for-like Portfolio
The like-for-like portfolio 
represents 67% of the Group’s 
total rent roll as at 31 March 2017. 
It comprises properties with 
stabilised occupancy over the 
previous twelve months, 
excluding recent acquisitions and 
those buildings impacted by 
significant refurbishment or 
redevelopment activity. Prior 
quarter comparatives have been 
restated for properties transferred 
to and from the refurbishment 
and redevelopment categories. 
The short-term reduction in rent 
roll at these refurbishments will 
be replaced in due course by a 
significant uplift in rent as they 
complete and the new and 
upgraded space is let. Assuming 
90% occupancy at our estimated 
rental values at 31 March 2017 
the rent roll at these 12 buildings 
once they are completed would 
be £31.4m, an uplift of £19.7m.
Projects Underway – 
Redevelopments 
There are currently six mixed-use 
redevelopment projects 
underway or contracted for sale. 
The buildings are vacated upon 
sale and Workspace receives a 
consideration comprising cash 
and at three of these properties, 
new business centres (built at no 
cost to Workspace). 
As at 31 March 2017 there is 
£0.3m of rent roll which will be 
run down in due course as 
buildings are sold. Assuming 
90% occupancy at our estimated 
rental values at 31 March 2017, 
the rent roll at the three new 
business centres we will receive 
back would be £2.7m.
Acquisitions
The increase in rent roll from 
acquisitions of £1.8m to £5.9m at 
31 March 2017 relates to five of 
the acquisitions made in previous 
years (excluding those subject to 
major refurbishment) and 
comprises:
 – £0.7m uplift at the Mecca 
Bingo site in Earlsfield which 
we have fully let to a 
trampoline operator while we 
progress with our 
redevelopment plans;
 – £0.5m uplift at 160 Fleet 
Street where occupancy has 
now reached 96%; and 
 – £0.4m uplift at Cannon Wharf, 
Surrey Quays a new building 
opened in December 2015 
where occupancy has 
increased to 76%.
If all the properties in this 
category were at 90% 
occupancy at the CBRE 
estimated rental values at 31 
March 2017 the rent roll would be 
£7.4m, an uplift of £1.5m.
The like-for-like rent roll has 
continued to grow strongly, up 
13.7% (£7.2m) in the year to 
£59.6m with rent roll growth in 
the second half of the year at 
6.2%, compared to 7.1% in the first 
half. The rental growth has come 
from the increases in pricing with 
like-for-like rent per sq. ft. up 
12.9% to £28.17 over the year.
See Table 2, below.
 
If all the like-for-like properties 
were at 90% occupancy at the 
CBRE estimated rental values at 
31 March 2017, the rent roll would 
be £67.0m, £7.4m higher than 
the rent roll at 31 March 2017.
Completed Projects
Three projects were completed 
during 2016 with rent roll 
growing by £4.0m to £7.1m at 
31 March 2017. The refurbishment 
at Vox Studios, Vauxhall and The 
Print Rooms, Southwark were 
completed in January 2016 
delivering 125,000 sq. ft. of new 
and upgraded space. We also 
opened Grand Union Studios 
(part of the mixed-use 
redevelopment at this site in 
Ladbroke Grove) in March 2016 
providing 65,000 sq. ft. of new 
space. 
See Table 3, below.
Customer demand at all three of 
these buildings has been ahead 
of our original expectations both 
in terms of the pace at which the 
buildings have been let and the 
pricing achieved. If the three 
buildings were at 90% 
occupancy at the CBRE 
estimated rental values at 31 
March 2017, the rent roll would 
be £8.6m, £1.5m higher than the 
31 March 2017 rent roll. 
Projects Underway – 
Refurbishments 
We are currently underway on 
12 refurbishments delivering 
738,000 sq. ft. of new and 
upgraded space. The rent roll at 
31 March 2017 at these 
refurbishments was £11.7m, down 
£1.3m in the year. The most 
significant reduction in rent roll 
of £0.7m was at Brickfields 
(formerly known as Cremer 
Business Centre), Hoxton where 
we have now completed 
demolition ahead of the 
construction of a new business 
centre.

Profit performance 
Adjusted trading profit after 
interest for the year (which 
includes our share of the trading 
profit of joint ventures after 
interest) is £50.7m, up 15.5% 
compared to the prior year. 
See Table 4, right.
Net rental income increased by 
6.9% (£5.1m) in the year to 
£79.2m. This includes:
 – 16.2% (£7.5m) increase in 
rental income at our like-for-
like properties to £53.8m; 
 – £3.8m increase in rental 
income at completed projects 
to £5.5m from the letting up 
of new and upgraded space;
 – £2.3m reduction in income at 
properties undergoing 
refurbishment or 
redevelopment; and
 – £4.3m reduction in income 
from the sale of 11 industrial 
properties in the previous 
financial year.
See Table 5, right.
 
Joint venture income represents 
our share of net rental income 
less associated administrative 
expenses, primarily from the 
BlackRock Workspace Property 
Trust (‘BWPT’) which concluded 
in June 2016.
Total administration costs are up 
3.4% (£0.5m) in the year to 
£15.1m, with underlying costs 
(excluding share based costs) up 
8% (£1.0m) to £12.8m. The 
year-on-year increase in 
underlying costs includes an 
additional six headcount year on 
year across our project 
management, marketing and 
new business development 
teams alongside salary increases 
averaging 4% and other 
inflationary increases in non-staff 
costs. Share based costs are 
reduced by 22% (£0.5m) to 
£2.3m due to the share price 
performance in the year. 
Net finance costs have reduced 
by £3.2m (23%) in the year to 
£13.7m. This was due to a lower 
average net debt balance in 
2016/17 compared to the 
previous financial year with the 
average interest cost for the year 
at 5.2% (2016: 5.1%). The 
marginal cost of undrawn 
facilities at 31 March 2017 was 
1.7%.

In September 2016, £45m of 
term debt maturing in 2022/23 
with a running interest rate of 4% 
was cancelled early at a total 
cost of £1.4m. This was funded 
from surplus cash and the 
revolver bank facility. As a result 
the average interest rate in the 
second half of the financial year 
reduced to 5.0% from 5.5% in the 
first half of the year. 
 
Profit before tax for the year is 
£88.8m compared to a profit of 
£391.3m in the prior year as 
detailed in Table 6, right.
The reported change in fair value 
of investment properties of 
£39.5m reflects the underlying 
increase in the CBRE valuation in 
the year of £38m, adjusted for 
the change in fair value of 
overage which is reclassified in 
the accounts as deferred 
consideration and included in 
other items above. This 
compares to a stronger 
underlying increase in the 
property valuation of £308m in 
the previous financial year.
 
The exceptional finance costs of 
£1.4m relates to the early 
repayment of £45m of term debt 
in September 2016 with break 
costs of £0.9m and the release 
of unamortised arrangement 
costs of £0.5m.
A performance fee of £24.5m in 
total was paid on the conclusion 
of the BWPT based on the 
returns achieved over its five 
year life.
Other items in the prior year 
included an increase in overage 
of £9.5m, a profit on the sale of 
investment properties of £8.1m 
and a £5.4m lease surrender 
premium.
Adjusted underlying earnings 
per share is up 14% to 30.6p in 
line with the increase in adjusted 
trading profit after interest. The 
EPRA earnings per share for the 
year is 30.2p, a reduction of 36% 
from 47.5p in the prior year. This 
is due to the EPRA calculation 
including a number of non-
trading items including overage, 
joint venture performance fees 
and lease surrender premiums.
Dividend
Our dividend policy is based on 
the growth in trading profits 
after interest taking into account 
our investment and acquisition 
plans and the distribution 
requirements that we have as a 
REIT. We have achieved good 
growth in trading profit in recent 
years and the Board has taken 
the opportunity this year to 
recommend an increase in both 
the interim and final dividend of 
40%. The final dividend of 14.27 
pence (2016: 10.19 pence) will be 
paid on 7 August 2017 to 
shareholders on the register at 7 
July 2017. The dividend will be 
paid as a Property Income 
Distribution.
For future years the intention is 
to grow the dividend on a 
covered trading profit basis, with 
a target of maintaining cover of 
at least 1.3 times adjusted 
underlying earnings per share. 
Dividend cover for the year to 31 
March 2017 was 1.45 times.

At 31 March 2017, the wholly 
owned portfolio was 
independently valued by CBRE 
at £1,844m, an underlying 
increase of 2.1% (£38m) in the 
year. This comprised a 0.9% 
(£16m) decline in the first half of 
the year and a 3.0% (£54m) 
increase in the second half. 
The main movements in the 
valuation over the year are set 
out in the ‘Property valuation

Like-for-like Properties
There was a 4.9% (£47m) 
increase in the valuation of 
like-for-like properties to 
£1,001m, as a result of:
 – An increase in estimated rental 
values (ERV) per sq. ft. of 
6.7% equating to an uplift in 
value of some £51m; 
 – A 0.1% outward shift in 
equivalent yield equating to a 
reduction in value of some 
£15m; and 
 – An £11m uplift in the value of 
Uplands Business Park, 
Walthamstow to £40m (sold 
in May 2017 for £50m).
See Table 7, right.
Completed projects
The uplift of 6.3% (£8m) in value 
of the three completed projects 
to £134m reflects the strong 
pricing levels that have been 
achieved at these properties 
since launch with an uplift of 
£4m at The Print Rooms, 
Southwark and £3m at Grand 
Union Studios, Ladbroke Grove. 
The overall valuation metrics for 
completed projects are set out in 
Table 8, right.
 
Current refurbishments
We have seen a reduction of 5.1% 
(£20m) in the value of current 
refurbishments to £369m, 
largely at properties where we 
have obtained vacant possession 
ahead of major refurbishments. 
The most significant reductions 
have been: 
 – A reduction of £10m in the 
valuation of Edinburgh House, 
Vauxhall where we obtained 
vacant possession of the 
entire building in March 2016. 
In October 2016 we received 
planning consent for a major 
refurbishment which is now 
underway.
 – A reduction of £5m in the 
valuation of The Leather 
Market, London Bridge where 
we are undertaking major 
upgrade and refurbishment 
works on a substantial part of 
the property.
 – A reduction of £2m in the 
valuation of Easton Street, 
Clerkenwell where we 
obtained vacant possession in 
December 2016. We received 
planning consent in April 2017 
for a major refurbishment and 
extension.
We would expect to see a 
recovery in values at these 
properties as the refurbishments 
progress to completion and are 
successfully let.
Current redevelopments
The uplift of 4.0% (£8m) in the 
value of current redevelopment 
projects to £208m reflects 
properties where we have 
obtained mixed use planning 
consents. This includes Arches 
Business Centre, Southall which 
was contracted for sale to a 
residential developer in October 
2016 with a £4m uplift in 
valuation.
Acquisitions
There is a £5m reduction in the 
value of recently acquired 
properties to £132m. At Goswell 
Road (formerly Angel House), 
Islington there has been a £3m 
reduction in the valuation. We 
have now obtained the vacant 
possession of the first floor, 
ground floor and basement at 
this property ahead of a 
repositioning of the space for 
letting at higher rental levels.

Acquisitions
In June 2016, we exchanged 
contracts to acquire 29,000 sq. 
ft. of commercial space at 
175-179 Long Lane, SE1 for £9.5m 
(payable upon completion) at a 
capital value of £328 per sq. ft. 
This property is located adjacent 
to The Leather Market, our 
business centre near Borough 
High Street. The commercial 
space being acquired is part of a 
larger mixed use development 
which is currently under 
construction and is expected to 
be completed in mid-2018.
In April 2017, we completed the 
acquisition of 13-17 Fitzroy Street, 
Fitzrovia for £98.5m. This 
property comprises 92,700 sq. 
ft. of net lettable space, currently 
let in its entirety to Arup until 
September 2022 at annual rent 
of £4.9m (£53 per sq. ft.), rising 
to £6.0m (£65 per sq. ft.) in 
March 2021. Arup plan to 
relocate from this building and 
the lease provides for their early 
exit with effect from September 
2020 with a rolling nine-month 
break option. In due course we 
will reposition the building as a 
multi-let business centre.

We completed the disposal of 
the remaining eight properties in 
BlackRock Workspace Property 
Trust (‘BWPT’) joint venture in 
May and June 2016 for £131m at 
a net initial yield of 4.7%. The 
disposals marked the conclusion 
of the joint venture with 
BlackRock in which Workspace 
made an initial investment of 
£20m in 2011. Based on the 
strong performance achieved 
over the five-year life of the joint 
venture, Workspace received a 
total performance fee from 
BWPT of £24.5m.
In October 2016, we contracted 
to sell three mixed-use 
redevelopments:
 – Arches Business Centre, 
Southall which has planning 
consent for 110 residential 
units, for £13.0m with 
proceeds to be received once 
vacant possession has been 
achieved in November 2017. 
 – The second phase at The 
Light Bulb, Wandsworth 
comprising 77 residential 
units, for £7.75m together with 
the return of 17,000 sq. ft. of 
new commercial space.
 – Lombard Business Centre, 
Croydon which has planning 
consent for 96 residential 
units, for £5.75m with the cash 
received in March 2017.
In May 2017, in line with our 
strategy, we exchanged and 
completed on the sale of 
Uplands, an 11 acre industrial 
estate in Walthamstow, for 
£50.0m at a net initial yield of 
3.1%.  2.

Refurbishment activity 
During the financial year we 
obtained planning permissions 
for the extension and upgrade of 
Pall Mall Deposit, Ladbroke 
Grove; Mare Street Studios, 
Hackney and Edinburgh House, 
Vauxhall. In April 2017, we 
received planning permission at 
Easton Street, Clerkenwell. These 
properties will provide a 
combined 208,000 sq. ft. of new 
and upgraded space at an 
estimated cost of £57m.
A summary of the status of 
the refurbishment pipeline at 
31 March 2017 is set out in the 
table, right.
In May 2017, we completed and 
opened The Record Hall, 
Holborn a new 58,000 sq. ft. 
business centre. Whilst not 
officially launched until June 
2017, interest and demand has 
already been strong with 31% of 
the building let or under offer by 
the end of May 2017.
The refurbishment projects 
underway at Barley Mow Centre, 
Chiswick and The Leather 
Market, London Bridge will also 
complete during the current 
financial year providing 192,000 
sq. ft. of new and upgraded 
space.
At the remaining nine 
refurbishment projects 
underway we are currently 
on-site at four, have achieved 
vacant possession and are at 
final construction contract 
tender stage at three and are 
working towards achieving 
vacant possession at the 
remaining two.
We would expect the capital 
expenditure on the 
refurbishment projects detailed 
above to be incurred relatively 
evenly over the next four years 
(subject to obtaining planning 
consent on the design stage 
schemes).
Redevelopment activity 
Many of our properties are in 
areas where there is strong 
demand for mixed use 
redevelopment. Our model is to 
use our expertise, knowledge 
and local relationships to obtain 
a mixed-use planning consent 
and then agree terms with a 
residential developer to 
undertake the redevelopment 
and construction at no cost or 
risk to Workspace. We receive 
back a combination of cash, new 
commercial space and overage 
in return for the sale of the 
residential component to the 
developer.
A summary of the status of the 
redevelopment pipeline at 
31 March 2017 is set out in the 
table, below.
The six redevelopment schemes 
underway will deliver some 
£114m in cash (£28m still to 
come) and three new 
commercial buildings, with the 
Fuel Tank in Deptford expected 
to be completed in the second 
half of 2017.
There are five schemes with 
mixed-use planning consents 
which are not yet contracted for 
sale. This includes Stratford 
Office Village, Stratford where 
we received planning consent in 
September 2016 for 101 
residential units. 
Discussions with the planners 
for the three mixed-use 
redevelopment schemes at the 
design stage are progressing well.

Cash flow
The Group generates strong 
operating cash flow in line with 
trading profit, with good levels of 
cash collection and bad debts 
low in the year at £0.3m (2016: 
£0.2m). A summary of the 
movements in cash flow are set 
out in Table 9, right.
Financing
The Group had £3m in cash and 
£245m of drawn debt at 31 
March 2017 with £365m of 
committed facilities as detailed 
in Table 10, right.
The Private Placement notes 
comprise $100m (£64.5m) of US 
dollar ten year notes, £84m of 
Sterling ten year notes and £9m 
of seven-year Sterling floating 
rate notes. The US dollar notes 
have been fully hedged against 
Sterling for ten years. The overall 
interest rate on the £148.5m 
10-year fixed rate notes is 5.6%. 
A seven year £57.5m Retail Bond 
(listed on ORB) was issued in 
October 2012 and carries a 
coupon of 6.0%. 
 
In June 2016, we exercised the 
option for the first extension of 
the maturity term of our £150m 
revolver bank facilities by a year 
to June 2021. In June 2017, we 
exercised the option for the 
second extension of the maturity 
of the revolver facility to June 
2022. We continue to have the 
option (subject to lender 
consent) of increasing the 
quantum of the revolver facility 
from £150m to £250m. We are 
also looking at the opportunity 
to further diversify and extend 
the maturity of our facilities 
which may include the issue of 
additional Private Placement 
notes.
Our hedging strategy is to fix the 
cost of our longer-term 
borrowings but maintain 
flexibility around our shorter-
term revolver facilities. At 31 
March 2017, 56% of our debt 
facilities are at fixed rates, 
representing 84% of our debt on 
a drawn basis.
At 31 March 2017, undrawn 
facilities (including cash) were 
£123m, loan to value (LTV) was 
13% (31 March 2016: 16%) and 
interest cover (based on net 
rental income) was 5.8 times, 
giving us good headroom on all 
of bank, placement notes and 
bond covenants. The average 
maturity of our facilities as at 31 
March 2017, taking into account 
the extension of our revolver 
bank facilities to June 2022, was 
5.2 years (31 March 2016: 5.9 
years).
The proforma impact of the 
acquisition of 13-17 Fitzroy Street 
in April 2017 and the disposal of 
Uplands industrial estate in May 
2017 on net debt, LTV and 
undrawn facilities reported as at 
31 March 2017 is as follows:
 – Net debt increases by £49m 
to £291m;
 – LTV increases from 13% to 15%; 
and 
 – Undrawn facilities reduce from 
£123m to £74m.
Net assets
Net assets increased in the year 
by £61m to £1,579m. EPRA net 
asset value per share at 31 March 
2017 was £9.53 (31 March 2016: 
£9.23), an increase of 3.3% 
(£0.30) in the period as detailed

Chairman’s governance statement
Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to present the Corporate Governance Report for the 
financial year ended 31 March 2017 which highlights the work 
undertaken during the year by the Board. 
The Company fully complied with the UK Corporate Governance 
Code throughout the year. Details of the Company’s governance 
arrangements and activities in compliance with the Principles of the 
UK Corporate Governance Code are included on pages 51 to 120.
Why is good governance important to us?
The Board of Workspace is committed to conducting business 
responsibly and ensuring that our governance structures at Board 
and Committee level remain appropriate for our business while 
supporting the delivery of our overall strategy. We are committed to 
maintaining high standards of Corporate Governance in terms of 
leadership, Board effectiveness, accountability, remuneration matters, 
and our relationship with shareholders.
Corporate Governance at Workspace is treated as an important 
discipline which complements our desire to continuously improve the 
performance of the Company. Our approach to governance is set by 
the Board and our Executive Committee ensures that the approach is 
effectively implemented across the business.
Our strategic priorities
The Company’s business model and strategy are outlined on pages 
14 and 15, and 18 to 23.
The Board regularly debates the relevance and effectiveness of the 
strategy and oversees the Executive Committee to ensure it is being 
successfully implemented and is delivering the desired performance. 
This year, the Board reaffirmed its belief that the current strategy is 
the right one for the business at this time. 
Board effectiveness
The annual Board effectiveness reviews (including its Committees) 
continue to provide a valuable opportunity for the Board to reflect on 
how it operates and to propose any improvements. The performance 
evaluation process for this year was led by me and assisted by the 
Company Secretary. This year’s review took the form of a 
questionnaire which was completed by the Directors and members of 
the Executive Committee. The questionnaires covered the processes 
and performance of the Board and its Committees. The Company 
Secretary consolidated the responses and prepared reports for me, 
as Chairman, as well as for the Chairmen of the relevant Committees. 
The findings from the Board evaluation were discussed at our 
meeting in March 2017. 
The performance of the Executive Directors was assessed by the 
Remuneration Committee as part of the salary review process. 50 Workspace Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Market Abuse Regulations
The Board also considered the implications of the Market Abuse 
Regulations, which came into force in July 2016. To assist with 
meeting the Company’s obligations under the regime, a Disclosure 
Committee of the Board was established to monitor inside 
information and closed periods. 
Engagement with our shareholders
We have continued to operate a comprehensive investor relations 
programme during the year with our Executive Directors regularly 
meeting with investors and analysts. During the year, presentations 
were made to shareholders and potential shareholders by the 
Executive Directors. On 28 February 2017, we held a Capital Markets 
Day for sell-side analysts and investors at our newly refurbished 
property in Fleet Street. More information can be found on pages 78 
to 79.
In addition to regular meetings with the Executive Directors, I am 
available to meet with investors on request and encourage an open 
dialogue on all matters and in particular, if they wish to raise any 
points with respect to Board governance. 
I am pleased with the progress we have made this year across the 
governance agenda. We have built a committed Board that is working 
well in the interests of all shareholders and each Director continues to 
contribute effectively. We extend our thanks to all our shareholders 
for your continued support as we look forward to the year ahead. 
Compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code
The Company has, throughout the year ended 31 March 2017, fully 
complied with the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code (the ‘Code’) published in September 2014, which is applicable 
to the Company for the financial year. A copy of the Code is 
available at www.frc.org.uk. The application of the principles 
contained in the Code is described within the Corporate 
Governance report. Detailed reports on the Nomination Committee, 
the Audit Committee and Remuneration Committee can be found 
on pages 82 to 93 and pages 94 to 115.
Daniel Kitchen
Non-Executive Chairman
6 June 2017
I can confirm that no issues were raised and the view of the Board is 
that the governance structure, together with the Board and its 
Committees, all continue to operate effectively. 
Furthermore, I am satisfied that the Non-Executive Directors, all of 
whom are standing for re-election at the forthcoming Annual General 
Meeting, continue to be effective and show a high level of 
commitment to their roles. They have a broad and complementary 
mix of business skills, knowledge and experience acquired across 
different business sectors.
The independence of our Non-Executive Directors is extremely 
important to us in maintaining good governance. July 2017 will mark 
three years since Stephen Hubbard was first elected to the Board. 
During the year we have considered Stephen’s independence. 
Stephen is Chairman of CBRE UK and is a member of their 
Management Board. The Valuation Advisory Division of CBRE acts as 
the Group’s external valuer and, recognising the effect that this may 
potentially have on the perception of his independence, and in view of 
this continuing relationship, the Board has rigorously evaluated 
Stephen’s independence as a Non-Executive Director and any 
potential conflicts. Having made that assessment, the Board is 
completely satisfied that he remains independent in judgement and 
character. Stephen will therefore stand for re-election at this year’s 
AGM. As advised last year, it has been agreed that Stephen will not 
take part in any considerations of the valuation of the Group’s 
property portfolio. In addition, he will not have involvement in any 
discussions or decisions regarding CBRE or the fees paid to them.
Appointment of External Auditor
In last year’s Annual Report the Company confirmed that it would 
undertake a competitive tender for the selection and appointment of 
an External Auditor during the financial year as a result of mandatory 
firm rotation. As part of its work this year, the Audit Committee has 
undertaken this exercise which resulted in the appointment of a new 
External Auditor, KPMG LLP (‘KPMG’) in January 2017, subject to final 
approval by shareholders at the next AGM on 14 July 2017. The 
selection and appointment process is fully described on page 92.
Remuneration Policy
The Company’s Remuneration Policy was approved in 2014 and has 
been operating for three years. During the year, the Remuneration 
Committee has spent time discussing a new Remuneration Policy.
The Chairman of the Remuneration Committee engaged with major 
shareholders and sought feedback on the proposals. In accordance 
with the regulations, shareholders will be asked to approve the new 
policy at the AGM in July 2017. You can read full details about this in 
the Directors’ Remuneration Report from page 94.
Chairman’s governance statement

How governance supports our strategy
The principles in the Code set the framework for how the Board,  
through its governance activities, provides effective oversight of  
delivering against the strategy. 
Leadership
The Board is responsible 
for setting the tone to 
embed the Group’s 
strategy into the business. 
The Board carefully 
monitors the progress of 
the strategy and receives 
regular briefings on the 
state of the London 
property market. 
For more information see 
pages 70 to 73.
Effectiveness
The Nomination Committee 
continues to make sure the 
Board has the necessary 
skills and experience to 
understand the market and 
provide challenge to the 
business to deliver the 
strategy.
For more information see 
pages 82 to 85.
Accountability
The work of the Audit 
Committee plays an 
important role to provide 
the necessary safeguards 
to manage risks and 
achieve high standards in 
transparency and 
accountability to 
shareholders.
For more information see 
pages 86 to 93.
Relations with 
Shareholders
Explaining the strategy 
and how it is being 
operationalised, through 
our business model, is an 
important part of the 
Board’s work in keeping 
shareholders informed on 
the business’ performance 
and future prospects. 
For more information see 
pages 77 and 78.
Remuneration
Through the work of the 
Remuneration Committee, 
the Company’s policy is to 
align reward of the 
Executive Directors with 
the performance of the 
Company and incentivise 
long-term and sustainable 
value.

Board engagement with the business
In order to ensure good quality decision making and oversight, all 
Directors need to stay up to date with events and developments in 
the business, as well as external factors, such as the changing 
governance landscape, regulation and shareholder views.
As part of their engagement with the business, the Board participates 
in an annual property tour where they meet centre staff and 
customers. This allows them to see the strategy in action and assess 
its effectiveness.
In the Boardroom
The Directors collectively have many years of experience gained in a 
wide range of businesses and sectors, as illustrated on pages 54 to 
55. Skills of the Board cover property, finance, retail, marketing, 
telecoms, media and general corporate experience. One Executive 
Director also serves as a Non-Executive Director on an external 
board. 
The Board met formally throughout the year, with main meetings 
timed around the financial calendar and additional meetings 
convened to consider an annual cycle of topics, including the annual 
strategy day, key management and financial updates, review of risk as 
well as the approval of acquisitions and refurbishment programmes. 
During the year, the Board received regular internal reports, which 
helped to keep the Directors well informed about the business 
generally. The Board will receive updates from the Chief Executive 
Officer and Chief Financial Officer, covering an overview of the 
business, the market in which it operates, together with the Group’s 
financial performance and other financing matters. The Company 
Secretary and external advisers will also update the Board, 
periodically, on regulatory changes. In particular, the Board 
considered the implications of the Market Abuse Regulations (‘MAR’), 
which came into force in July 2016. To assist with meeting the 
Company’s obligations under MAR, a Disclosure Committee of the 
Board was established to monitor inside information and closed 
periods. Terms of Reference are available for the Disclosure 
Committee and Board members receive minutes of meetings. 
The Board also engaged with Company advisors during the year. 
There was a presentation from the Company brokers in July. The 
Group’s Valuer, CBRE, also presented twice during the year at the 
Audit Committee meetings in May and November 2016. Their 
presentation covered the valuation of the property portfolio and the 
wider market in which the Company operates. The Board

local businesses and also attract 
organisations from outside the 
local area with all the extra 
amenities we put into a building, 
from great cafes and restaurants, 
high quality meeting rooms for 
hire, co-working space and, in 
many cases, a gym, showers and 
cycle storage.

Insights from the Board tour:
At Workspace, we place great 
emphasis on talking to 
customers and listening to their 
feedback so that we can create 
the ideal working environment to 
meet their individual business 
needs. This is evident in the 
relationships that Centre 
Managers have with their 
customers – from the moment 
they move in, they have an ally 
on site who is there to make their 
lives easier and facilitate 
networking with neighbours who 
could help their business grow.
Walking around our centres, you 
see the huge range of businesses 
and individuals that Workspace 
caters for – whether a freelance 
consultant or a well-established 
company. The rise of digital 
marketing has widened the 
potential reach of our offer and 
the truly flexible space we 
provide means we are able to 
operate right across the 
economic spectrum.
It is hugely exciting to see the 
opportunities that are opening 
up in the real estate market 
thanks to advances in 
technology. At Workspace, we 
are using it to better understand 
and respond to customer 
requirements, for example, by 
providing super connected 
properties that allow customers 
to remain connected to their 
servers wherever they are in the 
building, or indeed across many 
of our other buildings.

The annual Board tour of our properties provides an opportunity for 
the Board to enhance their understanding of the business first hand. 
The site visits in March 2017 proved beneficial as the Board engaged 
with centre staff and customers, which helped them to assess the 
effectiveness of the current strategy and reinforce and extend their 
knowledge and understanding of some key properties within the 
portfolio. 
All of these factors provide a different perspective for our Board 
which enables the Non-Executive Directors to support and offer 
constructive challenge to the executive management team. 
The role of the Workspace Group PLC Board 
The Board is collectively responsible for the performance and 
long-term success of the Company, for its leadership, strategy, values, 
standards, control and management. The key responsibilities of our 
Board and those matters reserved for its decision are as follows:
Responsibilities
 – Agree strategic plans and business objectives.
 – Approve the acquisition of investment properties and disposals.
 – Review and agree financing arrangements and capital expenditure.
 – Review the Group’s systems of internal control, governance and 
risk management.
Matters reserved for its decision
At least once a year the Board reviews the nature and scale of 
matters reserved for its decision and these include: 
 – Dividend Policy.
 – Company Strategy, business objectives and annual budgets.
 – Succession planning for the Board and Senior Management.
 – Approval of significant funding decisions. 
 – Review and approval of corporate transactions.
Other day-to-day operational decisions are delegated by the Board 
to the Executive Committee, subject to formal delegated authority 
limits. The schedule of matters reserved for the Board’s decision can 
be accessed on the Company website at www.workspace.co.uk.
Leadership
Our leadership 
provides agile and 
responsive decision 
making to keep 
pace with a dynamic 
marketplace within 
the safeguards of a 
sound governance 
framework.
The Executive Directors provide regular updates to the Board on 
different aspects of the business, ranging from progress being made 
on our refurbishment and redevelopment projects, trading 
performance, the rationale for acquisitions and disposals and how 
these are aligned to our strategy, and inform the Board on the 
discussions held with analysts and investors. 
Our governance framework, which is shown below, illustrates how our 
internal processes operate. Overview Our Governance Strategic Report Financial Statements Additional Information
71 Workspace Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017
To assist the Board in effectively discharging its duties, Directors 
receive relevant supporting information, which includes, but is not 
limited to, the monthly Group’s financial results, performance reports 
and risk assessment reports. Equally, the Board routinely considers 
safety, environmental, ethical and reputational issues, in order to 
ensure that they are fully reflected in the risk management process. 
Details of the Group’s strategy are set out in the Strategic Report on 
pages 2 to 47.
Details of the risk management and internal control system can be 
found on page 93.
Board and Committee meetings attendance 
The Board has regular scheduled meetings throughout the year. It 
held nine meetings during the year under review. Supplementary 
meetings or Board conference calls are held between formal Board 
meetings as and when necessary. 
The Directors are expected to attend all meetings of the Board, the 
Committees on which they serve and the Annual General Meeting 
(‘AGM’), and to devote sufficient time to the Company’s affairs, to 
enable them to fulfil their duties as Directors. Details of Directors’ 
attendance at each of the Board and Committee meetings during the 
year ended 31 March 2017 are set out in the table below.

Where a Director is unable to attend a meeting, they are provided 
with papers in advance of the meeting and their comments, as 
appropriate, are provided to the Board or the Committee Chairman 
prior to the meeting.
Board Committees
The Board has a number of standing Committees, namely the 
Nomination, Audit, and Remuneration Committees, to which specific 
responsibilities have been delegated. These Committees enable the 
Board to operate effectively and ensure a strong governance 
framework. 
Further details of the work of these Committees can be found on 
pages 82 to 115.
Each Committee has Terms of Reference which were reviewed by 
each of the Committees and the Board during the year. The Terms of 
Reference for the Nomination, Audit and Remuneration Committees 
are available for inspection on the Company’s website at 
www.workspace.co.uk. 
Each of these Committees is comprised of independent Non-
Executive Directors of the Company who are appointed by the Board. 
Board members receive minutes of meetings and comprehensive 
papers, in advance of all the Board’s Committees and they can 
request presentations or reports on areas of interest. 
The activity of each Committee is described on pages 82 to 115.
The Company Secretary is secretary to each Committee.
Division of responsibilities
The roles of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer 
The roles and responsibilities of the Non-Executive Chairman and 
Chief Executive Officer are separate, with a clear division of 
responsibilities between them.
As Chairman, Daniel Kitchen, is primarily responsible for the 
operation, leadership and overall effectiveness of the Board. The 
Chairman sets the Board’s agenda and ensures that important 
matters, in particular strategic issues, receive adequate time and 
attention at meetings. The Chairman facilitates the effective 
contribution of the Non-Executive Directors and ensures all Directors 
receive accurate, timely and clear information. He is also responsible 
for effective communication between the Board and shareholders. 
The Chairman is not involved in an executive capacity in any of the 
Group’s activities. 
During the year, the Chairman held a number of meetings with the 
Non-Executive Directors, without the Executive Directors being 
present. The discussions largely revolved around succession planning 
and other matters of interest. 
The Chief Executive Officer, Jamie Hopkins, is responsible for leading 
and managing the business, and is accountable to the Board for the 
financial and operational performance of the Group, and the 
determination of the strategy and achievement of its objectives.
Non-Executive Directors
The Non-Executive Directors have a broad and complementary mix 
of business skills, knowledge and experience acquired across different 
business sectors. This allows them to provide independent and 
external perspectives to Board discussions. 
The terms and conditions of appointment of Non-Executive Directors, 
including the expected time commitment, are available for inspection 
at the Company’s registered office. 
Senior Independent Director
The Board appointed Chris Girling to the position of Senior 
Independent Director on 16 July 2014. In performing this role, Chris is 
available to provide an alternative communication channel for 
shareholders, if required. He can also deputise for the Chairman in his 
absence and counsel all Board colleagues. 
Chris also chairs an annual meeting of the Executive and Non-
Executive Directors, without the Chairman present, to appraise the 
Chairman’s performance and address any other matters which the 
Directors might wish to raise. Chris then conveys the outcome of 
these discussions to the Chairman. 
If any Director has concerns about the running of the Company or 
proposed action which cannot be resolved, these concerns will be 
recorded in the Board Minutes. No such concerns arose during the 
year under review. Corporate governance report

Leadership structure
The Board is collectively responsible for the Company’s long-term 
success and the delivery of its strategic and operational objectives.
The Board sets the strategic direction, governance and values of the 
Group and has ultimate responsibility for its management, direction 
and performance.
The Board draws on the expertise throughout the business and from 
external advisors to ensure that its judgements are based on sound 
and timely information.
The Board operates through a sound risk management and internal 
control system, details of which can be found on page 93. Detailed

73 Workspace Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Financial Statements Additional Information Our Governance Strategic Report Overview During the year, the independence of Stephen Hubbard was 
specifically considered. The Board is satisfied that he remains 
independent and has established a protocol to ensure that Stephen 
has no involvement, at any stage, in the Group’s valuation exercise. He 
also takes no part in any of the discussions concerning CBRE’s role 
and fees. 
The Board believes that no long-standing relationship, which may be 
deemed to compromise independence has been formed with any of 
the Executive Directors or Senior Management at Workspace. 
The Nomination Committee regularly reviews the composition of the 
Board to ensure that it has an appropriate and diverse mix of skills, 
experience, independence and knowledge of the Group. Each 
Director brings a particular range of skills and expertise to the 
deliberations of the Board.
Appointments to the Board
The Nomination Committee is chaired by Daniel Kitchen, the 
Company Chairman and comprises all of the Non-Executive 
Directors. As needs arise, the Committee is assisted by external 
search consultants. 
The Committee ensures that there is a formal, rigorous and 
transparent procedure for the appointment of new Directors, with the 
first step being a detailed evaluation of the current composition of the 
Board, taking into account the balance of skills, experience, 
knowledge and diversity.
The Committee then prepares a candidate specification for approval 
by the Board.
There has been no Board Director recruitment activity for the year 
under review.
In accordance with the Code, all Directors wishing to continue will 
retire and offer themselves for re-election by shareholders at the 
Annual General Meeting on 14 July 2017.
The Nomination Committee’s terms of reference can be found at 
www.workspace.co.uk.
Further work of the Nomination Committee can be found on pages 
82 to 85.
Independent advice
The Directors can, for the purpose of discharging their duties, obtain 
independent professional advice at the Company’s expense. No 
Director had reason to use this facility during the year.
Effectiveness
The Directors bring 
a diverse set of skills 
and experience 
which allows them 
to provide sound 
independent advice.
The composition of the Board
As at 31 March 2017, the Board comprised the Chairman, four 
Independent Non-Executive Directors and two Executive Directors. 
Further biographical information on each of our Directors can be 
found on pages 54 and 55, which shows the breadth of their skills and 
experience and membership of the Committees. All of our Directors 
have significant experience and knowledge of the sector in which we 
operate. The Non-Executive Directors bring industry experience from 
a wide range of backgrounds. 
The effectiveness of the Board and its Committees is vital to the 
success of the Company. The Board considers there is an appropriate 
balance between Executive and Non-Executive Directors required to 
lead the business and safeguard the interest of shareholders. The 
Board’s current composition of a Non-Executive Chairman, two 
Executive Directors and four Independent Non-Executive Directors 
meets the requirement of the Code for at least half the Board, 
excluding the Chairman, to be independent Non-Executive Directors. 
Independence of Non-Executive Directors
During the year, the Board considered the independence of all of the 
Non-Executive Directors, save for the Chairman who was deemed 
independent by the Board at the date of his appointment. It 
concluded that each Non-Executive Director remained independent 
of management and free from any business or other relationship 
which could materially interfere with the exercise of their independent 
judgement. All Non-Executive Directors act in a robustly independent 
manner and bring constructive challenge to Board discussions and 
independent decision-making to their Board and Committee duties. 
Corporate governance report

74 Workspace Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Business experience and skills of the Board 
The Board currently has seven Directors that bring considerable and 
diverse experience which enables them to make a valuable 
contribution to the Group. Their experience, gained from varied 
commercial backgrounds, includes technology, property, marketing 
and finance, which enables them to support the executive team in 
delivering the Company’s strategy. 
The Board actively considers diversity and believes this to be an 
important factor when considering appointments to the Board. As 
part of the recruitment process, the composition of the Board will be 
kept under review to ensure the best balance of gender, skills and 
experience is maintained. Further details on our diversity policy can 
be found on page 28.
The mix and diverse range of skills create a highly effective Board, 
with the Directors’ individual and complementary qualities 
encouraging a high level of debate at Board meetings.
  Details of the business experience and skills held by each Director 
can be found in the Directors’ biographies section on pages 54 
and 55.
Commitment
The Board is satisfied that each of the Non-Executive Directors is able 
to devote sufficient time to the Company’s business. Non-Executive 
Directors are advised on appointment of the time required to fulfil the 
role and asked to confirm that they can make the required 
commitment. Letters of appointment for the Non-Executive Directors 
are available for inspection at the AGM. 
Non-Executive Directors will seek approval from the Chairman, prior 
to assuming additional external commitments which may affect their 
time available to devote to the Company. The Board is advised of any 
changes.
The Board is satisfied that all Non-Executive Directors are 
contributing effectively to the operation of the Board. 
Positions held by the Non-Executive Directors are detailed in the 
section on Directors’ biographies on pages 54 and 55.
All Executive Directors are encouraged to take a Non-Executive 
position in another company or organisation. The appointment to 
such positions is subject to the approval of the Board which 
considers, in particular, the time commitment required. 
Induction, training and development
All new Non-Executive Directors joining the Board, undertake a 
formal and personalised induction programme which is designed to 
give him or her an understanding of the Company’s business, 
governance and stakeholders. This will cover, for example, the 
operation and activities of the Group (including site visits and meeting 
members of the Senior Management team), the Group’s principal 
strategic risks; the role of the Board; the decision-making matters 
reserved to it; the responsibilities of the Board Committees; and the 
strategic objectives.
We recognise that our Directors have a diverse range of experience, 
and so we encourage them to attend external seminars and briefings 
at the Company’s expense, in areas considered appropriate for their 
professional development. 
The Company Secretary provides updates to the Board on changes in 
legal, regulatory and corporate governance matters. The Company’s 
principal external advisers provide updates to the Board, at least 
annually, on the latest developments in their respective fields. 
Information and support to the Board
The Directors have access to independent professional advice at the 
Company’s expense, as well as to the advice and services of the 
Company Secretary, Carmelina Carfora. Her biography can be found 
on page 55. Through the Chairman, Carmelina is responsible for 
advising the Board on matters of Corporate Governance and ensuring 
that Board procedures are complied with. The Board and its 
Committees receive high-quality, up-to-date information for them to 
review in good time before each meeting. 
In consultation with the Chairman, the Chief Executive Officer and 
Chief Financial Officer, the Company Secretary manages the 
provision of information to the Board for their formal Board meetings 
and at other appropriate times.
The Board uses an electronic Board paper system which provides 
quick, easy and secure access to Board papers and materials. Prior to 
each Board meeting the Directors receive, through this system, the 
agenda and supporting papers to ensure that they have the latest and 
relevant information in advance of the meeting.
After each Board meeting, the Company Secretary operates a 
comprehensive follow-up procedure to ensure that actions are 
completed as agreed by the Board.
The Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer ensure 
that the Board is kept fully aware, on a timely basis, of business 
matters relating to the Group.

75 Workspace Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Board evaluation
The Board recognises the benefit of annual evaluation, enabling it 
to improve its effectiveness and that of its Committees and 
Directors. For the year under review, the performance evaluation 
was an internal process which was led by the Chairman. No 
particular matters were identified as requiring specific action and 
the Board will continue to consider development in corporate 
governance and best practice. 
The outcome of the key recommendations arising from the 2016 
effectiveness review can be found below. 
Maintain focus 
on succession 
planning, 
resourcing, 
and training 
and 
development 
needs of 
Board 
members.
Progress during 2016/17:
  Succession planning and the 
development needs of Board members 
will continue to be kept under review to 
ensure stable and consistent governance 
and leadership. To that end, it is the 
Board’s intention that from 2017, new 
Non-Executive Directors would join the 
Board two years prior to existing 
members reaching the end of their 
relevant term. 
   Appropriate training and development 
requirements for Board members will 
continue to be satisfied through legal and 
other relevant updates provided by the 
Company Secretary, Company advisers 
and through Non-Executive Director 
training programmes.
Continue the 
ongoing 
programme of 
Board 
engagement 
with the 
business 
through 
activities such 
as site visits.
Progress during 2016/17:
  A site tour was held in March 2017 as part 
of the Board’s ongoing programme to 
engage with the business and develop 
their understanding of operational issues. 
Please see page 59 for details of the 
Board tour.
Topics discussed as part of evaluation for the year under review can 
be found in the Chairman’s governance statement on page 49.
The Company Secretary reviewed the responses and discussed 
them with the Chairman. 
The outcomes from this review were discussed as part of the Board 
meeting in March 2017. The Board agreed that, overall, the Board 
and its Committees were working well, and that each Director 
continues to contribute effectively and demonstrate commitment 
to their roles. Consequently, whilst no real development themes 
were identified from the 2017 evaluation, the Board will continue to 
look for opportunities to improve its effectiveness.

Chairman’s evaluation
The Senior Independent Director chairs an annual meeting of 
Executive and Non-Executive Directors, without the Chairman 
present, to appraise the Chairman’s performance and to address any 
other matters which the Directors might wish to raise. The outcome 
of these discussions is conveyed by the Senior Independent Director 
to the Chairman. During the year under review, it was concluded that 
the Chairman is highly respected and is valued for his industry 
knowledge. Furthermore, he was complimented by all for his 
leadership and for his inclusive style during Board meetings.
Re-election of Directors
All Directors will stand for re-election at the AGM on 14 July 2017. 
Following the Board evaluation review, the Chairman considers that 
each Director continues to operate as an effective member of the 
Board and has the skills, knowledge and experience that enables 
them to discharge their duties effectively, in fulfilling their duties on 
the Board and as members of the Board Committees. Consequently, 
the Board is of the opinion that the Directors seeking re-election at 
the Annual General Meeting have continued to give effective counsel 
and commitment to the Company and, accordingly, should be 
reappointed by the Group’s shareholders at the upcoming Annual 
General Meeting.
Mr Hopkins and Mr Clemett have service contracts and details can be 
found on page 113. None of the Non-Executive Directors have service 
contracts.
The appointment of Daniel Kitchen may be terminated by either him 
or the Company giving six months’ notice in writing.
 
Daniel Kitchen’s second term of appointment as Chairman expired on 
6 June 2017 and Stephen Hubbard’s first term of appointment as 
Non-Executive Director will expire on 16 July 2017. Following a review 
of their performance, the Nomination Committee recommended that 
their appointment should be extended for a further three-year term. 
This recommendation was agreed by the Board. 
The appointment of Chris Girling, Maria Moloney, Damon Russell and 
Stephen Hubbard may be terminated by either the Company or any 
one of them giving three months’ notice in writing. 
  Biographies for the Directors can be found on pages 54 and 55. Accountability
Transparency 
and effective risk 
management 
remain a focus.
The Directors consider that the Annual Report and Accounts taken as 
a whole is fair, balanced and understandable, and provides the 
information necessary for shareholders to assess the Company’s 
performance, business model and strategy.
The Group’s strategy and business model can be found on pages 18 
to 23, and 14 and 15. A statement of the Directors’ responsibilities 
regarding the financial statements is set out on page 120.
Internal control and risk management
The Board has reviewed the Group’s system of internal controls and 
risk management throughout the year. Processes and procedures 
have been established to enable the Directors to report on the 
effectiveness of internal controls in compliance with the Code. These 
processes and procedures involve the analysis, evaluation and 
management of the key risks to the Group. Further details are 
contained in principal risks and uncertainties on page 32.
 
An assessment of the principal risks facing the Company is set out on 
pages 32 to 39 and key performance indicators are on pages 24 and 
25.
Going Concern and Viability Statement
Going Concern disclosures are included alongside the Viability 
Statement on page 40.
Takeover directive
Share capital structures are included in the Directors’ Report on 
page 117.
Audit Committee and Auditors
The Audit Committee comprises four independent Non-Executive 
Directors. It met three times during the year under review, with 
meetings organised around the Company’s reporting schedule.
Chris Girling, the Chairman of the Audit Committee, has been 
determined by the Board, to have relevant financial experience as 
required by the Code.
The Audit Committee meets at least twice a year with its External 
Auditors, with no Company management present.
Further details on the work of the Audit Committee can be found in 
the Audit Committee Report on pages 86 to 93. Details of the 
composition of the Audit Committee are set out on page 87.

Remuneration
Remuneration 
and performance 
are aligned.
The principal responsibility of the Remuneration Committee is to 
determine and agree, with the Board, the overall remuneration 
principles and the framework for remuneration of the Executive 
Directors.
Details of the Directors’ remuneration can be found on pages 94 to 
115. Relations with shareholders
Engaging with 
shareholders is a 
priority for our 
business to ensure 
good understanding 
of our investment 
case.
Shareholder engagement
Workspace believes engagement with shareholders is all important. 
The Company has a comprehensive investor relations programme, 
maintaining regular dialogue with its investors, including major 
institutions and private client fund managers.
Throughout the year, meetings are arranged, both proactively and on 
request, for the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and 
Head of Corporate Communications with institutional shareholders 
and sell-side analysts to discuss the Company’s business model, 
strategy and marketplace, as well as update on performance. These 
meetings often include site visits which provide shareholders with 
valuable insight into the business.
Digital communication is increasingly used as a means of keeping in 
touch with shareholders. The investor website is kept up-to-date with 
RNS announcements, share price performance and information on 
Workspace’s ‘Doing the Right Thing’ strategy, while Company 
presentations are also available both on the website and, where 
appropriate, via a webcast. The Company also engages with 
shareholders at the Annual General Meeting and at an annual Capital 
Markets Day, as well as attending several external investor 
conferences. 
The Board receives reports of meetings with institutional shareholders 
together with regular market and brokers’ reports which give the 
Directors clear understanding of shareholders views and concerns.
The Chairman is also available to meet with shareholders, 
independently of the Executive Directors, as required.
The Annual Report and Accounts is sent to all shareholders who wish 
to receive a copy. It is also available in the investor section of the 
Company’s website www.workspace.co.uk/investors.

Workspace investor relations programme includes  
the following activities:
1. Analyst Engagement
The Executive Committee 
engages with sell-side analysts 
formally at the Full and Half Year 
results presentations and Capital 
Markets Day. All RNS 
announcements, including 
quarterly trading updates, are 
sent to analysts throughout the 
year. In addition, the Chief 
Financial Officer and Head of 
Corporate Communications are 
in regular dialogue with analysts 
as they update their models and 
publish research on the 
Company.
Why it is important: Sell-side 
analysts write independent 
research on the Company, which 
is sent to existing and 
prospective investors. It is 
therefore important that analysts 
have up-to-date and accurate 
information on the business and 
its strategy in order to present a 
fair view.
Frequency: Three formal 
meetings per year, plus regular 
ongoing dialogue.
2. Investor Roadshows
In addition to the results 
presentations, which investors 
attend as well as analysts, 
management carry out investor 
roadshows in the UK immediately 
after the Full and Half Year 
results, generally spending four 
to five days on the road in 
London and Scotland. Additional 
roadshows are arranged during 
the year to regional cities in the 
UK, Continental Europe and the 
US. 
Why they are important: The 
roadshows give shareholders an 
opportunity to meet with 
management one-on-one or in 
small groups to discuss the 
results, business model and 
strategy and raise any questions 
they may have about the 
Company and its performance.
Frequency: Two formal 
roadshows per year, plus at least 
two further roadshows arranged 
as necessary.
3. Webcasts
The Full and Half Year results 
presentations are streamed on 
the Company website via a live 
webcast and made available for 
replays following the event.
Why they are important: The 
webcasts allow analysts and 
investors to follow the results 
presentation if they cannot 
attend the event in person, and 
broaden the Company’s reach to 
investors based overseas.
Frequency: Twice per year. Jamie Hopkins

4. Bank and Industry 
Conferences
The Executive Directors and 
Senior Management team 
regularly attend and present at 
Real Estate conferences held by 
banks and industry bodies, e.g. 
EPRA, in the UK, Europe and US.
Why they are important: 
Conferences provide a good 
opportunity to meet a large 
number of investors and industry 
associates in one place. They 
often include presentations on 
industry trends and allow the 
Executive Directors to build 
relationships with key players in 
the sector, and demonstrate the 
strength and depth of the 
management team. Additionally, 
they often provide an opportunity 
to hold one-on-one and group 
meetings with investors outside 
of the formal roadshow schedule.
Frequency: Nine conferences 
attended this year.
5. Investor Tours
Tours of the Group’s assets are 
organised regularly, both 
proactively and on request, for 
existing and prospective investors. 
These are carried out by the 
Executive Directors and the Head 
of Corporate Communications, 
with Asset Managers, Centre 
Managers and other team 
members often present. 
Why they are important: The 
tours showcase the properties 
within the portfolio and 
demonstrate the operational 
model Workspace has adopted, 
as well as the high levels of 
activity ongoing across the 
Group. They allow investors to 
see the space being used by 
customers and demonstrate 
the business model in action.
Frequency: 19 tours conducted 
per year.
6. The Annual General Meeting 
The Annual General Meeting 
(‘AGM’) takes place at the 
Company Head Office and 
is attended by the full Board 
of Directors. Details of the 
resolutions to be proposed at 
the Annual General Meeting 
on 14 July 2017 can be found 
in the Notice of Annual General 
Meeting which is available at 
www.workspace.co.uk, and will 
be dispatched to shareholders 
who have requested a hard copy 
of the documentation from the 
Company. All shareholders are 
invited to vote on the Resolutions 
and the results are made available 
after the meeting and published 
on our investor website.
Why it is important: The AGM 
provides shareholders with a 
forum to put questions to the 
Board of Directors, and to vote 
on important issues within the 
business.
Frequency: Once a year.
7. Capital Markets Day
The Capital Markets Day is held 
once a year and includes either 
a tour of the Group’s properties 
or management presentations. 
The Executive Directors are all 
present, as well as a group of 
Centre Managers and other 
members of the management 
team.
Why it is important: As well 
as showcasing the Group’s 
properties, the Capital Markets 
Day allows Workspace to educate 
analysts and investors on 
different aspects of the business 
and demonstrate how it is driving 
value and growth from its real 
estate and customer proposition. 
Positive feedback was received 
from the Capital Markets Day in 
February 2017, with attendees 
commenting that the deep dive 
into Workspace’s technology 
proposition was of particular 
interest and helped them to 
understand the impact technology 
has, and will continue to have, on 
the Real Estate sector.
Frequency: Once a year.

Succession planning
Depth of experience and knowledge 
of the business underscores the 
Board’s effectiveness.
During the year, the Committee continued to focus on succession 
planning for both Executive and Non-Executive Directors. In doing so, it 
considered the tenure, mix and diversity of skills and experience of 
existing Board members and those required of prospective Board 
members in the context of the Group’s medium and long-term strategy. 
In doing so, the Committee agreed that as a general principle, new 
Non-Executive Directors would join the Board two years prior to 
existing members reaching the end of their relevant term. This will 
provide for newer Board members to become fully established in their 
role, whilst ensuring that plans are in place for the Board to secure the 
orderly and progressive refreshing of its membership. 
The Nomination Committee will continue to take a keen interest in 
succession planning, which includes the Executive Directors, the 
Executive Committee and Senior Management roles across the 
business.

82 Workspace Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Dear Shareholder
Welcome to the report of the Nomination Committee for the year 
ended 31 March 2017. Whilst there have been no changes to the Board 
during the financial year, the Nomination Committee has continued to 
support the Board during the year, in ensuring its composition has the 
right balance of skills, experience, independence and knowledge to 
best service the business and fulfil the Board’s responsibility to 
shareholders. 
Succession planning
An ongoing area of focus for the Committee is succession planning. 
As Chairman of both the Committee and the Company, I am acutely 
aware of the need to ensure that there are no gaps in the skills or 
experience as members of the Board reach the end of their relevant 
terms. This was discussed by the Nomination Committee during the 
year and the conclusions reached are summarised on page 82.
Skills and knowledge of the Board
A key responsibility of the Committee is to ensure that the Board 
maintains a balance of skills, knowledge and experience appropriate 
to the operation of the business and required to deliver the strategy. 
As in past years, the Committee has reviewed the composition of the 
Board and as part of this review the Committee considered: 
 – The size of the Board and whether it is of a sufficient size that the 
requirements of the business can be met;
 – Its independence and whether it has the right balance of 
independent and Non-Executive Directors and Executive Directors;
 – Whether Non-Executive Directors are able to commit sufficient 
time to the Company in order to discharge their responsibilities 
effectively; and
 – The mix of skills, experience and diversity.
Following the review, the Committee is satisfied that the Board 
continues to have an appropriate mix of skills and experience to 
operate effectively.
In addition, the Directors collectively have many years of experience, 
all gained from a broad range of businesses. They collectively bring a 
range of expertise and knowledge of different business sectors to 
Board deliberations, which encourage constructive and challenging 
debate around the Boardroom table. 
The Board experience by sector is illustrated below. Further 
information on the biographies of the Directors can be found on 
pages 54 and 55.
Role of the Committee
The Nomination Committee considers the structure, size and 
composition of the Board, advising on succession planning and 
making appropriate recommendations to ensure that the Board 
retains an appropriate mix of skills, experience and knowledge in 
line with our strategy. It is also responsible for reviewing the Group’s 
senior leadership needs.

Stephen Hubbard in the year, as his three-year appointment is due to 
expire on 16 July 2017. Stephen was not present during the 
Committee’s discussion. Having conducted its review, the Committee 
was satisfied that it was appropriate to recommend to the Board that 
Stephen’s appointment should be extended for a further three years, 
subject to re-election by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting 
on 14 July 2017.
In accordance with the Code, all Directors wishing to continue in 
office will retire and offer themselves for re-election by shareholders 
at the 2017 Annual General Meeting.

Diversity 
The Board’s policy on diversity is that selection should be based on 
the best person for the role and to ensure that its composition has an 
appropriate balance of skills and diversity to meet the requirements 
of the business. The Board considers that quotas are not appropriate 
in determining its composition, and has therefore chosen not to set 
targets. The benefits of diversity, including gender diversity, will 
continue to be an active consideration whenever changes to the 
Board’s composition are contemplated. 
The Committee has noted the recommendations in the Hampton-
Alexander Review for a new voluntary target of a third of all Board 
members in FTSE 350 companies to be women by 2020. Ultimately, 
our recruitment decisions, at all levels, are driven by the need to 
ensure the longer-term success of the Company, by appointing the 
person that most closely matches the requirements for the position, 
regardless of their background or gender.
Further details on diversity can be found on page 28. Gender 
diversity of the Board and Company is set out on the page 84.
Corporate Governance
During the year, the Committee also reviewed and agreed Terms of 
Reference for the Nomination Committee. There were no significant 
changes made to the existing Terms of Reference. These can be 
found on our website at www.workspace.co.uk. 
Non-Executive appointments and time commitments
In making recommendations to the Board on Non-Executive Director 
appointments, the Nomination Committee will consider the expected 
time commitment of the proposed Non-Executive Director, and other 
commitments they already have to ensure that they have sufficient 
time available to devote to the Company.
Prior to accepting any additional commitments, Non-Executive 
Directors will, in the first instance, discuss these with the Company 
Chairman. Agreement of the Board is then required to ensure that any 
conflicts of interest are identified and that they will continue to have 
sufficient time available to devote to the Company. 
Independence and re-election to the Board
The composition of the Board is reviewed annually by the Nomination 
Committee to ensure that there is an effective balance of skills, 
experience and knowledge.
Non-Executive Chairman’s performance review
Dear Shareholder 
Daniel Kitchen was appointed to the Board in June 2011, and 
subsequently assumed the role of Chairman at the AGM in July 2011. 
Consequently, Daniel will complete his six-year term in June 2017. 
Daniel has indicated his willingness to serve another term as 
Chairman. Whilst there are no specific requirements about the 
tenure of the Chairman, consistent with the spirit of the Code and 
best practice, it was agreed that it would be prudent to review 
whether Daniel’s tenure on the Board continues to be effective. As 
the Senior Independent Director, the Board asked me to lead this 
process.
 
As part of the review of the Chairman, I met with each Board 
member individually to discuss Daniel’s performance as Chairman. 
From those discussions, it became very clear that there was 
unanimous support for Daniel given his leadership style and the 
depth of industry knowledge.
On that basis, we support Daniel Kitchen seeking re-election as 
Chairman of the Company at the AGM in July 2017.

recommended to the Board that 
following the resignation of PwC 
after the completion of the March 
2017 year end audit as a result of 
mandatory firm rotation, KPMG be

AGM. The Board accepted the 
recommendation.
Audit Committee activities in 2016/17
86 Workspace Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Dear Shareholder
On behalf of the Audit Committee, I am pleased to present its report 
for the financial year ended 31 March 2017. 
The Audit Committee met three times during the year. Attendance at 
these meetings is shown in the table on page 71. To ensure 
compliance with the Code, the Committee’s membership is limited to 
Independent Non-Executive Directors of the Company. 
The right skills
The Board is satisfied that I have the appropriate level of relevant 
financial and accounting experience required by the provisions of the 
Code, to perform the role of Chairman of the Audit Committee, 
having previously held Chief Financial Officer positions in public 
companies. I am also a Chartered Accountant and I continue to chair 
the Audit Committee for another public limited company.
The Audit Committee collectively has the skills and experience 
required to fully discharge its duties. The Committee is authorised by 
the Board to seek any information necessary to fulfil its duties to 
obtain independent legal, accounting or other professional advice, at 
the Company’s expense, which might be necessary for the fulfilment 
of its duties.
External Auditor
As reported in last year’s Audit Committee Report, the Committee has 
undertaken a full tender of the Company’s external audit contract. 
I chaired the selection Sub-Committee, and following the outcome of 
the process in January 2017, I am pleased to report that the Board 
approved the appointment of KPMG LLP (‘KPMG’) as the Company’s 
External Auditor for the coming financial year. This appointment 
remains subject to approval by shareholders at the AGM on 14 July 
2017.
Further details on the process we adopted can be found on page 92.
Review of material issues
During the year under review, the Committee has continued to review 
and report to the Board on the Group’s financial and narrative 
reporting, internal control and risk management processes. 
The Audit Committee has a key role in reviewing the narrative 
reporting and ensuring the financial statements provide a true and 
fair view of the Group’s financial affairs. As part of this review process, 
we considered the significant financial judgements made during the 
year along with other key financial reporting issues. In this context, we 
considered the following two significant issues for which further detail 
is provided on page 90:
 – Valuation of the investment portfolio.
 – Compliance with the REIT regime.
During the year, we also considered, as we do on a regular basis, the 
potential for fraud in revenue recognition, scope for management 
override of controls and compliance with regulations. 
A description of the main activities and information on the other 
significant issues that the Committee considered during the year can 
be found on page 90.
Role of the Committee 
The Committee is responsible for overseeing internal risk 
management and effective internal controls, financial reporting and 
appropriate external audit arrangements.

Meetings
Meetings of the Audit Committee coincide with key dates in the 
financial reporting and audit cycle. During the year, the Committee 
met on three occasions to discharge its responsibilities. 
We also have in attendance at meetings, by invitation of the 
Committee, those people and advisors listed below:

The Committee Chairman reports the outcome of meetings to the 
Board. 
The Committee has a rolling agenda that ensures it gives thorough 
consideration to matters of particular importance to the Company, 
identifying key areas of focus and emerging topics as appropriate. 
The Committee receives appropriate information far enough in 
advance to enable it to fulfil its responsibilities. This includes not only 
information from management but also detailed reports from the 
External Auditor.
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report. At the 
request of the Board, the Committee also advises and recommends 
to the Board whether the Annual Report and Accounts, taken as a 
whole, is ‘fair, balanced and understandable’ and provides the 
information necessary for shareholders to assess the Company’s 
performance, business model and strategy. 
Based on its review of the relevant evidence, the Committee was 
satisfied that the Annual Report and Accounts was fair, balanced and 
understandable and provided its recommendation to the Board. The 
Board’s statement on the Annual Report and Accounts is set out in 
the Statement of Directors’ responsibilities on page 120.
Risk Management 
The principal business risks facing the Company, which have been 
subject to robust assessment by the Board, are set out on pages 32 to 
39, and the ongoing review and monitoring of the Group’s risk 
management and internal control systems are described on page 93.
The Audit Committee and the Board have continued to assess the 
long-term viability of the Company as required by the Code. Further 
information can be found on page 91 and our Viability Statement is 
located on page 40.
Audit Committee evaluation
As a Committee we are continually looking at opportunities to 
improve our effectiveness and better understand the risks and 
opportunities of the markets in which the Group operates. The 
Committee conducted an evaluation of its performance, facilitated by 
the Company Secretary. The topics covered in the review focused on 
the core business model and risks, the skills and experience of the 
Audit Committee members, independence of the External Auditors 
and the quality of interaction with them. The results of the review 
were then discussed at the meeting held in May 2017. The outcome of 
this review was positive and the Committee did not identify any 
material weaknesses in its effectiveness or operations. Accordingly, it 
was concluded that, consistent with the Code and its own terms of 
reference, the Audit Committee is discharging its obligations in an 
effective manner. 
 
Meetings with the External Auditor
I meet regularly with both the Company’s External Auditor, and the 
Chief Financial Officer, to discuss key issues relevant to the 
Committee’s work. Ensuring these lines of communication are open 
and working well is vital to the success of the Committee in carrying 
out its work.
The External Auditor has the opportunity to meet with the Audit 
Committee, without any Executive Directors present, whenever 
necessary and the Audit Committee ensures that this happens at 
least once a year, in order to receive feedback from them on matters 
such as the quality of interaction with management.
Governance
In order to ensure ongoing compliance with regulatory developments, 
the Committee’s Terms of Reference are reviewed annually. Whilst the 
Terms of Reference were reviewed during the year, no significant 
changes were made and they are available on the Company’s website 
at www.workspace.co.uk.
In the year ahead we plan to continue to ensure that the Group’s risk 
management and internal controls remain robust and to help secure 
the long-term success of the Company.
I would also like to thank PwC for the high quality of the audit services 
they have provided to the Company over many years.

The table below summarises the agenda items covered at the Committee’s meetings during 
this period:
Overview Our Governance Strategic Report Financial Statements Additional Information
89 Workspace Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Matter considered Action taken by the Committee
Valuation of the investment 
property portfolio
The valuation of the investment property portfolio is inherently subjective, requiring significant 
judgement. The outcome is significant for the Group in terms of its investment decisions, results and 
remuneration.
The valuation is conducted externally by independent valuers. The valuers presented the year-end 
valuation to the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee reviewed the methodology and outcomes of 
the valuation, challenging the key assumptions and judgements. In particular, the valuation of Uplands 
Business Park, was discussed in light of its sale at a premium to book value post year end. The 
justification for the year end value was considered to be reasonable. The objectivity and independence 
of the valuers is monitored by the Audit Committee. PwC also met with the valuers and presented their 
views on the valuation to the Committee, as well as an explanation for how the valuation is audited. 
Based on the above, the Committee was satisfied that the methodology, assumptions and judgements 
used by the valuers were appropriate and that the valuations were suitable for inclusion in the financial 
statements.
Compliance with the REIT 
regime
As a Real Estate Investment Trust (‘REIT’), Workspace must comply with specific rules so as to benefit 
from the tax exempt status on its property rental income. These rules are complex and the tax exempt 
status has a significant impact on the Group’s business and financial statements. Management monitor 
REIT compliance on an ongoing basis.
As at 31 March 2016, the Group recorded other income of £24.1m relating to the performance fee due at 
the end of the five-year term of the BlackRock JV. Recognition of this fee caused the Group to fail the 
75% Balance of Business test for the prior year. Two consecutive breaches are required for the Group to 
incur a minor breach. There has been no further breach in the current year and there is no reason to 
expect that any further breaches will occur and so any impact on the Group’s tax exempt status is not 
expected.
Significant issues  
considered by  
the Committee
The Audit Committee considers all financial information published in the annual and half year 
financial statements and considers accounting policies adopted by the Group, presentation 
and disclosure of the financial information and, in particular, the key judgements made by 
management in preparing the financial statements.
The Audit Committee pays particular attention to matters it considers to be important by 
virtue of their impact on the Group’s results, or the level of complexity, judgement or 
estimation involved in their application on the consolidated financial statements. The main 
areas of focus during the year are set out below:
In addition, the Audit Committee has considered a number of other judgements which have been made 
by management, none of which had a significant impact on the Group results.

Developing a robust Viability Statement
In continued development of the Group’s Viability Statement, existing 
processes were strengthened to ensure risks were identified, 
understood and reassessed over the period. The following factors 
were considered:
 – The Group’s current financial and operational position and the 
current economic outlook.
 – The Group’s cash flows, financing headroom and financial ratios.
 – Reassessment of key risks and their potential impact on the 
business model. 
The process we undertook
Stage 1 Stage 2 Stage 3 Stage 4
Risk identification
We reviewed both strategic and 
operational risks to identify the 
principal risks to viability over the 
period under consideration. We 
considered the risks that would 
impact solvency and liquidity 
either individually or in 
combination with other risks.
Risk assessment
For each risk, we considered:
 – Our risk appetite (the level of 
risk the Board is willing to 
take).
 – The controls in place to 
mitigate the risk.
 – The quantum of risk.
Scenario modelling analysis
For those risks identified as 
being severe enough to impact 
the viability of the Group, we 
performed sensitivity analysis to 
understand the potential impact 
on liquidity and financial ratios.
Conclusions
The Board was presented with 
the findings from this analysis 
and given the opportunity to 
question the process and 
findings.

Firms invited to tender
Two firms were short listed and invited to tender. They were each 
asked to prepare a detailed proposal document which included:
 – Their approach to ensuring overall audit quality.
 – Background and experience of the firm, lead partner and team.
 – Their approach to managing the audit including matters of 
judgement, new and arising audit topics and the transition to a new 
audit team.
As part of the tender process, the firms were invited to a series of 
meetings with Senior Managers of Workspace.
Selection of the new External Auditor 
Following a detailed review of the tender documents submitted by 
each of the audit firms and their presentations and taking into 
account views of colleagues who had met with each audit firm, the 
selection Sub-Committee identified KPMG as the proposed new 
External Auditor.
The Audit Committee recommended to the Board that following the 
resignation of PwC after the completion of the March 2017 year end 
audit, KPMG be appointed by the Board as External Auditor, subject 
to shareholder approval at the 2017 AGM. The Board accepted the 
recommendation.
The Company intends to put the external audit out to tender every 
10 years in the future. 
As KPMG will be appointed after the 2016/17 financial year, a full 
effectiveness review will be conducted later in 2018, following 
completion of its first full audit cycle.
Internal audit
Due to its size and structure, the Group does not have an internal 
audit function, a matter which is kept under review by the Audit 
Committee. However, management mandates a programme of 
financial, operational and health and safety internal audits at its 
properties. These are carried out by qualified senior Head Office 
personnel on a rotational basis. All findings are reported to the Risk 
Committee with any significant findings reported to the Audit 
Committee.
Audit fees
Details of audit and non-audit fees paid to PwC can be found in 
note 2 on page 134.
Effectiveness of the External Auditor 
Annually, the Committee assess the qualifications, expertise, 
resources, and independence of the Group’s External Auditors, as well 
as the effectiveness of the audit process. It does this through 
discussion with the Chief Financial Officer and confirmations from the 
External Auditor.
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP has confirmed to the Committee that:
 – The audit of the consolidated financial statements is undertaken in 
accordance with the UK Firm’s internal policies and procedures to 
ensure the objectivity of their audit report.
 – They have internal procedures in place to identify any aspects of 
non-audit work which could compromise their role as auditors and 
to ensure the objectivity of their audit report.
 – They believe that, in their professional judgement, the safeguards 
they have in place sufficiently guard against the threats to 
independence. Consequently, PwC consider that they have 
maintained their auditor independence throughout the year.
The Committee are satisfied that the Auditors are independent and 
that the audit process is effective.
External audit tender
PwC has been Workspace’s auditor since 1988. In last year’s Annual 
Report the Company stated that in order to maintain good governance, 
it would be placing the external audit out to tender as a result of 
mandatory firm rotation, with an audit rotation for the following year 
ending 31 March 2018. The Audit Committee recommended that a 
tender process would be undertaken during the year under review. The 
Committee decided that PwC would not be included in the process in 
the interest of best practice.
Audit tender timetable
2016
November: The Audit Committee resolved to appoint a selection 
Sub-Committee which was authorised to carry out the tender 
process and to make its recommendations to the Audit Committee 
and Group Board. The Sub-Committee comprised of Chris Girling, 
Chairman of the Audit Committee, Graham Clemett, Chief Financial 
Officer and Vivienne Frankham, Head of Finance. 
November: Meetings held between management and Sub-
Committee members to decide on firms to be approached and 
asked to tender.
November: Meeting between management and Sub-Committee 
members and audit firms to determine their capabilities and fit with 
the Company.
November: Agreement of short list of audit firms by the selection 
Sub-Committee. Confirmation of participation by audit firms.
December: Issue of tender documents and supporting information 
to the participating firms. A series of management meetings were 
held with the short list of firms and site visits were also undertaken.
2017
January: Receipt and review of tender documents by the Sub-
Committee.
January: Presentations were made to the selection Sub-Committee 
from each of the prospective firms.
January: Recommendation for the appointment of the new auditor 
at the next AGM was made to the Audit Committee and the Board 
for approval.
April: Induction period commenced with KPMG shadowing PwC 
during the 2017 year end process.
Selection Criteria and timetable
A proposed timetable for the tender process was agreed. Key factors 
in determining the timetable were the ability to identify a new 
External Auditor in time to allow the successful firm to shadow PwC 
during the year end process.
A number of firms were considered, including both from large and 
small firms. The selection Sub-Committee then prepared a list of key 
selection criteria and decided which firms would be invited to 
participate in the tender process. 
The key selection criteria included:
 – Quality and cultural fit of the lead partner and key members of 
their team; 
 – Approach to client services and quality of the audit; 
 – Audit approach and experience of the real estate sector; 
 – Technical expertise and a pragmatic, commercial approach to 
resolving issues;
 – Independence of the audit firm; and
 – Proposed audit transition plans. Overview Our Governance Strategic Report Financial Statements Additional Information
93 Workspace Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017
A familiarity threat
This is where, because of a too long or too close a relationship, the 
External Auditor’s independence is affected.
 – The Audit Committee will prohibit the hiring of former employees 
of the External Auditor associated with the Group’s audit into 
management roles with significant influence within the Group 
within two years following their association with the audit, unless 
the Chairman of the Audit Committee gives prior consent. 
Annually, the Audit Committee will be advised of any new hires 
caught by this policy. However, there have been no instances of 
this occurring. 
 – The Audit Committee will monitor on an ongoing basis the 
relationship with the External Auditors, to ensure their continuing 
independence, objectivity and effectiveness by reviewing their 
tenure, quality and fees. 
Management threat
This occurs when the audit firm performs non-audit services and 
management make judgements based on that work.
 – The Group will not use PwC for any services which would be 
considered management responsibility.
Risk management and internal control
The Audit Committee has a key role in ensuring appropriate 
governance and challenge around risk management. It also sets the 
tone and culture within the organisation regarding risk management 
and internal control.
Key elements of the Group’s system of internal control include:
 – a comprehensive system of financial reporting.
 – an organisational and management Board structure with clearly 
defined levels of authority and division of responsibilities.
 – a Risk Committee, which is chaired by the Chief Executive Officer 
and is attended by representatives from Senior Management and 
operational staff. 
The Risk Committee formally reports to the Audit Committee at least 
twice a year on strategic and key operational risks, emerging issues 
and any internal control review work undertaken.
The Group aims to continuously strengthen its risk management 
processes with the involvement of the Audit Committee to ensure 
these processes are embedded throughout the organisation. The 
Audit Committee has reviewed the Group’s system of controls 
including financial, operational, compliance and risk management 
during the year with no significant failings or weaknesses identified. 
However, any such system can only provide reasonable and not 
absolute assurance against any material misstatement or loss.
Further information on the Group’s risks is detailed on pages 32 to 39.
Whistleblowing
The Group has a ‘whistleblowing procedure’ by which employees may 
report suspicion of fraud, financial irregularity or other malpractice. 
There is also a process in place for staff to report operational risks 
and issues to the Risk Committee.
Code of Conduct
The Group has a Code of Conduct which explains how employees are 
expected to fulfil their responsibilities by acting in the best interests of 
the Group. This includes compliance with laws and regulations; acting 
fairly in dealing with customers, suppliers and other stakeholders; 
treating people with respect and operating within a control framework. 
Chris Girling
Chairman of the Audit Committee
6 June 2017
Non-audit services
The Audit Committee terms of reference establish a process for 
monitoring and approving the nature and the level of related fees for 
non-audit services (e.g. accounting, tax or due diligence work) paid to 
the Group External Auditors.
The Group uses the External Auditor for relevant financial work for a 
variety of reasons, including their knowledge of the Group and 
understanding of our sector, the audit-related nature of the work and 
the need to maintain confidentiality.
At each meeting, the Audit Committee is advised of any significant 
non-audit work awarded to the External Auditor since the previous 
meeting and the related fees. At the annual May meeting, the Audit 
Committee receive a report of fees, both audit and non-audit, from 
PwC for the past financial year. The Committee has considered in 
detail the nature and level of non-audit services provided by PwC and 
the related fees. The Committee may challenge and in some instances 
refuse proposals in respect of non-audit work to be performed by the 
External Auditor.
The Audit Committee considered a formal policy specifying the types 
of non-audit service for which use of the external auditor is pre-
approved. This is in response to the ‘Guidance on Audit Committees’ 
issued by the Financial Reporting Council (‘FRC’) in April 2016. 
Consequently, it was agreed that all non-audit work and fees would 
be reported to the Audit Committee.
In addition, the Audit Committee will assess the threats of self-review 
by the external auditors, self-interest, advocacy, familiarity and 
management. These are set out below and considered in relation to 
PwC’s services:
A self-review threat
This is where, in providing a service, the PwC audit team could 
potentially evaluate the results of a previous PwC service.
The Audit Committee specifically will not allow the auditors to:
 – Provide accounting or book-keeping services.
 – Prepare financial statement disclosure items.
A self-interest threat
Where a financial or other interest (of an individual or PwC) will 
inappropriately influence an individual’s judgement or behaviour.
The Audit Committee will specifically perform the following:
 – If the External Auditor is to be considered for the provision of 
non-audit services, their scope of work and fees must be approved 
in advance by the Chief Financial Officer, the Committee Secretary 
and the Chairman of the Audit Committee. For larger assignments 
in excess of £100,000 this would involve a competitive tender 
process, unless there are compelling commercial or timescale 
reasons to use the External Auditor or another specific 
accountancy firm.
 – It does not accept significant contingent fee arrangements with 
the External Auditors.
An advocacy threat
This is where PwC or PwC personnel promote an audit client’s 
position to the extent where PwC’s objectivity as auditor is 
compromised.
 – The Group will not use PwC in an advocacy role. Corporate governance report

the year under review. Attendance by individual Committee 
members at meetings is detailed on page 71.
During the year, the Committee sought internal support from the 
CEO and CFO whose attendance at Committee meetings was by 
invitation from the Chairman, to advise on specific questions raised 
by the Committee and on matters relating to the performance and 
remuneration of Senior Managers. The Company Secretary 
attended each meeting as Secretary to the Committee. No Director 
was present for any discussions that related directly to their own 
remuneration.

Letter from the Chairman of the 
Remuneration Committee
Dear Shareholders
A very active year
This last year has been one of considerable activity for the Workspace 
Remuneration Committee. Our revised Policy is being presented for 
Shareholder approval at the July 2017 AGM as the Policy approved by 
Shareholders in July 2014 will have reached the end of its three-year 
approval period. This current Policy has operated effectively and 
provided rewarding alignment between the Executive Directors and 
our Shareholders. However, as the Company has grown considerably 
over these three years and as we continuously aim to be fully up to 
date with regulatory developments, we have conducted a 
comprehensive review of our Remuneration Policy over the past year 
to ensure that the Policy will continue to be closely linked to the 
strategic priorities of the business.
I will cover the key elements of the proposed new Policy later in this 
letter but first of all, I would like to outline the key remuneration 
themes. 
Ethos
The Committee considers its main objective is to help promote the 
long-term success of the Company, by:
 – Supporting an effective pay for performance culture which allows 
us to retain, motivate and attract highly skilled executives, who 
have a clear purpose and the necessary calibre to execute the 
Company’s strategy of driving both strong growth and financial 
returns for our Shareholders. 
 – Achieving a strong alignment between Executive and Shareholder 
interests when deciding on executive remuneration. The 
Committee receives a report setting out the remuneration levels, 
proposed discretionary bonus and LTIP awards for Senior 
Managers.
 – Promoting a long-term ownership culture by encouraging the 
acquisition and retention of shares amongst the Executive 
Directors and members of the Executive Committee.
 – Keeping in touch with all regulatory debates and developments 
and with wider stakeholder views, including with Government 
pronouncements on remuneration, as well as with our external 
advisers to ensure that we are totally au fait with the constantly 
changing regulatory environment.
We have worked hard as a Committee to ensure that our new 
Remuneration Policy, outlined below, supports our ethos so that 
rewards are in line with the Company’s fundamental aims and 
principles.
On the following pages we set out:
 – the Annual Report on Remuneration (pages 106 to 115), which 
includes this letter and which will be subject to an advisory vote at 
our AGM on 14 July 2017; and
 – our revised Remuneration Policy (pages 100 and 105), which we 
will be asking you to formally approve at the AGM.
A new simplified Remuneration 
Policy provides the framework 
to appropriately incentivise our 
high-calibre executive team to 
continue to drive Company 
success and market-leading 
returns for our shareholders. 
Maria Moloney
Chairman of the 
Remuneration Committee 96 Workspace Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Reward philosophy tied to business strategy
Our key objective is to achieve an appropriate balance between fixed 
and variable remuneration based on short and long-term 
performance criteria which are tied to the strategy and risk appetite 
of the Company.
Each year we set a range of stretching core performance metrics 
aligned to our strategic priorities. A view of the overall performance is 
taken by looking at the delivery of individual performance objectives.
As well as the annual performance measures outlined on page 103 
the remaining measures in the annual and long-term incentive plan 
(page 110) are also tied to the Company’s strategic approach. In this 
way, rewards are achieved by successful delivery of the short and 
long-term objectives which deliver strong returns and value for our 
Shareholders. 
2016/17 Continued robust performance
Once again, the business has delivered a very solid operational and 
financial performance, with our results meeting and exceeding 
expectations across many of our KPIs.
 – Despite a challenging macro environment, the differential 
advantages of our successful business model have allowed us to, 
once again, capture the strong demand for high-quality, managed 
office space. 
 – The business out performed against the profit, total return and 
customer satisfaction measures under the annual bonus as outlined 
on page 108. This has resulted in bonuses paying out at 120% of 
salary for both Executive Directors. 33% of the bonus will be 
deferred into shares for three years.
 – We have delivered trading profit after interest of £50.7m, with the 
Board approving a 40% increase in the final dividend this year as a 
result. 
 – Over the LTIP performance period, Workspace Absolute Total 
Shareholder Return has been 13.2% p.a, which is once again, one of 
the highest among London office players. Please see the TSR chart 
below. 
 – For the 2014 LTIP, we achieved performance above upper quartile 
against both relative TSR and relative NAV, resulting in maximum 
payouts under these measures and an overall vesting level of 88.7% 
of maximum.

2017-2020 The proposed Remuneration Policy
I outline below the outcome of our work on the proposed new DRR, 
which has included an extensive Shareholder consultation covering 
over 70% of the share register and their representative bodies. I would 
like to thank those who provided feedback to the Committee. 
The full details of the proposed changes are set out on pages 100 to 
106. We have again included an ‘at a glance’ summary which includes 
remuneration in respect of 2016/17 (see page 98) and the proposed 
implementation of Policy in 2017/18 (see page 99). We have also 
provided an overview of the wider context of remuneration on 
page 107.
In the proposed new Remuneration Policy, there will be no changes to 
the overall quantum of reward. We are, however, proposing the 
following changes to the Policy to simplify and align it with best 
practice.
Simplification/clarity/transparency
We are proposing to:
 – Simplify our long-term incentives by removing the matching plan 
so that under the new Policy, only an annual bonus and a single 
Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) are operated.
 – Remove the link between the annual bonus and the long-term 
incentive by removing the matching/co-investment element.
 – Maintain incentive maximums at current levels. The annual bonus 
will remain at a maximum of 120% of salary and the LTIP maximum 
opportunity will be 200% of salary (previously 100% of salary 
Performance Shares plus 100% of salary Matching Shares).
Alignment with shareholder best practice
 – Shareholding guidelines will be increased from 150% of salary to 
200% of salary.
 – The holding period on the LTIP will be increased from one to two 
years.
 – The time period during which malus and clawback provisions can 
be applied will be increased under both the annual bonus and the 
LTIP, as you will see in the ‘at a glance’ section on page 99.
 – Bonus deferral will be increased from 25% to 33% of the total 
bonus.
 – The Remuneration Committee is aware of Shareholder concerns 
regarding Executive Director pension provisions. As a result, the 
Committee considered it appropriate to remove the exceptional 
maximum which formed part of the existing Policy and instead 
agreed to maintain a maximum pension provision of 16.5% p.a. in 
the new Policy.
Performance alignment 
 – No changes are proposed to the performance measures used for 
the annual bonus as we are happy that the current measures are 
providing a good balance of rewarding the operational excellence 
achieved over recent years, together with the strengthened 
customer relationships and deep market knowledge, all of which 
are foundations for our future growth.
 – The structure will be simplified by removing the multiplier and 
switching to an additive approach.
 – For the LTIP, we have introduced a combination of Total 
Shareholder Return (‘TSR’) and Total Property Return (‘TPR’), a 
balance which underlines our strategy of driving income growth 
and enhancing Shareholder value over the long term. 
 – We have extended the underpin for the LTIP.
In conclusion
Another very successful year and a Remuneration Policy fit for the 
future and for the continued long-term sustainability of the business.
As a Committee, we always aim to make the Remuneration Report as 
clear, concise and straightforward as possible. We were pleased that 
the 2015/16 Remuneration Report, received 99.28% support from 
Shareholders at the AGM last year. 
The Committee takes our duty to Shareholders extremely seriously 
and continues to encourage an open and constructive dialogue with 
Shareholders and their representative bodies. We will consult with 
major Shareholders on any material changes to the Remuneration 
Policy or how it is implemented. 
The Board and the Committee are fully aware that performance and 
value for Shareholders do not come from remuneration alone. 
However, as part of good corporate governance, it forms an integral 
part of our ethos to support the corporate drive of our strong 
leadership team and the success of our focused business model. 
As such, we recommend the revised Policy to Shareholders.

Directors’ Remuneration Policy
This section sets out the Director’s Remuneration Policy. A binding Shareholder resolution to approve this section will be proposed at the 2017 
Annual General Meeting (‘AGM’) of the Company on 14 July 2017. The Policy will be effective from the 2017 AGM subject to Shareholder approval 
and will be available to view at www.workspace.co.uk/investors in the corporate governance section.
Summary of Policy design changes 
The main structural changes to the Remuneration Policy, from the previous Policy approved by Shareholders at the 2014 AGM, and as described in 
the Chairman’s letter, are as follows:
Simplification Shareholder alignment Performance alignment
 – We are proposing to remove the matching/
co-investment element of our incentive 
structure. 
 – We will operate only an annual bonus and 
a single Long-Term Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’). 
 – There will be no increase to the total 
incentive opportunity:
 – The annual bonus opportunity will remain 
at a maximum of 120% of salary.
 – The usual LTIP opportunity will be a 
maximum of 200% of salary (previously 
100% of salary performance shares plus 
100% of salary matching shares). The 
exceptional maximum limit will remain 
unchanged.
 – The maximum pension provision will remain 
unchanged at 16.5% p.a. and the ability to 
provide a higher provision in exceptional 
circumstances is being removed.
 – The deferral of any bonus earned has been 
increased to 33% of the bonus earned from 
25% of bonus earned. There is no change to 
the three-year deferral period. 
 – Holding period on LTIP increased from one 
year to two years and applies to all shares 
vesting. 
 – Shareholding guidelines have been 
increased to 200% of salary from 150% of 
salary for all Executive Directors.
 – Extending the time period over which malus 
and clawback provisions can be applied to 
the end of the deferral period for the annual 
bonus and to the end of the holding period 
for the LTIP. 
 – This means that malus/clawback extends to 
three years for the whole of the annual 
bonus and two years from vesting for the 
LTIP (previously only one year for annual 
bonus and LTIP). 
 – The changes to performance measures for 
the 2017 LTIP award and 2017/18 annual 
bonus are as follows:
 – Annual bonus – Removing the personal 
performance multiplier and moving to a 
simpler additive approach.
 – LTIP – Performance measures based on 
Total Shareholder Return (TSR) and Total 
Property Return (TPR).
 – LTIP – Extension of underpin to apply to 
both elements (previously TSR only).
 – Dividend equivalents may be accrued on 
awards under the deferred bonus plan and 
LTIP.
Consideration of Shareholder views
The Committee is committed to ongoing dialogue with Shareholders and welcomes feedback on Directors’ remuneration. As part of the Policy 
review the Committee consulted with major Shareholders and investor bodies. In total we consulted with Shareholders who held, in aggregate, over 
70% of the Company’s issued share capital. The Committee was pleased with the support received. Overview Our Governance Strategic Report Financial Statements Additional Information

Remuneration Policy table
The table below describes the Policy in relation to the components of remuneration for Executive Directors.
Purpose and link to strategy Operation Maximum opportunity Performance metrics
Base salary
To reflect market value of the role and 
an individual’s experience, 
performance and contribution.
Salaries are normally reviewed 
annually.
Salary levels take account of:
 – The individual’s role, performance 
and experience.
 – Business performance and the 
external economic environment.
 – Salary levels for similar roles at 
relevant comparators.
 – Salary increases across the Group.
Base salary increases are applied in 
line with the outcome of the review. 
There is no prescribed maximum.
Salary increases for Executive 
Directors will typically be in line with 
those of the wider workforce. 
Increases may be above this level 
where the Committee considers it 
appropriate including (but not limited 
to) an increase in the scale, scope, 
market comparability or 
responsibilities of the role.
Where increases are awarded in 
excess of the wider employee 
population, the Committee will provide 
an explanation in the relevant year’s 
Annual Report on Remuneration.
Both Company and individual 
performance are considered when 
setting Executive Director base 
salaries.
Pension
To provide market competitive 
pensions.
Executives participate in a defined 
contribution pension scheme or may 
receive a cash allowance in lieu of 
pension contribution.
Up to 16.5% of salary. None
Benefits
To provide market competitive 
benefits.
Benefits typically include car 
allowance, private health insurance, 
and death in service cover. Where 
appropriate, other benefits may be 
offered including, but not limited to, 
allowances for relocation.
Executives are eligible to participate in 
all-employee share plans, currently 
SAYE and Share Incentive Plan, on the 
same basis as other employees.
Benefits may vary by role and 
individual circumstance, and are 
reviewed periodically. 
There is no overall maximum.
None
Annual bonus
To reinforce and reward delivery of 
annual strategic business priorities, 
based on performance measures 
relating to both Group and individual 
performance.
Bonus deferral provides alignment 
with Shareholder interests.
A portion of the annual bonus is 
deferred into shares, typically for a 
period of three years.
The minimum deferral is normally 33% 
of bonus earned.
Dividend equivalents may be accrued 
on deferred shares.
The Committee may apply malus and 
clawback in circumstances of gross 
misconduct, material misstatement of 
the Group’s results, or an error in 
calculation, up to the end of the 
deferral period.
The maximum bonus potential for 
Executive Directors is 120% of salary 
p.a.
The maximum opportunity is 
unchanged from the 2014 Policy.
Performance is measured relative to 
financial, operational, strategic and 
individual objectives in the year aligned 
with the Company’s strategic plan.
Performance measures and weightings 
are reviewed each year to ensure they 
remain appropriate and reinforce the 
business strategy. At least 60% of the 
total bonus will be based on financial 
measures.
Bonus awards are at the Committee’s 
discretion and the Committee will 
consider the Company’s performance 
in the round. The Committee may 
override the formulaic bonus outcome 
within the limits of the plan where it 
believes the outcome is not reflective 
of performance, to ensure fairness to 
both Shareholders and participants. 
The bonus pays out on a straight-line 
basis from threshold to 100% at 
maximum performance. Corporate governance report

LTIP
To reward and align to the delivery of 
sustained long-term sector 
outperformance and to align the 
interests of participants with those of 
Shareholders.
The Committee may grant annual 
awards of Performance Shares. 
Awards may be in the form of nominal 
or nil priced options or conditional 
shares, which normally vest after three 
years, subject to performance 
conditions. 
The performance period is usually 
three years and runs from the start of 
the financial year in which the awards 
are granted.
Vested shares are normally subject to 
a further two-year holding period. 
The Committee has discretion to apply 
malus and clawback to awards in 
circumstances of gross misconduct, 
material misstatement of the Group’s 
results, or an error in calculation, up to 
the end of the holding period.
Dividend equivalents may be accrued 
on shares in respect of the 
performance and holding period.
Normal maximum award of up to 
200% of salary per annum. 
An award of 300% of salary per 
annum may be made in exceptional 
circumstances.
The maximum opportunities are 
unchanged from the 2014 Policy.
Performance share plan awards will be 
based on a combination of financial, 
share price and strategic measures 
aligned with the Company’s strategic 
plan.
For 2017 awards the performance 
measures will be:
 – 50% Total Shareholder Return (TSR) 
relative to FTSE 350 property 
companies.
 – 50% Total Property Return (TPR) 
versus IPD.
A performance underpin will apply 
which allows the Committee to reduce 
vesting if performance is inconsistent 
with the overall performance of the 
business.
For threshold performance, vesting is 
typically 20% of maximum.
The Committee may, in the context of 
the underlying business strategy, use 
different measures and/or vary the 
weightings of the measures. The 
Committee would consult with major 
Shareholders prior to making any 
significant changes.
Shareholding guidelines
Shareholding guidelines of 200% of salary.
Legacy share awards
Payments can also be made to Executive Directors in respect of awards made prior to 14 July 2017 under the legacy LTIP plan which had both the Performance 
Share and Matching Share elements. These were the arrangements prior to the new LTIP.
The table below sets out the main elements for Non-Executive Directors’ remuneration:
Purpose and link to strategy Key structural changes Performance metrics
Fees
To reflect the time commitment in 
performing the duties and 
responsibilities of the role.
The Chairman receives an annual fee.
Non-Executive Directors receive an annual base fee. Additional fees 
are paid to Non-Executive Directors for additional responsibilities such 
as chairing a Board Committee.
Fees are reviewed from time to time, taking into account time 
commitment, responsibilities and fees paid by companies of a similar 
size and complexity.
Expenses incurred in the performance of non-executive duties for the 
Company may be reimbursed or paid for directly by the Company, 
including any tax due on the expenses. Non-Executive Directors do not 
normally receive any benefits, however these may be provided in the 
future if in the view of the Board this was considered appropriate.
Total fees paid to Non-Executive Directors will remain within the limit 
stated in the Articles of Association.

Notes to the Remuneration Policy table
Share awards will be operated in accordance with the rules of the 
relevant plan. In accordance with those rules, the Committee has 
discretion in the following areas:
 – In the event of a variation of share capital or a demerger, delisting, 
special dividend, rights issue or other similar event which may, in 
the Committee’s opinion, affect the current or future value of 
shares, the number of shares subject to an award and/or any 
performance condition attached to awards, may be adjusted. 
 – The Committee may determine that awards may be settled in cash.
 – The Committee may determine the basis on which dividends will be 
calculated which may include notional reinvestment.
The Committee may increase the time horizons for deferral or holding 
periods.
Performance measures and targets
As part of the review of the Policy, the Committee gave careful 
consideration to performance measures and targets for incentives to 
ensure that they are aligned to the Company’s strategy and to 
performance for our Shareholders. 
The annual bonus measures are intended to provide a good balance 
of rewarding operational excellence, customer relationships and 
building deep market knowledge which are the foundations of the 
Company’s future growth. 
For the LTIP, the performance measures for the 2017 award will be 
Total Shareholder Return performance against other FTSE 350 
property companies, and Total Property Return versus IPD. The 
Committee believes that the balance of the two measures selected is 
well aligned to the Company’s strategy of driving income growth and 
enhancing Shareholder value over the longer term, and continued 
out-performance for our Shareholders. The Committee considered it 
important to include an underpin based on underlying performance 
of the business.
 
The Committee may, in the context of the underlying business 
strategy, use different performance measures and/or vary the 
weightings of the measures. Major Shareholders would be consulted 
prior to any significant changes.
The Committee will set Group financial targets for the annual bonus 
with reference to the prior year and forward-looking business 
forecasts, ensuring the levels of performance required are 
appropriately challenging. The LTIP targets for the 2017 award will be 
based on threshold vesting for median performance and maximum 
vesting for upper quartile performance.
The measurement of performance against performance targets is at 
the Committee’s discretion, which may include appropriate 
adjustments to financial or non-financial elements and/or 
consideration of overall performance in the round.
Performance conditions and targets may be varied if an event occurs 
or circumstances arise which cause the Committee to determine that 
they have ceased to be appropriate. If they are varied, they must, in 
the opinion of the Committee, be fair, reasonable and materially no 
less difficult than the original condition when set.

Recruitment and promotion policy
The Committee will appoint new Executive Directors with a package 
that is in line with the Remuneration Policy in place and agreed by 
Shareholders at the time. 
Component Approach
Base salary The base salaries of new appointees will be 
determined by reference to the individual’s 
role and responsibilities, experience and 
skills, relevant market data, internal 
relativities and their current basic salary. 
Base salary may be higher or lower than the 
previous incumbent. Salaries may be set at 
an initially lower level with the intention of 
increasing salary at a higher than usual rate 
as the executive gains experience in the role.
Pension New appointees will be eligible to participate 
in the Group’s defined contribution pension 
plan or receive a cash alternative, in line with 
the Policy.
Benefits New appointees will be eligible to receive 
benefits in line with the Policy, including 
relocation benefits if appropriate.
Annual bonus The structure described in the Policy table 
will normally apply to new appointees with 
the relevant maximum being pro-rated to 
reflect the proportion of the year served. 
The Committee retains the flexibility to 
determine that for the first year of 
appointment any annual incentive award will 
be subject to such terms as it may 
determine.
LTIP New appointees will be eligible for awards 
under the LTIP which will normally be on the 
same terms as other executives, as 
described in the Policy table.
The maximum aggregate value of incentives (excluding buyouts) on 
appointment will be in line with the aggregate maximums in the Policy 
table.
To facilitate recruitment the Committee may need to ‘buy out’ 
remuneration forfeited on joining the Company. This will be 
considered on a case-by-case basis and may comprise cash or 
shares. In general:
 – If such remuneration was in the form of shares, compensation will 
be in the Company’s shares.
 – If remuneration was subject to achievement of performance 
conditions, compensation will normally be subject to performance.
 – The timing of any compensation will, where practicable, match the 
vesting schedule of the remuneration forfeited.
The over-riding principle would be that the value of any replacement 
buy out awards should be no more than the commercial value of 
awards which have been forfeited.
The approach in cases of appointing a new Executive Director by way 
of internal promotion will be consistent with the policy for external 
appointees detailed above. Where an individual has contractual 
commitments made prior to their promotion to Executive Director 
level, the Company will continue to honour these arrangements. 
Similarly, if an Executive Director is appointed following a merger or 
an acquisition of a company by Workspace, legacy terms and 
conditions may be honoured.
For interim positions a cash supplement may be paid rather than 
salary (for example a Non-Executive Director taking on an executive 
function on a short-term basis).
In the case of appointing a new Non-Executive Director, the 
Committee will follow the Policy as set out in the Policy table. 
Service contracts
The Executive Directors are employed under contracts of 
employment with Workspace Group PLC. Executive Directors have 
service contracts with a notice period of 12 months from the 
Company and the Executive Director. For new appointments notice 
periods would not exceed 12 months.
The Chairman and Non-Executive Directors have letters of 
appointment. The notice period for the Chairman is 6 months and the 
notice period for Non-Executive Directors is 3 months.
Termination
Payments in lieu of notice are limited to the Executive Director’s basic 
salary for the unexpired portion of the notice period. A payment may 
be made in lieu of unused holiday entitlement. The Company may 
make phased payments which are paid in monthly instalments and 
subject to mitigation.
The Committee reserves the right to make any other payments in 
connection with a Director’s cessation of office or employment where 
the payments are made in good faith in discharge of an existing legal 
obligation (or by way of damages for breach of such an obligation) or 
by way of a compromise or settlement of any claim arising in 
connection with the cessation of a Director’s office or employment. 
Any such payment may include but is not limited to paying any 
reasonable level of fees for outplacement assistance and/or the 
Director’s legal or professional advice fees in connection with his 
cessation of office or employment.
In the event that a participant ceases to be an employee of 
Workspace, treatment of outstanding awards under the Group’s 
incentive plans will be determined based on the relevant plan rules. Overview Our Governance Strategic Report Financial Statements Additional Information
105 Workspace Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Treatment of corporate events
In the event of a change of control or winding up of the Company, the 
LTIP awards will vest based on the extent to which the Committee 
determines that the performance conditions have been or would have 
been met. Pro-rating for service in the vesting period will apply unless 
the Committee decides otherwise. Outstanding deferred bonus 
awards will vest in full as soon as practicable in such circumstances.
In the event of a variation of share capital, demerger, special dividend 
or any other transaction which will materially impact the value of 
shares the Committee may, at its discretion, allow deferred bonus and 
LTIP awards to vest on the same basis as for a change of control 
described above. Alternatively, an adjustment may be made to the 
number of shares if considered appropriate. 
Consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the 
Company
When setting remuneration for Executive Directors the Committee 
takes into account contextual information about pay and conditions 
within the Group, including:
 – Salary increases for all employees.
 – Bonus awards for all employees.
The Committee members receive regular updates from the Executive 
Directors on employee feedback on pay and employment conditions 
elsewhere in the Group. While the Committee does not specifically 
consult with employees, they do monitor information on bonus 
payments and share awards.
We are committed to sharing business success across the 
organisation with all employees participating in a short-term incentive 
plan. At more senior levels, remuneration is increasingly long term and 
larger proportions are dependent on both Group and individual 
performance and paid in the form of shares. We operate both an 
SAYE and a SIP open to all employees in the Company. The 
illustration on page 107 provides an overview of remuneration 
throughout Workspace and the way in which our share incentive 
plans cascade through the organisation.
Legacy commitments
The Committee reserves the right to make any remuneration 
payments and payments for loss of office (including exercising any 
discretions available to it in connection with such payments) 
notwithstanding that they are not in line with the Policy set out above 
where the terms of the payment were agreed: (i) before 16 July 2014 
(the date the Company’s first shareholder-approved Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy came into effect); (ii) before the Policy set out 
above came into effect, provided that the terms of the payment were 
consistent with the shareholder-approved Directors’ Remuneration 
Policy in force at the time they were agreed; or (iii) at a time when the 
relevant individual was not a Director of the Company and, in the 
opinion of the Committee, the payment was not in consideration for 
the individual becoming a Director of the Company. For these 
purposes ‘payments’ include the Committee satisfying awards of 
variable remuneration and, in relation to an award over shares, the 
terms of the payment are ‘agreed’ at the time the award is granted.
Minor amendments
The Committee may make minor amendments to the Policy (for 
regulatory, exchange control, tax or administrative purposes or to 
take account of a change in legislation) without obtaining Shareholder 
approval.
The table below outlines the treatment of outstanding incentive 
awards on cessation of employment:
Component Approach
Annual bonus There is no automatic entitlement to an 
annual bonus. The Committee retains 
discretion to award bonuses for leavers 
taking account of the circumstances of 
departure. Leavers during the plan year 
normally lose any entitlement to bonus 
unless the individual is considered a ‘good 
leaver’
1
. Good leavers are eligible for an 
award to the extent that performance 
conditions have been satisfied and pro-rated 
for the proportion of the financial year 
served, with Committee discretion to treat 
otherwise.
Deferred bonus Deferred bonus shares are focused on 
alignment rather than retention and are not 
forfeitable on leaving except in the case of 
gross misconduct. Awards normally 
continue and are released at the usual time, 
although the Committee has the discretion 
to allow earlier release. On death, awards 
typically vest immediately.
LTIP Under the LTIP, unvested shares normally 
lapse unless the individual is considered a 
‘good leaver’
1
, in which case awards are 
normally tested for performance over the 
full performance period and pro-rated for 
time based on the proportion of the vesting 
period served, with Committee discretion to 
treat otherwise. On death, awards will 
typically vest immediately subject to the 
satisfaction of performance conditions as 
determined by the Committee.
LTIP awards which are subject to an 
additional holding period will typically be 
retained and released at either (i) the end of 
the holding period or (ii) two years from 
cessation – whichever is soonest, although 
the Committee has the discretion to allow 
earlier release.
All-employee plans For all-employee HMRC registered plans 
such as SAYE and SIP, leavers will be treated 
in accordance with the approved plan rules. 
1. A good leaver is defined as an employee who ceases to hold employment during 
the plan year by reason of: injury, ill-health or disability proved to the satisfaction 
of the Committee; retirement with the agreement of the Group Company by 
which he is employed; the participant’s employing Company ceasing to be a 
Group Company; the business or part of the business to which the participant’s 
employment relates being transferred to a person who is not a Group Company; 
or any other reason which the Committee in its absolute discretion so permits.
Any buyout award to be made, the leaver provisions may be 
determined at the time of the award. Corporate governance report

Annual Report on Remuneration
Application of Policy in 2017/18
As explained in the Remuneration Committee Chairman’s letter, we 
are seeking shareholder approval for a new Directors’ Remuneration 
Policy at the AGM on 14 July 2017. On the basis that it is approved by 
shareholders, it will be implemented as set out below.
Base salary
The Committee reviewed Executive Directors’ salaries during the year 
taking into account a number of factors, and the following salaries are 
effective from 1 April 2017.
Chief Executive Ocer
2016
2017 £479,700
£468,000
+2.5%
Chief Financial Ocer
2016
2017 £293,200
£286,000
+2.5%
The average salary increase across the Group for the year 
commencing 1 April 2017 is 3.7%.
Benefits and pension
There is no change to the implementation of our Policy in relation to 
benefits and pension for 2017/18. Executive Directors will receive a 
contribution to a defined contribution plan or a cash allowance in lieu 
of contribution of 16.5% of salary.
 
Annual bonus
There is no change to the annual bonus maximum potential in 2017/18 
and this will continue to be 120% of salary for Executive Directors.
From 2017/18, we are proposing to remove the personal performance 
multiplier on the annual bonus, moving to a simpler additive 
approach. No changes are being made to the performance measures 
and they will be:
Trading profit 
after interest
(60% of salary)
+
Total Property 
Return 
(24% of salary)
+
Customer 
satisfaction
(12% of salary)
+
Personal 
performance
(24% of salary)
Full disclosure on the targets, performance achieved and resulting 
bonus payouts for 2017/18 will be provided in next year’s report.
Deferral is being increased, and from 2017/18, 33% of the total bonus 
paid will be deferred into shares for three years. Dividend equivalents 
may be accrued on deferred shares. 
Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)
Following the review, the performance measures will be re-balanced 
so that 50% will be based on Total Property Return against a London 
focused IPD index and 50% will be based on relative TSR against 
FTSE 350 Real Estate companies. The targets for the two elements 
are as follows:
Total Shareholder Return 
relative to FTSE 350 Real 
Estate Supersector index 
excluding agencies 
Total Property Return 
versus London focused 
IPD index
Threshold vesting 
(20% of maximum) Median Median 
Maximum vesting 
(100% of maximum) Upper quartile Upper quartile
An extended holding period of two years (increased from one year) 
will apply to any vested shares under the LTIP.
To ensure any payouts are fully reflective of underlying performance, 
the LTIP underpin is being extended. It allows the Committee to 
reduce vesting if the Committee believes that the relative TSR and/or 
relative TPR performance is inconsistent with the overall performance 
of the business.
Performance measures and their alignment to our strategy
As part of the Policy review, the Committee carefully considered the 
performance measures under both the annual bonus and LTIP and 
the alignment to our strategy of driving outperformance and 
delivering Shareholder value over the longer term. The diagram below 
sets out the rationale for the performance measures proposed under 
our incentive plans from 2017/18:

Malus and clawback
The time period during which malus and clawback provisions can be 
applied is being extended, such that they can be applied up to the 
end of the deferral period for the annual bonus and to the end of the 
holding period for the LTIP.
Shareholding guidelines
The shareholding guidelines for Executive Directors is being increased 
from 150% of salary to 200% of salary. 
Non-Executive Director fees
The fees for Non-Executive Directors are reviewed and agreed 
annually. The fees, which are effective from 1 April 2017, are set out in

Wider approach to remuneration throughout the Company
The Group’s wider people policies are reported separately on pages 
28 to 30. All staff in the Company are eligible to participate in the 
Company’s bonus scheme, all-employee share schemes, pension 
scheme, life assurance arrangements and medical insurance benefits. 
Additionally, all employees participate in an annual bonus plan. All 
members of the Executive Committee and some senior staff are 
eligible to participate in the Company’s LTIP. During the year, we 
extended LTIP participation to a wider group of employees for a third 
consecutive year to further reinforce the strong performance culture.
Executive Committee members are also required to adhere to the 
Company’s shareholding guidelines.
When making remuneration decisions for the Executive Directors, the 
Committee considers pay and employment conditions elsewhere in 
the Group. The Committee receives regular updates from the 
Executive Directors on employee feedback. The Committee also 
monitors bonus payout and share award data. The following diagram 
demonstrates how Workspace’s key objectives are reflected 
consistently in plans operating at all levels within the Company.

2.  Annual bonus: This is the total bonus earned in respect of performance during the relevant year. For 2015/16, the Committee set a minimum deferral requirement of 25% 
of the bonus earned. For 2016/17 the deferral was 33%, this deferral was equivalent to £185,328 for Mr Hopkins and £113,256 for Mr Clemett. 
3.  LTIP: The 2016/17 figure includes the estimated value of 88.7% of the 2014 LTIP shares that vested based on performance to 31 March 2017. The share price used is the 
three-month average to 31 March 2017 of £7.73. This will be updated in next year’s report to reflect the share price on the date of vesting. The 2015/16 figures have been 
updated to reflect the share price on the date of vesting of £6.86.
4.  Pension: During 2016/17 each of Messrs Hopkins and Clemett received a cash allowance in lieu of pension contribution.
Annual bonus payout in respect of 2016/17
For 2016/17 the maximum bonus opportunity for the Executive Directors was 120% of salary subject to the assessment of performance against 
stretching financial, strategic and personal performance targets. Payouts are calculated on a straight-line basis from 0% at threshold to 100% at 
maximum performance. Executive Directors will be required to defer 33% of their bonus into Company shares for three years. The increased 
deferral policy of 33% of the total bonus agreed as part of the recent review is being implemented a year early so that it will apply to bonus 
payouts in respect of 2016/17 (previous policy of 25% of bonus).

LTIP awards made during the 2016/17 financial year
Under the previous Policy, awards under the LTIP were as follows:
 – Performance Shares up to a maximum of 100% of salary.
 – Matching Shares up to a maximum of 100% of salary. 
Matching Shares were granted subject to participant investment on a 2:1 basis. Both elements of the LTIP are subject to the performance 
conditions detailed in the table below measured over the period 1 April 2016 to 31 March 2019. Subject to Shareholder approval of the new 
arrangements, this is the final award to be made under the current LTIP (i.e. both Performance and Matching Share elements).

Advisors to the Committee
During the year, the Committee appointed Deloitte LLP as independent adviser to the Committee, following a selection process. Deloitte LLP is 
a founding member of the Remuneration Consultants Group and voluntarily operates under the Code of Conduct in relation to executive 
remuneration consulting in the UK. The Committee is satisfied that the Deloitte LLP engagement partner and team, that provide remuneration 
advice to the Committee, do not have connections with the Group that may impair their objectivity and independence. The fees charged by 
Deloitte LLP for the provision of independent advice to the Committee since their appointment in September 2016 were £119,225. The 
Committee retained Kepler Associates as its advisers for the first half of the year. Kepler Associates, who are also founding members and 
signatories of the Remuneration Consultants Group, provided independent advice. The fees paid to Kepler Associates were £31,600.
Other than in relation to advice on remuneration, neither Deloitte LLP nor Kepler Associates provided any other services to the Company. Corporate governance report

The 2016/17 Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions across the portfolio 
have decreased by 12% against our 2012/13 baseline. Compared to the 
previous year, GHG emissions across the portfolio have decreased by 
16%. 
This decrease can mostly be attributed to the divestment of 10 assets 
over this year, including eight properties within the Blackrock Joint 
Venture. However, a number of energy efficiency projects, such as 
boiler upgrades and lighting controls, were implemented within our 
existing portfolio towards the end of the last financial year and 
throughout this year which have also contributed to this year on year 
reduction. Furthermore, a number of energy efficiency measures 
such as natural ventilation and LED lighting have been incorporated 
into our new developments which have reduced their operational 
emissions.
Since 2012, the portfolio has grown in size and we have been 
increasing the amount of air-conditioned floor space we let, which 
has contributed to the increase in our overall portfolio carbon 
intensity. To tackle our GHG emissions, we will continue to focus on 
designing and implementing energy efficiency initiatives within our 
buildings and actively engage with both our site staff and customers 
to implement energy conservation measures. We have set new and 
challenging objectives and targets for the next year and will be 
monitoring our performance throughout the year to ensure that we 
achieve our goal of reducing GHG emissions.
Health and safety 
We are committed to health and safety best practice as an integral 
part of our business activities and our drive for high performance. 
The Group’s policy is to provide and maintain safe and healthy 
working conditions, equipment and systems of work for all its 
employees, customers and anyone affected by our business and to 
provide such information, training and supervision as they need for 
this purpose.
Whilst all employees of the Group have a responsibility in relation to 
health and safety matters, certain staff have been designated 
‘workplace’ responsibilities or other co-ordinating responsibilities 
throughout the Group, and ultimately, at Board level, the Chief 
Executive Officer has overall responsibility.

Company are set out in note 17 to the financial statements and in the

6 June 2017 120 Workspace Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and 
Accounts, including the Group and the Parent Company financial 
statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements 
for each financial year. Under that law the Directors have prepared 
the Group financial statements in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRSs’) as adopted by the European 
Union, and the Parent Company financial statements in accordance 
with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Standards 
(United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law). Under 
company law, the Directors must not approve the financial 
statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view 
of the state of affairs of the Parent Company and the Group and of 
the profit or loss of the Group for that period.
In preparing those financial statements, the Directors are required to:
 – Select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently.
 – Make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent.
 – State whether IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and 
applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject 
to any material departures disclosed and explained in the Group 
and Parent Company financial statements respectively.
 – Prepare financial statements on the Going Concern basis unless it is 
inappropriate to presume that the Group will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the Parent Company and the Group and to 
enable them to ensure that the financial statements and the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report comply with the Companies Act 2006 and, as 
regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS 
Regulation. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of 
the Company and the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps 
for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the 
Company’s corporate website (investors.workspace.co.uk). 
Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and 
dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in 
other jurisdictions.
The Directors consider that the Annual Report and Accounts taken as 
a whole are fair, balanced and understandable and provide the 
information necessary for shareholders to assess the Company’s 
performance, business model and strategy.
Each of the Directors, whose names and functions are detailed on 
pages 54 and 55 of the Annual Report, confirm that, to the best of 
their knowledge:
 – The Group financial statements, which have been prepared in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU, give a true and fair 
view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit of the 
Group.
 – The Strategic Report contained on pages 2 to 47 includes a fair 
review of the development and performance of the business and 
position of the Group, together with a description of the principal 
risks and uncertainties that it faces.

Our audit approach
Overview
 – Overall Group materiality: £18.4 million which 
represents approximately 1% of total assets.
 – Specific materiality of £3.2 million used for 
certain Consolidated income statement line 
items, being a percentage of profit before tax, 
net finance costs and investment property 
valuation movements.
 – All work in support of the Group audit opinion 
is performed by the Group audit team.
 – Valuation of investment properties due to 
materiality and the level of judgement 
involved.
 – Compliance with the REIT regime due to the 
impact of the tax exempt status on the 
Group’s business and the financial statements.
The scope of our audit and our areas of focus
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards 
on Auditing (UK and Ireland) (‘ISAs (UK & Ireland)’).
We designed our audit by determining materiality and assessing the 
risks of material misstatement in the financial statements. In particular, 
we looked at where the Directors made subjective judgements, for 
example in respect of significant accounting estimates that involved 
making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently 
uncertain. As in all of our audits we also addressed the risk of 
management override of internal controls, including evaluating 
whether there was evidence of bias by the Directors that represented 
a risk of material misstatement due to fraud. 
The risks of material misstatement that had the greatest effect on our 
audit, including the allocation of our resources and effort, are 
identified as ‘areas of focus’ in the table below. We have also set out 
how we tailored our audit to address these specific areas in order to 
provide an opinion on the financial statements as a whole, and any 
comments we make on the results of our procedures should be read 
in this context. This is not a complete list of all risks identified by our 
audit. 
Report on the Group financial statements
Our opinion
In our opinion, Workspace Group PLC’s Group financial statements 
(the ‘financial statements’):
 – give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 
31 March 2017 and of its profit and cash flows for the year then 
ended;
 – have been properly prepared in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRSs’) as adopted by the 
European Union; and
 – have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the 
Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
What we have audited
The financial statements, included within the Annual Report and 
Accounts (the ‘Annual Report’), comprise:
 – the Consolidated balance sheet as at 31 March 2017;
 – the Consolidated income statement and Consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income for the year then ended;
 – the Consolidated statement of cash flows for the year then ended;
 – the Consolidated statement of changes in equity for the year then 
ended; and
 – the notes to the financial statements, which include a summary of 
significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the 
preparation of the financial statements is IFRSs as adopted by the 
European Union, and applicable law.

Area of focus How our audit addressed the area of focus
Valuation of investment properties
Refer to page 90 (Audit Committee Report), pages 139 to 141 (Notes 
to the financial statements – note 10) and page 130 (Significant 
judgements, key assumptions and estimates, Significant accounting 
policies).
We focused on this area due to the magnitude of the investment 
property balance and because the assumptions used in determining 
the fair value of the investment properties involve significant 
judgements and estimates.
The Group’s investment properties were valued at £1,839.0 million as 
at 31 March 2017 and the revaluation gain of £39.5 million is included 
within ‘Change in fair value of investment properties’ in the 
Consolidated income statement.
The property valuations are carried out by external valuers in 
accordance with the RICS Valuation – Professional Standards and 
Workspace’s Group accounting policies which incorporate the 
requirements of International Accounting Standard 40, ‘Investment 
Property.’
The Group’s property portfolio consists of office and industrial 
properties located in London and includes:
Properties held at investment value – These are existing properties 
that are currently let and generate rental income. They are valued 
using the income capitalisation method as explained in note 10.
Properties held at development value – These are properties 
currently being refurbished, under development or identified for 
future development. They have a different risk and investment profile 
to the properties held at investment value and are valued using the 
residual value method as explained in note 10.
The most significant judgements affecting all the valuations includes 
yield and Estimated Rental Value (‘ERV’) movements (as described in 
note 10 of the financial statements). For properties held at 
development value, other assumptions including costs to complete, 
property specific factors, timing and the likelihood of achieving 
planning consent are also factored into the valuation. Where 
available, the valuations take into account evidence of market 
transactions for properties and locations comparable to those of the 
Group.
In order to assess the accuracy of the valuation of the property 
portfolio as at 31 March 2017 and to identify those properties which 
needed further investigation, we undertook an analysis of each 
property valuation and compared the yield adopted and movement in 
capital value over the year with expected market benchmarks. We 
evaluated the underlying valuation methodology and assumptions 
used by the valuer and met with the Group’s Development Director to 
understand property specific factors.
The external valuer used by the Group is CBRE. We assessed the 
competence, capabilities and objectivity of CBRE and verified its 
qualifications. Consistent with previous years and as part of our 
evaluation, we assessed the independence of CBRE given the Non-
Executive Director role of Stephen Hubbard. We also discussed the 
scope of its work and reviewed the terms of its engagement. We 
found no unusual terms or fee arrangements that might affect its 
objectivity.
We met with CBRE to discuss and challenge the valuation process, 
key assumptions and the rationale behind the more significant 
movements since 1 April 2016. Where relevant, we were able to 
corroborate the explanations for yields and ERV movements with 
comparable property transactions and market benchmarks.
We found that yields and ERVs were predominantly consistent with 
comparable benchmarking information for the asset location and that 
the assumptions applied appropriately reflected comparable market 
transactions. Where assumptions did not fall within our expected 
range, we assessed whether additional evidence presented in arriving 
at the final valuation was appropriate, and whether this had been 
robustly challenged by the external independent valuers. We were 
satisfied that variances were predominantly due to property specific 
factors such as new lettings at higher rents, increased average rents or 
capital improvements to the properties. We noted that the overall 
valuation primarily increased as a result of higher rents achieved, 
growth in ERVs and a contracted disposal. 
In addition, we were able to obtain evidence to support the valuation 
from the results of the following procedures which did not identify any 
material misstatements. We:
 – checked the accuracy of the underlying lease and occupancy data 
used by CBRE in their valuation of the portfolio by tracing the data 
back to the Workspace accounting records and signed leases on a 
sample basis;
 – for the properties held at development value, evaluated the 
underlying assumptions for the gross development value, 
construction costs and property specific factors within the 
development appraisals by comparing them to available market 
information and underlying project plans;
 – agreed the acquisitions and disposals in the year to the underlying 
agreements, cash payments and receipts and title deeds; and
 – agreed a sample of capital expenditure items to invoices, quantity 
surveyor reports and cash to check that they had been correctly 
capitalised. Overview Our Governance Strategic Report Financial Statements Additional Information

Area of focus How our audit addressed the area of focus
Compliance with the REIT regime
Refer to page 90 (Audit Committee Report), pages 136 to 137 (Notes 
to the financial statements – note 6) and page 130 (Significant 
judgements, key assumptions and estimates).
Workspace converted to a Real Estate Investment Trust (‘REIT’) in 
2007. The UK REIT regime grants companies tax exempt status 
provided they meet the specific requirements of the regime.
We focused on this area because the rules are complex and the tax 
exempt status has a significant impact on the Group’s business and 
the Group financial statements.
If the level of income generated from the property rental business 
were to fall below 75% of its total accounting profits in the current 
year, Workspace may be deemed to fail the Balance of Business test. 
Two consecutive years would represent a minor breach of the REIT 
regime criteria.
In 2016, the Group recognised a performance fee of £24.1m from the 
BlackRock Workspace Property Trust for services provided in its 
capacity as the property manager of the joint venture. As a result, 
Workspace generated less than 75% of its total accounting profits 
from its property rental business for the period. 
We therefore considered the Balance of Business test for 2017 to 
understand whether 75% of its total accounting profits were 
generated from its property rental business thereby avoiding a minor 
breach in the second consecutive period.
We confirmed our understanding of management’s overall approach 
to checking their compliance with the REIT regime requirements to 
our satisfaction.
We obtained management’s calculations and supporting 
documentation for the current and preceding year Balance of 
Business tests, testing the inputs, calculation and application of the 
rules.
For 2016, based on our work on the calculations and supporting 
documentation, we were satisfied with management’s conclusion that 
Workspace generated more than 50% and less than 75% of its total 
accounting profits from its property rental business. 
For 2017, we are satisfied that the Group generated approximately 
96% of its total accounting profits from the property rental business. 
Consequently, there is not a second year of the test result being below 
75% and we do not consider there to be a breach to any of the REIT 
criteria.
How we tailored the audit scope
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed 
enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements 
as a whole, taking into account the geographic structure of the 
Group, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in 
which the Group operates. 
Workspace Group PLC provides commercial property to let 
throughout London. The Group financial statements are a 
consolidation of the nine active entities, nineteen dormant entities and 
the Group’s one joint venture.
Except for the joint venture, where we focused our work on the share 
of profits and net assets that are recognised in the Group financial 
statements, all active entities were identified as requiring an audit of 
their complete financial information, either due to their size or their 
risk characteristics and all the audit work was performed by the 
Group audit team.
Materiality
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of 
materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality. 
These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to 
determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of 
our audit procedures on the individual financial statement line items 
and disclosures and in evaluating the effect of misstatements, both 
individually and on the financial statements as a whole. 
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for 
the financial statements as a whole as follows:
Overall Group 
materiality
£18.4 million (2016: £18.8 million).
How we 
determined it
Approximately 1% of total assets.
Rationale for 
benchmark 
applied
The key driver of the business and determinant of 
the Group’s value is direct property investments. 
Due to this, the key area of focus in the audit is the 
valuation of investment properties. On this basis, 
consistent with last year, we set an overall Group 
materiality level based on total assets.
Specific 
materiality
£3.2 million (2016: £5.5 million).
How we 
determined it
A percentage of profit before tax, net finance costs 
and investment property valuation movements.
Rationale for 
benchmark 
applied
A number of key performance indicators of the 
Group are driven by income statement items and we 
therefore applied a lower specific materiality to the 
components of profit before tax, excluding net 
finance costs and investment property valuation 
movements. 
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them 
misstatements identified during our audit above £0.6 million (2016: 
£0.4 million) as well as misstatements below that amount that, in our 
view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons. 124 Workspace Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017

assessed the prospects of the Group, over 
what period they have done so and why they 
consider that period to be appropriate, and 
their statement as to whether they have a 
reasonable expectation that the Group will be 
able to continue in operation and meet its 
liabilities as they fall due over the period of 
their assessment, including any related 
disclosures drawing attention to any necessary 
qualifications or assumptions.
We have nothing

Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the Directors’ 
statement that they have carried out a robust assessment of the 
principal risks facing the Group and the Directors’ statement in 
relation to the longer-term viability of the Group. Our review was 
substantially less in scope than an audit and only consisted of 
making inquiries and considering the Directors’ process 
supporting their statements; checking that the statements are in 
alignment with the relevant provisions of the Code; and 
considering whether the statements are consistent with the 
knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing our audit. 
We have nothing to report having performed our review.
Going Concern
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the Directors’ 
statement, set out on page 40, in relation to going concern. We have 
nothing to report having performed our review. 
Under ISAs (UK & Ireland) we are required to report to you if we have 
anything material to add or to draw attention to in relation to the 
Directors’ statement about whether they considered it appropriate to 
adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements. 
We have nothing material to add or to draw attention to. 
As noted in the Directors’ statement, the Directors have concluded 
that it is appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in preparing 
the financial statements. The going concern basis presumes that the 
Group has adequate resources to remain in operation, and that the 
Directors intend it to do so, for at least one year from the date the 
financial statements were signed. As part of our audit we have 
concluded that the Directors’ use of the going concern basis is 
appropriate. However, because not all future events or conditions can 
be predicted, these statements are not a guarantee as to the Group’s 
ability to continue as a going concern.

set out on page 120, the Directors are responsible for the preparation 
of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a 
true and fair view.
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial 
statements in accordance with applicable law and ISAs (UK & 
Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing 
Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for 
the Parent Company’s Members as a body in accordance with 
Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other 
purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume 
responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom 
this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where 
expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
What an audit of financial statements involves
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and 
disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: 
 – whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s 
circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately 
disclosed; 
 – the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by 
the Directors; and 
 – the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
We primarily focus our work in these areas by assessing the Directors’ 
judgements against available evidence, forming our own judgements, 
and evaluating the disclosures in the financial statements. 126 Workspace Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Consolidated statement of cash flows
For the year ended 31 March 2017 130 Workspace Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Workspace Group PLC (the ‘Company’) and its subsidiaries (together 
‘the Group’) are engaged in property investment in the form of letting 
of high-quality business accommodation to businesses across 
London.
The Company is a public limited company which is listed on the 
London Stock Exchange and is incorporated and domiciled in the UK.
The registered number of the Company is 2041612.
Basis of preparation
These financial statements are presented in Sterling, which is the 
Company’s functional currency and the Group’s presentation 
currency and have been prepared on a going concern basis, in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’) 
and IFRS IC interpretations as adopted by the European Union and 
with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies 
reporting under IFRS.
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost 
convention as modified by the revaluation of investment properties 
and financial assets and liabilities (including derivative financial 
instruments) at fair value through profit or loss or equity.
Significant judgements, key assumptions and estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally 
accepted accounting principles requires the use of estimates and 
judgements that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities 
at the balance sheet date and the reported amounts of revenues and 
expenses during the reporting period. Although these estimates are 
based on management’s best knowledge of the amount, event or 
actions, actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates.
The Group’s significant accounting policies are stated below. Not all 
of these accounting policies require management to make subjective 
or complex judgements. The following is intended to provide an 
understanding of the significant judgements within the accounting 
policies that management consider critical because of the 
assumptions or estimation involved in their application and their 
impact on the Consolidated financial statements.
Investment property valuation
The Group uses the valuation performed by its independent valuers 
as the fair value of its investment properties. The valuation is based 
upon the key assumptions of estimated rental values and market 
based yields. With regard to redevelopments and refurbishments, 
future development costs and an appropriate discount rate are also 
used. In determining fair value the valuers make reference to market 
evidence and recent transaction prices for similar properties.
Details of the valuation methodology and key assumptions are given 
in note 10. Management consider the significant assumptions to the 
valuation of investment properties to be estimated rental values and 
market based yields. Sensitivities on these assumptions are provided 
in note 10.
Compliance with the Real Estate Investment Trust (‘REIT’) taxation 
regime
The Group is a REIT and is thereby exempt from tax on both rental 
profits and chargeable gains from its UK property rental business. In 
order to retain REIT status, certain ongoing criteria must be 
maintained. The main criteria are as follows:
 – at the start of each accounting period, the assets of the tax exempt 
business must be at least 75% of the total value of the Group’s 
assets;
 – at least 75% of the Group’s total profits must arise from the tax 
exempt business; and
 – at least 90% of the tax exempt business must be distributed.
During the prior year, the Group recorded Other income of £24.1m for 
the performance fee relating to the BlackRock Workspace Property 
Trust joint venture causing the Group to fail the 75% Balance of 
Business income test for the prior year. Two consecutive breaches are 
required for the Group to incur a minor breach. There is no reason to 
expect that any further breaches will occur in future periods and so 
no impact on the Group’s tax exempt status is expected.
The Directors intend that the Group should continue as a REIT for the 
foreseeable future, with the result that deferred tax is not recognised 
on temporary differences relating to the property rental business 
which is within the REIT structure.
Significant accounting policies
The significant accounting policies adopted in the preparation of 
these Consolidated financial statements are set out below. These 
policies have been consistently applied to all years presented unless 
stated otherwise.
Basis of consolidation
The Consolidated financial statements include the financial 
statements of the Company and all its subsidiary undertakings up to 
31 March 2017. Subsidiaries are all entities (including structured 
entities) over which the Group has control. The Group controls an 
entity when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns 
from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those 
returns through its power over the entity. Subsidiaries are fully 
consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the 
Group. They are deconsolidated from the date that control ceases.
Inter company transactions, balances and unrealised gains from intra 
group transactions are eliminated. Unrealised losses are also 
eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment 
of the asset transferred.
Investment properties
Investment properties are those properties owned or leased by the 
Group that are held either to earn rental income or for capital 
appreciation, or both, and are not occupied by the Company or 
subsidiaries of the Group.
Investment property is measured initially at cost, including related 
transaction costs. After initial recognition investment property is held 
at fair value based on a valuation by an independent professional 
external valuer at each reporting date. The valuation methods and 
key assumptions applied are explained in note 10. Changes in fair 
value of investment property at each reporting date are recorded in 
the Consolidated income statement.
Notes to the financial statements
For the year ended 31 March 2017 Overview Our Governance Strategic Report Financial Statements Additional Information
131 Workspace Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Assets acquired under finance leases are capitalised at the lease’s 
commencement at the lower of the fair value of the leased property 
and the net present value of the minimum lease payments. The 
investment properties acquired under finance leases are subsequently 
carried at fair value. The corresponding rental obligations, net of 
finance charges, are included in current and non-current borrowings. 
Each lease payment is allocated between liability and finance charges 
so as to achieve a constant rate on the finance balance outstanding. 
The interest element of the finance cost is charged to the income 
statement.
Properties are treated as acquired at the point the Group assumes the 
significant risks and rewards of ownership and are treated as 
disposed when these are transferred outside of the Group’s control. 
Existing investment properties which undergo redevelopment and 
refurbishment for continued future use remain in investment property 
where the purpose of holding the property continues to meet the 
definition of investment property as defined above. 
Subsequent expenditure is charged to the asset’s carrying amount 
only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated 
with the expenditure will flow to the Group, and the cost of each item 
can be reliably measured. Certain internal staff costs directly 
attributable to capital/redevelopment projects are capitalised. All 
other repairs and maintenance costs are charged to the income 
statement during the period in which they are incurred.
Capitalised interest on refurbishment/redevelopment expenditure is 
added to the asset’s carrying amount. Borrowing costs capitalised are 
calculated by reference to the actual interest rate payable on 
borrowings, or if financed out of general borrowings by reference to 
the average rate payable on funding the assets employed by the 
Group and applied to the direct expenditure on the property 
undergoing redevelopment. Interest is capitalised from the date of 
commencement of the redevelopment activity until the date when 
substantially all the activities necessary to prepare the asset for its 
intended use are complete.
Investment properties are recognised as ‘assets held for sale’ when it 
is considered highly probable that sale completion will take place. 
This is assumed when a sale has exchanged by the balance sheet date 
and completed before the date of signing the financial statements. 
Income from the sale of assets is recognised when the significant risks 
and returns have been transferred to the buyer. In the case of sales of 
properties this is generally taken on completion of the contract. In the 
case of a part disposal agreement, the part of the asset being 
disposed will be derecognised from investment property when 
completion is reached or when a finance lease agreement is signed 
(i.e. when the risks and rewards of this part of the site transfer to the 
developer). Profit or loss on disposal is taken as the consideration 
receivable (net of costs) less the latest valuation (net book value) and 
is taken to other operating income/expense. 
Consideration can take the form of cash, new commercial buildings 
and a right to future overage (generally being a share in the proceeds 
of any future sale of the residential development to be constructed by 
the developer). Revenue is recognised when all relevant criteria in IAS 
18 are met, specifically when the inflow of economic benefit is 
probable and when the amount can be measured reliably. 
Consideration (including overage) is measured at the fair value of the 
consideration received/receivable. 
Commercial property to be received is fair valued using the residual 
method described in note 10 and is included in investment property. 
Changes in fair value are recognised through the Consolidated 
income statement in accordance with IAS 40.
Overage is only recognised once an agreement has been signed with 
a residential developer. Overage represents a financial asset and is 
designated as a financial asset at fair value through profit or loss upon 
initial recognition. The carrying value of overage is assessed at each 
period end and changes in fair value are taken to Other operating 
income.
Intangible assets
Intangible assets are stated at historical cost, less accumulated 
amortisation. Acquired computer software licences and external 
costs of implementing or developing computer software programs 
and websites are capitalised. These costs are amortised over their 
estimated useful lives of five years on a straight-line basis. 
Costs associated with maintaining computer software programs are 
recognised as an expense as they fall due.
Property, plant and equipment
Equipment and fixtures
Equipment and fixtures are stated at historical purchase cost less 
accumulated depreciation. Historical cost includes the original 
purchase price of the asset and the costs attributable to bringing the 
asset to its working condition for its intended use.
Subsequent expenditure is charged to the asset’s carrying amount or 
recognised as a separate asset only when it is probable that future 
economic benefits associated with the expenditure will flow to the 
Group and the cost of each item can be reliably measured. All other 
repairs and maintenance costs are charged to the Consolidated 
income statement during the period in which they are incurred.
Depreciation is provided using the straight-line method to allocate the 
cost less estimated residual value over the assets’ estimated useful 
lives which range from 4-10 years.
The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed and adjusted, 
if appropriate, at least at each financial year end. An asset’s carrying 
amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if its 
carrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount.
Joint ventures
Joint ventures are those entities over which the Group, either directly 
or indirectly, is in a position to jointly control the financial and 
operating policies of the entity. Joint ventures are accounted for 
under the equity method whereby the Group’s investment is initially 
accounted for at cost and adjusted thereafter to recognise the 
Group’s share of the gains or losses in the joint venture. These are 
adjusted for any gains or losses arising from transactions between the 
Group and the joint venture.
Other investments
Investment in unlisted shares are accounted for at cost where the fair 
value cannot be reliably measured. Subsequently they are reviewed 
for impairment by management on an annual basis.
Impairments and reversals are recognised through the Consolidated 
income statement. 132 Workspace Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017
The Group applies hedge accounting for certain derivatives that are 
designated and effective as hedges of future cash flows (cash flow 
hedges). The Group documents at the inception of the transaction 
the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items, as 
well as its risk management objectives and strategy for undertaking 
various hedging transactions. The Group also documents its 
assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of 
whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are 
highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of 
hedged items. The fair values of various derivative instruments used 
for hedging purposes are disclosed in note 16. Movements on the 
hedging reserve in other comprehensive income are shown in 
note 20.
For cash flow hedges, the effective portion of changes in the fair 
value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow 
hedges is recognised in other comprehensive income. The gain or 
loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in 
the Consolidated income statement within other gains/(losses). 
Amounts accumulated in equity are reclassified to profit or loss in the 
periods when the hedged item affects profit or loss (for example, to 
offset the currency movement on borrowings that are hedged at 
each period end). The gain or loss relating to the effective portion of 
swaps hedging the currency of borrowings is recognised in the 
Consolidated income statement.
Share capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly 
attributable to the issue of new shares are shown in equity as a 
deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
Investment in own shares
The Group operates an Employee Share Ownership Trust (‘ESOT’) 
and a trust for the Share Incentive Plan (‘SIP’). When the Group funds 
these trusts in order to purchase Company shares, the loan is 
deducted from shareholders’ equity as investment in own shares.
Operating segments
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the 
internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision maker. The 
chief operating decision maker is the person or group that allocates 
resources to and assesses the performance of the operating 
segments of an entity. The Group has determined that its chief 
operating decision maker is the Executive Committee of the 
Company. The Group considers that it has only one operating 
segment being a single portfolio of commercial property providing 
business accommodation for rent in London.
Revenue recognition
Revenue comprises rental income, service charges and other sums 
receivable from the Group’s investment properties. Other sums 
comprise insurance charges, supplies of utilities, premia associated 
with surrender of tenancies, commissions, fees and other sundry 
income.
All the Group’s properties are leased out under operating leases and 
are included in investment property in the balance sheet. Rental 
income from operating leases is recognised in the Consolidated 
income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Rent 
received in advance is deferred in the Consolidated balance sheet and 
recognised in the period to which it relates to. If the Group provides 
incentives to its customers the incentives are recognised over the 
lease term on a straight-line basis. 
Service charges and other sums receivable from tenants are 
recognised on an accruals basis by reference to the stage of 
completion of the relevant service or transactions at the reporting 
date. These services generally relate to a 12-month period.
Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables are recognised initially at fair value and 
subsequently measured at amortised cost less provision for 
impairment where it is established there is objective evidence that the 
Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the 
original terms of the receivable. The amount of the provision is the 
difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present 
value of estimated future cash flows. The provision is recorded in the 
Consolidated income statement.
Deferred consideration on the disposal of investment properties is 
included within trade and other receivables. It is fair valued on 
recognition and at each year end with any movement taken to Other 
operating income.
Trade and other payables
Trade and other payables are initially recognised at fair value and 
subsequently held at amortised cost.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand, restricted cash in the 
form of tenants’ deposits and deposits held on call with banks. Bank 
overdrafts are included in current liabilities but within cash and cash 
equivalents for the purpose of the cash flow statement.
Borrowings
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction 
costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost, 
with any difference between the initial amount (net of transaction 
costs) and the redemption value being recognised in the income 
statement over the period of the borrowings, using the effective 
interest method, except for interest capitalised on redevelopments.
Transaction costs are amortised over the effective life of the amounts 
borrowed.
Foreign currency translation 
Foreign currency transactions are translated into Sterling using the 
exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. Foreign 
exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such 
transactions and from the translation at year-end rates of monetary 
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised 
in the Consolidated income statement, except when deferred in Other 
comprehensive income as qualifying cash flow hedges.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting
The Group enters into derivative transactions in order to manage its 
exposure to foreign currency fluctuations and interest rate risks. 
Financial derivatives are recorded at fair value calculated by valuation 
techniques based on market prices, estimated future cash flows and 
forward interest rates. 
For financial derivatives (where hedge accounting is not applied) 
movements in fair value are recognised in the Consolidated income 
statement. In line with IFRS 13, fair values of financial derivatives are 
measured at the estimated amount that the Group would receive or 
pay to terminate the agreement at the balance sheet date, taking into 
account the current interest expectations and current credit value 
adjustment of the counterparties.

b)  The following accounting standards and guidance are not yet 
effective or not yet endorsed by the EU, and are either not 
expected to have a significant impact on the Group’s financial 
statements or will result in changes to presentation and disclosure 
only. They have not been adopted early by the Group:

IFRS 16 Leases
Direct costs
Direct costs comprise service charge and other costs directly 
recoverable from tenants and non-recoverable costs directly 
attributable to investment properties and other revenue streams.
Exceptional items
Exceptional items are those items that in the Directors’ view are 
required to be separately disclosed by virtue of their size or incidence 
to enable a full understanding of the Group’s financial performance.
Share based payments
The Group operates a number of share schemes under which the 
Group receives services from employees as consideration for equity 
instruments of the Group.
The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the 
grant of share awards and options is recognised as an expense over 
the vesting period.
Fair value is measured by the use of Black-Scholes and Binomial 
option pricing models. The expected life used in the models has been 
adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the effects of 
non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural 
considerations. 
Pensions
The Group operates a defined contribution pension scheme. 
Contributions are charged to the Consolidated income statement on 
an accruals basis.
Taxation
Current income tax is tax payable on the taxable income for the year 
and any prior year adjustment, and is calculated using tax rates that 
have been substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is provided in full on temporary differences between the 
tax base of an asset or liability and its carrying amount in the balance 
sheet. Deferred tax is determined using tax rates that have been 
enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. Deferred 
tax assets are recognised when it is probable that taxable profits will 
be available against which the deferred tax asset can be utilised.
Dividend distributions
Final dividend distributions to the Company’s shareholders are 
recognised as a liability in the Group’s financial statements in the 
period in which the dividends are approved, while interim dividends 
are recognised when paid.
New accounting standards, amendments and guidance
a)  During the year to 31 March 2017 the Group adopted the following 
accounting standards and guidance:
 – Amendments to IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements, 
IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities and IAS 28 
Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures – amendments 
regarding the consolidation exemption.
 – Amendments to IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements – amendments

The Group, as property manager to the BlackRock Workspace Property Trust joint venture, received a performance fee based on the returns 
achieved over the five-year term of the fund. The five-year term came to an end in February 2016 and the Group agreed with its partner to sell 
the remaining properties to bring the joint venture to a conclusion. Based on the returns achieved over the life of the fund and the valuation at 
31 March 2016 of the remaining properties the fee was estimated at £24.1m. Subsequent to the sale of the joint venture in June 2016, an 
additional fee of £0.4m was recognised and the total amount settled in the financial year.
The value of deferred consideration (cash and overage) from the sale of investment properties has been re-valued by CBRE Limited at 31 March 
2017 and 31 March 2016. The amounts receivable are included in the Consolidated balance sheet under non-current and current trade and other

The Group is a Real Estate Investment Trust (‘REIT’). The Group’s UK property rental business (both income and capital gains) is exempt from 
tax. The Group’s other income is subject to corporation tax. Other income of £2.1m has been recorded this year (note 3(c)). £0.8m (2016: 
£30.7m) of this income is subject to tax. The Group estimates that as the majority of its future profits will be exempt from tax, it will have a very 
low tax charge.

Changes to the UK corporation tax rates were ‘substantively enacted’ and ‘fully enacted’ on 6 and 15 September 2016 respectively as part of 
the Finance Bill 2016. These changes include reductions to the main rate of corporation tax from 19% to 17% from 1 April 2020. Deferred taxes at 
the balance sheet date have been measured using the rates expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability is settled.
The Group currently has an asset in relation to unrecognised tax losses carried forward of £1.0m (2016: £1.4m) calculated at a corporation tax 
rate of 19% (2016: 19%).

Valuation
The Group’s investment properties are held at fair value and were revalued at 31 March 2017 by the external valuer, CBRE Limited, a firm of 
independent qualified valuers in accordance with the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors Valuation – Professional Standards 2014. All the 
properties are revalued at period end regardless of the date of acquisition. This includes a physical inspection of all properties, at least once a 
year. In line with IFRS 13, all investment properties are valued on the basis of their highest and best use. For like-for-like properties their current 
use equates to the highest and best use. For properties undergoing refurbishment or redevelopment, most of these are currently being used 
for business accommodation in their current state. However, the valuation is based on the current valuation at the balance sheet date including 
the impact of the potential refurbishment and redevelopment as this represents the highest and best use.
The Executive Committee and the Board both conduct a detailed review of each property valuation to ensure appropriate assumptions have 
been applied. Meetings are held with the valuers to review and challenge the valuations, ensuring they have considered all relevant information, 
and rigorous reviews are performed to ensure valuations are sensible.
The valuation of like-for-like properties (which are not subject to refurbishment or redevelopment) is based on the income capitalisation 
method which applies market-based yields to the Estimated Rental Values (‘ERVs’) of each of the properties. Yields are based on current 
market expectations depending on the location and use of the property. ERVs are based on estimated rental potential considering current 
rental streams, market comparatives, occupancy and timing of rent reviews. Whilst there is market evidence for these inputs and recent 
transaction prices for similar properties, there is still a significant element of estimation and judgement. As a result of adjustments made to 
market observable data, the significant inputs are deemed unobservable under IFRS 13.
When valuing properties being refurbished by Workspace, the residual value method is used. The completed value of the refurbishment is 
determined as for like-for-like properties above. Capital expenditure required to complete the building is then deducted and a discount factor is 
applied to reflect the time period to complete construction and allowance made for construction and market risk to arrive at the residual value 
of the property. 
The discount factor used is the property yield that is also applied to the estimated rental value to determine the value of the completed 
building. Other risks such as unexpected time delays relating to planned capital expenditure are assessed on a project-by-project basis, looking 
at market comparable data where possible and the complexity of the proposed scheme. 140 Workspace Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017
10. Investment properties continued
Redevelopment properties are also valued using the residual value method. The completed proposed redevelopment which would be 
undertaken by a residential developer is valued based on the market value for similar sites and then adjusted for costs to complete, developer’s 
profit margin and a time discount factor. Allowance is also made for planning and construction risk depending on the stage of the 
redevelopment. If a contract is agreed for the sale/redevelopment of the site, the property is valued based on agreed consideration.
For all methods the valuers are provided with information on tenure, letting, town planning and the repair of the buildings and sites.
An increase/decrease to ERVs will increase/decrease valuations respectively, while an increase/decrease to yields will decrease/increase 
valuations respectively. There are interrelationships between these inputs as they are partially determined by market conditions.
An increase/decrease in costs to complete and the discount factor will decrease/increase valuations respectively.
The reconciliation of the valuation report total to the amount shown in the Consolidated balance sheet as non-current assets, investment 
properties, is as follows:

Total per CBRE valuation report 1,844.0 1,778.6

Head leases treated as finance leases under IAS 17 7.1 7.1
Total investment properties per balance sheet 1,839.0 1,749.4
The Group’s Investment properties are carried at fair value and under IFRS 13 are required to be analysed by level depending on the valuation 
method adopted. The different valuation methods are as follows:
Level 1 –  Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity can access at the measurement date.
Level 2 –  Use of a model with inputs (other than quoted prices included in Level 1) that are directly or indirectly observable market data.
Level 3 – Use of a model with inputs that are not based on observable market data.
As noted in the Significant judgements, key assumptions and estimates section, property valuations are complex and involve data which is not 
publicly available and involves a degree of judgement. All the investment properties are classified as Level 3, due to the fact that one or more 
significant inputs to the valuation are not based on observable market data. If the degree of subjectivity or nature of the measurement inputs 
changes then there could be a transfer between Levels 2 and 3 of classification. No changes requiring a transfer have occurred during the 
current or previous year.

12(a). Investment in joint ventures continued
BlackRock Workspace Property Trust (‘BWPT’) was a Jersey property unit trust established in February 2011 whose aim was to build a fund of 
up to £100m of office and industrial property in and around London. Prior to disposing of its share in the BWPT joint venture, the Group held a 
20.1% interest. Strategic decisions were taken with the agreement of both parties and no one party had control on their own. The Group was 
also property manager with significant delegated powers including responsibility for asset management and recommending acquisitions and 
disposals. As a result there was shared control and so the joint venture was equity accounted in the Consolidated financial statements.
Generate Studio Limited is engaged in the design and project management of office fit outs and workplace consultancy both for Group 
properties and third parties. 
The Group has no funding commitments relating to its joint ventures.

The deferred consideration arising on the sale of investment properties relates to cash and overage. The conditional value of the portion of the 
receivable that relates to overage is held at fair value through profit and loss. It has been fair valued by CBRE Limited on the basis of residual 
value, using appropriate discount rates, and will be revalued on a regular basis. This is a Level 3 valuation of a financial asset, as defined by 
IFRS 13. The methodology and significant assumptions used in the valuation are consistent with those disclosed in note 10. The change in fair 
value recorded in the Consolidated income statement, including both current and non-current elements, was a loss of £0.5m (31 March 2016: 
£9.5m gain) (note 3(c)).

acquire investment properties. In the prior year this included £24.1m in relation to the performance fee for the BlackRock Workspace Property 
Trust joint venture.
Receivables at fair value:
Included within deferred consideration on sale of investment properties is £9.4m (2016: £33.3m) of overage which is held at fair value through 
profit and loss. Where the amount is receivable within the following 12 months it has been classified from non-current to current receivables. 
Receivables at amortised cost:
The remaining receivables are held at amortised cost. There is no material difference between the above amounts and their fair values due to 
the short-term nature of the receivables. Trade receivables are impaired when there is evidence that the amounts may not be collectable under 
the original terms of the receivable. All the Group’s trade and other receivables are denominated in Sterling.

The fair value of the Retail Bond has been established from the quoted market price at 31 March 2017 and is thus a Level 1 valuation as defined 
by IFRS 13.
In accordance with IFRS 13 disclosure is required for financial instruments that are carried in the financial statements at fair value. The fair values 
of all the Group’s financial derivatives have been determined by reference to market prices and discounted expected cash flows at prevailing 
interest rates and are Level 2 valuations. There have been no transfers between levels in the year.
The different levels of valuation hierarchy as defined by IFRS 13 are set out in note 10.
The total change in fair value of derivative financial instruments recorded in other comprehensive income was a £2.2m loss (2016: profit of 
£1.4m).
In the prior year we recognised a gain on the change in fair value of derivative financial instruments of £0.9m. This interest rate hedge was 
cancelled during the prior year.

17. Financial risk management objectives and policy
The Group has identified exposure to the following financial risks:
 – M a r k e t ri sk .
 – C r e d i t ri sk .
 – L iq uidi t y r i s k .
 – Capital risk management.
The policies for managing each of these risks and the principal effects of these policies on the results for the year are summarised below:
(a) Market risk
Market risk is the risk that changes in market conditions will affect the Group’s interest rates. Borrowings at variable rates expose the Group to 
cash flow interest rate risk. Borrowings at fixed rates expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk.
The Group finances its operations through a mixture of retained profits and borrowings. The Group borrows at both fixed and floating rates of 
interest and then uses interest rate and cross currency swaps and caps to generate the desired interest and risk profile. The Group has entered 
into a cross currency swap to ensure the US Dollar liability streams generated from the US Dollar private placement notes are fully hedged into 
Sterling for the life of the transaction. At 31 March 2017 84% (2016: 69%) of Group borrowings were fixed or fixed through the use of interest 
rate and cross currency swaps.
All transactions entered into are approved by the Board and are in accordance with the Group’s treasury policy. The Board also monitors 
variances on interest rates to budget and forecast rates to ensure that the risk relating to interest rates is being sufficiently safeguarded against. 
Based upon year end variable rate loan balances, a reasonably possible interest rate movement of +/-0.5% would have increased and 
decreased net interest payable and equity respectively by £0.2m (2016: £0.5m).
(b) Credit risk
The Group’s main financial assets are cash and cash equivalents, deposits with banks and financial institutions and trade and other receivables.
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss if a tenant or a counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations. The Group’s 
exposure to this risk principally relates to the receivables from tenants, deferred consideration on the sale of investment property and cash and 
cash equivalent balances held with counterparties.
The Group’s exposure to credit risk in relation to receivables from tenants is influenced mainly by the characteristics of individual tenants 
occupying its rental properties. The Group has around 4,000 tenants over 68 properties. The largest 10 single tenants generate less than 10% of 
net rent roll. As such, the credit risk attributable to individual tenants is low.
The Group’s credit risk in relation to tenants is further managed by requiring that tenants provide a deposit equivalent to three months’ rent on 
inception of lease as security against default. Total tenant deposits held are £21.8m (2016: £19.3m). The Group monitors aged debt balances 
and any potential bad debts every week, the information being reported to the Executive Committee every month as part of the performance 
monitoring process. The Group’s debtor recovery is consistently high and as such is deemed a low risk area.
Deferred consideration (cash and overage) on the sale of investment properties is contractual and valued regularly by the external valuer based 
on current and future market factors. Cash and cash equivalents and financial derivatives are held with major UK high street banks or building 
societies and strict counterparty limits are operated on deposits.
The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure. The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date 
was:

(c) Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Group’s approach to managing liquidity is to ensure it will always have sufficient funds to meet obligations as they fall due. This is 
performed via a variety of methods including daily cash flow review and forecasting, monthly monitoring of the maturity profile of debt and the 
regular revision of borrowing facilities in relation to the Group’s requirements and strategy.
To ensure it can effectively manage its liquidity risk, the Group has an overdraft facility of £4m (2016: £4m) and a revolving loan facility of 
£150m (2016: £150m). At 31 March 2017 headroom excluding overdraft and cash was £120m (31 March 2016: £110m).
Cash flow is monitored formally on a monthly basis as part of internal performance monitoring with regular daily monitoring and forecasting 
undertaken to manage day-to-day cash flows and any balances which are ring-fenced by lenders. The Board reviews compliance with loan 
covenants which include agreed interest cover and loan to value ratios, alongside review of available headroom on loan facilities.
The following is an analysis of the contractual undiscounted cash flows payable under financial liabilities, derivative financial instruments and 
trade and other payables existing at the balance sheet date. Contracted cash flows are based upon the loan balances and applicable interest 
rates payable on these at each year end.

17. Financial risk management objectives and policy continued
(d) Capital risk management
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, and monitor an appropriate 
mix of debt and equity financing.
Equity comprises issued share capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in the Consolidated statement of changes in equity. Debt 
comprises term loan facilities, revolving loan facilities from banks, the Retail Bond, private placement notes less cash at bank and in hand.
The foreign currency risk on the US Dollar Private Placement Notes is fully hedged through a cross currency swap.
At 31 March 2017 Group equity was £1,578.5m (2016: £1,517.6m), and Group net debt (debt less cash at bank and in hand) was £242.3m (2016: 
£275.5m). Group gearing at 31 March 2017 was 17% (2016: 19%).
The Group’s borrowings are all unsecured. The loan to value covenants applicable to these borrowings range between 60% and 75% and 
compliance is being met comfortably.

22. Share based payments
The Group operates a number of share schemes:
I) Long term equity incentive plan (‘LTIP’)
The LTIP scheme is a performance award scheme whereby shares are issued against three Group performance measures which are assessed 
over the three-year vesting period. These are:
 – Absolute TSR.
 – Relative TSR.
 – Relative NAV.
The shares are issued at nil consideration provided the performance conditions are met.
Under the 2016 LTIP scheme 479,057 performance and matching shares were awarded in June 2016 to Directors and Senior Management 
(2015 LTIP scheme: 402,421). 
Details of the movements for the LTIP scheme during the year were as follows:

For the 2013 LTIP the average closing share price at the date of exercise of shares exercised during the year was £6.85 (2016: £8.85).
For the 2016 LTIP a binomial model was used to determine the fair value of the LTIP grant for the Absolute TSR and Relative TSR elements of 
the LTIP scheme.
Assumptions used in the model were as follows:
2017 2016
Share price at grant 828p 914p
Exercise price Nil Nil
Average expected life (years) 3 3
Risk free rate 1% 1%
Expected dividend yield 2% 2%
Average share price volatility 28% 25%
Fair value per option – Absolute TSR element 316p 305p
Fair value per option – Relative TSR element 306p 306p
The relative NAV is a non-market based condition and the intrinsic value is therefore the share price at date of grant of 828 pence. At each 
balance sheet date, the Directors assess the likelihood of meeting the conditions under this element of the scheme. The impact of the revision 
to original estimates, if any, is recognised in the income statement with a corresponding adjustment to equity. The assessment at year end was 
that up to 50% of the relative NAV element will vest.
The expected Workspace share price volatility was determined by taking account of the daily share price movement over a three-year period. 
The respective FTSE 250 Real Estate share price volatility and correlations were also determined over the same period. The average expected 
term to exercise used in the models has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise 
restrictions and behavioural conditions and historical experience.
The risk free rate has been determined from market yield curves for government gilts with outstanding terms equal to the average expected 
term to exercise for each relevant grant. The expected dividend yield was determined by calculating the present value of expected future 
dividend payments to expiry.

II) Employee share option schemes
The Group operates a Save As You Earn (‘SAYE’) share option scheme. Grants under the SAYE scheme are normally exercisable after three or 
five year’s saving. In accordance with UK practice, the majority of options under the SAYE schemes are granted at a price 20% below the 
market price ruling at the date of grant.
Details of the movements for the SAYE schemes during the year were as follows:
SAYE
Options outstanding Number

At 31 March 2015 354,506 £3.09
Options granted 86,251 £7.27

Options lapsed (17,983) £5.33
At 31 March 2016 267,693 £4.95
Options granted 190,167 £5.18
Options exercised (53,429) £3.65
Options lapsed (99,220) £6.41 
At 31 March 2017 305,211 £4.85 
The average closing share price at the date of exercise for the SAYE options exercised (for the 3 year 2013 and the 5 year 2011 schemes) during 
the year was £7.16 (2016: £8.73).
190,167 SAYE share options were granted in the year (2016: 86,251 shares).
The fair value has been calculated using the Black-Scholes model. Inputs to the model are summarised as follows:
2017

Risk free rate 1% 1% 1% 1%
Expected dividend yield 2% 2% 2% 2%
Possibility of ceasing employment before vesting 25% 25% 25% 25%
The expected life is the average expected period to exercise. The risk free rate of return is the yield on zero-coupon UK government bonds of a 
term consistent with the assumed option life. The expected dividend yield is based on the present value of expected future dividend payments 
to expiry.
Fair values per share of these options were:
2017 2016

SAYE – 3 year 27 July 2016 149p 24 July 2015 222p
SAYE – 5 year 27 July 2016 164p 24 July 2015 259p
III) Share incentive plan (‘SIP’)
All staff were granted £1,000 worth of shares in both March 2013 and September 2015. These shares are held in trust under an HMRC approved 
SIP. The shares can be exercised following three years of employment but must be held for a further two years in order to qualify for tax 
advantages. No new shares were granted in the year (2016: 20,651). 4,088 (2016: 12,643) shares were exercised in the year and 3,930 (2016: 
3,426) shares lapsed.  154 Workspace Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017

SAYE – 1.6 years (2016: 1.6 years), SIP – 0.8 years (2016: 1.1 years).
V) Cash-settled share based payments
National Insurance payments due on the exercise of non-approved ESOS options and shares from the LTIP are considered cash-settled share 
based payments.
The estimated fair value of the National Insurance cash-settled share based payments have been calculated using the Black-Scholes model. At 
each balance sheet date the Group revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to vest. It recognises the impact of the 
revision to original estimates, if any, in the income statement.
VI) Share based payment charges
The Group recognised a total charge in relation to share based payments as follows:
2017
£m
2016
£m
Equity settled share based payments 1.9 1.9
Cash settled share based payments 0.4 0.9
2.3 2.8
The total liability at the end of the year in respect of cash settled share based schemes was £0.8m (2016: £1.1m).

 – the Parent Company statement of changes in equity for the year then 
ended; and
 – the notes to the financial statements, which include a summary of

The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation 
of the financial statements is United Kingdom Accounting Standards, 
comprising FRS 101 ‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’, and applicable law 
(United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
Other required reporting
Consistency of other information and compliance with applicable 
requirements
Companies Act 2006 opinion
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:
 – the information given in the Strategic Report and the Report of the 
Directors for the financial year for which the financial statements are 
prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and
 – the Strategic Report and the Report of the Directors have been 
prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.
In addition, in light of the knowledge and understanding of the Parent 
Company and its environment obtained in the course of the audit, we 
are required to report if we have identified any material misstatements 
in the Strategic Report and the Report of the Directors. We have 
nothing to report in this respect.
ISAs (UK & Ireland) reporting
Under International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) (‘ISAs (UK 
& Ireland)’) we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, 
information in the Annual Report is:
 – materially inconsistent with the information in the audited financial 
statements; or
 – apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent 
with, our knowledge of the Parent Company acquired in the course 
of performing our audit; or
 – otherwise misleading.
We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.
Adequacy of accounting records and information and explanations 
received
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in 
our opinion:
 – we have not received all the information and explanations we 
require for our audit; or
 – adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent 
Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received

In our opinion, the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be 
audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies 
Act 2006.
Other Companies Act 2006 reporting
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our 
opinion, certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are 
not made. We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility. 
Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit
Our responsibilities and those of the Directors
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ responsibilities set 
out on page 120, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the 
financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair 
view.
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial 
statements in accordance with applicable law and ISAs (UK & Ireland). 
Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s 
Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the 
Parent Company’s Members as a body in accordance with Chapter 3 of 
Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, 
in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any other 
purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into 
whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior 
consent in writing.
What an audit of financial statements involves
We conducted our audit in accordance with ISAs (UK & Ireland). An audit 
involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the 
financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the 
financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused 
by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: 
 – whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Parent 
Company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and 
adequately disclosed; 
 – the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the 
Directors; and 
 – the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
We primarily focus our work in these areas by assessing the Directors’ 
judgements against available evidence, forming our own judgements, and 
evaluating the disclosures in the financial statements.
We test and examine information, using sampling and other auditing 
techniques, to the extent we consider necessary to provide a reasonable 
basis for us to draw conclusions. We obtain audit evidence through 
testing the effectiveness of controls, substantive procedures or a 
combination of both. 
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the 
Annual Report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited 
financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently 
materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the 
knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we 
become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies 
we consider the implications for our report. With respect to the Strategic 
Report and Report of the Directors, we consider whether those reports 
include the disclosures required by applicable legal requirements.
Other matter
We have reported separately on the Group financial statements of 
Workspace Group PLC for the year ended 31 March 2017.

Parent Company statement of changes in equity
For the year ended 31 March 2017 Overview Our Governance Strategic Report Financial Statements Additional Information
161 Workspace Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017
A. Accounting policies
Although the Group Consolidated financial statements are prepared 
under IFRS as adopted by the EU, the Workspace Group PLC 
Company financial statements are prepared under Financial 
Reporting Standard 101 (‘FRS 101’) ‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’.
Basis of accounting
The financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis under 
the historical cost convention and in accordance with the Companies 
Act 2006 and applicable accounting standards in the UK. The 
financial statements are presented in Sterling. 
In preparing the financial statements the Company has taken 
advantage of the following disclosure exemptions conferred by 
FRS 101:
a)  The requirements of IAS 7 to provide a Statement of cash flows for 
the year; 
b)  The requirements of IAS 1 to provide a statement of compliance 
with IFRS; 
c)  The requirements of IAS 1 to disclose information on the 
management of capital;
d)  The requirements of paragraphs 30 and 31 of IAS 8 Accounting 
Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors to disclose 
new IFRS’s that have been issued but are not yet effective; 
e)  The requirements in IAS 24 Related Party Disclosures to disclose 
related party transactions entered into between two or more 
members of a group, provided that any subsidiary which is a party 
to the transaction is wholly owned by such a member; 
f)  The requirements of IFRS 7 on financial instruments disclosures; 
and 
g)  The requirements of paragraphs 91-99 of IFRS 13 Fair Value 
Measurement to disclose information of fair value valuation 
techniques and inputs. 
The above disclosure exemptions are allowed because equivalent 
disclosures are included in the Group Consolidated financial 
statements.
Significant Accounting Policies
i. Investments
Investments are carried in the Company’s balance sheet at cost less 
impairment. Impairment reviews are performed by the Directors 
when there has been an indication of potential impairment.
Impairment and reversal of impairment is taken to the profit and loss 
account.
ii. Share based payment and investment in own shares
Incentives are provided to employees under share option schemes. 
The Company has established an Employee Share Ownership Trust 
(‘ESOT’) to satisfy part of its obligation to provide shares when Group 
employees exercise their options. The Company provides funding to 
the ESOT to purchase these shares.
The Company has also established an employee Share Incentive Plan 
(‘SIP’) which is governed by HMRC rules. 
The Company itself has no employees. When the Company grants 
share options to Group employees as part of their remuneration, the 
expense of the share options is reflected in a subsidiary undertaking, 
Workspace Management Limited. The Company recognises this as an 
investment in subsidiary undertakings with a corresponding increase 
to equity.
The disclosure requirements for share based payments are met in 
note 22 of the Group Consolidated financial statements. 
iii. Borrowings
Details of borrowings are described in note F to the Parent Company 
financial statements. Costs associated with the raising of finance are 
capitalised, amortised over the life of the instrument and charged as 
part of interest costs.
iv. Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting
The accounting policy for derivative financial instruments and hedge 
accounting are the same as those for the Group and are set out on 
page 132. Disclosure requirements are provided in note 16 to the 
Consolidated financial statements.
v. Foreign currency translation
The accounting policy for foreign currency translation is the same as 
that for the Group and is set out on page 132.
Taxation
Current income tax is tax payable on the taxable income for the year 
and any prior year adjustment, and is calculated using tax rates that 
have been substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is provided in full on temporary differences between the 
tax base of an asset or liability and its carrying amount in the balance 
sheet. Deferred tax is determined using tax rates that have been 
enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. Deferred 
tax assets are recognised when it is probable that taxable profits will 
be available against which the deferred tax asset can be utilised.
Dividend distributions
Final dividend distributions to the Company’s shareholders are 
recognised as a liability in the Group’s financial statements in the 
period in which the dividends are approved, while interim dividends 
are recognised when paid.

continued Overview Our Governance Strategic Report Financial Statements Additional Information
167 Workspace Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Adjusted trading profit after interest is net rental income, joint 
venture trading and finance income, less administrative expenses, less 
finance costs but excluding exceptional finance costs.
Adjusted underlying earnings are based on trading profit after 
interest adjusted to exclude exceptional items.
BlackRock JV BlackRock Workspace Property Trust, a joint venture 
property fund with the BlackRock UK Property Fund in which the 
Group held a 20.1% interest until June 2016.
Cash rent roll is the current net rents receivable for occupied units.
Earnings per share (‘EPS’) is the profit after taxation divided by the 
weighted average number of shares in issue during the period.
Employee Share Ownership Trust (‘ESOT’) is the trust created by 
the Group to hold shares pending exercise of employee share options.
EPRA NAV is a definition of net asset value as set out by the 
European Public Real Estate Association. It represents net assets after 
excluding mark to market adjustments of effective cash flow hedges 
(financial derivatives) and deferred tax relating to revaluation 
movements, capital allowances and derivatives.
Equivalent yield is a weighted average of the initial yield and 
reversionary yield and represents the return a property will produce 
based upon the timing of the occupancy of the property and timing 
of the income receivable. This is approximated by the reversionary 
yield multiplied by the Group trend occupancy of 90%.
Estimated Rental Value (‘ERV’) or market rental value is the Group’s 
external valuers’ opinion as to the open market rent which, on the 
date of valuation, could reasonably be expected to be obtained on a 
new letting or rent review.
Exceptional items are significant items of income or expense that by 
virtue of their size, incidence or nature are shown separately on the 
Consolidated income statement to enable a full understanding of the 
Group’s financial performance.
Gearing is the Group’s net debt as a percentage of net assets.
Gearing on EPRA net assets is the Group’s net debt as a percentage 
of net assets excluding mark to market derivative adjustments.
Initial yield is the net rents generated by a property or by the 
portfolio as a whole expressed as a percentage of its valuation.
Interest cover is the number of times net interest payable is covered 
by operating profit.
IPD is the Investment Property Databank Ltd, a company that 
produces an independent benchmark of property returns.
IPD Quarterly Universe is the IPD quarterly universe property fund 
benchmark of approximately 240 (£196bn) UK domestic property 
funds.
LIBOR is the British Bankers’ Association London Interbank Offer 
Rate.
Like-for-like are those properties that have been held throughout a 
12-month period and have not been subject to a refurbishment or 
redevelopment programme in the last 24 months.
Loan to value is net debt divided by the current value of properties 
owned by the Group.
Market rental values (see ‘ERV’).
Net asset value per share (‘NAV’) is net assets divided by the 
number of shares at the period end.
Net bank debt is the amount drawn on bank and other loan facilities, 
including overdrafts, less cash deposits.
Net rents are rents excluding any contracted increases and after 
deduction of inclusive service charge revenue.
Occupancy percentage is the area of space let divided by the total 
net lettable area (excluding land used for open storage).
Open market value is an opinion of the best price at which the sale of 
an interest in the property would complete unconditionally for cash 
consideration on the date of valuation (as determined by the Group’s 
external valuers).
Profit/(loss) before tax (‘PBT’) is income less all expenditure other 
than taxation.
Property Income Distribution (‘PID’) a dividend generally subject to 
withholding tax that a UK REIT is required to pay from its tax-
exempted property rental business and which is taxable for UK 
resident shareholders at their marginal tax rate.
REIT is a Real Estate Investment Trust as set out in the UK Finance 
Act 2006 Sections 106 and 107. REITs pay no corporation tax on 
profits derived from their property rental business.
Rent per sq. ft. is the net rent divided by the occupied area.
Rent roll (see cash rent roll).
Reversion/reversionary income is the increase in rent estimated by 
the Group’s external valuers, where the net rent is below the current 
estimated rental value. The increases to rent arise on rent reviews, 
letting of vacant space, expiry of rent free periods or rental increase 
steps.
Reversionary yield is the anticipated yield, which the initial yield will 
rise to once the rent reaches the estimated rental value. It is 
calculated by dividing the ERV by the valuation.
Total Shareholder Return (‘TSR’) is the return obtained by a 
shareholder calculated by combining both share price movements 
and dividend receipts.
Total property return is the return for the year combining the 
valuation movement on our portfolio and the income achieved 
in the year.
Unique web visits is the number of unduplicated (counted only once) 
visitors to a website over the course of a specified time period.
