We purchase land in targeted locations 
which at least meets our hurdle rates 
of 20% gross margin and 25% site 
ROCE. We then work closely with local 
communities and authorities to deliver 
effective planning permissions.
Our capability to deliver developments 
of all levels of complexity from standard 
housing to large and highly complex 
London schemes, and our geographical 
portfolio means we can manage risk 
through our diversity.
We also have a proven track record in 
delivering successful JV partnerships.

41.7p

Capital Return Plan 
over four years ending November 2018 
based on consensus earnings
This has been another excellent year for the Group across all key operational and 
financial performance metrics. We achieved record profits, completion volumes were 
at their highest level for nine years and we remain industry leading in terms of quality 
and customer service. 
We have delivered our FY17 financial targets of 20% gross margin and 25% ROCE, 
and we are committed to further progress. Improving our profit margin remains a 
priority for the Group and we have a number of initiatives underway to further increase 
efficiency, reduce costs and simplify our business. 
We remain the largest housebuilder in the UK, delivering 17,395 homes in the year 
reflecting the strength of our housebuilding operations.
Our sites were awarded 74 NHBC Pride in the Job Awards for site management 
this year, more than any other housebuilder for the 13th year in a row. We were also 
awarded the Home Builders Federation maximum five star rating for the eighth 
consecutive year – the only major housebuilder with this record. We have now won 56 
Built for Life accreditations for excellence in the design of homes and neighbourhoods, 
more than all the other housebuilders combined.
These are significant achievements and are testament to our continuing focus on 
leading the future of housebuilding by putting customers first and at the heart of 
everything we do.
Political and economic environment
Whilst the General Election in June 2017 
created some uncertainty, Government 
support for housebuilding and a commitment 
to tackle the country’s housing shortage 
remain. The Government’s Housing White 
Paper published in February contained many 
positive measures, particularly those aimed 
at speeding up the planning system and 
bringing forward more land for new homes. 
Following the outcome of the EU referendum, 
the Board continues to monitor carefully the 
potential impacts of the vote to leave the EU 
on our business. 
Market conditions remain good with a wide 
availability of attractive mortgage finance, 
which, alongside Help to Buy, continues 
to support robust consumer demand. 
The Group is in a strong position, with a 
substantial year end net cash balance, healthy 
forward sales position and an experienced 
management team.
Consequently, we remain confident in the 
strong fundamentals of the housing sector 
and our business.
Our employees
The outstanding progress made during the 
year would not have been possible without 
the capability and dedication of our Senior 
Management team and employees whom 
I would like to thank on behalf of the Board. 
We ensure that we reward all of our employees 
appropriately so that we can recruit and retain 
the best people whilst motivating them to 
continue to perform year on year.  Annual Report and Accounts 2017 – Barratt Developments PLC     9
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Other Information
Corporate Governance
Underpinning any successful Company, is good 
corporate governance. Corporate governance 
is the basis of good management practice 
and we place it at the heart of everything we 
do. It is embedded in our policies, procedures 
and processes throughout our business from 
Board level to our divisional operations. 
Last year the Government published a 
Green Paper on Corporate Governance. 
The Financial Reporting Council (FRC) 
announced a fundamental review of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code to take into 
account their work done around corporate 
culture and succession planning. The review 
will also take account of the issues raised in 
the Government’s Green Paper and the BEIS 
Select Committee inquiry.
We have begun to explore the various 
proposals in the Green Paper and the FRC 
review with our advisors. We have already 
taken steps to establish a forum at which 
employee representatives from across 
the business will have the opportunity to 
express the views of the workforce on key 
topics such as culture, diversity, training 
and remuneration. This will ensure that best 
practice is embedded in our business and that 
we can effectively respond to, and implement, 
any changes that may be required as new 
regulation or legislation is introduced.
We will continue to ensure that good corporate 
governance remains embedded within the 
culture and values of the business as a whole 
whilst adapting our policies, processes and 
procedures in light of any changes proposed 
by the Government and the FRC. Through the 
Nomination Committee, we will ensure 
that we continue to have robust succession 
planning in place for both Board members and 
Senior Management.
On 22 June 2017, we were pleased to announce 
the appointment of Jessica White as Chief 
Financial Officer. Jessica was previously 
Group Financial Controller and is therefore 
very familiar with the way in which the Group 
operates. Jessica’s full biography and details 
of the recruitment process followed are set 
out on pages 46 and 62 respectively. 
More information on the composition of 
the Board and the individual roles and 
responsibilities of each Board member is set 
out on pages 46 and 47. 
Delivering returns for our shareholders
In line with the improved Capital Return Plan 
announced in February 2017, and given the 
strong financial performance of the Group, the 
Board is pleased to propose a final dividend 
of 17.1 pence per share (2016: 12.3 pence 
per share) and a special dividend of £175.0m 
(17.3 pence per share), both of which, subject 
to shareholder approval, will be paid in 
November 2017. The total proposed dividend 
for FY17, including the interim dividend of 7.3 
pence per share paid in May 2017, is therefore 
41.7 pence per share (2016: 30.7 pence 
per share).
We continue to cooperate fully with the 
Metropolitan Police on the ongoing 
investigation we instigated regarding possible 
misconduct in the London business. As stated 
in October 2016, Barratt does not anticipate 
any material adverse financial effect and our 
London business is operating well.
Appointments and succession
A number of Board changes took place during 
the year. 
After eight years of service, Mark Rolfe stood 
down from the Board after the 2016 AGM. 
Jock Lennox, who had joined the Board on 
1 July 2016, took over as Audit Committee 
Chairman. Details of the work undertaken 
by the Audit Committee during FY17 can be 
found on pages 65 to 73. In addition, Richard 
Akers was appointed as Senior Independent 
Director with effect from the conclusion of 
the 2016 AGM.
As announced on 19 January 2017, Neil 
Cooper, previously Chief Financial Officer, 
left the Board by mutual agreement. 
Information regarding the payments made to 
Neil on leaving the business can be found on 
page 103 and throughout the Remuneration 
Report. From that date, David Thomas 
performed the dual roles of Chief Executive 
and Chief Financial Officer. In order to maintain 
a stable governance framework, the Board 
ensured that David had sufficient support from 
members of the Senior Management team 
and from members of the Board to enable him 
to undertake his day to day duties under both 
roles. Details of the steps taken can be found 
on page 62. 
Conclusion
I believe that you have a strong and 
experienced Board dedicated to managing 
your Company efficiently with a great focus 
on achieving long term sustainable value. 
The Board continues to have the right 
balance of skills, experience and knowledge 
to deliver the strategy of the Group during 
FY18. We remain, as ever, cognisant of the 
need for continued assessment of the Board 
and will keep under review the effectiveness, 
time commitment and tenure of each of 
our Directors.
I, on behalf of the Board, would like to thank 
you for your continued support and look 
forward to seeing many of you at our AGM 
on 15 November 2017.

The UK economy and housing market
The UK economy continued to grow, albeit 
more slowly than previously predicted, in 
the 12 months to 30 June 2017, with most 
economic indicators showing improvements 
on the prior year. The EU referendum result 
in June 2016 led to some initial uncertainty 
for the UK economy. The recovery of UK 
Government bond yields by December 2016, 
to levels similar to those seen prior to the EU 
referendum, indicated that the economic effect 
of the ‘leave’ decision was less significant than 
first predicted (source: BOE
3
). 
The UK housing market continued to show 
strength with UK residential housing 
transactions remaining at around 1.2 million 
transactions for the year to 30 June 2017, 
broadly in line with the prior year (source: 
HMRC
4
). 
Despite the volume of property transactions 
being flat year on year, the market for new 
homes remains strong with the housing 
market as a whole being characterised by 
continued strong demand and undersupply, 
supported by a positive lending environment 
and ongoing Government support.
Housing supply
In February 2017, the Government issued 
a Housing White Paper, called ‘Fixing Our 
Broken Housing Market’ aimed at reforming 
the housing market and boosting the supply  
of new homes in England. 
The most recent available data shows an

). Although housing supply is increasing, 
there remains a long term housing shortage 
compared to what is required to meet 
forecast demand. 
A combination of demand 
continuing to exceed supply,  
a positive lending environment 
and ongoing Government 
support meant that the market 
for new homes remained 
strong during FY17 .

House prices
The shortfall in the supply of housing stock 
and a continued availability of mortgage 
finance at low interest rates meant that house 
prices continued to rise in the year, although 
annual growth is lower than previous periods. 
The ONS
8
 house price index rose by an average 
of 4.9% per annum across the UK in the year 
to June 2017. The East of England showed 
the highest annual growth, where the ONS 
house price index rose by 7.2%, followed by 
the East Midlands at 7.1%. The lowest annual 
growth was in the North East, where prices 
increased by 2.5% over the year. According to 
the Halifax
2
, the UK average house price in 
June 2017 was £218,390, consistent with the 
average price in June 2016.
The higher end of the London market 
demonstrated some negative house price 
growth. Overall London house prices have 
shown a year on year fall of 1.4%, with inner 
London’s drop of 4.2% outweighing a 1.7% rise 
in outer London

.
Housing outlook
The underlying demand for new housing is 
expected to remain strong as supply is unlikely 
to meet demand in the medium term. We are 
committed to do our part to help address the 
existing undersupply in the market. 
The Government is committed to increasing 
the supply of new homes, and the Help to Buy 
(Equity Loan) scheme in place in England 
to 2021 will support an increase in new 
housing supply and provide certainty for both 
developers and purchasers. 
However, the nature of the UK’s departure 
from the EU continues to present a risk 
of uncertainty to the UK economy in the 
medium term. 
The DCLG household projections suggest that 
210,000 homes need to be built in England, 
each year to meet the growth in the number 
of households created across the period 
2014-2039 in addition to the backlog already 
in existence.
Obtaining implementable planning permission 
continues to be a constraint for new build 
developments. A number of amendments have 
been made to the planning system in recent 
years and in addition, measures set out in 
the Housing White Paper propose to simplify 
the planning process further. In the year to 
December 2016, there was an increase of 12% 
in planning approvals to 323,061 across Great 
Britain (source: HBF
5
). 
Mortgage availability and Help to Buy
Mortgage transaction volumes have decreased 
slightly since last year, primarily due to 
continued weakness in buy-to-let completions. 
In contrast, first-time buyer completions 
have increased. The number of mortgage 
approvals for house purchases decreased by 
6% to around 790,000 approvals in the year to 
June 2017 (source: BOE
6
). However, average 
quoted household interest rates are at record 
affordable levels, and this should continue to 
support housing activity (source: BOE
3
).
The Help to Buy (Equity Loan) scheme 
continues to be an important enabler for new 
housebuilding. The Help to Buy (Equity Loan) 
scheme has supported 120,864 property 
completions since its launch in April 2013 
to the end of March 2017 (source: DCLG
7
). 
The majority of these property completions, 
representing 81%, were to first-time buyers.

Housebuilding
Housebuilding results
The business performed well throughout 
the financial year and delivered against 
both its financial and operational targets. 
Market conditions remain supportive, 
with attractive mortgage financing and 
the support of Help to Buy driving strong 
consumer demand.
We are the UK’s largest housebuilder with 
total completions at 17,395 units including JV’s 
(2016: 17,319). Private completions increased 
by 0.8% to 13,303 (2016: 13,198), affordable 
completions were 3,342 (2016: 2,707), and 
JV completions in which the Group had an 
interest were 750 (2016: 1,414). 
We continue to increase the proportion 
of higher margin land completions which 
accounted for 92% (2016: 86%) of the total 
in the year and to trade through our legacy 
assets which has also contributed to the 
improvement in our gross margin. 
Total average selling price (‘ASP’) on 
completions in the year increased by 
6.0% to £275.2k (2016: £259.7k), with 
private ASP increasing by 8.0% to £313.1k 
(2016: £289.8k) benefiting from mix changes 
and underlying house price inflation. 
Completions in our London business were 
in line with expectations and weighted to the 
second half, consistent with planned site build 
programmes, resulting in a higher ASP in the 
second half of FY17. 
We lead the industry in the high 
quality of our homes and our 
customer service.

Chief Executive
Our results 
We have traded strongly throughout the financial year, delivering a record profit before 
tax of £765.1m, up 12.1% on the prior year (2016: £682.3m). We achieved our targets set 
in September 2014 of a 20% gross margin and 25% ROCE, with 2017 gross margin at 
20.0% (2016: 18.9%) and our highest ROCE in 12 years at 29.8% (2016: 27.1%). 
We have also continued to strengthen our Balance Sheet, ending the year with 
net cash of £723.7m (2016: £592.0m) and with net tangible assets of £3,430.0m 
(2016: £3,118.0m).

Our FY17 sales rate was 0.72 (2016: 0.69) net 
private reservations per active outlet per 
week in the full year and 0.76 (2016: 0.72) in the 
second half. During the year, we operated from 
an average of 377 active outlets including JV’s 
(2016: 378). 
Our share of profits from JV’s and associates 
in the year for the housebuilding business 
decreased to £26.5m (2016: £72.4m), reflecting 
planned site build programmes and some 
headwinds in the central London market. 
As at 30 June 2017 we were selling from 11 
(2016: 11) JV outlets. In FY18 we expect to deliver 
around 750 joint venture completions and our 
share of profits from JV’s to be around £25m.
Committed to building more high 
quality homes
We are dedicated to playing our part in 
addressing the UK’s housing shortage, 
whilst maintaining our quality standards, and 
designing developments, which look great, are 
a pleasure to live on, and will enhance local 
communities for years to come.
We lead the industry in the high quality of our 
homes and our customer service. That quality 
is recognised through the NHBC Pride in the 
Job Awards for site management where we 
have achieved more awards than any other 
housebuilder for the 13th consecutive year. 
We are also the only major housebuilder to 
be rated five star by our customers in the 
HBF customer satisfaction survey for eight 
consecutive years. 
We are committed to investing in the future of 
housebuilding. We continue to offer a range of 
graduate, apprentice and trainee programmes 
and are one of the largest employers of 
apprentices in the industry. In addition, we 
have successfully trialled a programme to 
recruit and train ex-forces personnel in site 
management. We also continue to develop, 
trial and implement modern methods 
of construction which can help address 
industry-wide skills challenges and support 
future growth. 
The key dimensions underpinning delivery 
of our strategy
In addition to the generally favourable market 
conditions during the year, the increase in our 
housebuilding profitability has benefited from 
our successful land investment strategy and 
from improvements in operating margin. 
Land and planning
A key factor in the growth of our housebuilding 
business in recent years has been our land 
investment strategy, which has boosted 
absolute profit and led to increased completion 
volumes. The land market remained attractive 
throughout the financial year and we secured 
excellent opportunities that exceeded our 
minimum hurdle rates of 20% gross margin 
and 25% site ROCE. In the period, we approved 
the purchase of £957.2m (2016: £1,095.6m) of 
land, equating 18,497 plots (2016: 24,387 plots). 
We expect to approve the purchase of over 
20,000 plots in FY18. 
We continue to target a regionally balanced 
land portfolio with a supply of owned land 
of c. 3.5 years and a further c. 1.0 year of 
controlled land. Our target for a shorter than 
sector average land bank reflects our focus 
on ROCE and our fast build and sell model. 
At 30 June 2017 we achieved this target with 
a 4.5 years land supply comprising 3.5 years 
owned land and 1.0 years controlled land, 
with the owned land bank including land with 
both outline and detailed planning consents. 
At 30 June 2017, the ASP of plots in our owned 
land bank was £265k.

Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Other Information
On strategic land we are making good 
progress and in FY17 we have achieved 
our mid-term target of delivering 25% of 
completions from strategic land. We target 
continued growth in the participation of 
strategically sourced land in the medium term, 
which will support future margin growth. 
Following our success with planning over the 
past 12 months we are very well positioned, 
with all of our expected FY18 completions 
(2016: 99.7% of FY17 completions) having 
outline or full planning consent.
Improving efficiency and reducing costs
Improving the efficiency of our operations and 
controlling costs continues to be a high priority 
for the Group, as it will further enhance 
our margin. 
In 2016, the Group undertook a fundamental 
review of its Barratt and David Wilson housing 
ranges. The outcome was a reduction in 
the number of houses in the range which 
will increase standardisation, simplify 
construction and reduce build costs whilst 
maintaining our high standards of design and 
build quality. There are currently 132 sites 
with c. 19,000 plots where we will be using 
the new ranges, of which 51 sites are already 
under construction. 
We have also focused on improving margins 
through further standardisation of our layouts, 
stopping the advance sale of show homes and 
through business process simplification. 
We have a robust and carefully managed 
supply chain with 90% of the housebuild 
materials sourced by our centralised 
procurement function manufactured or 
assembled in the UK. The cost of c. 75% of our 
centrally procured materials is now fixed until 
the end of FY18. 
On labour, whilst we continue to see some 
pressure on skilled labour supply with 
shortages remaining location and trade 
specific, the rate of cost increase has eased. 
We are also seeking to increase construction 
efficiency and reduce demand on labour 
through implementing the new housetype 
ranges which are easier to build and through 
the use of alternative build options such as 
timber frames, large format block and light 
gauge steel frames.
We continue to expect that overall build cost 
inflation for FY18 will be c. 3-4%. We carefully 
control our administrative cost base and 
expect administrative expenses to be around 
£150m for FY18 (2017: £132.8m). 
Commercial developments
Wilson Bowden Developments (‘WBD’) is our 
commercial development division. 
During the year, WBD completed a new 
logistics hub and a freehold sale. WBD are 
currently developing a logistics warehouse 
and an office and warehouse facility. We have 
also continued to make progress in leasing 
our retail schemes at Hinckley, and have 
completed its investment sale. 
Commercial development revenue was £61.1m 
(2016: £81.9m) with an operating profit before 
adjusting items of £10.2m (2016: £6.0m). 
After charging an £8.8m provision against a 
legacy commercial asset, we recognised an 
operating profit of £1.4m (2016: £6.0m). 
Health and safety
The health and safety of our people, 
contractors, customers and the general public 
is the Group’s number one priority.

Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Other Information
Increased activity levels across the industry 
in terms of site openings and production 
volumes combined with shortages of skilled 
staff has contributed to an increased risk of 
accidents on sites. We remain fully committed 
to the highest standards of health and safety 
on our sites. In the year, our reportable injury 
incidence rate has decreased slightly with 
379 (2016: 385) reportable incidents per 
100,000 employees. 
The tragic events at Grenfell Tower in London 
illustrate why health and safety must always 
remain the first priority for the building 
industry. Fire safety is core to the way we plan 
and build our developments. Following the 
fire at Grenfell Tower, we conducted a review 
of our sites and continue to ensure we 
are maintaining the highest standards of 
building safety.
Delivery of our strategic objectives
We delivered on our financial targets, set in 
September 2014, of a minimum ROCE of 25% 
and a 20% gross margin for FY17 and we are 
focused on making further progress. With our 
improved Capital Return Plan, announced 
with our interim results in February 2017, we 
continue to deliver attractive cash returns.
Our key financial metrics
Our housebuilding business achieved a gross 
margin of 20.2% (2016: 19.1%) up 1.1 ppts and 
an operating margin of 17.4% (2016: 15.9%) up 
1.5 ppts reflecting the improvements we have 
driven through the business, notwithstanding 
that the high-end London market presents  
some headwinds in this regard. The Group  
delivered a gross margin of 20.0% (2016:  
18.9%) and an operating margin of 17.2% 
(2016: 15.8%) up 1.4 ppts on the prior year. 
We have achieved our ROCE target with ROCE 
increasing by 2.7 ppts to 29.8% (2016: 27.1%). 
Contributing to this growth has been our 
increased operating profitability, use of land 
creditors and the disposal of our legacy shared 
equity interests. It remains a core part of our 
strategy to drive ROCE performance further, 
in line with our fast build and sell model.
Maintaining an appropriate 
capital structure
As at 30 June 2017, the Group had a net cash 
balance of £723.7m (2016: £592.0m), ahead 
of expectations, driven by strong performance 
and the timing of land and working capital 
payments. We expect to have low levels of 
average net debt throughout the year and FY18 
year-end net cash to be around £500m.
We seek to defer payment for land purchases 
where possible to drive a higher ROCE, and 
land creditors as at 30 June 2017 were 37% 
of the owned land bank (30 June 2016: 38%). 
We continue to secure attractive deferred 
payment terms on land and expect land 
creditors as a proportion of the owned 
land bank to reduce slightly and be around 
30-35% at 30 June 2018, in line with our 
operating framework.
The Group continues to maintain an 
appropriate financial structure with 
shareholders’ funds and land creditors funding 
the longer term requirements of the business 
and with term loans and bank debt funding 
shorter term requirements for working capital. 
In December, we further strengthened working 
capital capacity by amending and extending 
our existing revolving credit facility, removing 
the £150m stepdown in facility size previously 
due in December 2017 and extending our 
£700m facility to December 2021. 
In August 2017, the Group refinanced the 
maturing US$80m US Private Placement 
(USPP) with a new USPP of £200m, taking 
advantage of the current low interest rate 
environment. This has a ten year maturity with 
a fixed coupon of 2.77% which is significantly 
lower than the maturing USPP that had a 
fixed rate of interest of 8.14%. Following these 
financing changes we expect interest costs for 
FY18 to be around £50m of which c. £15m will 
be cash interest costs.
Net tangible assets were £3,430.0m (£3.40 per 
share) of which land net of land creditors and 
work in progress totalled £3,340.7m  
(£3.31 per share).
Capital Return Plan
In February, the Board announced that, given 
the significant operational and financial 
improvements the Group has made over the 
last few years, it would improve and extend 
the existing dividend plan announced in 
September 2014. As a result, the Group has 
improved the level of ordinary dividend cover 
from three times to two and a half times, and 
thereby increased the dividend payout ratio.
When market conditions allow, ordinary 
dividends will be supplemented with the 
payment of special dividends. The Board 
proposes to pay special dividends of £175m in 
November 2017 and November 2018. 
We are therefore delighted to propose a final 
dividend of 17.1 pence per share (2016: 12.3 
pence per share) resulting in a total ordinary 
dividend for the year up 33.3% to 24.4 pence 
per share (2016: 18.3 pence per share) and 
the third of our special dividends totalling 
£175.0m, equivalent to 17.3 pence per share. 
Both dividends will be paid on 20 November 
2017 to all shareholders on the register at the 
close of business on 27 October 2017.

similar proportion of completions as FY17.
We have industry leading quality and customer service, and talented employees whose 
outstanding contribution drives our success. I am proud to lead our first class team who are all

its housing shortage, with continued 
demand in the market and continued 
undersupply of new homes. Home 
buyers are supported by a good 
mortgage market in terms of both 
availability and rates, as well as the 
Government’s Help to Buy (Equity 
Loan) scheme in England, Scotland 
and Wales. 
The industry is seeking to increase 
volumes, maintain customer 
satisfaction and build quality and at 
the same time address the constraint 
created by a shortage of skilled people.
Why we measure
We measure customer service as our customers are 
key to our success as a business. The HBF Homebuilder 
survey is an industry recognised, independently 
measured indicator of both our customer service 
and build quality.
The survey is designed to provide home buyers with 
information about housebuilders to help guide their 
purchasing decision, and to encourage excellent levels 
of service to be delivered by housebuilders.

Customer satisfaction 
We place customers at the heart of everything 
we do, with their satisfaction being a key 
performance indicator at all levels of 
management. All of our team are responsible 
for delivering customer satisfaction and 
we operate a Customer Service Academy 
comprising both classroom and online training 
to ensure that our employees understand how 
to deliver, right first time, every time. 
We achieved the HBF 5 Star homebuilder 
award for the eighth year in succession which 
means that more than 90% of our customers 
stated that they would recommend us to 
friends and family. This is more than any 
other major housebuilder. We appreciate 
our customers’ feedback and our teams are 
committed to acting upon it. We continue 
to improve customer service, investing 
in technology from developments to our 
customer service systems and our onsite 
systems to aid our quality control inspections. 
We have reviewed our customer journey and 
automated where possible to speed up and 
streamline our sales process. This includes 
how customers reserve homes and 
personalise their new homes with choices 
and upgrades.
All our site managers perform quality 
inspections and record each stage of quality 
control using mobile tablets, and our customer 
service operatives use mobile tablets to 
manage any customer issues following legal 
completion. Management throughout the 
business are responsible for customer service 
and monitor customer satisfaction survey 
performance on a weekly basis.

to gather insight at every stage of our 
customer journey. This will encompass the 
whole end to end customer experience from 
initially browsing our website right through to 
moving in and beyond. The feedback gained 
so far has already informed how we support 
customers online and will continue to drive 
improvements and decision making as well 
as helping us to further align our business 
with customer needs.
Training
In support of our commitment to outstanding 
build quality we have invested in training and 
support for our site managers to ensure they 
have all the skills and tools that are required 
in order to deliver the highest quality homes. 
Our Customer Care teams have also benefited 
from a joint training initiative between us and 
the NHBC to improve how we manage any 
issues which occur after customers move in. Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Other Information

Securing the best land
We continue to see high quality land 
opportunities that exceed our required hurdle 
rates of a gross margin of 20% and a site 
ROCE of 25%. 
Our success in buying land is based on the 
extensive local knowledge of our divisional 
land teams and strong local relationships 
with landowners, combined with detailed 
assessments of local market conditions. 
We target locations based on the availability 
of land, housing market conditions and the 
likelihood of obtaining planning consent.
We continue to target a regionally balanced 
land portfolio with a supply of owned land 
of c. 3.5 years and a further c. 1.0 year of 
controlled land. Our target is for a shorter 
than sector average land bank reflecting 
our focus on ROCE and a fast build and sell 
model. At 30 June 2017 we achieved this target 
with a 4.5 year land supply (excluding JV’s) 
comprising 3.5 years owned land and 1.0 years 
controlled land, with the owned land bank 
including land with both outline and detailed 
planning consents.

Our land bank
The transformation of our land bank from 
older, lower margin land to more recently 
acquired higher margin land has progressed 
well. As at 30 June 2017, 95% (30 June 
2016: 93%) of our owned and controlled land 
is higher margin, newer land. On the 306 sites 
that we have acquired and completed since 
2009 we have achieved an average site gross 
margin of 20.8%, and an average site ROCE 
of 35.7%, demonstrating sustained delivery 
above our hurdle rates on this more recently 
acquired land. 
We maintained our progress in relation 
to strategic land where we see continued 
margin progression opportunities in the 
year. We approved the purchase of another 
1,568 strategic acres in FY17. The planning 
environment remains positive for strategic 
land. This, together with the strong local 
relationships developed by our 24 divisions 
outside London, mean we continue to see 
many high quality strategic opportunities.
Whilst maintaining a first class operational 
land bank, we remain focused on securing 
a longer term land pipeline through the 
acquisition of strategic land options. In the year 
6,757 plots (2016: 4,558 plots) were transferred 
from strategic land to our owned land bank 
and 25% of our completions (2016: 22%) during 
the year were on strategically sourced land, 
meeting our target. 
We use land creditors to defer payments for 
land acquisitions where appropriate to drive a 
higher ROCE and as at 30 June 2017, the land 
creditor position totalled £1,064.0m (30 June 
2016: £1,086.8m) representing 37% (30 June 
2016: 38%) of the owned land bank. We are 
targeting land creditors at 30% to 35% of the 
owned land bank for June 2018.  Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Other Information

Effective planning permission
Bringing land through the planning system 
quickly and into production is important to 
support our business objectives. We support 
the work the Government is currently 
doing to speed up the planning process, in 
particular in relation to quicker resolution 
of planning conditions which can hold up 
progress. A faster planning process will 
enable housing supply to increase more 
quickly. The preparation of local plans will 
help us unlock strategic sites awaiting local 
plan adoption. 
We have maintained good momentum in 
achieving planning consents and during the 
year we secured planning on 19,861 plots 
(2016: 20,249 plots). We now have full or outline 
planning permission in place for all of our 
expected completions in FY18 and 96.1% of 
expected completions in FY19.
Designing great places
Designing great places is fundamental to 
our business: our customers want to live 
in great places, the vendors of the land we 
purchase want to work with developers who 
leave behind a legacy of design quality and 
local people want developments that enhance 
their communities. 
We are pleased to announce that 20 of our 
developments have achieved Built for Life, 
(‘BfL ’) accreditation this year. From the 
schemes awarded, 12 attained the highest 
accolade of BfL ‘Outstanding’, having fulfilled 
all 12 of the urban design criteria.
Building for Life 12 is a Government endorsed 
industry standard for creating well-designed 
residential places. It sets out a framework 
promoting design quality that meets the 
objectives of attractive, functional and 
sustainable urban design.
Our internal design manual, Great Places, 
reflects these 12 principles and ensures 
consistent great design across our 
developments. The awards reinforce our 
commitment to better placemaking and a 
legacy of delivering residential schemes 
that we can all be proud of.
Over the years, 56 of our developments 
have achieved BfL accreditation and 14 have 
attained ‘Outstanding’ status.
We are focused upon ‘placemaking’ 
throughout our business and use our internal 
‘Great Places’ design standards, assessing 
every development against these at the pre-
application stage. Our ‘Great Places’ design 
standards are aligned to the requirements of 
Building for Life 12 and we run annual awards 
to recognise our best developments. We also 
review our development layouts to ensure they 
achieve both design quality and efficient land 
use, and have an internal urban design team 
to provide specialist expertise.

NHBC Pride in the Job Awards on our sites. 
This is the 13th consecutive year that we have 
won more of these awards than any other 
housebuilder, making us the clear industry 
leader in site management. 
Innovating to improve efficiency
The majority of our homes are built with 
traditional brick and block construction, 
although we continue to increase the use 
of offsite construction on some of our sites. 
During the year we completed successful 
multi-site trials using a Large Format 
Block System which is more efficient to 
put together than traditional construction 
methods, reduces our reliance on certain sub-
contractor trades and allows consistent flow of 
delivery. Following last year’s small scale trial 
using Light Gauge Steel Frames, we have also 
commenced full trials during 2017. In addition, 
we have built 1,270 plots using timber frames 
during the year.
We are constantly engaging with our suppliers 
to find, understand and consider innovative 
products and services that can be used to 
increase our efficiency onsite whilst still 
maintaining our high quality and customer 
satisfaction requirements.

Partnering with our supply chain
We have a centralised procurement team 
which has built long term relationships with 
our suppliers. This ensures the consistency 
of specification and technical performance of 
the materials used in our homes. Long term 
relationships have enabled us to ensure the 
continuous availability of materials as demand 
increased. We also use many local sub-
contractors in the construction of our homes, 
with whom our divisions partner at a local level 
to ensure the availability of the skilled trades 
that we require.
We engage in continuous communication with 
our suppliers and hold regular performance 
and business reviews, training days and an 
annual supplier conference. We are a signatory 
of the Prompt Payment Code. 
We purchase substantial amounts of timber 
and have implemented a sustainable 
procurement and timber sourcing policy. 
Since December 2013, all timber and 
timber products that we purchase via group 
agreements are FSC/PEFC certified and 
originate from well managed forestry sources. 
Further information is available in the Group’s 
Sustainability Report for 2017.
We are also researching smart technologies 
and their use in future homes to improve the 
ability of customers to save energy.
Large Format Block 
SIG plc
We partnered with our supplier, SIG plc, 
on their Large Format Block System trial 
which is part of their ‘SIG I House System’, 
a large masonry solution which reduces 
the workload of the bricklayer and delivers 
speed benefits similar to our other offsite or 
panelised systems. The two key benefits to 
this system are that our sub-contractors are 
familiar with the traditional masonry of the 
solution and the ‘I House’ team deliver the 
wall, floor, roof and insulation as a holistic 
solution. We have trialled this approach on 
five sites and delivered 103 houses within our 
West Midlands and North Midlands divisions.

Employee retention
During the year, employee turnover increased 
by 1% to 18% (2016: 17%). There is significant 
demand and many opportunities for skilled 
employees elsewhere in the industry. 
We therefore continue to focus upon developing 
talent within our business, including succession 
planning, to ensure that we have the necessary 
skills within our business for continued 
operational delivery, as well as focusing on 
remuneration and benefits to ensure retention 
measures are in place and are effective. 
Talent of the Future
Through the continual running and focus on the 
quality of our ASPIRE graduate scheme, our 
construction degree run in partnership with 
Sheffield Hallam University and our Apprentice 
programme, we continue to offer a diverse 
range of options for graduates, apprentices 
and trainees through our Barratt Future Talent 
programmes. In response to the Government’s 
Apprenticeship Levy scheme, we have worked 
with the HBF, Federation of Master Builders, 
and housebuilding peers on the trailblazer 
programmes to develop new apprenticeship 
standards for apprenticeship levels 3–6. 
We have worked with our Apprentice champions 
to ensure our programmes deliver quality 
tradespeople. Our 12 month leaver completion 
rate continues to rise reaching 79% for the year 
compared to 58% in March 2016.
We have successfully trialled a programme 
which resulted in the recruitment of ex-forces 
personnel and a training programme to enable 
them to transition into site management. We have 
recruited 43 construction trainees via this route, 
some of whom had little or no construction 
experience and are proving to be outstanding 
leaders. We have invested in our employees, 
including recruiting 184 new apprentices, 
trainees, graduates and undergraduates in

Greig Mills
Greig Mills completed our dedicated  
ex-forces personnel training programme 
at the end of last year and is now working 
as an assistant site manager at Barratt 
Homes’ Hawthorn Rise development in 
Newton Abbott. He said: “Forward-thinking 
companies like Barratt Homes really 
appreciate the skills that ex-forces personnel 
have. There are a lot of attributes you develop 
in the forces that translate well to the 
construction industry, like strong leadership, 
and it’s a fun sector to be in. 
The buzz you get from seeing the finishing 
touches go on a house is rewarding and it’s 
great to do a job that has a physical aspect to 
it too.” Greig found the training programme 
so good that he recommended it to his 
former colleagues from the Royal Marines, 
Ross Pearson and Ross Carey. Both were 
taken on by Barratt Homes in the latest wave 
of its training programme and are currently 
training to become assistant site managers.

Equipping the business with  
the relevant skills
To ensure we continue to deliver results we 
need to enable us to successfully introduce 
and embed changes in our business, equipping 
our people with the skills to manage change 
successfully is a key priority for us. We have 
developed a Project and Change Management 
toolkit and development programme, which 
contains a series of tools and steps which we 
are now using to ensure a robust and reliable 
approach to managing projects. Around 30 
people involved in our key business projects 
have taken part in workshops to date, which 
is supporting the changes we’re making in 
our business. 
Diversity and inclusion
We are committed to delivering our Diversity 
and Inclusion Strategy and we are working 
with a group of employee representatives as 
well as external consultants, drawing upon a 
major survey of our employees to inform our 
activities. We have identified broad targets 
in areas such as gender, family, ethnicity, 
disability and sexual orientation/gender 
reassignment and our aim is to improve our 
diversity and inclusion in all of these areas in 
the next three years. Our senior managers 
have received awareness training and all 
colleagues will have access to Diversity and 
Inclusion training in the next year. We have 
reviewed our family friendly policies, updating 
our maternity, paternity, adoption and shared 
parental leave policies to provide enhanced 
benefits to employees who become parents. 
We recognise that flexible working can 
help us retain talented employees and can 
be particularly beneficial for those with 
caring responsibilities, so we are piloting a 
new flexible working approach in some of 
our divisions. As previously highlighted, in 
2015, we successfully trialled a programme 
which resulted in the recruitment of ex-
forces personnel.

The challenge and our response
Increased activity levels across the industry in 
terms of site openings and production volumes 
combined with shortages of skilled staff has 
contributed to an increased risk of accidents 
on sites. We maintain stringent safety 
standards and have a continuous focus on 
health and safety with all areas and levels of 
the business focusing upon it as their number 
one priority. Getting the basics right, good 
leadership, and commitment to health and 
safety from all levels of management is what 
delivers good health and safety performance 
in our business. Health and safety is our 
number one priority and our aim is to have an 
injury-free workplace. We believe all injuries 
are avoidable and while we recognise that 
entirely eradicating risk is difficult we are 
determined to improve our performance and 
reduce the number of injuries occurring in our 
working environment. 
Our Safety, Health and Environmental 
management system (‘SHE’) is subject to 
continuous review and improvement. 
All of our trading divisions are certified 
to OHSAS 18001 and adhere to our SHE 
guidelines with their ongoing compliance 
being verified by a programme of internal and 
external audits. During the year, we carried 
out 6,990 (2016: 6,184) monitoring visits and 
achieved an average compliance rate of 96% 
(2016: 96%). Our overall aim is to have an 
injury free working environment, our objective 
for the year was to have an improvement in 
our reportable Injury Incidence Rate (‘IIR’). 
During the year, our IIR decreased to 379 
(2016: 385) per 100,000 persons employed 
(including sub-contractors). We have 
continued to operate our 5 Steps to Safety 
Campaign and during the year have reviewed 
and restructured our health and safety training 
strategy for employees at all levels within 
our business, in order to continue to seek to 
improve our performance. 
Our site managers have again been successful 
at the NHBC Health and Safety Awards, 
achieving seven commendations and two going 
on to receive the highly commended status.

Being a trusted partner
Our principle
We build meaningful, long 
term relationships that make 
us the developer of choice 
for our partners. We are 
innovating with our supply 
chain to drive efficiency and 
meet our customers’ needs.

Introduction of supplier evaluation  
and development programme
The challenge and our response
Housebuilding is a long term business and 
the development of sustained business 
partnerships with landowners, suppliers 
and sub-contractors, is critical to  
our success. 
We continue to work with private landowners, 
operators and agents to identify and bring 
forward land for development. Divisional land 
teams continue to work hard to ensure that we 
are regarded as the housebuilder of choice by 
the local landowners and agency community. 
We recognise that our suppliers and sub-
contractors are critical to the delivery of 
our strategic objectives and we invest in our 
relationships with them. We hold an annual 
national supply chain conference, setting 
out strategic objectives and challenges. 
We also hold regular review meetings with 
our suppliers, seeking to develop long term 
business relationships and a preferred 
customer status. We have recently introduced 
a new, ‘supplier evaluation and development 
programme’, we believe the first of its type in 
the industry. This programme will be rolled 
out across our most important suppliers 
during 2017. 
We work with our suppliers to help them to 
introduce the new technologies that we need 
to meet increasingly challenging building 
standards, improve build efficiency and 
address skills shortages. We also work with 
our sub-contractors to help them to improve 
their environmental and safety performance.

Our principles continued
Building strong community relationships
Our principle
We engage fully with 
local communities and 
customers when creating 
new developments. 
We seek to ensure that 
our work creates a positive 
legacy that helps local 
communities to thrive.
Key highlights
Contributed £3.3bn of Gross Value 
Added to the UK economic output
Won 56 Built for Life accreditations 
for excellence in community design
Raised over £1.1m for national and local 
community charities
The challenge and our response
We don’t just build homes, we build 
communities. To enable this to happen we 
put great emphasis on building relationships 
with existing communities, making sure they 
are involved and fully engaged in what we are 
doing. We deliver substantial benefits to local 
communities. This year we provided 3,087 
school places and funded more than 40 sports, 
leisure, health and youth facilities. By building 
communities, homes and local infrastructure 
we are also supporting thousands of jobs. 
This year through direct, indirect and induced 
employment we supported more than 53,400 
jobs and contributed some £3.3bn of Gross 
Value Added to the UK’s economic output.
Equally important is to have strong 
relationships with landowners and local 
authorities. In combination with close 
community involvement, it means that 95% 
of our homes are consented locally without 
planning appeals. This success is built on 
comprehensive local consultation whereby the 
focus is always on listening, the whole of the 
community is invited to participate and public 
exhibitions are held at times when people can 
attend so we can secure the widest possible 
range of views. 
Part of building strong communities is the 
care we put into designing them from the 
outset. By creating great places that leave 
a legacy for future generations we enhance 
communities for years to come. This can be 
seen in the success we have had with the 
industry design standard Building for Life 
12. These principles are designed to give 
the home buyer confidence that important 
design elements have been checked during 
the planning process. Currently we have won 
56 Built for Life accreditations, which is more 
than every other housebuilder combined. 
Schools are the future of a community which 
is why we work closely with them on a range of 
initiatives. We recently launched a new health 
and safety programme for schools designed 
to highlight the hazards of construction sites, 
with tailored resources for both teachers 
and pupils. We also support communities 
through charitable donations and fundraising 
for local initiatives. Around the country our 
27 divisions, commercial developments 
business and Group support functions have 
worked hard raising money for chosen 
charities, from traditional sports dinners and 
blind auctions, to golf days, sponsored walks 
and even an afternoon tea on the Queen’s 
birthday. The Barratt Charity Plan allows any 
fundraising for a chosen charity to be matched 
by up to £10,000. Barratt has also made 
several donations in response to emergencies 
throughout the year, giving money to support 
victims of the Croydon tram crash, the 
terrorist attacks in London and Manchester 
and the Grenfell Tower fire. This has meant 
that overall the Group has raised over £1.1m 
for national and local community charities.
Our Mercia division has recently opened a community building at its Baggeridge Village development in Sedgley. The 
community building is being used as a workshop for the Wolverhampton and District Model Engineering Society which 
operates a miniature railway in Baggeridge Country Park for visitors.

Safeguarding the environment
Our principle
We strive to minimise the 
environmental impact of our 
operations and supply chain, 
which increases the energy 
and resource efficiency 
of our homes. We seek 
to enhance habitats, 
biodiversity and local 
environments across  
all of our developments.
Key highlights
Reduced gross tonnage of construction 
waste by 15,160 tonnes in 12 months
We have reduced waste intensity by 
13%¹ compared to 2015, achieving our 
2020 target three years early
95% of construction waste segregated 
onsite for recycling (2016: 95%)
Carbon intensity reduced by 3% 
to 2.17 tonnes CO
2
 per 1,000 sq. ft. 
(2016: 2.23 tonnes)
51% of new developments have a 
biodiversity action plan (2016: 30%)
The challenge and our response
As the demand for new housing increases, we 
recognise the need for our business to become 
more resource and energy efficient and to 
produce less waste and generate fewer carbon 
emissions. With less available brownfield plots 
to build on (brownfield completions reduced 
by 7% on 2016), there is a need to protect and 
enhance biodiversity on developments. All of 
our divisions are certified to ISO 14001, the 
environmental management standard. 
Designing out construction waste
We have successfully reversed a trend in 
rising construction waste intensity – the 
amount we create for each 1,000 sq. ft. built on 
construction sites. This has been achieved 
through prioritising waste tonnage reduction, 
in partnership with our waste management 
contractor, and identifying ways to design out 
waste, in addition to continued rigour on waste 
segregation and recycling. 
By completing a study to determine the root 
cause of waste, at our Saxton Gate site, York, 
we have identified further opportunities for 
improvement in the years ahead.
We segregate waste for recycling as standard 
across our sites and have achieved a recycling 
rate of 95% (2016: 95%) for the year.
Being energy efficient and  
reducing emissions
Our direct and indirect operational greenhouse 
gas emissions are shown in the table. This is 
based on the energy used in our offices, on 
our live developments and for business 
travel. We are now reporting a market-
based figure for Scope 2 emissions² – this 
shows carbon dioxide equivalent emissions 
based on the generation mix of our specific 
electricity suppliers.

Our operational greenhouse gas emissions have reduced to 2.17 (2016: 2.23) tonnes of emissions 
per 1,000 sq. ft. this year. We continue to drive awareness of energy efficiency and carbon 
reduction, seeking to continuously improve performance across our business.
As part of our partnership with the RSPB 
and one of our suppliers we have created 
a new swift nest box in a brick format 
which offer a safe nesting space for swifts 
and house sparrows. The first of these 
swift bricks have just been fitted at our 
Kingsbrook development in Aylesbury.
1  Measured in tonnes per 1,000 sq. ft. Target is to reduce construction 
waste intensity by 10% by 2020 against a 2015 baseline.
2  In line with the revised Greenhouse Gas Reporting Protocol we are 
reporting Location based and Market Based Scope 2 electricity 
data. Market based data is based on the actual electricity generation 
source. Location based refers to the average grid electricity carbon 
emissions equivalent.
3  Greenhouse gas emissions are reported in line with UK Government’s 
‘Environmental Reporting Guidelines: including mandatory greenhouse 
gas emissions reporting guidance’ (dated June 2013) and has used 
the greenhouse gas (GHG) emission factors outlined in the DECC ‘UK 
Government conversion factors for Company Reporting’ , Version 1 (June 
2016). We measure Scope 1 fuel combusted on our sites, offices and 
company owned vehicles, plus refrigerant losses; Scope 2: Purchased 
electricity for our sites and offices; Scope 3: business travel by car , rail 
and air and office and site electricity transmission and distribution losses.
Enhancing habitats, biodiversity and local 
environments across our developments
We are partnering with CIRIA to draft guidance 
on the good practice principles for Biodiversity 
Net Gain. We released our ‘Growing with 
Nature’ landscaping and planting guide drafted 
in partnership with RSPB, which helps ensure 
that biodiversity is considered from project 
inception through to completion. We have 
continued our unique national partnership 
with the RSPB, the UK’s largest nature 
conservation charity. During the year within our 
developments, 430 (2016: 521) hectares of open 
space were created and 617,708 (2016: 638,136) 
trees or shrubs were planted or retained. 38       Barratt Developments PLC – Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Net cash and capital structure
We maintain an appropriate capital structure, 
with land and long term work in progress 
funded by shareholders’ funds and land 
creditors, and with net cash at our year 
end. During the year we generated £388.6m 
(2016: £652.9m) of cash inflow from operating 
activities and £65.9m (2016: £12.7m) of cash 
inflow from investing activities. This was 
in part applied to £428.1m (2016: £268.0m) 
of financing activities: of which £321.7m 
(2016: £263.2m) related to dividends paid 
during the year. Together with opening cash of 
£758.0m, the Group’s net cash increase in the 
year of £26.4m led to closing cash of £784.4m 
and net cash at 30 June 2017 of £723.7m 
(2016: £592.0m). At 30 June 2017 land creditors 
were 37% (2016: 38%) of the owned land bank. 
 
As we make scheduled payments on agreed 
new land and build work in progress to deliver 
spring 2018 completions, we expect net cash 
at 31 December 2017 to be in line with normal 
seasonal trends (31 December 2016: £196.7m). 
It remains our objective for FY18 to maintain an 
appropriate capital structure with year end net 
cash and land creditors at 30% to 35% of the 
owned land bank.
Capital Return Plan
The Board proposes to pay a final ordinary 
dividend of 17.1 pence (2016: 12.3 pence) 
per share for the financial year ended 
30 June 2017, which subject to shareholder 
approval, will be paid on 20 November 2017 
to shareholders on the register at the close of 
business on 27 October 2017. Together with 
the interim ordinary dividend of 7.3 pence per 
share, which was paid in the year, this gives 
a total ordinary dividend for the year of 24.4 
pence per share (2016: 18.3 pence per share). 
The ordinary dividend was covered around two 
and a half times by basic earnings per share. 
Under the special cash payment programme 
the Board is proposing a payment of £175.0m 
(17.3 pence per share), which subject to 
shareholder approval, will be paid by way 
of a special dividend on 20 November 2017 
to shareholders on the register at the close 
of business on 27 October 2017. The Board 
anticipates a further payment of £175.0m to 
be proposed with our FY18 results payable 
in November 2018. 
In total, the Capital Return Plan is expected to 
return around £1.4bn of cash through ordinary 
dividends (based on consensus earnings) 
and special dividends to the Company’s 
shareholders over the four years ending 
November 2018 of which £632.4m has already 
been paid.
Return on capital employed
The Group’s fast build and sell model, 
supported by a relatively short consented 
land bank, deferred payment terms, high 
levels of standard product, and the ability 
to sell through our David Wilson Homes and 
Barratt brands on larger sites, is focused 
on driving ROCE.
For FY17 ROCE increased by 2.7 ppts to 29.8% 
(2016: 27.1%). This growth benefited from rates 
of profit growth continuing to grow ahead of 
working capital growth rates and a continued 
reduction in our legacy assets, including 
the disposal of our investment in a portfolio 
of non-current available for share loans 
previously held in a joint venture.

Roles and responsibilities 
The Board is responsible for the overall stewardship of our 
system of risk management and internal control. It has 
undertaken a robust assessment of the principal risks in our 
business and has established the appropriate level of risk that 
is acceptable in the pursuit of our strategic objectives and has 
set appropriate policies to govern this. The Board, as part of its 
regular risk assessment procedures also takes into account the 
significance of environmental, social and governance matters to 
the business of the Company. Based on the regular and adequate 
information provided to the Board on such matters, it identified 
and assessed the significant risks to the Company’s short and 
long term value as well as potential opportunities to enhance 
value that may arise from an appropriate response to matters. 
It has also set delegated authority levels to provide the executive 
framework for assessing risks and ensuring that they are 
escalated to the appropriate levels of management, including up 
to the Board where appropriate, for consideration and approval.
The roles and responsibilities of the Board, its committees and 
all levels of management from a risk management perspective 
are summarised on this page:

Why and how our risks change
The principal risks identified either separately 
or in combination could have a material 
adverse effect on the implementation of 
the Group strategy, our business, financial 
performance, shareholder value and returns 
and reputation.
Reputational risk could potentially arise 
from a number of sources including external 
and internal influences relating to the 
housebuilding sector which when combined 
or over a period of time could create a new 
principal risk. The Group actively manages 
the impact of reputational risk by carefully 
assessing the potential impact of all the 
principal risks and implementing mitigation 
actions to minimise those risks.
The Group is committed to safeguarding the 
environment in which it operates and assesses 
climate change risks as set out in our 
Climate Change Policy online and our annual 
submission to the Carbon Disclosure Project.
Principal risks probability assessment
Whilst the principal risks for the Group related 
to the execution of its business strategy have 
not fundamentally changed, the likelihood of 
the risk factors occurring can change.
The diagram on this page shows the estimated 
likelihood of each principal risk following 
our risk mitigation review and strategies 
implemented in both 2016 and 2017. 
The principal risks the Group has identified 
are not listed by order of importance and 
the illustration on the probability does not 
consider the relative size of any associated 
financial or reputational impact of each item.

impact
Changes in the UK and European 
macroeconomic environments, including 
but not limited to, flat or negative 
economic growth, inflation, interest 
rates, buyer confidence, mortgage 
availability, Government backed 
schemes, competitor pricing, falls in 
house prices or land values, may lead to 
a falling demand or lower price achieved 
for houses, which in turn could result in 
impairments of the Group’s inventories, 
goodwill and intangible assets.
The ability to secure sufficient consented 
land and strategic land options at an 
appropriate cost and quality to provide 
profitable growth.
Unavailability of sufficient borrowing 
facilities to enable the servicing of 
liabilities (including pension funding) and 
the inability to refinance facilities as they 
fall due, obtain surety bonds, or comply 
with borrowing covenants. Furthermore, 
there are risks from management of 
working capital such as conditional 
contracts, build costs, joint ventures 
and the cash flows related to them.
The ability to recruit and/or retain 
employees with the appropriate skills 
or sufficient numbers of such employees.
Shortages or increased costs of 
materials and skilled labour, the 
failure of a key supplier or the inability 
to secure supplies upon appropriate 
credit terms could increase costs and 
delay construction.

The 
opportunity
The majority of our customers 
require mortgages to purchase their 
new home. Buyer confidence, the 
availability of mortgages and mortgage 
interest rates are affected by the 
economic environment.
Securing more sites that at least meet 
our hurdle rates of a minimum 20% gross 
margin and 25% site ROCE will enable 
disciplined volume growth.
Availability of sufficient committed and 
surety facilities ensures that the Group 
can manage changes in the economic 
environment and take advantage of 
appropriate land buying and operational 
opportunities to help deliver sustainable 
shareholder value.
Development of skilled employees is 
critical to deliver the Group’s strategy 
of disciplined growth, improving key 
financial metrics through a focus on 
efficiency and the continued delivery 
of attractive cash returns.
Maintaining sufficient material and 
skilled sub-contractor availability will 
enable disciplined volume growth.

Potential 
impact
Inability to adhere to the increasingly 
stringent and complex regulatory 
environment, including planning and 
technical requirements and time taken 
to obtain planning approval affects 
the housing market and generally 
the regulatory requirements.
Failure to identify and achieve key 
construction milestones, due to factors 
including the impact of adverse weather 
conditions, identify cost overruns 
promptly, design and construction 
defects, and exposure to environmental 
liabilities, which could delay construction, 
increase costs, reduce selling prices 
and result in litigation and uninsured 
losses. There are also risks associated 
with climate change and the use of new 
technology in the build process  
e.g. materials related to carbon reduction.
Large development projects, some of 
which involve joint ventures or consortia 
arrangements and/or commercial 
developments, are complex and capital 
intensive and changes may negatively 
impact upon cash flows or returns.
Health and safety or environmental 
breaches can result in injuries to 
employees, sub-contractors and site 
visitors, causing potential reputational 
damage, criminal prosecution and 
civil litigation, delays in construction 
or increased costs.
Failure of any of the Group’s IT systems 
in particular those relating to surveying 
and valuation, could adversely impact the 
performance of the Group.

Managing risk – availability of raw materials, sub-contractors and suppliers
Housebuilding is a long term business and the 
development of sustained business partnerships 
with suppliers and sub-contractors, is critical to 
our success. The failure of a key supplier in our 
supply chain or the inability to secure supplies 
when they are required, could increase costs 
and delay construction. The risk to our supply 
chain is categorised into three principal areas: 
commercial risk, continuity of supply risk and 
reputational risk.
The commercial risk relates to the risk of 
increasing cost inflation in our supply base. 
The Group manage this risk by implementing 
Group-wide supply arrangements for key raw 
materials required in the construction process. 
Such arrangements allow us to ensure the 
continuity of our supplies as well as maximising 
the leverage of our market position. The Group 
have long term trading relationships with our 
suppliers, and with a centralised procurement 
team invest in those relationships through 
constant engagement. This promotes stability 
in our supplier base and a degree of certainty of 
the supply of raw materials as well as ensuring 
the costs of supplies remain competitive. 
The Group perform benchmarking on market 
prices to identify and continually strive on areas 
for improvement in our supply chain. We are 
developing market intelligence on commodity 
prices to ensure we continue to plan and react 
appropriately to potential future cost increases in 
our raw materials in the short to medium term. 
Continuity of supply relates to risk of the 
availability of raw materials, suppliers and 
sub-contractors when the business requires 
them. We recognise that our suppliers and 
sub-contractors are critical to the delivery of 
our strategic objectives. The Group works with 
suppliers to ensure that we are sourcing the most 
sustainable products and services, in order to 
maintain the high quality build standards required 
for the longer term.
We are the industry leader in sharing information 
on our production programme with our supply 
chain. This enables suppliers to plan accordingly, 
well in advance, to meet our demand and their 
capacity. These relationships with suppliers 
have been built up over a long period of working 
together as partners. Through our long term 
relationships, we aim to establish ourselves 
as the preferred customer with our suppliers. 
This constant focus on long term relationships 
means that we are able to benefit in periods 
of short term market supply shortage. 
We continually evaluate all of our supply markets 
in order to develop appropriate sourcing strategies 
for each of our supply inputs, be that single or 
multi supplier sourcing, to ensure we have the 
ability to meet construction demand across our 
business when required for each product or sub-
contractor skilled trade. 
During the year, the Group introduced a 
new, ‘supplier evaluation and development 
programme’, which we believe is the first of its 
type in the industry. This programme is used to 
assess the capability of our suppliers so that we 
can ensure continuity of supply over the medium 
term. This programme will be rolled out across 
our most important suppliers during the rest 
of 2017. 
The failure of a key supplier, sub-contractor or 
the inability to source raw materials in our supply 
chain could impact the quality and or timing of 
construction, which in turn could impact on our 
customer’s experience of our product offering. 
We put customer satisfaction at the heart of 
our construction processes with a focus upon 
getting it right first time and have continued to 
be recognised as a 5 Star homebuilder by the 
HBF for eight consecutive years. We require all 
of our Group suppliers to be members of the 
Supply Chain Sustainability School developing 
sustainability knowledge and practices within 
our supplier base. The School provides a tailored 
self-assessment and action planning tool which 
identifies which sustainability issues suppliers 
should prioritise and supports suppliers in 
addressing these issues. Our supply chain is 
an extremely important part of our business 
and we recognise any failures in this area could 
present a reputational risk to the business which 
the Group needs to constantly stay alert to and 
manage accordingly.
Viability Statement
In accordance with provision C.2.2 of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code 2016, the Directors 
have assessed the prospects and financial viability 
of the Group, taking into account both its current 
position and circumstances, and the potential 
impact of its principal risks. The Directors 
consider that a three year period is appropriate 
for this assessment.
The Group’s objective is for a shorter than 
sector average land bank reflecting its focus on 
return on capital and a fast build and sell model. 
Our target is a regionally balanced land portfolio 
with a supply of owned land of c. 3.5 years and a 
further 1.0 years of controlled land. Accordingly, 
we consider it appropriate that our viability review 
period is broadly aligned with the expected 
longevity of our owned land supply. 
By using a three year timeframe, the Viability 
Statement review period is also aligned with 
the Group’s bottom up three year planning and 
forecasting cycle, during which a wide range 
of information relating to present and future 
business conditions is considered, including those 
impacting on expected profitability, cash flows, and 
funding requirements.
The Group considers it is subject to a number of 
principal risks (as set out in more detail in pages 42 
to 43, and its Viability Statement review considers 
the impact that these risks (particularly those 
related to the economic environment and liquidity) 
might have on its ability to meet its targets. This is 
undertaken through the performance of sensitivity 
testing, using appropriately challenging scenarios 
which reflect severe but plausible impacts 
based on current market conditions and applying 
estimates for the impact of these risks to ensure 
that the quantified mitigation actions available to it 
are sufficient. This process involves consideration 
of the impact of our chosen scenarios on key 
business drivers, including the volume of legal 
completions achieved, average selling prices and 
build costs. Several scenarios are modelled to 
ensure that the Board can carefully evaluate the 
range of plausible outcomes being assessed and 
mitigation factors are based on those identified 
and successfully deployed during the previous 
downturn in 2007-2008 following the ‘credit crisis’. 
Based on this review, the Directors confirm that 
they have a reasonable expectation that the Group 
will be able to continue in operation and meet 
its liabilities as they fall due over this three-
year period.
New risks
No new principal risks have emerged during the financial year
Increased risk profile Why?
None n/a
Decreased risk profile Why?
 Liquidity The Group’s average level of debt has continued to decrease during the financial 
year, and in December 2016 the Group extended its £700.0m revolving credit 
facility to 2021. The Group entered into a new fixed rate £200.0m US private 
placement on 22 August 2017 .

Corporate governance report – Introduction and Overview
Leadership
Your Board is collectively responsible for the long term success of 
your Company. The roles are clearly defined with Executive Directors 
managing the business on a day to day basis and the Non-Executive 
Directors providing an appropriate level of scrutiny, challenge and 
support. In this way proposals relating to strategy, performance, 
responsibility and accountability are constructively challenged and the 
Board ensures that all decisions are well considered, justified and of 
the highest quality. In addition, Board processes are set up to ensure 
adequate oversight of the implementation of those decisions.
This section details the structure and composition of the Board and its 
Committees, how responsibilities are divided amongst the Board, its 
Committees and individual Directors, the main activities of the Board in 
FY17 and its main focus areas for FY18 in addition to the induction process 
for new Directors. 
Effectiveness
Your Board continuously reviews its balance of skills, experience, 
independence and knowledge to ensure it remains in the best possible 
position to discharge its duties and responsibilities effectively. 
The Board undertakes an annual evaluation of its own effectiveness 
and that of its Committees and of individual Directors. 
This section outlines the internal Board evaluation process 
undertaken in FY17 and the outcomes. It also sets out the progress 
made on the actions arising from the FY16 external evaluation. 
Accountability
Your Board is mindful of the risk environment in which it operates 
when making any decisions. It maintains sound risk management and 
internal control systems and regularly reviews the principal risks and 
assesses the appropriate appetite for risk in striving to achieve the 
Company’s strategic objectives.
This section details the Board’s approach to risk management, its 
internal controls and risk management systems and its processes for 
evaluating that the Annual Report and Accounts of the Company are 
fair, balanced and understandable. 
Relations with shareholders
Your Board recognises the importance of maintaining open dialogue 
with its shareholders, both private and institutional. A number of 
events and communications take place on an annual basis to regularly 
communicate with shareholders and gain feedback on matters such 
as remuneration and governance.
This section summarises how the Board and individual Directors 
engaged with shareholders throughout FY17 and how shareholders 
can communicate with the Company. 
Remuneration
The Board, through its Remuneration Committee, has established 
a formal and transparent procedure for developing its policy on 
executive remuneration. The Group’s Remuneration Policy that 
operated throughout the year was presented to, and approved by, 
shareholders at the 2014 AGM and is designed to promote the long 
term success of the Group. 
This section sets out the Group’s revised Remuneration Policy which 
will be presented to shareholders for approval at the 2017 AGM, how 
the current policy operated during FY17 and how it will be applied 
in FY18. The new policy will be effective immediately on approval 
by shareholders.

Corporate governance report – Leadership continued
Corporate Governance Statement
The Board confirms that during the year ended 30 June 2017, and as at the date of this report, 
the Company has fully complied with the main and supporting principles of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code (the ‘Code’) issued in September 2016 (a copy of which is available from 
www.frc.org.uk). This report, together with the other statutory disclosures, and the reports 
from the Audit, Nomination, Safety, Health and Environment and Remuneration Committees, 
provide details of how the Company has applied the principles and complied with the provisions 
of the Code during the year under review. We describe how we have applied the main principles 
throughout pages 48 to 105. 
The Company has also complied with the requirements under the Disclosure Guidance 
and Transparency Rules, the Listing Rules and the BIS Directors’ Remuneration Reporting 
regulations and narrative reporting requirements. 
Board balance
The names, responsibilities and other details of each of the Directors of the Board are set out 
on pages 46 and 47 with the composition of the Board on page 49. The Board believes it has an 
appropriate balance of Executive and independent Non-Executive Directors having regard to the 
size and nature of the business. In addition, the combination of the experience and calibre of the 
Non-Executive Directors collectively, having regard to their diverse backgrounds, experience 
and their varying lengths of service, further enhances this balance and mitigates the risk of 
‘ group think’. During the year, the Nomination Committee conducted a review of the balance of 
skills and experience on the Board. The outcome of the review was that, in general, the Board 
has the appropriate balance of skills and experience to deliver Group Strategy, however, it 
could further benefit from the addition of a Non-Executive Director with experience of the wider 
housing environment.
Board independence
The Company recognises the importance of its Non-Executive Directors remaining independent 
throughout their appointment, as it enables them to provide objective advice and guidance to the 
Executive Directors (and Senior Management) through the application of their wide business and 
commercial experience and diverse backgrounds. This independence allows the Non-Executive 
Directors to constructively challenge and scrutinise the performance of the Executive Directors 
and provide an independent perspective on business strategy, performance and the integrity of 
the financial information considered by the Board and disclosed to the Company’s shareholders. 
In addition, their independence is of the utmost importance when considering the appointment 
or removal of Executive Directors and in the determination of succession planning for Board 
positions and other Senior Management roles within the Group. All Non-Executive Directors 
remained independent in character and judgement during the financial year. It was confirmed 
as part of the annual conflict of interests review that none of the Non-Executive Directors have 
business or other relationships with the Group (or other outside interests) that might influence 
their independence or judgement. Given that Tessa Bamford is currently serving her third three 
year term on the Board, her independence was subject to particularly rigorous review. The Board 
was satisfied that she continues to be independent and commits satisfactory time to her role as a 
Non-Executive Director.
Details of the Directors’ interests in shares of the Company are contained in Table 21 on page 99 
of the Remuneration report.
John Allan was considered to be independent on appointment to the Board and on taking up the 
role of Chairman. As part of the FY17 annual review of the Chairman’s effectiveness, the Non-
Executive Directors led by Richard Akers, as Senior Independent Director, considered John’s 
other significant commitments and confirmed that they do not impinge upon his availability 
to fulfil his duties to the Company. John Allan has demonstrated this throughout the year by 
ensuring full attendance at each of the Board and Committee meetings, being available to Board 
members whenever required and spending time out in the business and within the Group’s 
corporate office in London. John Allan continues to show dedication to his role and commits the 
time necessary to discharge his duties. 
In addition, in accordance with the requirements of the Code, the Chairman met at least once 
with the Non-Executive Directors independently of the Executive Directors. The Non-Executive 
Directors meet without the Executive Directors being present usually prior to or immediately 
following Committee meetings.

Induction
Board visits
Each year the Board collectively visits two regions which are selected on a rotational basis. 
During FY17 these visits were to the Central region and the London and Southern region. 
At each of these regions the Board met with Senior Management who provided an overview 
of the regional business including their business plan, customer service levels, employee 
turnover and engagement and other operational matters.
As part of their visit to the London and Southern region, the Board also visited the Group’s 
development at Cane Hill Park, Coulsdon, Surrey. Cane Hill Park is a large brownfield 
regeneration site acquired from the HCA on which we are developing 659 units (494 private 
residential units and 165 affordable units) under both the Barratt and David Wilson Homes 
brands. Both brands are piloting the use of modern methods of construction, primarily 
timber frame and light gauge steel frames on some of their units.
On joining the Company, each new Director participates in a full and formal induction process. 
The aim of the induction is to assist the Director to familiarise themselves with the business 
and its culture, in addition to the roles and responsibilities of the Board and each member of 
Senior Management. Site and divisional/functional visits are arranged so the Group’s business 
is seen in operation. Each new Director is provided with an induction pack containing general 
and specific information relating to their role such as a schedule of meetings, copies of Board 
minutes, terms of reference of the Committees upon which they will serve and other Committee 
specific information, various policies and procedures, details of their duties as a Director of a 
listed plc and other obligations under the various regulations governing the Company. During  
the financial year under review, the Company completed the induction of Jock Lennox to the 
role of Non-Executive Director and Chairman of the Audit Committee. Details of his induction 
were reported in the 2016 Annual Report and Accounts. As Jessica White was previously Group 
Financial Controller, she already has an extensive understanding of the business. She will still, 
however, be subject to a thorough and formal induction process which will take place throughout 
FY18 and be reported on in the 2018 Annual Report and Accounts.

Board and Committee evaluation
In accordance with the Code, the Board is responsible for undertaking a formal and rigorous annual evaluation of its own performance and that of its Committees and individual Directors. For FY16 
the Board undertook the review with the assistance of Ffion Hague of Independent Board Evaluation who has no other connection with the Company. 
Progress on FY16 evaluation
We reported the outcomes of the Board evaluation for the last financial year in the 2016 Annual Report and Accounts. Details of progress made on these are set out below.
Table 2 – The Board

In conjunction with Spencer Stuart, an external Board and 
executive leadership consultant, assessments have been 
undertaken of a number of individuals across the business to 
identify those with the potential to ‘step up’ to the next level.
A Diversity and Inclusion Forum has been formed to focus on 
increasing awareness of diversity and inclusion. Training on 
diversity has started to be rolled out across the business and 
initiatives to attract individuals from various backgrounds, 
such as ex-forces, into the industry have been launched. 
‘Family friendly’ policies, such as maternity and paternity 
policies, have also been reviewed to ensure that they are in 
line with good market practice.
Presentations on the topics identified have been included in 
the Board’s schedule of presentations for the year .
The Company Secretary provides an update on regulatory, 
legislative or best practice changes at each Board meeting.
Each Board meeting is now followed by a strategy session. The 
topics covered in FY17 ranged from Government policy and planning 
to increasing volume, retaining and attracting talent and the skills 
shortage, and improving margin.

FY17 Board performance evaluation 
Following the external review in FY16, it was agreed to undertake the evaluation internally 
for FY17. The Chairman of the Board led the evaluation process, supported by the 
Company Secretary. 
Board and Committee evaluation process
The Company Secretary issued questionnaires to Board and Committee members and to 
individuals who attend the Committee meetings on a regular basis. The questionnaire looked at 
a variety of areas including, among other matters, the composition of the Board and Committees, 
the advice and support provided, the focus of meetings and top three priorities for the next year.
The Company Secretary collated the results of the questionnaires and provided a summary 
to each of the Chairmen. The results were then discussed between Board and Committee 
members respectively at their meetings. 
FY17 Internal Board effectiveness evaluation outcomes 
The results of the evaluation were generally positive and showed that the Board is running 
effectively. The Board is seen as being cohesive and comprising of the appropriate balance of 
experience, skills and knowledge to implement the Group’s strategy over the next few years. 
Board meetings operate in a spirit of openness, fostered by the Chairman, in which Directors 
are able to challenge and discuss openly ideas of importance to the Group and its strategy. 
Members of the Board felt that the new arrangements for deep dive strategy discussions at 
each Board meeting (rather than one offsite strategy day) ensured a detailed discussion of each 
strategic area of focus and greater integration of strategy into the running of the Group. 
Table 4 – Areas of improvement for the Board
Succession planning Relationship with suppliers and customers Risk, culture and behaviours
FY17 outcomes Continue to focus on identifying successors for Executive 
Directors and Senior Management.
More interaction with shareholders, suppliers and  
customers to gain a better understanding of their  
views and requirements.
To further develop risk oversight processes and monitor culture and 
behaviours throughout the organisation.

and work with the individuals identified with the potential to 
progress to Senior Management or Board level.
Establish a calendar of events that Non-Executive  
Directors could attend to meet with shareholders,  
suppliers and customers.
To continue to focus on the Group’s culture, behaviours and appetite 
to risk.
Table 5 – Areas of improvement for the Committees 
Nomination Committee Audit Committee Remuneration Committee
FY17 outcomes Increase the focus on succession for Executive Directors and 
Senior Management.
To focus more on risk at a strategic level and reduce the 
length of the meeting packs.
To reduce the focus on the detail and concentrate more on the bigger 
picture to speed up the decision making process.

Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Other Information
Evaluation of the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors
The evaluation of the effectiveness of the Chairman was conducted by the Senior Independent 
Director with assistance from the Company Secretary. A questionnaire was issued to each Board 
member and the result was unanimous support for the Chairman. Of particular note was how 
supportive the Chairman is of other Directors and his wish to listen to all contributions during 
the course of a debate. In addition, Board members found him engaging and encouraging of 
building Board cohesion through activities outside of formal Board meetings. The Directors 
were complimentary of the way in which the Chairman managed his other commitments, always 
ensuring sufficient time is given to his role with the Company. The Senior Independent Director 
shared the feedback with the Board (without the Chairman being present) before discussing it 
with the Chairman. 
The Chairman held one to one meetings with each Director to assess their effectiveness and to 
agree any areas of improvement or training and development, including on environmental social 
and governance matters. There were no issues of any substance arising from this review. 
Information and support
The Chairman, with the assistance of the Company Secretary, ensures that the Board receives 
accurate, timely and clear information. Each Director is issued with an agenda, briefing papers 
and comprehensive operating and financial management reports for the period under review, 
generally five working days before any Board meeting. The Company Secretary attends all 
Board and Committee meetings and all Directors have access to her advice and, if necessary, 
to independent professional advice at the Company’s expense to assist with the discharge of 
their responsibilities as Directors.
All Directors are provided with a rolling two-year schedule of proposed meeting dates. 
Any Director who is unable to attend a meeting is invited to provide their views to the Chairman 
ahead of that meeting, having reviewed the agenda, briefing papers and management 
information. Reasons for non-attendance are recorded by the Company Secretary and either 
she or the Chairman will meet with any absent Director to go through any action points which 
are of relevance. Formal minutes of each Board meeting are prepared, circulated and submitted 
for approval at the next meeting.
Training
The Chairman regularly reviews training requirements of, and annually agrees development 
needs with, individual Directors. A number of internal presentations and updates are provided to 
Directors as part of the Board and strategy agenda. This forms part of the training the Directors 
receive for their role. Subjects are chosen based on their impact on the business and include 
(but are not limited to) general economic and market updates, Government and regulatory 
environment, our customers, financial updates and planning, Modern Methods of Construction 
and sales and product development.
Internal controls and risk management
In accordance with provision C.2.3. of the Code, the Board monitors and regularly reviews 
the effectiveness of the Group’s system of internal controls, including those related to the 
material financial, operational and compliance performance, and risk management systems 
(see the Audit Committee report on pages 65 to 73). A risk framework has been developed for 
all business processes by the Internal Audit function and approved by the Audit Committee. 
This framework forms the basis of the internal control audit plan for the year ahead, which tests 
if key controls are being applied effectively in each operating division. Material issues identified 
during internal audits and follow-up action plans are reviewed by the Executive Directors and 
by the Board on a quarterly basis. Any necessary actions are immediately taken to remedy any 
significant failings in the internal control system.
The Group’s system of internal controls is designed to manage risks that may impede the 
achievement of the Group’s business objectives rather than to eliminate those risks entirely. 
The system of internal controls therefore provides only reasonable, not absolute, assurance against 
material misstatement or loss. The system of internal controls does, however, provide reasonable 
assurance that potential issues can be identified promptly and appropriate remedial action taken. 
Further details can be found in the risk management section of the Strategic Report (pages 40 to 44). 
We continue to cooperate fully with the Metropolitan Police on the ongoing investigation we 
instigated regarding possible misconduct in the London business. As stated in October 2016, Barratt 
does not anticipate any material adverse financial effect and our London business is operating well.
The Group operates internal controls to ensure that the Group’s Financial Statements are 
reconciled to the underlying financial ledgers. A review of the consolidated accounts and 
Financial Statements is completed by management to ensure that the financial position and 
results of the Group are appropriately reflected.
The Board has not identified, nor been advised of, any failings or weaknesses which it has 
determined to be significant. Therefore, a confirmation of necessary actions has not been 
considered appropriate.
Fair, balanced and understandable
As part of its considerations, the Board reflected upon the feedback shareholders provided 
in respect of our 2016 Annual Report and Accounts. It also set aside adequate time to review 
and discuss significant areas of the 2017 Annual Report and Accounts. 
The Board assessed the tone, balance and language of the document being mindful of the 
requirements of the Code and the need for consistency between the narrative section of the Annual 
Report and the Financial Statements in arriving at its conclusion. It also received a paper from 
the Company Secretary explaining the process that had been undertaken to provide assurance 
to the Audit Committee that the report was ‘Fair, balanced and understandable’. The Board’s 
formal statement on the Annual Report and Accounts being fair, balanced and understandable is 
contained within the Director’s Responsibility Statement on page 112. The process undertaken by 
the Audit Committee to assist the Board in assessing if the Annual Report and Accounts were fair, 
balanced and understandable can be found on page 69. Following recommendation from the Audit 
Committee, the paper from the Company Secretary and its own reflections, the Board was happy 
to endorse the recommendations of the Audit Committee.

Relations with shareholders
The Board recognises the importance of having an effective relationship with its shareholders 
and other stakeholders. The Group has arrangements in place which enable it to communicate 
effectively with shareholders in respect of business strategy, governance, remuneration and any 
Senior Management or Board changes. It also conducts regular institutional investor meetings 
after the release of the annual and half year results and following the publication of each of our 
trading updates. 
Trading updates
The Company is fully aware that the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules have removed 
the requirement for companies to publish interim management statements to the market in 
between the full and half year results. We undertook a review of our reporting frequency in FY16 
and, given the cyclical nature of our business, we continue to believe that it is important that we 
keep our shareholders fully informed of the performance of the business on a regular basis. 
In addition, given that we only publish short trading updates four times a year, two of which are 
in preparation for the half and full year results, the burden on management time is not deemed 
to be excessive. We will therefore continue to publish trading updates in FY18 four times a year 
whilst keeping the position under review. 
Any announcement published via the Regulatory Information Service including the half year 
and annual results, trading updates and other Company announcements can be found on the 
Company’s website at www.barrattdevelopments.co.uk/investors. 
Board updates
In order to ensure that all Directors are aware of, and have a clear understanding of, the views 
of major shareholders, the Chief Financial Officer or in her absence, the Chief Executive, reports 
regularly to the Board on the Company’s investor relations activities, including updates from 
the Company’s brokers. Additionally, the Company’s brokers presented an analysis of investor 
feedback during the year under review.
Investor meetings
The executive team meet regularly with investors and analysts in order to convey an 
understanding of the market and the Group’s operations and objectives. These meetings take 
place throughout the year but particularly after the annual and half year results announcements. 
In FY17, the Directors attended a total of 146 investor meetings (130 one to one meetings and 16 
group meetings). In addition, they attended a number of conferences and investor roadshows in 
the UK and the US. The Chairman and other Non-Executive Directors also have the opportunity 
to attend meetings with major shareholders at the request of either party. The Senior 
Independent Director is also available to meet with major shareholders, as and when required, 
to gain an understanding of any issues and concerns. During FY17, the Chairman held calls with 
major shareholders on request following the announcement of Neil Cooper leaving the business 
and Jessica White’s appointment as Chief Financial Officer. In addition, the Chairman of the 
Remuneration Committee consulted with major shareholders on remuneration policy and its 
implementation, as he does annually.

The values of an organisation are 
largely influenced by the people leading 
it. By appointing the right people 
to the Board a culture of honesty, 
openness and diversity can be achieved 
throughout the business. 
John Allan
Nomination Committee Chairman
Statement from the Chairman of the Nomination Committee
I am pleased to present the Nomination Committee report for the financial year ended 30 June 
2017. The Nomination Committee continues to play a vital role in ensuring that not only the 
Board, but the senior leadership team comprises the right individuals to plan and implement 
the strategy of the Group. A number of recommendations have been made by the FRC and 
other key organisations for Nomination Committees to focus on. Issues, relating to diversity, 
including gender, ethnicity and race. The Nomination Committee fully supports the aims of these 
recommendations and will take appropriate action as opportunities present.
Skills and experience of the Board
Ensuring the Group is led by a first rate Board, operating in a responsive, open and transparent 
culture is our prime focus. We undertook an assessment of the tenure and length of service of 
the Non-Executive Directors and of the skills and experience of the Board needed to deliver the 
strategy of the Group. The review highlighted the potential for appointing an additional Non-
Executive Director with experience in the wider housing environment such as in central or local 
Government, Housing Association or strategic and public policy. Accordingly, we embarked on 
the recruitment process for a new Non-Executive Director. Details of the recruitment process 
can be found on page 62.
Chief Financial Officer
A key focus for the Nomination Committee for the year under review has been the recruitment of 
a new Chief Financial Officer. Details of the recruitment process and how the role was fulfilled in 
the interim can be found on page 62.
Membership of the Nomination Committee
The Nomination Committee also reviewed its membership in comparison to other FTSE 100 
companies during the year. Consequently, it was agreed that David Thomas would step down 
as a member with effect from 30 June 2017. The members of the Committee are now therefore 
myself and the independent Non-Executive Directors. 
Diversity and inclusion
During the year under review we have made good progress with our diversity and inclusion 
programme. Further information can be found on page 64. 
Succession planning
As highlighted from the effectiveness review, we will continue to focus on succession planning 
for Executive Directors and senior managerial roles during the next financial year.

Appointment and re-appointment of Directors 
The Nomination Committee leads the process for appointments to the Board and makes 
recommendations to the Board when suitable candidates have been identified. When a vacancy 
arises the Nomination Committee evaluates the balance of skills, experience, independence 
and knowledge on the Board and considers this against current and future needs to deliver 
its strategy. It then prepares a description of the roles and capabilities required for that 
appointment. The search for Board candidates is carried out, and appointments made, on merit 
with due regard for Board diversity and the need to maintain an appropriate balance of skills and 
experience. External recruitment consultants are used where appropriate.
During FY17 the Nomination Committee identified the requirement to appoint an additional 
Non-Executive Director to the Board with experience in the wider housing environment. 
Accordingly, Odgers Berndtson, an independent recruitment agency with no other connection 
to the Company, have been appointed to assist with the search for a new Non-Executive Director. 
The Board delegated authority to John Allan and Richard Akers to oversee the process and 
accordingly they have reviewed a longlist of candidates. Odgers Berndtson are currently in the 
process of compiling a shortlist from which candidates will be selected for interview with John 
Allan and Richard Akers in the first instance. Details of any appointment made as a result of this 
process will be announced via a Regulatory Information Service at the appropriate time.
Chief Financial Officer
As announced on 19 January 2017, Neil Cooper left the business by mutual agreement. 
The Nomination Committee immediately embarked on a search to find a suitable replacement. 
David Thomas, who had previously held the position of Group Finance Director, temporarily  
re-assumed responsibility for the finance function. David was ably supported by the Group 
Financial Controller and the Housebuilding Financial Controller during this time. In addition, 
Steven Boyes, Deputy Chief Executive and Chief Operating Officer, supported David with his 
ongoing executive responsibilities. The Chairman and the Board, being conscious of the need 
to maintain good governance practices throughout this period, assessed the robustness and 
effectiveness of the Group’s internal controls and procedures to ensure that they remained 
appropriate to mitigate against any significant risks arising during the period David fulfilled this 
dual role. To further enhance the controls and procedures around land acquisitions during this 
period, John Allan and Richard Akers, in their capacity as Chairman and Senior Independent 
Director, attended the Land Committee meetings on a weekly basis and played a primary role 
in challenging the proposals brought forward by the divisions.
In February 2017, the Nomination Committee delegated authority to David Thomas, John Allan 
and Jock Lennox to lead the search for a new Chief Financial Officer. Subsequently, Russell 
Reynolds, an independent recruitment agency with no other connection to the Company, 
were appointed to assist with the search. Russell Reynolds produced a short list of potential 
candidates which were reviewed by David Thomas, John Allan and Jock Lennox together with 
Rob Tansey, the Group HR Director. A desktop benchmarking exercise was undertaken on 
all of the external candidates, and it was noted that some of the shortlisted candidates had 
been considered for the position in 2015 prior to the appointment of Neil Cooper. In addition, 
applications were received from three internal candidates. The experience, skills and 
knowledge of each of the internal candidates was considered and it was agreed that only one 
of them, Jessica White, the then Group Financial Controller, would progress to the next stage. 
Jessica was put through a rigorous assessment process with Russell Reynolds to allow her to be 
benchmarked against the external candidates. She was also interviewed by each of the members 
of the Board and of the Executive Committee. Feedback from this process confirmed that due 
to her extensive knowledge of the business, the respect in which she is held by other employees 
throughout the organisation and her past track record as Group Financial Controller, Jessica 
was the best candidate for the position of Chief Financial Officer. Accordingly, the Nomination 
Committee recommended to the Board that a formal offer of appointment be made to her. 
This recommendation was unanimously endorsed by the Board. Accordingly, on 22 June 2017, 
Jessica was appointed as the Chief Financial Officer of the Group. Annual Report and Accounts 2017 – Barratt Developments PLC     63
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Other Information
Re-appointment of Non-Executive Directors
Non-Executive Directors are appointed by the Board for an initial three-year term and normally 
serve a second three-year term, subject to re-election by shareholders and statutory provisions 
relating to the removal of Directors. Beyond this a third term of up to three years may be 
served subject to particularly rigorous review and taking into account the need for progressive 
refreshment of the Board. The Articles, in accordance with the Code, require any Non-Executive 
Director who has served nine years or more on the Board continuously to be subject to annual 
re-appointment. 
The letters of appointment of all Non-Executive Directors (alongside the service contracts for the 
Executive Directors) are available for inspection by any person at the Company’s registered office 
during normal office hours or via the Company’s website (www.barrattdevelopments.co.uk). 
Copies will also be available at the 2017 AGM for 15 minutes before and throughout the 
meeting. The letters of appointment clearly set out the time commitment expected from each 
Non-Executive Director to ensure they satisfactorily perform their duties. The required time 
commitment is reviewed annually by the Board. Each Non-Executive Director confirms that 
they are able to allocate the time commitment required at the time of their appointment and 
thereafter as part of their individual annual effectiveness review undertaken by the Chairman.
During the year, with John Allan absenting, the Nomination Committee considered the re-
appointment of John Allan as Chairman. The Nomination Committee was satisfied that John 
continues to dedicate sufficient time to his duties as Chairman and John confirmed that he 
would continue to do so. Furthermore, the Committee were satisfied that John had no other 
relationship or circumstance that would affect the performance of his role. Accordingly, the  
re-appointment of John Allan for a second three-year term was recommended to the Board, 
which it fully endorsed.
Retirement and re-election of Directors
The Articles currently require Directors to submit themselves for re-election by shareholders 
at the first AGM following their initial appointment to the Board and thereafter at intervals of no 
more than three years. All Board members will, however, in accordance with the Code, stand for 
election or re-election, as appropriate, by shareholders at the 2017 AGM irrespective of their date 
of appointment and length of service on the Board.
Biographical details of each of the Directors and supporting statements for their re-election 
are set out on pages 46 and 47 of this report and in the Notice of the 2017 AGM. Details of the 
Executive Directors’ service contracts can be found in the Remuneration report on page 87. 
Each of the Directors has been subject to a formal performance evaluation process including 
the appropriateness of a particular Director’s experience and the effectiveness with which 
such experience is utilised in furthering the Company’s business. Following these reviews, the 
Nomination Committee, and the Board, are satisfied that each Director continues to be effective 
in, and demonstrate commitment to, their respective roles. The Board, in the light of the results 
of the performance evaluation and the breadth of experience demonstrated by each Director’s 
biography set out on pages 46 and 47, therefore recommends that shareholders approve the 
resolutions to be put forward at the 2017 AGM relating to the election or re-election of the 
Directors as applicable.
Succession planning – Executive Directors
During the year, the Board undertook its annual review of the Group’s succession plans. 
This involves a review of the succession for Executive Directors and other Senior Management 
roles below Board level. The aim of this review is to identify suitable individuals who are capable 
of filling senior managerial positions on a medium and long term basis, whilst ensuring their 
development needs are identified and addressed. It also seeks to ensure that the Board’s future 
needs are met. As part of their development, Senior Managers who are not of Board level will be 
invited to attend part of a Board meeting to present on their specialist area. This also enables the 
Board to assess the quality of internal talent and for the individual to get a greater understanding 
of the workings of the Board. 
The Nomination Committee plays an active part in this process. 
Succession planning – Non-Executive Directors
The Nomination Committee reviews annually the length of service of the Non-Executive 
Directors and holds conversations with the longer serving members to create a plan for the 
progressive refreshment of the Board as necessary. 
Directors’ conflict of interests
The Board has, in accordance with the Articles and best practice guidelines, authorised the 
Nomination Committee to oversee the process for reviewing and making recommendations to 
the Board concerning any actual or potential conflict of interests which may arise for any Board 
member, including details of any terms and conditions which it deems necessary to impose on 
any authorisation given. This process was carried out satisfactorily during the year in respect of 
all Directors. 
The Company Secretary maintains a register of Directors’ conflict of interests which is 
reviewed annually with recommendations made to the Board in respect of any changes to the 
authorisations that may be required. The register of conflicts is reviewed at each Board meeting 
in order that each Director can review their entries and immediately notify the Chairman and/
or the Board of any new conflict or potential conflict and of any change in circumstances relating 
to authorisations already given. The Board, when authorising any conflict or possible conflict of 
interests, does not count in the quorum the Director whose conflict or possible conflict is being 
discussed and reserves the right to exclude a Director from a meeting whilst a conflict or possible 
conflict is being considered. The Board may revoke or vary any authorisation at any time. 64       Barratt Developments PLC – Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Nomination Committee report continued
Board diversity policy
During the year, the Nomination Committee reviewed the Group’s policy on diversity, including 
professional, international and gender diversity. This policy was also considered by the Board. 
The Nomination Committee’s primary goal remains to identify the most suitable candidate to join 
the Board and for other senior positions within the Group. However, it also seeks to ensure that, 
in managing an appointment and in succession planning, it has regard to the benefits of diversity, 
including but not restricted to gender diversity and its impact on effective decision making. 
In terms of gender diversity the Board will continue to work only with recruitment search 
consultants who have adopted a voluntary code of conduct addressing gender diversity. 
Going forward recruitment search consultants will be required to identify and present potential 
candidates in accordance with the Parker review and its recommendations regarding the ethnic 
diversity of boards. 
The Board notes that in his report published October 2015, Lord Davies increased the target for 
women on boards from 25% to 33%. Whilst the Board appreciates the benefits that can be gained 
from gender diversity, it has agreed not to impose a gender balance quota preferring instead to 
appoint strictly on merit as it did with the appointment of Jessica White. In addition, the Board 
are aware of the requirements of the Hampton-Alexander review, the Parker review and the 
McGregor-Smith review. Details as required by the Hampton-Alexander review can be found on 
page 33. In respect of the recommendation of the Parker and the McGregor-Smith reviews, work 
is currently underway to collate data and amend processes (as necessary). Information on the 
steps taken will be published in the 2018 Annual Report and Accounts. 
The Nomination Committee and the Board do recognise the need to ensure that the business 
reflects a diverse workforce, at all levels of seniority, whilst always seeking to ensure that each 
post is offered to the best available candidate. Promoting diversity at a Senior Management level 
and more generally within the workforce is an objective for the Chief Executive and HR Director. 
Progress has been made with promoting diversity within the business (see page 33, Diversity 
and inclusion).

Audit Committee Chairman
Statement from the Chairman of the Audit Committee
I am pleased to present to you my first Audit Committee report as Chairman of the Audit 
Committee. During my first year, I have spent time meeting with senior financial management, 
internal audit and the external auditor. I have attended meetings with various parts of the 
business and visited regions and divisions in order to fully understand key controls and 
processes and to see their application. In addition, I visited a number of sites and met with 
a variety of regional, divisional and functional management.
Tender of external audit and tax compliance and advisory services
During the year ended 30 June 2017, we have conducted a full tender exercise of our external 
audit in line with the UK Corporate Governance Code and the provisions of the CMI Order 2014. 
We also tendered the Group’s tax compliance and advisory services. More information on both 
of these items can be found on pages 72 and 73 respectively.
Risk management
We continue to monitor our risk management processes and during the year each business 
function developed or updated their risk registers. These registers set out the key risks currently 
affecting that function, the likelihood and impact of that risk and the mitigation in place. They are 
reviewed twice a year and are also assessed by the internal audit team as part of the internal 
audit process. Each risk register is also presented to the Risk Committee as part of a functional 
update at least once a year. The Chief Internal Auditor notifies the Audit Committee of any issues 
identified by the Risk Committee as part of their review. Our focus going forward is to further 
embed risk management into day to day management processes. 
In conjunction with this, we have also undertaken a detailed review of all of our policies, 
processes and procedures. These have been updated to ensure that they accurately reflect 
current practices and are easy to understand and follow. To ensure compliance with our policies, 
all senior and middle management have confirmed, in writing, that they and their teams, have 
read and understood the policies appropriate to their role and that they have been complied 
with. In addition, our delegation of authorities matrix has been simplified in an attempt to avoid 
confusion. Both the Group policies and the delegation of authority matrix have been refreshed 
and re-published to the business on the Group’s intranet, during the year under review. 
Key activities in FY17
Throughout the year under review we held frequent discussions on key accounting judgements 
ensuring that they remain appropriate to the Group’s financial reporting. We had in-depth 
sessions with Senior Management on a variety of topics important to the business including: 
cyber security and the EU General Data Protection Regulation to fully understand the practical 
aspects of the important issues facing the Group including their related risks, accounting 
judgements and policies. As with any business, there are areas where employees will be 
required to make individual judgements. We continually monitor these areas in order to ensure 
that they are appropriately treated and controlled and do not promote inappropriate behaviours.

As an Audit Committee we have been given our authority by the Board and we act in accordance

Corporate Governance Code and followed the best practice guidance set out by the FRC. 
In performing our role we work closely with both internal and external audit teams in order 
to ensure our internal control processes remain robust, our financial reporting remains clear 
and concise and our accounting judgements are appropriate.
Areas of focus for FY18
FY18 will no doubt be another busy year. Our priorities are to:
(i)  continue to develop processes and reporting in respect of IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts 
with Customers’, IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’ and IFRS 16 ‘Leases’, which will impact the 
Group in FY19;
(ii)  continue to monitor the cyber security risks for the business and ensure that the business is 
in a position to defend itself as the types of cyber attacks evolve;
(iii)  ensure that the business is fully prepared for the EU General Data Protection Regulation; and
(iv)  continue to review the Group’s principal risks and uncertainties as Brexit unfolds and the new 
Government takes shape and adapt accordingly.

Membership and attendance at Audit Committee meetings
In compliance with the Code, the Committee comprises exclusively of Non-Executive Directors 
and each member is considered to be independent by the Company. John Allan is not a member 
of the Audit Committee. The Board is satisfied that, Jock Lennox has recent and relevant 
financial experience to Chair the Audit Committee. Jock Lennox succeeded Mark Rolfe as Chair 
of the Audit Committee on 16 November 2016. Jock is a chartered accountant and chairman of 
another listed Company Audit Committee and is therefore well qualified to undertake this role 
effectively. As part of the effectiveness review, the Nomination Committee was satisfied that 
the Audit Committee as a whole has competence relevant to the sector in which we operate. 
There were four scheduled meetings during the year. Details of the members and attendance at 
each of the meetings is shown in Table 8 and the biographies and qualifications of the members 
are shown on pages 46 to 47.

The significant issues considered by the Audit Committee during the financial year and how each 
of them was addressed were as follows:
Going concern
The Audit Committee:
 > assessed the Group’s available facilities, headroom and banking covenants;
 > reviewed management’s detailed analysis, which included forecasts and scenarios considering 
potential downturns in the housing market; 
 > satisfied itself, and subsequently the Board, that the going concern basis of preparation 
continues to be appropriate in the context of the Group’s funding and liquidity position; 
 > considered the going concern requirements of the Code to ensure compliance; and
 > continued to monitor market conditions following the UK’s decision to leave the EU and the 
outcome of the General Election to ensure any appropriate adjustments are made to the 
Group’s strategic and financial planning.
Further details on the Group’s going concern assessment can be found on page 124.
Financial reporting
The Audit Committee reviewed the integrity of the Financial Statements of the Group and the 
Company and all formal announcements relating to the Group’s and Company’s financial 
performance. This process included the assessment of the following primary areas of 
judgement and took into account the views of Deloitte LLP. Annual Report and Accounts 2017 – Barratt Developments PLC     69
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Other Information
Significant critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty for FY17 remained unchanged from FY16 and include:
Significant financial estimates for FY17
Carrying value of land and work in progress Goodwill and intangible assets impairment review
Land and WIP are the most significant assets of the Group and as at 30 June 2017 were carried at £4,404.7m 
(see note 3. 1 to the Financial Statements). The Group undertakes housebuilding and commercial development 
and the majority of activity carried out is not forward sold before development is commenced. Accordingly, there 
is a risk that land and WIP may be held at a value in excess of the lower of cost and net realisable (sale) value. 
The Group conducts half yearly reviews of land and WIP carrying value and if the estimated net realisable value 
is lower than the carrying value, it impairs the land and WIP value.
The Group has £792.2m of goodwill and £100.0m of intangible assets which arose upon the acquisition of 
Wilson Bowden (see note 4.2 to the Financial Statements). The Group reviews the carrying value of these assets 
on an annual basis to ensure that the present value of the future cash flows that the housebuilding business 
is expected to generate is greater than the carrying value of these assets. This review includes a number of 
judgements around the estimation of future cash flows and the determination of an appropriate rate with 
which to discount these cash flows. 
How the Audit Committee addressed those estimates
Carrying value of land and work in progress valuation Goodwill and intangible assets impairment review
The Audit Committee considered land and WIP accounting estimate review papers at its August 2016, February 
and June 2017 meetings. These outlined the review process undertaken and the estimates made with regards 
to the estimation of further sales proceeds and further build costs. Deloitte LLP reported upon land and WIP 
carrying value at the February and August meetings in the context of the half year review and year end audit. 
Following detailed consideration of the accounting estimates papers and the findings of Deloitte LLP , the Audit 
Committee agreed with the estimates made by management and concluded that the carrying value of our land 
and WIP remains appropriate.
The Audit Committee considered a paper on goodwill and intangible assets accounting estimates at its August 
meeting. This outlined the assumptions made, the sources for these assumptions, and the resulting valuation. 
Deloitte LLP reported upon goodwill and intangible assets valuation also at the February and August meetings 
in the context of the half year review and year end audit. Following detailed consideration of the Material 
Accounting Policies, Estimates and Judgements paper and the findings of Deloitte LLP , the Audit Committee 
agreed with the estimates made by management and concluded that the valuation of goodwill and intangible 
assets remains appropriate.
2017 Annual Report and Accounts: fair, balanced and understandable
The Audit Committee undertook a detailed review of the process undertaken in drafting the 
Annual Report and Accounts to support its deliberations on whether the 2017 Annual Report 
and Accounts were fair, balanced and understandable. The process involved various parts of the 
Group including, the Group Finance team and Company Secretariat with support and advice from 
other functions and the Company’s advisers. This collaborative approach enabled a clear link 
between the Strategic Report, the Governance section and the Financial Statements. The Audit 
Committee received an early draft of the 2017 Annual Report and Accounts (including the risk 
management statement and principal risks disclosure) to allow itself sufficient time to review the 
disclosures therein. The Audit Committee then assessed, at its meeting in August 2017, whether 
the 2017 Annual Report and Accounts were fair, balanced and understandable. In reaching its 
decision, the Audit Committee reviewed:
 > the feedback provided by shareholders in respect of the 2016 Annual Report and Accounts;
 > the assurance of the Annual Report and Accounts, in relation to the financial and non-financial 
management information; 
 > the balance between statutory and adjusted performance measures;
 > the internal processes underpinning the Group’s reporting governance framework and the 
reviews and findings of the Group’s external legal advisers and the auditor; and 
 > a report from the Company Secretary which confirmed that: (i) the Annual Report and Accounts 
had been reviewed by the Executive Directors; and (ii) the Company had received confirmation 
from its external advisers, that the Annual Report and Accounts adhered to the requirements 
of the Code and relevant rules and regulations.
Following detailed consideration, the Audit Committee concluded that the 2017 Annual Report 
and Accounts:
 > accurately reflected the Company’s performance in the year under review;
 > contained an accurate description of the business model;
 > the Company’s strategy was correctly reflected;
 > the messages were consistent between each of the sections of the Report and Accounts; and
 > the KPIs were consistent with the business plan and remuneration strategy;
and therefore the 2017 Annual Report and Accounts were fair, balanced and understandable 
and contained sufficient information for shareholders to assess the Company’s position, 
performance, business model and strategy and recommended as such to the Board. 
Long term viability statement
In accordance with provision C.2.2. of the Code and the FRC guidance on Risk Management, Internal 
Control and Related Financial and Business Reporting, the Audit Committee revisited the timescale 
over which it could sensibly assess the Company’s ability to continue to trade, taking into account 
the Company’s business model and prospects. It concluded that this analysis should continue to 
be performed over a three-year timespan. Presentations were received from management and it 
was concluded that there was a reasonable expectation that the Group would be able to continue 
in operation and meet its liabilities over this three-year period. This was then communicated and 
recommended to the Board for approval. 
The long term viability statement is shown on page 44 of the Strategic Report. 70       Barratt Developments PLC – Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Audit Committee report continued
The effectiveness of internal controls and the risk management process 
The Audit Committee plays a vital role in managing the effectiveness of internal controls and 
the risk management process on behalf of the Board. The key aspects of the Group’s system 
of internal control and risk management framework are as follows:
i)  a clear organisational structure with defined levels of authority and responsibility for each 
operating division;
ii)  financial and management reporting systems under which financial and operating 
performance is consistently reviewed against budget and forecasts at divisional, regional 
and Group levels on a monthly basis;
iii)  identification and review of principal operational risk areas to ensure they are embedded 
in the Group’s monthly management reporting system. This embeds the identification and 
control of risk as routine aspects of managerial responsibility. Details of the management 
of risk system utilised and the principal risks and uncertainties and their relevance to the 
operations and financial performance of the Group are set out in the Risk management 
section on pages 40 to 44 of the Strategic Report; and
iv)  assessment of compliance with the internal control and risk management systems. 
This assessment is supported by the Group’s Internal Audit team which is responsible for 
undertaking an annual audit plan, ad hoc audits and reporting to the Audit Committee, and if 
necessary, the Board, on the operation and effectiveness of those systems and any material 
failings. The planned programme of audit appraisals across Group operations, which is 
approved by the Audit Committee, is set with reference to the principal risks of the Group 
including those risks associated with culture, safety, health and environment and other 
business process areas. It includes full divisional audits and targeted audits of key risk areas 
such as land acquisition and sale, cost controls and monitoring WIP , Treasury, payroll and HR. 
Where the Internal Audit team does not have the expertise or resources required to conduct 
complex audits they use external expertise. 
The Group’s operations and financing arrangements expose it to a variety of financial risks 
that include the effects of changes in borrowing and debt profiles, Government policy, market 
prices, credit risks, liquidity risks and interest rates. The most significant of these to the 
Group is liquidity risk. Accordingly, there is a regular, detailed system for the reporting and 
forecasting of cash flows from the operations to Group management to ensure that risks are 
promptly identified and appropriate mitigating actions taken. These forecasts are further stress 
tested at a Group level on a regular basis to ensure that adequate headroom within facilities 
and banking covenants is maintained. In addition, the Group has in place a risk management 
programme that seeks to limit the adverse effects of the other risks on its financial performance, 
in particular by using financial instruments, including debt and derivatives, to hedge interest 
and currency rates. The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative 
purposes. Activities are delegated, by the Board, to a centralised Treasury Operating Committee. 
The Treasury department implements guidelines in accordance with approved treasury policies 
that are established by the Board and the Treasury Operating Committee. 
Specifically in relation to risk management and internal control, the Audit Committee, during 
the year:
 > monitored and reviewed the effectiveness of risk management and all internal controls; 
 > reviewed a number of process improvements and confirmed that the risk management and 
internal control systems had been in place and had operated effectively throughout the year 
ended 30 June 2017;
 > provided regular reports to the Board in respect of the findings of its monitoring of the 
effectiveness of the internal controls and risk management process, in order to assist the 
Board with its assessment that sound risk management and internal control systems had been 
maintained throughout the year to safeguard shareholders’ investments as well as the Group’s 
assets (in accordance with principle C.2 of the Code); 
 > assisted the Board to determine the nature and extent of the principal risks that are 
appropriate for the Group to take in order to achieve its strategic objectives and to be assured 
that Executive Directors and Senior Management continue to implement and maintain the 
Group’s internal control and risk management systems within the governance and policy 
framework approved by the Board;
 > carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks including those that would threaten the 
business model, future performance, solvency and liquidity and confirmed that they are being 
appropriately managed;
 > received presentations from management below Board level to understand risks and controls 
in a number of areas of the business including; tender processes, Group IT – planning and 
disaster recovery provision, cyber security, and pension provision and funding;
 > reviewed in detail the output of the six monthly control self-certification process from each of 
the divisions;
 > considered all whistleblowing and suspected fraud reports and actions, including oversight of 
the investigation relating to tendering and procurement processes in the London business;
 > reviewed all internal audit results and action plans and the effectiveness of the Group Internal 
Audit function;
 > received regular reports from the Risk Committee in respect of the work it had undertaken 
to review the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control policies and procedures for the 
identification, assessment and reporting of risks and for assessing individual key risks on a 
rolling basis;
 > reviewed the concurrency of the principal risks and the risk management framework to 
determine if the descriptions of their operation were up to date, the system of internal control 
remains effective and reported their findings to the Board when considering the draft half year 
and full year Financial Statements; assisted the Executive Committee to prioritise the risk 
framework by identifying the risks considered most significant to the Group and assessed their 
potential impact on the business of any risks identified; and 
 > robustly assessed the structure deployed by the Group when assessing risks. This is set out in 
the Risk management section on pages 40 to 44 of the Strategic Report. 
The Audit Committee is pleased with the progress with its short and medium term work 
programmes to date, and recognises that work will need to be continued in these areas during 
the next financial year.  Annual Report and Accounts 2017 – Barratt Developments PLC     71
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Other Information
Review of accounting policies
The Audit Committee considered the accounting standards applied in the year and reviewed the 
Group’s progress on projects to consider the impact of IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’, IFRS 15 
‘Revenue from contracts with customers’ and IFRS 16 ‘Leases’ upon the Group’s accounting 
policies and Financial Statements. Further information on the impact of accounting standards 
is on page 125. 
External Auditor
i) Audit performance and effectiveness 
The Audit Committee assessed the performance of the external auditor and the effectiveness of 
the external audit for HY17 and FY17. In coming to its conclusion the Audit Committee reviewed 
amongst other matters:
 > feedback on the effectiveness and performance of the external audit from Group, divisional and 
regional management and the Chief Internal Auditor who were closely involved in both the half 
year and full year reporting process; 
 > Deloitte LLP’s fulfilment of the agreed audit plan for FY17;
 > reports highlighting the material issues and accounting judgements that arose during the 
conduct of the audit; and
 > Deloitte LLP’s objectivity and independence during the process.
The Audit Committee concluded that the audit process as a whole had been conducted robustly 
and that the team selected to undertake the audit had done so thoroughly and professionally. 
Deloitte LLP’s performance as auditor to the Company during FY17 was therefore considered to 
be satisfactory.
ii) Interaction with the FRC
We can confirm that, during the financial year under review, the Company had no interaction with 
the FRC’s Corporate Reporting Review Team or its Audit Quality Review Team.
iii) Non-audit services
The Committee has approved a policy on the use of the external auditor for non-audit purposes 
and continually monitors the ratio of non-audit to audit fees to ensure that it does not exceed the 
1:1 ratio prescribed by that policy, further details of which are set out in section (iv). At the end of 
FY17, non-audit fees represented 59% of audit fees. Further details of the audit (including audit-
related) and non-audit fees incurred by the Group can be found on page 128. 
The majority of the non-audit fees related to other services which comprised advice provided 
on land acquisitions and disposals and other transactions in the normal course of business, in 
addition to taxation advice relating to the Chinese representative office. Accordingly, the Audit 
Committee was satisfied that the work performed by Deloitte LLP was appropriate in the context 
of ensuring their independence as auditor, particularly given that the audit-related assurance 
services, relating to the review of the Group’s half year report, is usually conducted by the 
Group’s auditor and that the tax advisory services had been managed by a partner who has no 
involvement with the audit of the Group. This safeguard will be applied to any non-audit work 
that the auditor may be asked to provide by the Committee. Consequently, the Audit Committee 
concluded that the level of non-audit fees was justified and did not raise any concerns in terms 
of Deloitte LLP’s independence as auditor to the Group. However, as outlined on page 73 during 
the year taxation compliance and advisory services were put to a full competitive tender and 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP are now providing these services to the Group.
iv) Auditor independence and non-audit fees policy
In FY16 the Audit Committee performed a thorough review of the policy which the Company 
has implemented on Auditor independence and non-audit fees (the ‘Policy’) to take account of 
the legislation arising from the European Commission reforms of the EU audit market which 
became effective from 17 June 2016. In FY17, the Committee again reviewed this policy to ensure 
it continues to be appropriate. The Policy sets out the duties of the Audit Committee with respect 
to protecting the objectivity and independence of the auditor and codifies: the limited range 
of services which have been pre-approved by the Audit Committee; permitted services which 
must be approved by the Audit Committee before being provided; and those services that the 
Auditor will not be permitted to provide under any circumstances. These are set out in the table 
on page 72. The Audit Committee also continually monitors non-audit fees paid to the Auditor by 
the Group.
The review confirmed that the Policy remains fit for purpose and has been drafted in line with the 
requirements of the Ethical Standard.  72       Barratt Developments PLC – Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Other Information
Audit Committee report continued
1 Non audit fees including audit related non-audit services still subject to Audit Committee approval are subject to certain annual limits.
2 Exceptions to prohibited services:
 > Certain tax and valuation services, including tax advice will be allowed provided:
 > they have no direct or clearly inconsequential effect on the audited Financial Statements; 
 > the auditor has documented and explained the estimated effect on the Financial Statements in their report to the Audit Committee;
 > the ethical principles of the ethical standards are upheld; and 
 > significant reliance is not placed on the results of the non-audit service for the purpose of the audit.
As per the previous year, the Policy continues to include restrictions on the recruitment of 
employees from Deloitte LLP, so that no employee (at whatever level of seniority) involved in 
the Company’s audit for a two-year preceding period can be hired without the pre-approval 
of each of the Chairman of the Company; the Chair of the Audit Committee and the Chief 
Financial Officer.
With effect from 1 July 2016, Deloitte LLP no longer provided services to the Group that are 
prohibited under the Policy. Where the auditor does provide non-audit services, independence 
and objectivity is maintained as they are managed by a partner with no other involvement with the 
Audit of the Group. Tax compliance services provided by Deloitte LLP concluded during FY16 and 
are now provided PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP. 
Under the Policy the Company is required to annually obtain written confirmation from Deloitte 
LLP that they remain independent. For FY17 Deloitte LLP provided a comprehensive report to the 
Audit Committee verifying that they have performed their audit and audit-related services in line 
with independence requirements and explaining why they believe that they remain independent 
within the requirements of the applicable regulations and their own professional standards. 
The report also explains why the ratio of audit to non-audit fees and the extent and type of non-
audit services provided by them is appropriate. 
Following receipt of such confirmations and the completion of their own review, the Audit 
Committee endorsed Deloitte LLP’s conclusions that the Policy had been appropriately complied 
with throughout the year under review; there were no items that may affect the independence of 
the auditor; and non-audit fees were of an appropriate level. 
External audit tender 
As announced in the 2016 Audit Committee report, a tender process for the Company and 
Group’s external audit service was completed during the first half of the year under review. 
The vigorous, full and transparent process undertaken is outlined below. 
The Company invited two audit firms to tender for the audit of the Group, in addition to the 
incumbent auditor Deloitte LLP, who had indicated their wish to be re-appointed. The tender 
process took place in October and November 2016. Each tender participant:
 > was provided with an invitation to tender document;
 > was given access to a data room containing sufficient information on the Group necessary for 
them to arrange their proposal;

 > attended visits, arranged by the Company as requested;
 > submitted a written tender document; and
 > was given the opportunity to present to a specially arranged Audit Tender Panel which 
consisted of the Chief Financial Officer, the Chair and Chair elect of the Audit Committee, 
the Chief Internal Auditor, the Group Financial Controller and Head of Group Accounting.
In advance of the presentations, the Audit Tender Panel agreed a set of selection criteria against 
which the participants could be assessed. This criteria included, but was not limited to: strength 
of the leadership team; cost; sector knowledge; independence; governance and professionalism. 
Following the presentations the Audit Tender Panel discussed the merits of each tender 
document, and each participant’s presentation and unanimously agreed to recommend to 
the Audit Committee that Deloitte LLP be re-appointed as the auditor of the Group.
The Audit Committee considered the results of the tender process and the recommendation of 
the Audit Tender Panel. Based on the information provided, the Audit Committee recommended 
two potential auditors for FY18 to the Board noting that Deloitte LLP was the preferred choice. 
The Board, in arriving at its conclusion, took into account: 
 > the advice of, and information provided by, the Audit Tender Panel and the Audit Committee;
 > that Claire Faulkner, who led the audit tender process on behalf of Deloitte LLP, would replace 
Mark Goodey (who was appointed on 2 July 2012 and was required to rotate in line with the FRC 
guidelines) as lead audit partner. This would help to preserve Deloitte LLPs objectivity and 
independence; and
 > Deloitte LLPs continued performance as the incumbent auditor.
Accordingly, the Board unanimously agreed to re-appoint Deloitte LLP as the Auditor for the 
Company commencing with the FY18 audit. 
The Committee confirms compliance with the provisions of the CMI Order 2014.
Internal Audit function
During the year, the Audit Committee received reports from the Chief Internal Auditor on the 
findings of internal audits conducted throughout the business, together with details of the 
proposed actions to rectify any issues identified. The Internal Audit function is fully independent 
of business operations and has a Group-wide mandate. The Chief Internal Auditor attends all 
Audit Committee meetings. In addition, the Audit Committee monitors and reviews the systems 
and processes adopted by the Internal Audit function to ensure that they remain fit for purpose. 
During the year the Committee reviewed the effectiveness of the Internal Audit function. 
The Chief Internal Auditor presented to the Committee a formal review of the effectiveness of the 
Internal Audit function. The Chief Internal Auditor answered questions from the Audit Committee 
on the contents of that report and other aspects of Internal Audit’s performance during the 
year. Following this review, the Audit Committee confirmed that in its opinion, the Internal Audit 
function had operated effectively and provided an appropriate level of independent scrutiny of the 
operations of the Group. 
Tender of the taxation services
Following the introduction of the revised policy on Auditor Independence in 2016, Deloitte LLP 
were unable to continue to provide taxation services to the Group. Five firms were therefore 
invited to tender to provide ongoing taxation services. Following a competitive tender process it 
was agreed that PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP had the capability and strength to best advise the 
Group on its tax affairs and they were therefore appointed to provide services with effect from 
23 December 2016.
Audit Committee effectiveness 
The 2016 performance evaluation of the Audit Committee was generally positive with the one 
main outcome being for more of a strategic view of financial and audit issues to be taken. 
The Audit Committee has successfully implemented this recommendation. Presentations to 
the Audit Committee must now include a more strategic outlook, with detail available to the 
Committee. This year the Audit Committee’s evaluation was performed internally along with 
the Board effectiveness review. The outcome of the review was positive, particularly in respect 
of each member having a clear understanding of what is expected of them to undertake and 
discharge their responsibilities. The outcomes and actions arising from each review are 
described in more detail on pages 55 and 56.
Whistleblowing 
The Chief Internal Auditor updated the Audit Committee at each meeting on new whistleblowing 
incidents, ongoing investigations and the outcome of any completed investigations. On the back of 
these updates, the Audit Committee assessed the adequacy of the Group’s whistleblowing policy 
in accordance with the requirements of the Code. It reviewed the whistleblowing procedure 
adopted by the Group, including steps that can be taken to enhance awareness of the process, to 
ensure it remains appropriate and available to those who need to raise concerns. The procedure 
allows individuals who become aware of possible improper, unethical or even illegal behaviour 
to raise the matter with their manager or alternatively refer the matter to a confidential and 
independent telephone number (the ‘Whistleblowing Number’). 
The Whistleblowing Number is available to all employees (together with sub-contractors 
and suppliers) 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Any issues reported to the Whistleblowing 
Number are immediately brought to the attention of the Chief Internal Auditor. The Chief 
Internal Auditor reviews and investigates the issues and, at his sole discretion, can seek 
guidance from appropriate individuals within the Group, such as the Company Secretary, as and 
when necessary.

Safety, Health and Environment Committee report
Health and safety is our number  
one priority throughout all of  
our business operations.
Richard Akers
Safety, Health and Environment  
Committee Chairman
Statement from the Chairman of the Safety, Health and Environment Committee
Safety, Health and the Environment (‘SHE’) remains our number one priority throughout 
the Group and is embedded within the day to day operations of the business. 
This Committee primarily oversees and provides stewardship of the Group’s SHE operational 
performance. Its activities help mitigate one of our key operational risks, as well as improve our 
performance through underpinning efficient working practices, saving direct costs associated 
with incidents, and supporting the culture and ongoing sustainability of the Group. 
The tragic events at Grenfell Tower in London illustrate why health and safety must always 
remain the first priority for the building industry. Fire safety is core to the way we plan and build 
our developments. Following the fire at Grenfell Tower, we conducted a review of our sites and 
continue to ensure we are maintaining the highest standards of building safety.
The Committee has formal terms of reference, which have been reviewed during the year. 
The terms of reference are available at www.barrattdevelopments.co.uk/investors/corporate-
governance/governance-policies.
The key aspects of this Committee’s role as defined in these terms of reference are to:
 > oversee the Group’s compliance with the SHE management system;
 > identify and monitor SHE risks or exposures for the business and determine how best 
to mitigate against them;
 > establish and maintain policies in respect of all areas relating to safety, health and 
the environment; 
 > review the scope of and assess the outcome of annual SHE internal and external audits 
and agree necessary actions with the Group Safety, Health and Environmental Director 
(‘SHE Director’);
 > receive assessments from the Group SHE Director on specific incidents to gain an 
understanding of what caused it, details of the internal and external (if any) investigations that 
are being/have been undertaken and details of what steps have been taken or controls put in 
place to mitigate against the incident recurring; and
 > agree and recommend to the Remuneration Committee targets for any SHE performance 
measures which are to be applied to the annual bonus scheme and monitor performance 
against such measures.
The Committee continues to work closely with the SHE Operations Committee and to further 
enhance this relationship, at least one joint meeting is held. The joint meeting allows this 
Committee to gain more of an in-depth understanding of the issues from an operational 
perspective and to discuss them directly with those responsible for day to day management. Annual Report and Accounts 2017 – Barratt Developments PLC     75

Key achievements in FY17
We strive to ensure that our people, whether employees, sub-contractors or members of the 
public, remain safe throughout the whole construction and sales process of our developments 
and in our wider business. We aim to arrange a SHE site visit for each Director during the 
calendar year. These visits aim to provide an insight into how SHE is managed in addition to 
providing more detailed information on some of the initiatives we have put in place to further 
improve the SHE culture on our sites. The visit involves a site tour with the SHE Director and 
site team during which the challenges and objectives to managing risk on site are reviewed 
and discussed. Not only do these visits provide an important role in ensuring our Board has 
a full understanding of this vital part of our business, it also benefits the site teams to see 
the emphasis being placed on SHE by the Board. 
We have continued to monitor our SHE performance targets, our key performance indicator 
and our injury incidence rate, which are available in the Strategic Report and our Sustainability 
Report. Our injury incidence rate continues to improve, helped by targeted campaigns and our 
focus on identifying the root causes of incidents, and implementation of best practice across the 
Group. During the year we have provided defibrillators to all of our sites and offices for use in an 
emergency. We have arranged appropriate training for our teams on how to use the equipment 
and it has been added to our training programmes going forward. 
We have continued to operate the SHE management system that enabled us, in FY16, to 
achieve 5-star status with the British Safety Council following their health and safety audit. 
Despite this rating we refuse to become complacent and continually monitor, review and amend 
(as necessary) our SHE policies, processes and procedures that we operate throughout our 
business to ensure that they remain up to date and relevant to the business. The external 
verification of our health and safety approach and the quality of our policies and procedures is 
important but, of more importance is the impact our policies have on keeping our people safe 
in the workplace. Consequently, all employees are required to familiarise themselves with 
these policies, processes and procedures during their induction and are required to attend 
various health and safety courses throughout their time with the Group. During FY17 the SHE 
training matrix modules have been reviewed and updated making them more specific and 
focused on Barratt and the industry in which we operate. In particular, our site management 
training programmes have been enhanced, as have some more specific items such as scaffold 
inspection. We have also extended the availability of bespoke training on SHE matters throughout 
the Group. All Senior Management have also completed the IOSH Leading Safely training course. 
In addition, we have launched an initiative to work with local schools to highlight the potential 
dangers of construction sites to their pupils. The ‘Working Safely with Schools’ initiative includes 
a short film and various puzzles enabling the pupils to engage with the subject area, and a 
number of other elements to enhance the learning experience for a younger audience. We have 
done this because we acknowledge that construction sites hold a natural fascination for pupils 
and we see it as our duty to raise the awareness amongst this young audience of the dangers 
that may exist on a building site. 
Areas of focus for FY18
During FY18, we will:
 > concentrate on the augmentation of our wellbeing and occupational health programmes 
and support our supply chain to meet this obligation;
 > implement a programme of random drugs and alcohol testing in line with our policy in this 
area; and
 > update our SHE management system to comply with ISO14001. 
Our most important asset is our people and therefore it is important that the safety and 
wellbeing of all employees (direct or indirect) remains a top priority for this Committee and the 
Group Board. 
Membership and attendance at SHE Committee meetings

Our Remuneration Policy continues to 
align Executive Directors’ interests with 
those of shareholders and is sufficiently 
robust to ensure Executive Directors 
are paid for performance whilst 
ensuring long term shareholder value.
Richard Akers
Remuneration Committee Chairman
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present our Remuneration Report for the financial year 
ended 30 June 2017. Our Remuneration Report comprises of three parts: this Annual Statement, 
the Remuneration Policy and the Annual Report on Remuneration.
Remuneration Policy
Shareholders last approved our Remuneration Policy in November 2014 with 99% of the votes 
in favour. In accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006, our Remuneration 
Policy is due to be presented for a binding vote by shareholders at our AGM in November 2017. 
We therefore conducted a thorough review of the Remuneration Policy during the financial year 
to ensure that it remains fit for purpose and is in line with shareholder expectations. In doing so, 
we have carefully considered the various proposals by Government and other organisations on 
potential changes to Executive remuneration including disclosure requirements. We will continue 
to monitor these and propose changes to remuneration as deemed necessary. No changes will 
be made to the Remuneration Policy without further consultation with our shareholders.
Outcome of our review and shareholder consultation 
Following support from the Investment Association and the BEIS Select Committee for 
alternative remuneration structures, we discussed the possibility of replacing LTPP awards with 
restricted share awards during the review of our Remuneration Policy. We however, decided not 
to change to restricted shares for the following reasons:
(i)  Part of the reason for change would be to reduce complexity. We believe that our proposed 
arrangements are very clear and understandable and we have made a number of changes to 
the policy to reduce the number of schemes and measures and to continue to ensure effective 
reporting of outcomes;
(ii)  there is a strong link between the current LTPP performance measures and the returns to 
shareholders. If restricted awards were to be granted in place of LTPPs the alignment with 
shareholders would be weakened; 
(iii)  based on advice from our remuneration consultants, the quantum of restricted awards would 
need to be reduced in comparison to the level of LTPP awards, particularly if there are no 
performance conditions attached. One of the business’ major challenges is to attract and 
retain the very best people in an industry where there is a significant skills shortage and we 
believe that the performance-based incentive provided by the LTPP is important to achieving 
this objective; and
(iv)  our LTPP is also granted by way of a Senior Management Incentive Scheme to more than 200 
employees across the business. We believe that the targets set create a strong incentive to 
perform and an alignment with Executive Directors and shareholders. 
Based on the above, we concluded not to adopt any alternative remuneration structures at this 
time but will keep the matter under review.

Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Other Information
On conclusion of our internal review, which was conducted with the support of our remuneration 
consultant, New Bridge Street, we consulted with key institutional shareholders and voting 
agencies on the changes proposed to our Remuneration Policy. Overall, the feedback received 
was positive. Accordingly, the following minor amendments are proposed to simplify our 
Remuneration Policy and further align with our shareholders:
 > introduction of the accrual of dividend equivalents during the vesting period on Deferred Bonus 
Plan and LTPP awards. Any dividend equivalent accrued will be adjusted in line with the level 
of the award that actually vests. Regard will also be given to quantum of an award at the time 
of grant; 
 > inclusion of more flexibility for the Committee to determine performance conditions for the 
LTPP, taking into account the strategy of the business and the economic conditions at the time 
of grant; 
 > removal of the matching element from the Deferred Bonus Plan; 
 > removal of the ability to grant further options under the Executive Share Option Scheme;
 > increase the shareholding requirement for all Executive Directors from 150% to 200%; and 
 > reduce the level of pension contribution/cash supplement in lieu of pension from 25% to 15% for 
any new Executive Directors joining the Group. This level is in line with that awarded to Senior 
Management across the Group and with that awarded by other companies within the sector.
Payments for loss of office 
The payments agreed for Neil Cooper on leaving the business on 19 January 2017 by mutual 
agreement are set out throughout the Annual Report on Remuneration. In summary, it was 
agreed that Neil would, in accordance with his service contract, continue to receive his salary in 
lieu of notice, a cash supplement in lieu of pension and private health insurance for a period of 
12 months, or if earlier, up to the date on which he obtained alternative employment. In addition, 
Neil was paid in lieu of holidays earned but not taken, the shares deferred in respect of the bonus 
earned for FY16 were released to him and we made a capped contribution towards legal fees 
incurred in connection with his loss of office. His other share based awards lapsed on cessation 
of his employment. With effect from 5 June 2017, Neil Cooper secured alternative employment 
and accordingly his monthly sum in respect of salary has been adjusted (see page 103 for 
further details).
Remuneration for new Chief Financial Officer
On 22 June 2017, we announced the appointment of Jessica White as Chief Financial Officer. 
In considering the level of remuneration to award Jessica, the Committee took into account 
the remuneration package previously provided to Neil Cooper and Jessica’s level of experience, 
knowledge of the business and location. The Committee also benchmarked her potential 
package against finance directors within the industry. On this basis, the Committee agreed that 
a salary of £400,000 per annum with a 15% pension contribution was appropriate. Jessica’s 
salary will be reviewed on an annual basis. In addition, Jessica will be invited to participate in the 
LTPP on the same basis as the other Executive Directors and any awards which were granted to 
Jessica prior to her appointment as Chief Financial Officer will remain unchanged. 
For the avoidance of doubt, David Thomas will receive no additional remuneration for also 
covering the role of Chief Financial Officer for a period of five months whilst we recruited 
a new Chief Financial Officer.
FY17 Performance and reward
The start of the financial year was impacted by the result of the EU Referendum which caused 
huge uncertainty and some significant downgrades to profit forecasts by analysts. Whilst target 
setting was delayed, the Committee did not reduce the stretch targets which were under 
consideration prior to the EU Referendum result. Despite this uncertainty, the continued focus 
and strong leadership of the Executive Directors and Senior Management team has resulted in 
another successful year with the business meeting or exceeding all financial and non-financial 
performance targets (see pages 4 and 5). Accordingly, in recognition of this, the Committee 
agreed that the financial performance of the Company fully supports an annual bonus payment 
of 146.3% of salary for Executive Directors.
In addition, the LTPP award granted in October 2014 was tested after the year end and 100% of 
the award vested. The net shares (after the payment of any tax and NI due on release) will be 
subject to a further two-year holding period. Full details of the achievements against each of the 
bonus and LTPP targets can be found on pages 95 to 97.
FY18 Executive Directors’ remuneration
Details of the remuneration proposed for each of the Executive Directors for the financial 
year ending 30 June 2018 are set out on pages 92 and 93. Salary increases are in line with the 
wider workforce and pension contributions, annual bonus opportunity and LTPP award levels 
remain unchanged from the previous financial year. Changes have, however, been made to the 
performance metrics for the annual bonus and the LTPP.
Annual bonus – the scheme has been further simplified by reducing the number of performance 
metrics from five to three, with majority weighting continuing to be placed on profit before tax 
(see page 92 for further details). 
LTPP – the comparator group used for measuring TSR performance has been amended so 
as to provide a directly comparable assessment of the Company’s TSR performance against 
other housebuilders. Accordingly, TSR will be measured against a 50+/50- comparator group 
of the FTSE companies with market capitalisations either side of the Company and against a 
Housebuilder index. Each of these will represent 50% of the TSR element. The Housebuilder 
index will comprise; Bellway PLC, The Berkeley Group Holdings PLC, Taylor Wimpey PLC, 
Persimmon PLC, Redrow PLC, Bovis Homes Group PLC, Countryside Properties PLC, Crest 
Nicholson Holdings PLC, and Galliford Try PLC. 78       Barratt Developments PLC – Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Other Information
In addition, on future awards ROCE will be calculated excluding land creditors (‘Underlying 
ROCE’). This means that for the purposes of our remuneration target, land creditors, which are 
a form of indebtedness, will be added back to our capital employed position in exactly the same 
way as we currently treat net cash and net debt. This will ensure that the Underlying ROCE 
targets remain aligned with shareholders’ best interests with regards to the Group’s optimal 
level of gearing. The removal of land creditors from the calculation of ROCE will not otherwise 
change the basis of the calculation. Accordingly, this change should not make the metrics any 
more or less onerous than they would be if land creditors continued to be included. 
Conclusion
The Committee believes that the revised Remuneration Policy and our current remuneration 
practices will continue to drive appropriate behaviours by management. They continue to align 
the Executive Directors with shareholders through the targets we have set, the requirement to 
retain a specific level of shareholding in the Company, to defer any bonus achieved in excess of 
100% of base salary and to hold shares acquired under the LTPP (net of tax) for a period of two 
years following vesting. 
We therefore hope that you will, as you have done in previous years, support the new 
Remuneration Policy, the outcomes for FY17 and the remuneration for FY18. On behalf of the 
Board I would like to thank you for your continued support of our remuneration framework  
and I look forward to seeing many of you at the AGM in November 2017.

Our remuneration strategy
Our most important asset is our people. Our remuneration strategy seeks to ensure that 
remuneration is clearly linked to the delivery of sustainable shareholder value and that the 
employees are appropriately rewarded for performance against the Group’s key objectives.
Aims of our Remuneration Policy:
 > promote the long term success of the Company and be fully aligned with the performance 
and strategic objectives of the Group in order to enhance shareholder value; 
 > reward the delivery of profit, the maintenance of an appropriate capital structure and the 
continued improvement of return on capital employed by the business whilst ensuring that 
Executive Directors and Senior Management adopt a level of risk which is in line with the 
risk profile of the business as approved by the Board; 
 > reflect the interests and expectations of shareholders and other stakeholders;
 > attract, retain, motivate and competitively reward Executive Directors and Senior 
Management with the requisite experience, skills and ability to support the achievement 
of the Group’s key strategic objectives in any financial year; 
 > take account of pay and employment conditions of employees across the Group; and
 > ensure that there is no reward for failure; termination payments (if any) are limited to 
those that the Executive Director (or member of Senior Management) is legally entitled to; 
and in exercising its discretion, the Committee robustly applies the ‘ good’ and ‘bad’ leaver 
provisions as defined in the rules of each of the share schemes operated by the Group.
In developing its policy the Committee has regard to:
 > the Company’s business strategy, ensuring that targets support the achievement 
of business strategy and key KPIs;
 > the performance, roles and responsibilities of each Executive Director or member 
of Senior Management;
 > arrangements which apply below Senior Management level, including average base 
salary increases;
 > information and surveys from internal and independent sources; and
 > the economic environment and financial performance of the Group.

ii.  the level of pay increases awarded across 
the Group (with the exception of promotions);
iii.  the size and responsibility of the role;
iv.  economic and market conditions; and
v. the performance of the Group.
The Committee, when setting salaries does take 
into account salary levels for similar positions in 
the housebuilding sector and within companies 
of a similar size to the Group.
The Committee does have the discretion to vary 
salaries in the event there are changes to any of the 
above within the 12 month period for which salaries 
have been fixed. 
Salaries are paid monthly in arrears.
There is no prescribed maximum 
annual increase.
The Committee is guided by the general 
increase for the broader UK employee 
population but on occasions may need to 
recognise changes in the role and/or duties 
of a Director; movement in comparator 
salaries; and salary progression for newly 
appointed Directors.
The Committee retains the right to approve 
a higher increase in exceptional cases, 
such as major changes to the Executive 
Director’s role/duties; new recruits; or 
internal promotions to the position of 
Executive Director whose salary was set 
lower than the market level for such a 
role and a higher increase is justified as 
the individual becomes more established 
in the role. In these circumstances a full 
explanation of the increases awarded 
will be provided in the Annual report 
on remuneration.
N/A No change.
Remuneration report
The Company’s current Directors’ Remuneration Policy (the ‘Current Policy’), was approved 
by shareholders at the 2014 AGM with 99% of the votes cast being in favour. As required by the 
Companies Act, the Company will be presenting a new policy (the ‘New Policy’) to shareholders 
for approval at its AGM in November 2017. It is intended that the New Policy as set on pages 80 
to 89 will, subject to shareholder approval, apply for a period of three years commencing from 
15 November 2017. 
The New Policy aims to support and drive the Group’s strategy by challenging and motivating 
Executive Directors to deliver value for shareholders and promote the success of the Company 
over the longer term. It continues to ensure that the fixed and variable remuneration elements 
are simple, transparent and aligned with the interests of shareholders and designed to reflect 
the views of our investor shareholder bodies and other stakeholders. The New Policy, once 
effective, will be reviewed on an annual basis in the context of the business environment, 
regulation, best practice and market trends for the current and subsequent financial years. 
Future policy table
The following table sets out the policy for each of the key elements of Directors’ remuneration. 
A description of how the Company intends to implement the New Policy during FY18 can be found 
on pages 92 to 93. Any changes made to the Policy are as a consequence of consultation with 
shareholders or to bring remuneration practices in line with those of the market. To the extent 
that there is any change from the Current Policy, this is set out below.
1  The Committee reviews performance targets on an annual basis taking into account performance of the Group throughout the previous financial year, internal and external forecasts and consensus figures for the performance period. The performance targets are designed to be sufficiently 
stretching in order to ensure that maximum payout is only achieved for delivering exceptional performance.

2
Annual bonus To motivate and reward 
Executive Directors for the 
achievement of demanding 
financial and non-financial 
objectives and key strategic 
measures over the 
financial year.
Variable remuneration 
allows the Group to manage 
its cost base by giving it the 
flexibility to react to changes 
in the market and any 
unforeseen events.
The Committee has an absolute discretion whether 
or not to award a bonus and as to the level of bonus to 
be awarded up to a maximum of 150% of base salary. 
The level of bonus to be awarded will be determined 
with reference to the performance of the Company 
against the relevant performance conditions and the 
underlying financial and operational performance 
of the business relative to the sector (as noted in the 
column to the right).
The Committee sets annually financial and non-
financial performance targets taking account of the 
Company’s goals and budget for the relevant financial 
year . Group and individual performance against 
these targets is measured at the end of the financial 
year and the level of bonus payable is calculated at 
that point.
The Committee retains the discretion to decide whether 
or not to pay an annual bonus to an Executive Director 
who has handed in their notice and to determine, in 
respect of any employee who is a ‘ good leaver’ , whether 
any annual bonus earned in excess of 100% of salary 
should be paid in cash and not deferred into shares.
Malus and Clawback applies to both the cash and 
deferred element of the bonus, in the event of material 
misconduct and/or material misstatement or error of 
financial results. For full details see page 86.
When setting bonus targets, the Committee 
considers the effect of corporate performance 
on environmental, social and governance risks 
and sustainability issues generally to ensure that 
remuneration structures do not inadvertently 
motivate irresponsible behaviour .
Where the Committee believes that performance does 
not warrant the level of bonus determined, it may use 
its discretion to reduce the award (possibly to nil) as it 
deems appropriate.
No Executive Director has any contractual right 
to receive a bonus.
Annual bonus is not pensionable.
150% of base salary.
50% of the potential maximum bonus  
(75% of salary) is payable for achievement 
of on-target performance.
The performance targets set are 
stretching whilst having regard to the 
nature and risk profile of the Company 
and the interests of its shareholders. 
The focus of the performance targets 
is to deliver profit growth and to 
ensure we have an adequate land bank 
acquired within the constraints of our 
Balance Sheet commitments.
Performance measures normally 
include:
–  financial items (e.g. profit before 
tax, margin growth, net debt/land 
creditors; or land commitment);
–  non-financial items (e.g. quality 
and service, health and safety and 
personal objectives).
The Committee has the discretion 
to vary the elements of each of 
these items and weightings of each 
component on an annual basis to 
ensure that they remain aligned 
to the strategy of the business and 
to market conditions. Financial 
items will normally however have 
majority weighting.
No change.

Deferred 
Bonus Plan 
(‘DBP’)
Any annual bonus which is 
deferred into shares is held 
in this plan.
The aim is to encourage 
long term focus and to 
further align interests 
with those of shareholders 
and discourage excessive 
risk taking.
Deferred shares are normally granted in the form 
of a conditional award and are held in accordance 
with the rules of the DBP .
Deferred shares will normally accrue dividend 
equivalents during the deferral period. Dividend 
equivalents may be paid in cash or shares on the 
vesting of the award.
Malus and Clawback may apply in the event of 
material misconduct and/or material misstatement or 
error of financial results. For full details see page 86.
Any bonus paid in excess of 100% of salary 
is deferred into shares and held in the 
DBP , unless the Committee determines 
otherwise in the case of a ‘ good leaver’.
No performance conditions apply to the 
vesting of awards other than continued 
employment condition.
–  Matching awards will no 
longer be available under 
the DBP.

Long Term 
Performance 
Plan (‘L TPP’)
To motivate and reward 
Executive Directors for the 
delivery of the long term 
performance of the Group. 
To facilitate share ownership 
by Executive Directors. 
The rules of the LTPP were first approved by 
shareholders at the 2012 AGM.
LTPP awards:
i.  are normally granted annually in the form of 
conditional awards or nil-cost options at no  
cost to the Executive Director;
ii.  are at the discretion of the Committee, taking into 
account individual performance and the overall 
performance of the Group;
iii.  are subject to the achievement of stretching 
performance conditions measured over three 
financial years with a subsequent two-year holding 
period. Awards may therefore only be realised on 
conclusion of the five-year combined period;
iv.  can be satisfied by either newly issued shares or 
shares purchased in the market. Newly issued 
shares are subject to the dilution limits set out 
in the scheme rules and in accordance with 
guidelines from the Investment Association; and
v.  in accordance with the changes to the rules, 
subject to approval at the 2017 AGM, awards may, 
at the discretion of the Committee, accrue dividend 
equivalents. Any accrued dividend equivalent 
will be prorated, depending on the level of 
award vesting.
Malus and Clawback may apply in the event of 
material misconduct and/or material misstatement or 
error of financial results. For full details see page 86.
In accordance with the rules of the LTPP 
the Committee has the discretion to grant 
an award up to 200% of base salary to each 
of the Executive Directors.
The Committee ensures that targets, 
whilst stretching, are: realistic and 
attainable; for the long term benefit 
of the Group; and do not encourage 
inappropriate business risks.
Any LTPP awards are normally subject 
to performance conditions, which 
may include TSR, absolute EPS and 
Underlying ROCE.
Any performance conditions selected 
by the Committee will be on the 
basis that they reward achievement 
of stretching performance targets 
aligned with our strategy and the 
interests of shareholders.
The Committee has the discretion 
to determine the weighting of each 
performance condition on the grant 
of an LTPP award.
No more than 25% of an award will vest 
at threshold performance (0% will vest 
below the threshold level) increasing 
pro-rata to 100% vesting for maximum 
performance.
Overall, the Committee must be 
satisfied that the underlying financial 
and non-financial performance of 
the Group over the performance 
period warrants the level of vesting 
as determined by applying the above 
targets. If the Committee is not of this 
view, then it is empowered to reduce 
the level of vesting potentially to nil.
–  The Committee will have 
the discretion to vary 
performance conditions 
on the grant of any award 
depending on market 
conditions and the 
strategy of the Company 
at that time.
–  The Committee will 
take into account non-
financial performance 
when determining the 
level of vesting and any 
adjustments to be made.
–  Introduction of the accrual 
of dividend equivalents 
between the grant and 
vesting of the awards.

Savings 
Related Share 
Option Scheme 
(‘Sharesave’)
To promote long term share 
ownership amongst all 
employees of the Group in 
a tax-efficient way, linking 
employee benefits to the 
performance of the Group 
and to aid retention of staff.
Under the standard terms of the Sharesave, 
employees must have completed the requisite length 
of service as at the invitation date to be eligible to 
participate in the Sharesave.
Employees can elect to save between a minimum 
of £5 and the maximum monthly savings limit as 
approved by the Committee and the Board within 
the limit s prescribed by legislation and HMRC, for a 
period of three or five years. At the end of the savings 
period the employee has six months in which to 
exercise their option. 
Save up to the maximum monthly amount 
as specified by legislation or HMRC and as 
approved by the Committee and the Board.
The maximum savings level is set by 
legislation or Government from time to time 
and the Committee reserves the right to 
amend contribution levels to reflect such 
approved changes.
Continued employment for the duration 
of the scheme and ‘ good’ and ‘bad’ 
leaver provisions.

Non-Executive 
Directors’ fees 
(including the 
Chairman)
To attract and retain high 
quality and experienced 
Non-Executive Directors 
(including the Chairman).
Normally the Board will decide whether or not an 
increase to the Chairman’s and/or the Non-Executive 
Directors’ fees is appropriate. The Chairman 
is not involved in any decisions relating to his 
own remuneration.
The Chairman and the Non-Executive Directors’ fees 
are reviewed annually and are normally set by reference 
to the level of fees paid to Chairmen and Non-Executive 
Directors serving on boards of similarly-sized, UK-listed 
companies, taking into account the size, responsibility 
and time commitment required of the role.
The Chairman’s and Non-Executive Directors’ fees 
are paid in cash. Neither the Chairman nor the Non-
Executive Directors participate in any performance 
related schemes (e.g. annual bonus or incentive 
schemes) nor do they receive any pension or private 
medical insurance or taxable benefits other than the 
potential to receive gifts at the end of a long-standing 
term of appointment.
Expenses incurred by the Chairman and the  
Non-Executive Directors in the performance of their 
duties for the Company (including taxable travel and 
accommodation benefits in connection with travelling 
to a permanent workplace) may be reimbursed or paid 
for directly by the Company, as appropriate.
No additional fees are payable for membership of 
Board Committees however , additional fees are paid 
to the Chairmen of the Audit, the Remuneration and the 
Safety, Health and Environmental Committees and the 
Senior Independent Director . Additional fees may be 
paid where, in exceptional circumstances, the normal 
time commitment is significantly exceeded.
Non-Executive Director fees must remain 
within the aggregate limit approved by 
shareholders from time to time.
The current aggregate limit is £800,000. 
N/A No change.

Guidelines on Responsible Investment Disclosure
In line with the Investment Association’s Guidelines on Responsible Investment Disclosure the 
Committee is satisfied that the incentive structure and targets for Executive Directors do not 
raise any environmental, social, or governance risks by inadvertently motivating irresponsible or 
reckless behaviour. The Committee considers that no element of the remuneration package will 
encourage inappropriate risk taking within the Company.
Remuneration Committee discretion
The areas of the New Policy over which the Committee has discretion are included in the Future 
policy table. However, we have summarised the key discretions below for clarification:
 > amendment of salary or the award of higher increases in exceptional circumstances;
 > vary benefits offered to secure new appointments;
 > honour pension contributions for internal promotions;
 > whether or not to make a bonus award and whether payment should be made to anyone who 
has handed in their notice to leave the business;
 > what performance conditions should be attached to annual bonus and LTPP awards and the 
weighting to be attached to each;
 > determining the timing of grants of awards and/or payment;
 > determining the quantum of awards and/or payments (within the limits set out in the policy 
table above);
 > determining the application of dividend equivalents, whether they be issued in shares or cash 
and retaining the ability to adjust the amount paid; 
 > determining the extent of vesting based on the assessment of performance;
 > making the appropriate adjustments required in certain circumstances (e.g. change of control, 
rights issues, corporate restructuring events, and special dividends); and
 > determining ‘ good leaver’ status for incentive plan purposes and applying the 
appropriate treatment.
If an event occurs which results in the Annual bonus plan or LTPP performance conditions  
and/or targets being deemed no longer appropriate (e.g. a material acquisition or divestment) the 
Committee will have the ability, in limited circumstances, to adjust appropriately the measures 
and/or targets, to alter the weighting of the measures, and to reduce any annual bonus or 
LTPP awards (potentially to nil) in the event that the underlying financial and non-financial 
performance of the Group does not warrant the level of vesting. 
Malus and Clawback 
Both the annual bonus (including any deferred bonus) and the LTPP are subject to the malus 
and clawback (‘Malus and Clawback’) provisions contained in the plan rules for a period of two 
years following vesting. Malus and Clawback is applicable in respect of any annual bonus paid or 
deferred and to any share awards granted under the LTPP, subject in the case of HMRC approved 
options, to such approval. 
Clawback can be invoked if: 
(a)  the Company has to restate its Financial Statements due to ‘prior period errors’ as defined 
by International Accounting Standard 8 and such errors resulted in that Award vesting to a 
greater degree than would have been the case had that error not occurred;
(b)  the Committee forms the view that in assessing the extent to which any Performance 
Condition and/or any other condition imposed on the Award was satisfied such assessment 
was based on a material error and that such error resulted in that Award vesting to a 
materially greater degree than would have been the case had that error not been made; or 
(c)  the relevant individual ceases to be a director or employee of a member of the Group as 
a result of their summary dismissal because of their gross misconduct which has caused 
loss or damage to a member of the Group.
In such circumstances, the Committee may determine that the bonus and/or share award 
will be retrospectively recalculated. If bonus monies have been paid, the participant will be 
required to reimburse the Company for an amount up to the total amount of the net bonus paid, 
less any bonus that the Committee determines would have been paid regardless of the event 
in question. If share awards have been granted, the number of awards or options granted will 
be reduced accordingly. If the award has vested and shares have been issued to the participant, 
the participant will be required to repay the value of the relevant number of shares based on 
the Company’s closing share price as at the date the shares were issued. 
Recruitment of Executive Directors 
The Committee will determine the remuneration for any new Executive Directors in accordance 
with the Policy then in force and will take into consideration each of the following elements:
Salary and benefits – the Committee will take into account market data for the scope of the job, 
the remuneration for the relevant role, the salaries of and benefits provided to existing Executive 
Directors, the new Executive Director’s experience, location and current base salary and benefits 
package. In the event an Executive Director is recruited at below market levels, their base salary 
may be re-aligned over a period of time (e.g. two to three years) subject to their performance in 
the role. The Committee may also agree to cover relocation costs if it deems it appropriate.
Remuneration report – Directors’ Remuneration Policy continued Annual Report and Accounts 2017 – Barratt Developments PLC     87
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Other Information
Pension – Executive Directors will be auto-enrolled from the date of recruitment unless 
they opt-out. If an Executive Director chooses to opt–out they may elect to receive a pension 
supplement in cash. The Committee has discretion to determine the level of pension supplement 
to be awarded to the Executive Director, up to a maximum which is equivalent to the percentage 
normally offered to Senior Management. Alternatively, the Executive Director may choose to join 
the defined contribution money purchase pension plan provided they meet all of the eligibility 
criteria. The Executive Director also has the option to receive some of their pension entitlement 
in cash and have the remainder contributed to the defined contribution money purchase pension 
plan, provided this does not, in aggregate, exceed the agreed percentage.
Annual bonus and LTPP – new Executive Directors may be able to participate in the annual 
bonus scheme and the LTPP on terms to be considered by the Committee on a case by case 
basis. Any award made to the new Executive Director will usually be on the same terms as set 
out in the Future Policy Table on pages 82 and 84. The level of the award will be no greater than 
that made to existing Executive Directors and will be pro-rated based on the number of weeks 
remaining outstanding of the relevant performance period. 
Buyout of existing entitlements – The Committee may also consider buying out existing 
entitlements which an individual would forfeit upon leaving their current employer, again this 
would be reviewed on a case by case basis. The Committee would however in all cases seek 
validation of the value of any potential entitlement that is being forfeited and take into account  
the proportion of any performance period remaining of the award, the type of award (i.e. cash  
or shares) and the performance achieved (or likely to be achieved). Replacement share awards, 
if any, will seek to reflect (to the extent possible) the value, degree of conditionality and form of 
award of the entitlement foregone. In structuring any buyouts, existing arrangements will be 
used where possible, however, the Company may also make use of the flexibility provided by  
the Listing Rules to make awards without prior shareholder approval.
Where an individual is recruited internally to the position of Executive Director, the Company will 
honour any pre-existing contractual commitments.
Executive Directors’ service contracts 
Details of the Executive Directors’ service contracts are included in Table 10 and their 
emoluments are shown in Table 15 on page 94. The Company’s policy is for all Executive 
Directors’ (including new appointments) service contracts to be for a rolling 12 month period 
which can be terminated by 12 months’ notice given by either the Company or by the Executive 
Director at any time. The service contracts normally entitle Executive Directors to the provision 
of a company car, annual medical screening, permanent health insurance, private medical 
insurance, some telephone costs, contributions to the cost of obtaining independent financial 
and tax advice and payment of legal fees on cessation of employment. The Committee regularly 
reviews contractual terms for Executive Directors to ensure that they continue to reflect 
best practice.
All Executive Directors’ appointments and subsequent re-appointments are subject to election 
and annual re-election by shareholders at the Company’s AGM.

Steven Boyes 21 February 2013 1 July 2001 12 months
Jessica White 21 June 2017 22 June 2017 12 months
Executive Directors’ service contracts are available for inspection by any person at the 
Company’s registered office during normal office hours. 
Executive Directors’ policy on payment on loss of office
There are no specific provisions for compensation on early termination (except for payment 
in lieu of holidays accrued but untaken) or loss of office due to a change of ownership of the 
Company. The Committee reserves the right to make additional payments where such payments 
are made in good faith: (a) in discharge of an existing legal obligation (or by way of damages for 
breach of such an obligation); or (b) by way of settlement or compromise of any claim arising in 
connection with the termination of an Executive Director’s office or employment. The Committee 
may also provide a contribution toward reasonable legal costs and with the provision of 
outplacement services. The Committee will apply mitigation against any contractual obligations 
as it deems fair and reasonable and will seek legal advice on the Company’s liability to pay 
compensation. The Committee also seeks to reduce the level of any compensation payable 
and takes into account, amongst other factors, the individual’s and the Group’s performance; 
the Director’s obligation to mitigate their own loss; and the Director’s length of service when 
calculating termination payments. The Committee reserves the right to phase any such 
payments if it deems that it is appropriate to do so. Any amount that the Committee decides 
to pay an Executive Director will be based on the main elements of Executive Remuneration 
namely, base salary, annual bonus (subject to the Committee’s discretion), benefits and pension. 
The Committee also takes into account the rules of the annual bonus and LTPP Schemes when 
determining any payments for loss of office as follows:
Annual Bonus – in accordance with the provisions contained within the service contracts, Executive 
Directors are not usually entitled to any bonus payment (other than in circumstances where they 
are deemed by the Committee as a ‘ good leaver’, which includes but is not limited to redundancy, 
retirement, ill-health or disability or any other circumstance which the Committee may decide), 
unless they remain employed and are not under notice as at the payment date. Any bonus payment 
for a ‘ good leaver’ will be based on the individual performance of the Executive Director concerned 
as well as the Company’s performance during the relevant period. Such payment will be pro-rated 
depending on the proportion of the bonus period worked by the relevant individual. Any bonus 
payment to the leaving Executive Director will normally be paid entirely in cash. 
Deferred Bonus – if the Executive Director is deemed to be a ‘ good leaver’ (as defined above), 
they will be entitled to retain the shares subject to settling any tax and national insurance 
liability that may become due on release of the shares. In all other cases, the shares will lapse 
immediately on the date that the Executive Director’s employment with the Company ends 
and there is no entitlement to any compensation for the loss of the shares. Deferred shares 
can, at the discretion of the Committee, be released to the Executive Director on cessation 
of employment. 88       Barratt Developments PLC – Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Other Information
LTPP – under the rules of the LTPP, unless the Executive Director is deemed by the Committee 
to be a ‘ good leaver’ (as defined above) any LTPP awards held by them will lapse on cessation 
of his or her employment. If he or she is a ‘ good leaver’, the number of shares subject to the 
award will be pro-rated based on the number of weeks of the relevant performance period 
completed by them. Other than in the event of death, no shares will be released to the Executive 
Director, until the normal vesting date. During this time the shares will continue to be subject 
to the relevant performance conditions until the end of the performance period, at which point 
the Committee will test the performance conditions and determine how much, if any, of the 
remaining shares will vest. Following the vesting of each scheme, (absent a life changing event 
such as retirement and the consent of the Committee), the Executive Directors must retain 
any shares vesting under the LTPP for a period of two-years commencing from the end of the 
relevant performance period.
Change of control – the rules of each share scheme operated by the Company contain provisions 
relating to a change of control. In the event that a change of control does occur any unvested 
options or awards will become vested on the date of the relevant event. However, the number 
of options or awards that vest will be pro-rated depending on the number of weeks completed 
within the relevant performance period and the level of performance conditions achieved during 
that period. Options or awards which have already vested as at the date of the relevant event may 
still be exercised within the prescribed timescales set out in the rules.
Differences between Executive Directors’ and employees’ remuneration
The following differences exist between the Company’s policy for the remuneration of Executive 
Directors as set out in the Future policy table on pages 80 to 85 and its approach to the payment 
of employees generally:
 > a lower level of maximum annual bonus opportunity may apply to employees other than the 
Executive Directors. All employees, including Executive Directors, are subject to similar 
performance targets, however the weightings against the various targets may vary;
 > Executive Directors are required to defer any bonus earned in excess of 100% of base salary 
into shares for a period of three years;
 > Executive Directors’ may opt to receive a cash supplement in lieu of being auto-enrolled 
or contributing to the defined contribution section of the Barratt Group Pension and Life 
Assurance Scheme. The cash supplement or employer's contribution rate for existing 
Executives does not exceed 25% of base salary. For all other employees, the maximum rate 
of employer’s contribution varies between 5%–25%. Any new Executive Directors will be at 
the same rate as Senior Management from time to time; and
 > Executive Directors are able to participate in the LTPP. A number of select employees at Senior 
Management level may be invited to participate in the LTPP at the Committee’s discretion.
In general, these differences arise from the development of remuneration arrangements that 
are market competitive for the various categories of individuals. They also reflect the greater 
emphasis placed on performance-related pay for Executive Directors.
Executive Directors' shareholding requirements
To further align the interests of Executive Directors to those of shareholders, Executive Directors 
are required to build and retain a shareholding equivalent to 200% of base salary (FY16, 200% 
Chief Executive and 150% other Executive Directors) in the Company's shares within five years 
of the shareholding requirement coming into force or the Executive Director being appointed to 
the Board, whichever is the later. The share price used for the purposes of determining the value 
of the shares is that prevailing on 30 June of the given year. The Committee reserves the right to 
amend the percentage holding required by the Chief Executive and the other Executive Directors 
depending on market conditions and best practice guidance.
Details of the Executive Directors’ shareholdings can be found in Table 21 on page 99. 
Performance scenario charts – fixed and variable pay
The Group’s policy seeks to ensure that a substantial proportion of Executive Directors’ 
remuneration is performance related and that enhanced rewards are only paid for exceptional 
performance. The chart below shows how the composition of each of the Executive Directors’ 
remuneration packages varies at different levels of performance achievement for the 2017/18 
financial year.

Non-Executive directorships 
Subject to Board approval, Executive Directors are permitted to accept one Non-Executive 
directorship outside the Company and retain any fees received from such a position. Board  
approval will not be given for any Non-Executive position where such appointment would lead 
to a material conflict of interest or would have an effect on the Director’s ability to perform their 
duties to the Company.
Chairman and Non-Executive Directors’ letters of appointment
The Chairman and each of the Non-Executive Directors are appointed under terms set out 
in a letter of appointment. They do not have service contracts and their appointments can be 
terminated (by the Board) without compensation for loss of office and by giving the appropriate 
length of notice as prescribed in their respective letters of appointment.
The notice period applicable, from either party, for the Chairman is three months and for each 
of the other Non-Executive Directors is one month. Under governance policies approved by the 
Board, Non-Executive Directors are appointed for a three-year term and usually serve a second 
three-year term subject to performance review and re-election by shareholders. Beyond this a 
further term of up to three years may be served subject to rigorous review by the Chairman and 
the Nomination Committee and re-election by shareholders. Details of Non-Executive Directors’ 
letters of appointment can be found in Table 11.

The letters of appointment for Non-Executive Directors are available for inspection by any person 
at the Company’s registered office during normal office hours.
Gifts to Directors on leaving employment
The Committee reserves the discretion to approve gifts to long serving Directors who are 
retiring or who are ‘ good leavers’ e.g. those leaving office for any reason other than dismissal 
or misconduct. The value of the gift for any one Director shall be limited to a maximum of £5,000 
(excluding any tax or VAT liability). Where a tax or VAT liability is incurred on such a gift, the 
Committee has the discretion to approve the payment of such liability on behalf of the Director 
in addition to the maximum limit.
Legacy arrangements
For the avoidance of doubt, in approving the Policy, authority is given to the Company to honour 
any previously disclosed commitments entered into with current or former Directors including, 
but not limited to, payment of pensions or the vesting/exercise of past share awards.
Statement of consideration of pay and employment conditions elsewhere across the Group
The level for all employees’ salaries is determined with reference to the rate of inflation, salaries 
for similar positions throughout the industry and general themes and trends in respect of 
remunerating employees.
When reviewing the pay and employment conditions of Executive Directors, including increase 
in base salary, the Committee takes into consideration the pay and employment conditions of 
all employees across the Group. The Company does not directly consult with employees when 
setting Executive Directors’ remuneration, however given that the Company operates the 
Sharesave in which all employees can participate and become shareholders in the Company, 
they can comment on the Group’s Remuneration Policy in the same way as all of our other 
shareholders. In addition, the Company provides a number of forums through which employees 
can ask questions on such matters should they so wish.
Statement of consideration of shareholder views
Each year we normally update our major shareholders upon the Committee’s application of the 
Policy and our performance, following the release of the July trading update and in advance 
of the publication of our Annual Report and Accounts. The Committee takes into account 
shareholder feedback received from this exercise and any additional feedback received during

The Company Secretary acts as Secretary to the Committee.
Advice/advisers 
In carrying out its principal responsibilities, the Committee has the authority to obtain the 
advice of external independent remuneration consultants and is solely responsible for their 
appointment, retention and termination. During the year, the Committee has taken advice from 
independent advisers, New Bridge Street (‘NBS’), a part of Aon plc. NBS was initially appointed 
by the Committee as its remuneration consultant in 2008 and is a founder signatory to the 
Remuneration Consultants Group’s Code of Conduct. In addition to advising the Committee, 
NBS also provided the Company with advice on implementing decisions made by the Committee 
and remuneration benchmarking. The Chairman of the Committee also seeks advice from NBS 
independent of management on any matters to be discussed at Committee meetings. NBS’s fees 
for providing such advice amounted to £72,830 for the year ended 30 June 2017 (2016: £40,489). 
In line with best practice, the Committee assesses from time to time, whether the appointment 
remains appropriate or if it should be put out to tender as part of its effectiveness review. 
In addition, as part of this assessment, the Committee also considers the independence 
and objectivity of NBS. While the Committee did not feel there were any issues regarding 
independence and objectivity, given the length of tenure of NBS, the Committee concluded that it 
would be appropriate to put the position out to tender. The tender process will take place during 
the next financial year, with a view to appointing a remuneration consultant as soon as possible in 
calendar year 2018. Aon plc also provided broking services to the Company in respect of private 
medical insurance, death in service benefits and group income protection.
The Committee also receives input into its decision making from the Chief Executive (David 
Thomas), the Company Secretary (Tina Bains) and the Group Human Resources Director 
(Rob Tansey), none of whom were present at any time when their own remuneration 
was being considered. Annual Report and Accounts 2017 – Barratt Developments PLC     91

Remuneration Report
In this section, we describe how the Policy will be applied in FY18 and how it has been 
implemented throughout FY17 together with the resulting payments to Directors. The Annual 
report on remuneration will be subject to an advisory vote at the 2017 AGM.
Statement of implementation of the Policy for FY18
Executive Directors’ remuneration for FY18 will be based on the Group’s Remuneration Policy 
as approved by shareholders in 2014 and set out in the 2014 Annual Report and Accounts until 
the New Policy is approved by shareholders. The New Policy, as shown on pages 80 to 89, will 
be presented for approval by shareholders at the 2017 AGM and will be effective immediately 
on approval.
Base salary
The Committee reviewed the salaries of the Executive Directors in April 2017 and the salary of 
the Chief Executive in June 2017. In reviewing these salaries the Committee had regard to: the 
performance of the Executive Directors during the year; the pay and employment conditions 
elsewhere in the business; the increase awarded to other members of staff; and the multiplier 
effect of an increase in base salary on the package as a whole. On this basis the Committee 
agreed to increase the salaries of David Thomas and Steven Boyes by 3%, in line with the average 
increase given to other employees across the organisation. Following her promotion on 22 June 
2017, Jessica White’s salary was increased to £400,000 per annum to more fully represent the 
additional responsibilities of the role. The salaries of the Executive Directors with effect from 
1 July 2017 will therefore be:

Following these increases David Thomas’ and Steven Boyes’ salaries remain within the range for 
the housebuilding sector and the wider population of similar sized companies.
Pension
Each of the Executive Directors has opted to receive a cash salary supplement in lieu of a 
pension of up to 25% annual salary. These arrangements will continue for current Directors 
in FY18. The Remuneration Committee considered the current level of pension provision for 
Directors and has agreed that any new Executive Director would be given a pension equivalent 
to that of Managing Directors, currently 15% of salary. Jessica White will receive a cash salary 
supplement of 15% of her salary.
Annual bonus
Executive Directors and Senior Management will participate in the Group’s annual bonus scheme 
in accordance with the Policy. The Company is of the view that the individual annual bonus 
performance targets are commercially sensitive in terms of the Group Strategy therefore these 
targets will not be disclosed in this report. We will as always disclose the annual bonus targets 
and performance against them in next year’s Annual Report and Accounts. The performance 
measures, the reasons for selecting these measures and the maximum bonus payment against 
each of them expressed as a percentage of salary for FY18 will be:

1  Executive Directors will have two personal objectives each as well as two strategic objectives which will be based on land and improving margin.
2 Any bonus earned in aggregate in excess of 100% will continue to be deferred into shares and held in the DBP . The Committee has agreed that  
 no matching shares will be awarded against any deferred shares in respect of FY18.
The Group’s profitability remains a key measure, however, in order to drive sustainable value this 
must be achieved through an appropriate capital structure and in line with the risk profile of the 
business. In order to ensure that the annual bonus performance measures remain appropriate, 
they have been reviewed against last year’s and the following changes have been made to 
simplify the scheme and align performance measures with the Group’s strategy: 
 > to ensure that the bonus scheme is concentrated on key drivers and to further simplify the 
scheme, the number of performance measures has been reduced from five to three;
 > profit before tax remains a key performance measure, the weighting has been increased to adjust 
for the removal of the other financial items which now form part of the strategic objectives;
 > the weighting of the quality of service metric has also increased to reflect the importance of 
maintaining a high quality product and service for our customers; and
 > the weighting of personal and strategic objectives has increased to cater for the inclusion of 
metrics that are relevant for the financial year. For the financial year ending 30 June 2018 the 
strategic objectives will focus on land and improving margin. The Committee has also agreed 
to retrospectively disclose the personal and strategic objectives of the Directors and the 
performance against them starting with those for the current year (see page 96).
The Committee will continue to have an overriding discretion in respect of any bonus payment in 
accordance with its Remuneration Policy. In addition, any bonus awarded for FY18 will be subject 
to Malus and Clawback.

LTPP
The level of the LTPP award to be granted to Executive Directors during FY18 will be in line with 
that set out in the Policy. The Committee is cognisant that such an award should be subject to 
performance targets, which are stretching and challenging whilst aligned with the short and 
long term performance of the Group and TSR. Accordingly, the Committee has agreed that 
the extent to which the LTPP award to be granted in the year ended 30 June 2018 (the ‘2017/18 
LTPP’) will vest, will be dependent on three independent performance conditions; TSR, EPS and 
Underlying ROCE, which will be measured as follows:

2  Please see the Glossary on page 176 for the definition of Underlying ROCE. This equates to a ROCE of 25% at threshold and 28% at maximum.
Vesting will be on a straight-line basis between threshold and maximum. In addition, all LTPP 
awards are subject to an overriding Committee discretion, whereby the Committee must be 
satisfied that the underlying financial performance of the Group, over the performance period, 
warrants the level of vesting as determined by applying the above targets. If the Committee 
is not of this view, it has the authority to reduce (possibly to nil) the level of vesting as it 
deems appropriate.
The 2017/18 LTPP will also be subject to Clawback provisions and a two-year holding period will 
apply from the end of the performance period, on any shares vesting (net of shares sold to satisfy 
tax and national insurance liabilities).
Non-Executive Directors’ fees 
The Board reviewed the fees for the Non-Executive Directors (including the Chairman) and 
concluded that in order to ensure that the base fee level remains competitive in the market, they 
should be increased to £315,000 per annum for the Chairman and £60,000 per annum for each of 
the Non-Executive Directors with effect from 1 July 2017. The additional fees for the Chairmen of 
the Committees and the Senior Independent Director remain the same. Accordingly, the annual 
fees payable to the Non-Executive Chairman and Non-Executive Directors with effect from 1 July 
2017 are as follows:

3 Performance conditions for the LTPP and the SMIS were tested after 30 June 2017 and 100% of the award is due to vest in October 2017. The market price of the shares has been calculated based on an average market value over the three months to 30 June 2017 (£5.84 per share).
4   In accordance with regulatory requirements, the values in this column have been re-calculated using share price of £4.76 per share being the market value of the shares on the vesting date, 24 October 2016, as opposed to the market price of £5.37 per share calculated based on an average market 
value over the three months to 30 June 2016 as disclosed in last year’s Remuneration report. 
5 The Sharesave Scheme, granted in March 2013, was subject to a continued employment condition and matured on 1 June 2016. The value is calculated using a share price of £5.74 per share being the mid-market close price of a share on the date of maturity. 
6  Jessica White was appointed to the Board on 22 June 2017 and her salary, bonus and pension entitlement above reflects the time served on the Board. Jessica White’s benefits (including car allowance) and pension supplement for the period 22 June 2017 to 30 June 2017 were £430 and £489 
respectively. The Company also paid the legal fees of £2,806 (excluding VAT) for the advice Jessica White received in respect of her terms of appointment and service contract.
7 Neil Cooper was appointed to the Board on 23 November 2015 and resigned from the Board on 19 January 2017. His salary reflects the period served on the Board. Full details of his leaving arrangements can be found on pages 103 and 104.
8 The benefits (taxable) for Steven Boyes includes a cash payment of £30,406 (including tax and national insurance contributions) for re-imbursement of the cost of a holiday which had to be cancelled to deal with urgent Company business.

Annual bonus
For the year under review, Executive Directors had the potential to earn an annual bonus of up to 150% of base salary, 130% of which is based on the attainment of Group performance targets and 
20% on personal objectives, both of which are linked directly to the Group’s strategy. Any bonus earned in excess of 100% of base salary is deferred into shares for a period of three years. All targets, 
Group and personal, were agreed towards the beginning of the financial year and amended during the course of the year based on the circumstances prevailing at the time. The Group performance

1  The actual EPS of 61.3 pence has been re-based using the corporation tax rate applicable at the date on which the 2014/15 LTPP targets were set, 
as the subsequent reduction to the rate of corporation tax was not performance related. The actual EPS has also been re-based using the same 
number of shares in issue as used in the 2014/15 LTPP targets. The re-based EPS used for the purpose of determining vesting, which is directly 
comparable to the 2014/15 LTPP targets, was 61.9 pence.
The Committee considered the underlying financial performance of the Group and was satisfied 
that given the continued improvement in the Group’s financial results, the above level of vesting 
of the 2014/15 LTPP was justified. Accordingly, the gross number of shares to be released to each 
of the Executive Directors are as follows:

The 2016/17 LTPP for Executive Directors is subject to three performance conditions, one-third 
TSR, one-third EPS and one-third ROCE. The levels of vesting against TSR are measured over 
a three-year period commencing 1 July 2016, and against EPS and ROCE for the financial year 
ending 30 June 2019. On completion of the performance period, assuming that shares vest, they 
will be subject to a further two-year holding period. 
As the award granted to Jessica White was made prior to her becoming an Executive Director, 
the award is subject to two performance measures, EPS (50%) and ROCE (50%), in line with 
other participants below Board and Executive Committee level. These performances measures 
will be measured against the same targets set for the Executive Directors’ LTPP awards. 
In addition, Jessica White’s award is not subject to a holding period.
Performance against the targets for each of the outstanding awards are as follows:

Statement of Directors’ shareholding and share interests (Audited)
For the financial year ended 30 June 2017 Executive Directors were required to hold shares 
in the Company equivalent in value to 200% of salary (2016: 200% for the Chief Executive and 
150% of salary for the other Directors). The Chief Executive must hold a minimum of 67% 
(50% for other Executive Directors) as an Owned Shareholding. The Chief Executive and other 
Executive Directors are expected to meet this requirement no later than the fifth anniversary 
of joining the Board, with progress being made towards its achievement throughout the period. 
Participants who have not built up the required level of shareholding by the end of the defined 
period, will not be eligible for inclusion in future share-based incentive schemes, likewise, 
they will not be allowed to sell any of the net of tax shares released from incentive schemes 
until they reach the levels specified, unless exceptional circumstances exist in the opinion 
of the Committee. The Committee retains discretion to adjust the length of time in which the 
required amount of shareholding needs to be accrued in order to adjust for events out of the 
individual’s control. 
At 30 June 2017, both David Thomas and Steven Boyes have met the shareholding requirement. 
Jessica White has until 21 June 2022 to meet the shareholding requirement.
The interests of the Directors serving during the financial year and their connected persons 
in the ordinary share capital of the Company at the beginning and end of the year are shown 
in Table 21. On 24 July 2017 the Company was notified that Steven Boyes and Jessica White 
exercised their respective options over 2,578 shares each under the SAYE scheme. No other 
notification has been received of any change in the interests shown during the period 30 June 
2017 to 5 September 2017 inclusive, with the exception of the shares to be deferred in respect of 
the bonus earned in excess of 100% of base salary by Executive Directors for the financial year 
ended 30 June 2017 the details of which can be found on page 96.
To be classified as a ‘ good leaver’ from the Company, the Executive Directors, will be required to 
commit to retaining a total shareholding of 100% and 75% respectively of the value of their final 
salary in the Company’s shares for two years following their leaving date.

 possible following the vesting date. 
10 Neil Cooper left the Board on 19 January 2017 at which time his options and awards lapsed. Neil Cooper was treated as a ‘ good leaver’ in respect of his DBP award granted on 17.10.2016 with awards vesting following the announcement of the half year results on 23 February 2017.
All conditional awards and share options are subject to an overriding Committee discretion, in that the Committee must be satisfied that the underlying financial performance of the Group over 
the performance period warrants the level of vesting as determined by applying the relevant targets. If the Committee is not of this view, it has the authority to reduce the level of vesting as it 
deems appropriate.  Annual Report and Accounts 2017 – Barratt Developments PLC     103

Dilution 
On maturity or vesting of any of its share incentive schemes the Company satisfies the awards 
through: a new issue of shares; market purchases; or the EBT. During the financial year 
ended 30 June 2017, the Company continued to satisfy all outstanding Executive options and 
awards under the LTPP, 2009/10 ESOS, the DBP and the Sharesave through a new issue of 
shares, subject to the dilution limits described below. Awards made to individuals below Senior 
Management level continued to be satisfied through shares currently held, or to be purchased in 
the market, by the EBT. 
The Company regularly monitors the number of shares issued under its schemes and the 
impact on dilution limits. The Company is satisfied that as at 30 June 2017 its usage of shares 
is compliant with the relevant dilution limits set by the Investment Association in respect of 
all share plans (10% of the Company’s issued share capital in any rolling ten-year period) and 
discretionary share plans (5% of the Company’s issued share capital in any rolling ten-year 
period). In the event that the outstanding options under each of the schemes to be satisfied 
through a new issue of shares were to vest and had been exercised on 30 June 2017, the resulting 
issue of new shares would represent 1.6% of the Company’s issued share capital as at that date. 
Executive Directors’ pension arrangements 
The Company’s pension policy for Executive Directors is that on joining the Group they will be 
auto-enrolled unless they choose to opt-out. Upon opting-out, the Executive Director may choose 
to receive a cash supplement (which does not count for incentive purposes) and/or participate 
in the Company’s defined contribution money purchase pension plan. Each of the Executive 
Directors have opted to receive a cash supplement in lieu of pension. For FY17, David Thomas 
and Steven Boyes received an amount equal to 25% of base salary in line with market practice. 
Jessica White, with effect from 22 June 2017, received an amount equal to 15% base salary in line 
with the Remuneration Committee’s decision for new Executive Directors to receive a pension 
contribution equivalent to other Senior Managers, currently 15% base salary. Only the base 
salary element of a Director’s remuneration is pensionable.
Defined benefit section
Steven Boyes was a deferred member of the defined benefit section of the Barratt Group Pension 
and Life Assurance Scheme (the ‘Scheme’) during the year ended 30 June 2017.
The Scheme was closed to new entrants in 2001 and on 30 June 2009, the Company exercised 
its consent under the rules of the Scheme and agreed to cease offering future accrual of defined 
benefits for current members. Members of the Scheme became eligible to join the defined 
contribution money purchase section of the Scheme with effect from 1 July 2009.
Until 30 June 2009, Steven Boyes was an active member of the defined benefit section of the 
Scheme. This entitlement was based on a 1/60 accrual rate and a normal retirement age of 
65. Since 1 July 2009, Steven Boyes has been entitled to receive a cash supplement which is 
currently equal to 25% of his base salary per annum.
The previous full actuarial valuation of the Scheme as at 30 November 2013 showed a deficit 
of £34.8m calculated on the basis of the Scheme’s technical provisions. The Company and the 
Trustees of the Scheme agreed a plan to address the shortfall which required the Company 
to make deficit reduction payments of £13.3m per annum until 30 November 2015, followed by 
payments of £9.5m per annum from 1 December 2015 until 31 December 2016. Since 1 January 
2017, the Company has continued to make deficit reduction payments of £9.5m per annum and 
it was intended that these would continue until 28 February 2018 (or until the Scheme reaches 
full funding on its long term funding basis, if earlier). In March 2017, the Board were advised 
that the triennial valuation undertaken in November 2016 had indicated a £69.2m deficit. In order 
to address the deficit, the Board has agreed to increase its annual contribution from £9.5m to 
£14.5m for a period of three years from 1 April 2017. Thereafter contributions of £10.0m per 
annum will be made until the Scheme is fully funded. The valuation for the Financial Statements 
was updated to 30 June 2017 by a qualified independent actuary and a surplus of £13.6m 
(2016: surplus of £8.1m) is included in the Group Balance Sheet as shown in note 6.2.2 of the 
Financial Statements. 
Members of the Scheme are also eligible for an insured lump sum of up to five times pensionable 
salary on death in service. Current employees who were members of the defined benefit section 
of the Scheme at closure also retain their dependants’ pension entitlements. 
No excess retirement benefits have been paid to or are receivable by current and/or past 
Directors in respect of their qualifying services during the financial year and there are no 
arrangements in place that guarantee pensions with limited or no abatement on severance 
or early retirement.
Payments to former Directors and those leaving the Group (Audited)
Neil Cooper 
Neil Cooper stepped down from the Board on 19 January 2017. Under the termination 
arrangements agreed with the Company he will continue to receive a monthly sum in respect 
of salary of £37,833, plus a cash supplement in lieu of pension of £9,458 per month and a car 
allowance of £1,250 per month (all less withholding for income tax and national Insurance 
contributions). He would also continue to be provided with private health insurance (valued at 
£1,199 per annum) for a period of 12 months or, if earlier, up until the date on which alternative 
employment is obtained. In addition he has been paid £6,985 in lieu of holidays accrued but not 
taken during his period of employment and a contribution of up to £9,500 (excluding VAT) for 
legal fees in connection with his loss of office based on fees actually incurred. With effect from 
5 June 2017, Neil Cooper secured alternative employment. In accordance with the termination 
arrangements agreed, the monthly sum in respect of salary was adjusted to £12,833 (less 
withholding for tax and national insurance contributions). The payments in lieu of pension and the 
car allowance remain unchanged. 104       Barratt Developments PLC – Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Other Information
Neil Cooper’s Option under the CFO Scheme (76,175 ordinary shares with an option price of 
10 pence per share) and award under the LTPP (122,440 ordinary shares), both granted on 
21 December 2015 lapsed immediately on leaving the business. The option over 3,734 ordinary 
shares granted under the Company’s Sharesave also lapsed upon Neil leaving the business. 
In accordance with the rules of the DBP the Remuneration Committee determined that he 
should be treated as a good leaver in respect of the 25,144 ordinary shares awarded in respect 
of performance in the year to 30 June 2016 and these subsequently vested on 23 February 2017 
following the release of the half year results. All other awards granted to Neil Cooper lapsed on 
cessation of his employment.
No further payments were made to any former Directors during the year ended 30 June 2017 
(30 June 2016: £nil) except otherwise disclosed in this Remuneration report.
No payments were made in respect of loss of office during the year ended 30 June 2017 
(30 June 2016: £nil) except as otherwise disclosed in this Remuneration report.

or the members for any benefit provided pursuant to the Articles and receipt of any such benefit 
shall not disqualify any person from being or becoming a Director of the Company.
Related party transactions
The Board and certain members of Senior Management are related parties within the definition 
of IAS 24 (Revised) ‘Related Party Disclosures’ (‘IAS 24’) and the Board are related parties 
within the definition of Chapter 11 of the UK Listing Rules (‘Chapter 11’). There is no difference 
between transactions with key personnel of the Company and transactions with key personnel 
of the Group.
During the year, the Group entered into the following transactions which, for the purposes of IAS 
24, is considered to be a ‘related party transaction’: 
David Thomas
As outlined in the 2016 Annual Report and Accounts, in June 2016 David Thomas notified 
the Board that he and one of his connected persons intended to buy one property each at the 
BDW Trading Limited site at Cane Hill Park, Coulsdon, Surrey (the ‘Transactions’).
Property 1
David Thomas (Chief Executive) reserved a property from BDW Trading Limited, at a purchase 
price of £579,995 (which includes an upgraded kitchen, flooring, lighting, built-in wardrobe and 
soft furnishings). The property was purchased on a sale and licence back basis for a period of 
two years with an annual rental of 6%. A 10% deposit was paid on exchange and the balance on 
completion on 16 December 2016 in accordance with the Group’s normal terms of trade.
Property 2
David Thomas’ connected person reserved a David Wilson home from BDW Trading Limited at a 
purchase price of £545,000 together with a number of customer extras. A 10% deposit was paid 
on exchange and the balance was paid on completion on 12 April 2017 in accordance with the 
Group’s normal terms of trade. 
Both of the Transactions were conducted at a fair and reasonable market price based on an 
independent market valuation and similar comparable transactions at the time. On notification 
by David Thomas of the Transactions, the Board sought advice from its legal advisers and 
Corporate brokers/sponsors in respect of the application of Chapter 11 and section 190 of 
the Act (Substantial Property Transaction) (‘Section 190’) to the Transactions. The advice 
received concluded that the Transactions, both individually and combined, were exempt from 
the provisions of Chapter 11, due to being classified as a ‘Small Transaction’. However, the 
Transactions were above the threshold prescribed by Section 190 and as David Thomas is a 
Director of the Company, which is not a wholly owned subsidiary, shareholder approval was 
required before the Transactions could be completed. The Transactions were therefore approved 
by the Board in June 2016 subject to shareholder approval being obtained. The Company’s 
shareholders subsequently approved the Transactions at the 2016 AGM.
No amounts remain outstanding for either of the above Transactions as at 30 June 2017.
No other related party transactions that require disclosure, have been entered into during the 
year under review.
Disclosure of information to auditor 
So far as each of the Directors is aware, there is no relevant audit information (that is, 
information needed by the Company’s auditor in connection with preparing its report) of 
which the Company’s auditor is not aware.
Each Director has taken all reasonable steps that they ought to have taken in accordance 
with their duty as a Director to make themselves aware of any relevant audit information and 
to ensure that the Company’s auditor is aware of that information. This confirmation is given 
and should be interpreted in accordance with the provisions of section 418(2) of the Act. 108       Barratt Developments PLC – Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Other Information
Political donations and expenditure
Our policy is that the Group will not make donations to any political party. However, the definition 
of political donations under the Companies Act 2006 is very broad. During FY17, it was agreed 
that the Chief Executive would present to the Conservative Councillors’ Association annual 
conference about the issues facing the housing industry and take part in a discussion on how 
to address the country’s housing shortage. The Company paid £3,840 of the cost of the dinner 
at which this presentation and discussion took place.
Offices
The Group had 29 offices (excluding those offices undertaking an administrative function only) 
located throughout Britain at the end of the financial year. The Group also has a representative 
office in Beijing and Shanghai, China. A full list of the Group’s offices and their locations can be 
obtained from the Company Secretary at the Company’s registered office or from its website 
www.barrattdevelopments.co.uk.
Capital structure
The Company has a single class of share capital which is divided into ordinary shares of 10 pence 
each. All issued shares are in registered form and are fully paid. Details of the Company’s issued 
share capital and of the movements in the share capital during the year can be found in note 5.6 
to the Financial Statements on page 155. Subject to the Articles, the Act and other shareholders’ 
rights, shares are at the disposal of the Board. At each AGM the Board seeks authorisation from 
its shareholders to allot shares. At the AGM held on 16 November 2016, the Directors were given 
authority to allot shares up to a nominal value of £33,462,297 (representing one-third of the 
nominal value of the Company’s issued share capital as at 30 September 2016), such authority to 
remain valid until the end of the 2018 AGM or, if earlier, until the close of business on 16 February 
2018. A resolution to renew this authority will be proposed at the 2017 AGM.
Rights and obligations attaching to shares
Subject to any rights attached to existing shares, shares may be issued with such rights and 
restrictions as the Company may by ordinary resolution decide, or (if there is no such resolution 
or so far as it does not make specific provision) as the Board may decide. 
Subject to the Act, the Articles specify that rights attached to any existing class of shares may 
be varied either with the written consent of the holders of not less than three-fourths in nominal 
value of the issued shares of that class (excluding any shares of that class held as treasury 
shares), or with the sanction of a special resolution passed at a separate general meeting of the 
holders of those shares. The rights conferred upon the holders of any shares shall not, unless 
otherwise expressly provided in the rights attaching to those shares, be deemed to be varied 
by the creation or issue of further shares ranking pari passu with them. 
Voting
Subject to any special terms as to voting upon any shares which may be issued or may at the 
relevant time be held, every member present in person or by proxy at a general meeting or 
class meeting has one vote upon a show of hands or, upon a poll vote, one vote for every share of 
which such member is a holder. In the case of joint holders of a share, the vote of the senior who 
tenders a vote, whether in person or by proxy, shall be accepted to the exclusion of votes of the 
other joint holders and seniority shall be determined by the order in which the names stand in 
the register in respect of the joint holding. 
In accordance with the Act, each member is entitled to appoint one or more proxies, and in the 
case of corporations, more than one corporate representative to exercise all or any of their rights 
to attend, speak and vote on their behalf at a general meeting or class meeting. The timescales 
for appointing proxies are set out in the Notice of the 2017 AGM. 
No member shall be entitled to vote at any general meeting or class meeting in respect of 
any shares held by them if any call or other sum then payable by them in respect of that share 
remains unpaid or if they have been served with a restriction notice (as defined in the Articles) 
after failure to provide the Company with information concerning interests in those shares 
required to be provided under the Act. 
Transfer of shares
Shares in the Company may be in uncertificated or certificated form. Title to uncertificated 
shares may be transferred by means of a relevant system and certificated shares may be 
transferred by an instrument of transfer as approved by the Board. The transferor of a share is 
deemed to remain the holder until the transferee’s name is entered into the Company’s register 
of members.
There are no restrictions on the transfer of shares except as follows. The Board may, in its 
absolute discretion and without giving any reason, decline to register any transfer of any share 
which is not a fully paid share. Registration of a transfer of an uncertificated share may be 
refused in the circumstances set out in the uncertificated securities rules (as defined in the 
Articles) and where, in the case of a transfer to joint holders, the number of joint holders to 
whom the uncertificated share is to be transferred exceeds four. 
The Board may decline to register a transfer of a certificated share unless the instrument of 
transfer: (i) is duly stamped or certified or otherwise shown to the satisfaction of the Board to 
be exempt from stamp duty and is accompanied by the relevant share certificate and such other 
evidence of the right to transfer as the Board may reasonably require; (ii) is in respect of only 
one class of share; (iii) if joint transferees, is in favour of not more than four such transferees; or 
(iv) where the transfer is requested by a person with a 0.25% interest (as defined in the Articles) 
if such a person has been served with a restriction notice after failure to provide the Company 
with information concerning interests in those shares required to be provided under the Act, 
unless the transfer is shown to the Board to be pursuant to an arm’s length sale (as defined 
in the Articles).
There are no special control rights in relation to the Company’s shares and the Company is not 
aware of any agreements between holders of securities that may result in restrictions on the 
transfer of securities.

Shareholder authority for purchase of own shares 
At the Company’s AGM held on 16 November 2016, shareholders gave authority to the Company 
to buy back up to an aggregate of 100,386,890 ordinary shares (representing 10% of the 
Company’s issued share capital). This authority is valid until the end of the 2017 AGM or, if earlier, 
until the close of business on 16 February 2018. Under the authority there is a minimum and 
maximum price to be paid for such shares. Any shares which are bought back may be held as 
treasury shares or, if not so held, will be cancelled immediately upon completion of the purchase, 
thereby reducing the Company’s issued share capital.
No purchases had been made under this authority as at the date of this Annual Report and 
Accounts. A resolution renewing the authority will be proposed at the 2017 AGM.
Dividends and distributions 
Subject to the provisions of the Act, the Company may, by ordinary resolution, from time to 
time declare dividends for payment to the holders of the ordinary shares of 10 pence each, 
of an amount which does not exceed the amount recommended by the Board. The Board may 
pay interim dividends, and also any fixed rate dividends, whenever the financial position of the 
Company justify their payment in the opinion of the Board. If the Board acts in good faith, it is 
not liable to holders of shares with preferred or pari passu rights for losses arising from the 
payment of interim or fixed dividends on other shares. The Board may withhold payment of all 
or any part of any dividends or other monies payable in respect of the Company’s shares from a 
person with a 0.25% interest if such person has been served with a restriction notice after failure 
to provide the Company with information concerning interests in those shares required to be 
provided under the Act.
Shareholder arrangements to waive dividends 
The Barratt Developments Employee Benefit Trust (the ‘EBT’) holds ordinary shares in the 
Company for the purpose of satisfying options and awards that have been granted under the 
various employee share schemes operated by the Company. Details of the shares so held are set 
out in note 5.6 to the Financial Statements.
The EBT has agreed to waive all or any future right to dividend payments on shares held within 
the EBT and these shares do not count in the calculation of the weighted average number 
of shares used to calculate EPS until such time as they are vested to the relevant employee. 
This waiver will not apply to any shares held under an award to which dividend equivalents apply.
The Trustees of the EBT may vote or abstain from voting on shares held in the EBT in any way 
they think fit and in doing so may take into account both financial and non-financial interests 
of the beneficiaries of the EBT or their dependants. 
Relations with other capital providers
The Board recognises the contribution made by other providers of capital to the Group and 
welcomes the views of such providers in relation to the Group’s approach to corporate governance.
Employee share schemes
Details of employee share schemes are set out in note 6.3 to the Financial Statements. Details of 
long term incentive schemes for the Directors are shown in the Remuneration report on pages 
92 to 105.
Employment policy and involvement
(i) Employment and diversity
The Group is committed to seeking to develop the talents of its employees so that they can 
maximise their career potential and providing rewarding careers in an atmosphere that 
engenders equal opportunities for all. Selection for employment and promotion is based on 
merit, following an objective assessment of ability and experience of candidates, after giving full 
and fair consideration to all applications (including individuals with disabilities). The Group is 
also committed to ensuring that its workplaces are free from discrimination. The Group strives 
to ensure that its policies and practices provide equal opportunities in respect of issues such 
as training, career development and promotion for all existing or potential staff irrespective of 
gender, race, ethnic origin, colour, religion, physical disability, marital status, sexual orientation 
or age. Every effort is made to retain and support employees who become disabled whilst 
working within the Group. Further details on the Group’s diversity initiatives are available in the 
Sustainability Report which is available from www.barrattdevelopments.co.uk/sustainability/
our-reports.
(ii) Employee engagement
The Board recognises that appropriate employee engagement is a key factor in the long term 
success of the Group. It utilises a comprehensive employee engagement programme with the 
aim of creating a strong, shared culture. All employees are invited to take part in an online 
engagement survey each year. The results of this survey are fed back to each operating division 
who use the results to formulate plans for maintaining or improving engagement in the following 
year. We continue to report high levels of engagement, with scores remaining within the top 
quartile of IBM’s database this year at 78% (2016: 77%).
(iii) Employee communications
A key part of effective employee engagement is communication. The Company seeks to ensure 
that all significant events, economic factors and financial updates and the impact of these on 
the performance of the Group are communicated to employees. This is mainly channelled 
through the Group’s intranet and the use of email alerts, core briefings and regular newsletters. 
Additionally, the Chief Executive regularly briefs senior and middle management via conference 
calls and bulletins which gives them the opportunity to ask questions and enter into dialogue. 
Individually and collectively, the Board and the Executive Committee members visit operating 
divisions and sites frequently in order to assess operational performance, engage with 
employees on a one-to-one basis and gain first-hand experience of employees’ aspirations 
and concerns. 1 10       Barratt Developments PLC – Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Other Information
(iv) Future talent
The Group runs a number of programmes for new entrants through our ‘Future Talent strategy’. 
The Group currently has 45 graduates across our two-year and one-year schemes, 15 of which 
commenced their training in September 2015. In addition, 82 delegates are currently on our 
bespoke Foundation Degree in Residential Development and Construction in partnership with 
Sheffield Hallam University. During the year we trained 455 Trade, Technical, Commercial 
and other apprentices/trainees and 11 undergraduate students on a paid 12-month industrial 
placement programme. We are now working with the Apprentice trailblazer programmes to 
help develop standards for the sector, and in partnership with Sheffield Hallam University are 
planning to deliver a Construction and Commercial Degree Apprenticeship programme.
(v) Employee training and development
The Group has a suite of leadership and management development programmes aimed at all 
levels within the organisation. The programmes are designed and delivered internally and are 
tailored to the needs of the business.
The Group also offers the Barratt Academy, a staged programme to enable employee 
development from apprentice to site manager as well as within the areas of customer service 
(new in FY16), our technical and commercial academies have been enhanced and we are making 
a significant investment into our IT training provision. Succession planning is in place across the 
Group and the leadership programmes assist with the development of individuals as part of this 
process. In addition, we have continued to provide development centres for those employees with 
high potential.
We are enhancing our leadership and management development programmes to provide our 
Directors and project managers with the skills required to manage change and complex projects 
effectively. We need to be able to successfully introduce and embed changes in our business, 
and equipping our people with the skills to manage change successfully is a key priority for us. 
We have developed a Project and Change Management toolkit and development programme, 
which contains a series of tools and steps we are now using to ensure a robust and reliable 
approach to managing projects. 
To supplement our Barratt Academy programmes we have successfully launched a 12 month 
transition programme for those leaving the armed forces who want to pursue a career in site 
management. Currently we have 24 on this programme and we are actively recruiting a further 
27. Succession planning continues to be a key priority. A key focus this year is to understand the 
key development needs for those on the succession plan so that we can fast track development 
for these individuals. 
(vi) Employee Sharesave Scheme
In April 2017, the Company invited all eligible employees of the Group to participate in the 
ninth grant under the Savings Related Share Option Scheme (the ‘2017 Sharesave’) which was 
approved by shareholders at the Company’s AGM held in November 2008. The invitations for the 
2017 Sharesave allowed eligible employees to contribute a maximum of £500 per month in one 
or a combination of Sharesave schemes. This enabled those individuals who had participated in 
previous grants under the Sharesave the opportunity to increase their savings and gave other 
employees (new and existing) the chance to participate and further align their interests with the 
performance of the Group. At 30 June 2017, approximately 52% of employees participate in one or 
more of the active Sharesave schemes. 
(vii) Culture and Values
The Company takes its collective culture and values very seriously. The Board considers 
feedback from the employee engagement survey in its overview of the management of the 
business. The Chief Executive has agreed in FY18 to further analyse, and enhance as necessary, 
the culture and values of the business. Any initiatives agreed and implemented during FY18 will 
be reported upon in the Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 30 June 2018.
Articles of Association
The Company’s Articles of Association (the ‘Articles’) contain regulations which deal with matters 
such as the appointment and removal of Directors, Directors’ interests and proceedings at 
general and Board meetings. Any amendments to the Articles may be made in accordance with 
the provisions of the Companies Act 2006 by way of a special resolution at a general meeting.
Approach to tax and tax governance
For all taxes, it is the Group’s aim to ensure it accurately calculates and pays the tax that is due 
at the correct time. Whilst the Group does seek to minimise its tax liabilities through the use 
of legitimate routine tax planning, it does not participate in aggressive tax planning schemes. 
The Group also seeks to be transparent in its dealings with HMRC and has regular dialogue with 
its representatives to discuss both developments in the business and the ongoing tax position. 
In accordance with UK law we will be publishing details of our tax strategy by the end of FY18.
The Chief Financial Officer retains overall responsibility for oversight of the tax affairs of the 
Group. Neil Cooper, Chief Financial Officer was Senior Accounting Officer until leaving the Group 
on 19 January 2017 at which time, David Thomas assumed the responsibility in his capacity of 
Chief Executive and Interim Chief Financial Officer. With effect from 1 July 2017 Jessica White 
became the Senior Accounting Officer. The Senior Accounting Officer receives regular updates 
on the tax position. In addition, taxation is discussed by the Audit Committee at least annually.

Significant agreements 
The following significant agreements as at 30 June 2017 contained provisions entitling the 
counterparties to exercise termination or other rights in the event of a change of control of 
the Company:
 > The revolving credit facility agreement dated 14 May 2013 (as amended on 17 December 
2014, 30 June 2016 and 29 December 2016) made between, amongst others, the Company, 
Lloyds Bank Plc (as the facility agent) and the banks and financial institutions named therein 
as lenders (the ‘Revolving Credit Facility Agreement’) contains a prepayment provision at 
the election of each lender on change of control. The Company must notify the facility agent 
promptly upon becoming aware of the change of control. After the occurrence of a change of 
control, the facility agent shall (if a lender so requests within 20 days of being notified of the 
change of control) by notice to the Company, on the date falling 30 days after the change of 
control, cancel the commitment of such lender under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement 
and declare all amounts outstanding in respect of such lender under the Revolving Credit 
Facility Agreement immediately due and payable. The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement also 
contains a provision such that, following a change of control, a lender is not obliged to fund 
any further drawdown of the facility (other than rollover loans). For these purposes, a ‘change 
of control’ occurs if any person or group of persons ‘acting in concert’ (as defined in the City 
Code on Takeovers and Mergers) gains control (as defined in the Corporation Tax Act 2010) 
of the Company. 
 > Each of the note purchase agreements entered into in respect of the Group’s privately placed 
notes (being the US$80m of notes issued pursuant to the following note purchase agreements: 
(i) a note purchase agreement in respect of the issue of US$15m notes dated 10 May 2011  
(as amended and restated on 14 May 2013 and as amended on 17 December 2014); and  
(ii) a note purchase agreement in respect of the issue of US$65m notes also dated 10 May 2011 
(as amended and restated on 14 May 2013 and as amended on 17 December 2014)) contains 
a change of control prepayment provision. Each such control provision provides that promptly 
after the Company becomes aware that a change of control has occurred, the Company shall 
notify all the holders of the notes of the same and give the noteholders the option to require the 
Company to prepay at par all outstanding amounts (principal and interest) under the notes. If a 
noteholder accepts such offer of prepayment, such prepayment shall take place on a business 
day that is not more than 90 days after the Company notified the noteholders of the change of 
control. For these purposes a ‘change of control’ means the acquisition by a person or a group 
of persons ‘acting in concert’ (as defined in the City Code on Takeovers and Mergers) such that 
they gain beneficial ownership of more than 50% of the issued share capital of the Company 
carrying voting rights. As explained in the post Balance Sheet event on page 106 the Group 
refinanced this US Private Placement. Full disclosure of the new private placement will be 
made in the 2018 Annual Report and Accounts.
 > Each of the debt facility agreements (based on a proforma agreement agreed in October 2012) 
between the Company (as guarantor), BDW (as borrower and developer) and the Homes and 
Communities Agency (‘HCA’) (as lender), whereby the HCA has made up to £33m (in aggregate) 
of project financing available to fund up to 20 development sites, contains a provision requiring 
BDW Trading Limited to obtain the consent of the HCA on a change in control of the Company, 
BDW or any of their holding companies (if relevant). The HCA is entitled to withhold its consent 
to such a change in control if the new controller does not have sufficient reputation, financial 
standing or organisational standing and capacity. A failure to: (i) obtain the HCA’s consent to a 
change in control; and (ii) provide the HCA with notice of the change in control within a specified 
time period, is an event of default under each of these agreements. On such an event of default 
the HCA may, by notice in writing to BDW, terminate each debt facility agreement and require 
BDW to prepay the project financing. For these purposes a ‘change in control’ means the 
acquisition by a person or a group of persons acting together such that they gain beneficial 
ownership of more than 50% of the issued share capital or voting rights of the relevant 
company, have the right to appoint the majority of the Directors of the relevant company or 
otherwise control the votes at Board meetings of the relevant company.
The note purchase agreements also impose upon the holders customary restrictions on resale 
or transfer of the notes, such as the transfer being subject to a de minimis amount.
Going concern
In determining the appropriate basis of preparation of the Financial Statements, the Directors 
are required to consider whether the Group can continue in operational existence for the 
foreseeable future. Accordingly, after making enquiries and having considered forecasts 
and appropriate sensitivities, the Directors have formed a judgement, at the time of approving 
the Financial Statements, that there is a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate 
resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future, being at least 
12 months from the date of these Financial Statements (more information on the going concern 
judgement can be found on page 124). For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern 
basis in the preparation of these Financial Statements.

Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities
Financial Statements and accounting records
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and Accounts including the 
Directors’ Remuneration report and the Financial Statements in accordance with applicable 
law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. 
The Directors are required by the International Accounting Standards Regulation (the ‘IAS 
Regulation’) to prepare the Group Financial Statements under International Financial Reporting 
Standards as adopted by the European Union (‘IFRS’) and have also elected to prepare the Parent 
Company Financial Statements in accordance with IFRS. The Financial Statements are also 
required by law to be properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and Article 
4 of the IAS Regulation. Under the Disclosure and Transparency Rules, the Directors must not 
approve the Accounts unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of 
affairs of the Company and of the profit or loss of the Company for that period.
International Accounting Standard 1 requires that Financial Statements present fairly for 
each financial year the Company’s financial position, financial performance and cash flows. 
This requires the faithful representation of the effects of transactions, other events and 
conditions in accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, 
income and expenses set out in the International Accounting Standards Board’s ‘Framework 
for the preparation and presentation of financial statements’. In virtually all circumstances, 
a fair presentation will be achieved by compliance with all applicable IFRS. Directors are 
also required to:
 > properly select and apply accounting policies;
 > present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, 
comparable and understandable information;
 > provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in IFRS are 
insufficient to enable users to understand the impact of particular transactions, other events 
and conditions on the entity’s financial position and financial performance; and
 > make an assessment of the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to 
show and explain the Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time 
the financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure that the Financial Statements 
comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets 
of the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud 
and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial 
information included on the Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing 
the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in 
other jurisdictions.
Fair, balanced and understandable
The Board considers, on the advice of the Audit Committee, that the Annual Report and 
Accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the Company’s position, performance, business model 
and strategy.
Directors’ responsibility statement
The Directors confirm that, to the best of each person’s knowledge:
a)  the Group and Parent Company Financial Statements in this Annual Report and Accounts, 
which have been prepared in accordance with IFRS, Standing Interpretation Committee 
interpretations as adopted and endorsed by the European Union, International Financial 
Reporting Interpretations Committee interpretations and those parts of the Companies Act 
2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS, give a true and fair view of the assets, 
liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the Company and of the Group taken as a 
whole; and
b)  the Annual Report and Accounts includes a fair review of the development and performance 
of the business and the position of the Company and the Group taken as a whole, together 
with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties they face.
The Directors of the Company and their functions are listed on pages 46 and 47.

Report on the audit of the Financial Statements
Opinion
In our opinion:
 > the Financial Statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of 
the Parent Company’s affairs as at 30 June 2017 and of the Group’s profit for the year 
then ended;
 > the Group Financial Statements have been properly prepared in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union;
 > the Parent Company Financial Statements have been properly prepared in accordance with 
IFRS as adopted by the European Union and as applied in accordance with the provisions 
of the Companies Act 2006; and
 > the Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of 
the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group Financial Statements, Article 4 of the 
IAS Regulation.
We have audited the Financial Statements of Barratt Developments PLC (the ‘Parent Company’) 
and its subsidiaries (the ‘Group’) which comprise:
 > the Consolidated Income Statement;
 > the Consolidated and Parent Company Statement of Comprehensive Income;
 > the Consolidated and Parent Company Statements of Changes in Equity;
 > the Consolidated and Parent Company Balance Sheets; 
 > the Consolidated and Parent Company Cash Flow Statements; and
 > the related notes 1 to 7.5.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law 
and IFRS as adopted by the European Union and, as regards the Parent Company Financial 
Statements, as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) 
and applicable law. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the 
auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the Financial Statements section of our Report. 
We are independent of the Group and the Parent Company in accordance with the ethical 
requirements that are relevant to our audit of the Financial Statements in the UK, including the 
FRC’s Ethical Standard as applied to listed public interest entities, and we have fulfilled our  
other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We confirm that the  
non-audit services prohibited by the FRC’s Ethical Standard were not provided to the Group 
or the Parent Company.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide 
a basis for our opinion.
Summary of our audit approach
Key audit matters The key audit matters that we identified in the current year were:
 > carrying value of land and work in progress; and
 > impairment of goodwill and intangible assets 
There are no changes to the key audit matters from the prior year .
Materiality The materiality that we used in the current year was £38.3m which was determined on the 
basis of 5% of statutory profit before tax.
Scoping Consistent with our approach in the prior year, our Group audit scope focused on the audit work 
of the two components, being housebuilding and commercial developments. All audit work 
was completed by the Group audit team. 
Significant changes  
in our approach
There are no significant changes in our approach from the prior year .
Conclusions relating to principal risks, going concern and viability statement
We have reviewed the Directors’ statement regarding the appropriateness of the going 
concern basis of accounting contained within note 1.3 to the Financial Statements and the 
Directors’ statement on the longer-term viability of the Group contained within the Strategic 
Report on page 44.
We are required to state whether we have anything material to add or draw attention to in  
relation to: 
 > the disclosures on pages 42-44 that describe the principal risks and explain how they 
are being managed or mitigated;
 > the Directors’ confirmation on page 44 that they have carried out a robust assessment 
of the principal risks facing the Group, including those that would threaten its business 
model, future performance, solvency or liquidity;
 > the Directors’ statement in note 1.3 to the Financial Statements about whether they 
considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing 
them and their identification of any material uncertainties to the Group and the Parent 
Company’s ability to continue to do so over a period of at least twelve months from the 
date of approval of the Financial Statements;
 > the Directors’ explanation on page 44 as to how they have assessed the prospects of 
the Group, over what period they have done so and why they consider that period to be 
appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have a reasonable expectation that 
the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over 
the period of their assessment, including any related disclosures drawing attention to 
any necessary qualifications or assumptions; or
 > whether the Directors’ statements relating to going concern and the prospects of the 
Company required in accordance with Listing Rule 9.8.6R(3) are materially inconsistent 
with our knowledge obtained in the audit.
We confirm that we have 
nothing material to add 
or draw attention to in 
respect of these matters.
We agreed with the 
Directors’ adoption of 
the going concern basis 
of accounting and we 
did not identify any such 
material uncertainties. 
However , because 
not all future events 
or conditions can be 
predicted, this statement 
is not a guarantee as 
to the Group’s ability 
to continue as a going 
concern.

Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the Financial Statements of the current period and include the most significant 
assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) that we identified. These matters included those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, the allocation 
of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team.
These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the Financial Statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

Key audit matter description The Group’s assessment of the carrying value of land and work in progress, being the lower of cost and net realisable value, is a judgemental process and is an area where potential fraud could occur as it requires the 
estimation of selling prices, sales rates and costs to complete, determined on a site by site basis. These factors drive the gross margin for each site and hence the profit recognised at the point of sale.
The land and WIP impairment calculation continues to be most sensitive to changes in sales price inflation (SPI) and build cost inflation (BCI) and net margin inflation. The outcome of the EU referendum and ongoing Brexit 
negotiations and the UK General Election has resulted in greater political and economic uncertainty which may impact selling prices, sales rates and build costs, especially in the longer term, albeit there is no evidence 
of pervasive adverse factors impacting the Group to date. Such assumptions impact the Group’s assessments on the carrying value of land and work in progress. The net impairment charge for the year was £13.5m 
(2016: £8.6m). In addition, revenue recognition on social housing developments accounted for under IAS 11 ‘Construction Contracts’ requires additional judgement in calculating the revenue and profit to be recognised, 
estimating the total expected costs to complete each site and the percentage of completion at the balance sheet date.
Refer to page 69 (Audit Committee Statement) and note 3.1 (financial statement disclosures including the related Critical Accounting Judgements and Key Sources of Estimation Uncertainty).
How the scope of our audit 
responded to the key audit matter
Our work involved the following:
 > We have tested the design, implementation and operating effectiveness of the Group’s controls relating to the determination of costs to complete as this is the most significant judgement applied to each site 
valuation. We attended a number of valuation meetings across all regions that review the carrying value of land and work in progress of individual sites and costs to complete. A sample of sites were also 
visited to enable us to verify how surveyors measure the degree of build completion of the developments against the costs incurred to date and to measure the sub-contractor accruals at the year end.
 > For multi-phased sites we have performed procedures to validate the appropriateness of actual and forecast margin maintained across the individual phases of the entire site.
 > We have reviewed the land acquisition appraisal process and viability assessment at acquisition and tested the design, implementation and operating effectiveness of the key controls. 
 > We have sample tested and agreed certain costs incurred to date included within land and work in progress as well as reviewing the proportion of that expenditure recognised as a cost of sale in the year 
in respect of units sold.
 > We have used IT interrogation tools to test the model prepared by Management to calculate the net realisable value of sites to ascertain the mechanical accuracy of the formulae being applied to the inputs 
to specific sites.
 > We have tested each of the key assumptions within Management’s model on forecast sales values, sales rates and costs to complete which support the basis of the carrying value of land and work in progress. 
We have compared the Group’s assumptions to external market forecasts for sales price inflation and build cost inflation and have tested a sample of sites to current market data on sales rates, sales prices 
and cost assumptions. We have also tested the accuracy of costs to complete assumptions on a sample basis.
 > We have performed independent sensitivity analysis, informed by external forecasts, to measure the impact on the carrying value of land and work in progress through possible deviations around the 
assumptions applied by management.
 > A sample of construction contracts for social housing developments have been tested by verifying the costs incurred to date and recalculating the percentage of completion at the balance sheet date. 
A selection of these schemes have been reviewed with a sample of costs agreed to third party surveyors’ certificates, total sales values agreed to contracts, and the recognition formula verified to support 
revenue recognised.
 > We have reviewed the appropriateness of the Group’s disclosures within the Annual Report and Financial Statements relating to the estimation uncertainty. 
Key observations The Group’s assumptions for SPI, BCI and net margin were consistent with our own expectations and the net impairment management assessed of £13.5m which has been recorded through the income statement 
was reasonable. 1 16       Barratt Developments PLC – Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets – £892.2m (2016: £892.2m) 
Key audit matter description The goodwill and David Wilson Homes brand intangible asset arose upon the acquisition of Wilson Bowden (see note 4.2).
The Group’s assessment of impairment of goodwill and intangible assets is a judgemental process which requires estimates concerning the forecast future cash flows associated with the goodwill and brand assets held, 
the discount rates and the growth rate of revenue, which incorporates assumptions on volume, house price inflation and margin, together with costs, to be applied in determining the value in use. The Group determined 
the discount rate to use in the impairment test with the assistance of an independent firm based on its weighted average cost of capital rate (‘WACC’).
As described in the previous key audit matter, the outcome of the EU referendum and UK General Election has resulted in greater political and economic uncertainty which may impact selling prices, sales rates and build 
costs, especially in the longer term.
There were no impairments in the current year (2016: £nil).
Refer to page 69 (Audit Committee Statement) and note 4.2 (financial statement disclosures including the related Critical Accounting Judgements and Key Sources of Estimation Uncertainty).
How the scope of our audit 
responded to the key audit matter
Our work involved the following:
 > We have assessed the design and implementation of the Group’s controls relating to Management’s impairment review of goodwill and intangible assets. 
 > We have tested the accuracy of the underlying model to assess whether the processes are applied to the correct input data and the outputs are mapped accurately. 
 > We challenged each of the key assumptions employed in the annual goodwill impairment test, including volumes, house price inflation, margin and costs; this included reference to historical performance, 
forward looking market data and forecast trends in the industry. 
 > This included reference to our internal valuation specialists’ benchmarking of the WACC employed as the discount rate, including its methodology and constituent inputs, comparison to independent market 
forecasts of revenue and cost growth in the housebuilding sector and an assessment of the Group’s historic forecasting accuracy.
 > We have tested Management’s sensitivity analysis in relation to the key inputs to the goodwill impairment test model, as well as performing our own sensitivity analysis which included changes to volume, 
margin, incentives and the discount rate applied.
 > We have reviewed the appropriateness of the disclosures provided in accordance with IAS 36 ‘Impairment of Assets’.
Key observations Based upon our procedures, we are satisfied that no impairment of the value of goodwill and intangibles assets is required.
Our application of materiality
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the Financial Statements that makes 
it probable that the economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed 
or influenced. We use materiality both in planning the scope of our audit work and in evaluating 
the results of our work. 
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the Financial Statements 
as a whole as follows:
Group materiality £38.3m (2016: £33.5m).
Basis for determining 
materiality
5% of statutory profit before tax in both the current and prior year . 
Rationale for the 
benchmark applied
Statutory profit before tax was used as the benchmark because this is a key performance 
indicator for the Group’s stakeholders and is consistent with the benchmark used for 
comparable companies.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the Committee all audit differences 
in excess of £1.9m (2016: £1.7m), as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, 
warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. We also report to the Audit Committee on disclosure 
matters that we identified when assessing the overall presentation of the Financial Statements.

An overview of the scope of our audit
Our Group audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of the Group and its environment, 
including Group-wide controls, and assessing the risks of material misstatement at the Group 
level. The entire Group is audited by one audit team, led by the Senior Statutory Auditor. The audit 
is performed centrally and comprises all the divisions which comprise the Group’s housebuilding 
segment, the Group’s commercial developments segment and the head office consolidation. 
Consistent with prior years, we choose to visit the Group’s three London housebuilding divisions 
each year, as well as five further non-London housebuilding divisions across each of the 
Group’s regions, selected on a rotational basis and with reference to size and complexity among 
other factors. We also visit Wilson Bowden Developments Limited on an annual basis, which 
constitutes the majority of the Group’s commercial developments segment, this was audited 
to its local statutory audit materiality determined on a profit before tax basis.  
Other information
The Directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises 
the information included in the Annual Report, other than the Financial Statements and our 
Auditor’s Report thereon.
Our opinion on the Financial Statements does not cover the other information and, except to 
the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our Report, we do not express any form of assurance 
conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the Financial Statements, our responsibility is to read the other 
information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent 
with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to 
be materially misstated.
If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are 
required to determine whether there is a material misstatement in the Financial Statements 
or a material misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have performed, 
we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required 
to report that fact.
In this context, matters that we are specifically required to report to you as uncorrected 
material misstatements of the other information include where we conclude that:
 > Fair, balanced and understandable – the statement given by the Directors that they 
consider the Annual Report and Financial Statements taken as a whole is fair, balanced 
and understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess 
the Group’s performance, business model and strategy, is materially inconsistent with 
our knowledge obtained in the audit; or
 > Audit Committee reporting – the section describing the work of the Audit Committee 
does not appropriately address matters communicated by us to the Audit Committee; or
 > Directors’ statement of compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code – the 
parts of the Directors’ statement required under the Listing Rules relating to the 
company’s compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code containing provisions 
specified for review by the auditor in accordance with Listing Rule 9.8.10R(2) do 
not properly disclose a departure from a relevant provision of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code.
We have nothing to 
report in respect of these 
matters.
Responsibilities of Directors
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities, the Directors are 
responsible for the preparation of the Financial Statements and for being satisfied that they 
give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the Directors determine is necessary 
to enable the preparation of Financial Statements that are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the Financial Statements, the Directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s 
and the Parent Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing as applicable, 
matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the 
Directors either intend to liquidate the Group or the Parent Company or to cease operations, 
or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Financial Statements as 
a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an 
Auditor’s Report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, 
but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect 
a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and 
are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to 
influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these Financial Statements.
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the Financial Statements is located 
on the Financial Reporting Council’s website at: www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. 
This description forms part of our Auditor’s Report.
Use of our Report
This Report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 
3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might 
state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an Auditor’s 
Report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or 
assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members as a 
body, for our audit work, for this Report, or for the opinions we have formed. 1 18       Barratt Developments PLC – Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Notes to the Financial Statements Year ended 30 June 2017
1. 1 Introduction
These Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as issued by the IASB, 
IFRIC interpretations and SIC interpretations as adopted and endorsed by the EU and with those 
parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS and therefore 
the Group Financial Statements comply with Article 4 of the EU International Accounting 
Standards Regulation. The Financial Statements have been prepared under the historical 
cost convention as modified by the revaluation of available for sale financial assets, derivative 
financial instruments and share-based payments.
Group accounting policies
The significant Group accounting policies are included within the relevant notes to the Financial 
Statements on pages 124 to 174.
Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of estimates 
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the 
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting 
period. Although these estimates are based on the Directors’ best knowledge of the amounts, 
actual results may ultimately differ from those estimates. The Directors have made no 
individual judgements that have a significant impact upon the Financial Statements, apart from 
those involving estimations.
The most significant estimates made by the Directors in these Financial Statements are set 
out within the relevant notes on pages 124 to 174.
1.2 Basis of consolidation
The Group Financial Statements include the results of Barratt Developments PLC (the 
‘Company’), incorporated in the UK, and all its subsidiary undertakings made up to 30 June. 
The financial statements of subsidiary undertakings are consolidated from the date when 
control passes to the Group using the purchase method of accounting and up to the date control 
ceases. All transactions with subsidiaries and intercompany profits or losses are eliminated 
on consolidation.
1.3 Going concern
In determining the appropriate basis of preparation of the Financial Statements, the Directors 
are required to consider whether the Group can continue in operational existence for the 
foreseeable future. 
The Group’s business activities, together with factors which the Directors consider are likely 
to affect its future development, financial performance and financial position are set out in the 
Strategic Report on pages 1 to 44. The material financial and operational risks and uncertainties 
that may have an impact upon the Group’s performance and their mitigation are outlined on 
pages 41 to 44 and financial risks including liquidity risk, market risk, credit risk and capital risk 
are outlined in note 5.5 to the Financial Statements. 
The financial performance of the Group is dependent upon the wider economic environment 
in which the Group operates. As explained in the Risk Management section on pages 40 
to 44, factors that particularly affect the performance of the Group include changes in the 
macroeconomic environment including buyer confidence, availability of mortgage finance for the 
Group’s customers and interest rates. In forming their conclusion, the Directors have considered 
all currently available information about the potential future outcomes of events and changes in 
conditions that are reasonably possible at the time of making this statement. In doing this they 
have concluded that no material uncertainties exist.
At 30 June 2017 the Group had total committed bank facilities and private placement notes of 
£748.3m. The final maturity dates of these facilities range from August 2017 to December 2021, 
with the £700.0m revolving credit facility maturing in December 2021. Since the balance sheet 
date the US$ private placement notes have been repaid and new sterling US private placement 
notes have been issued resulting in total committed bank facilities and private placement 
notes of £900.0m with maturities ranging from December 2021 to August 2027. The committed 
facilities and private placement notes provide appropriate headroom above our current forecast 
debt requirements. 
In addition to these committed borrowing facilities the Group has £16.8m of financing from the 
Government’s ‘Get Britain Building’ scheme repayable on 31 March 2018. Further committed 
loan facilities of £4.6m are available under agreements with local government which are due 
to be repaid between March 2018 and March 2020.
Accordingly, after making enquiries and having considered forecasts and appropriate 
sensitivities, the Directors have formed a judgement, at the time of approving the Financial 
Statements, that there is a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to 
continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future, being at least 12 months from the 
date of these Financial Statements. For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern 
basis in the preparation of these Financial Statements.

1.4 Adoption of new and revised standards
In the year ended 30 June 2017, the Group has adopted no new standards, amendments 
or interpretations. 
1.5 Impact of standards and interpretations in issue but not yet effective
At the date of approval of these Financial Statements, there were a number of standards, 
amendments and interpretations that have been published and are therefore mandatory for 
the Group’s accounting periods beginning on or after 1 July 2017 and later periods. The Group 
has not early-adopted any standard, amendment or interpretation.
The following new standards in particular are expected to have an impact upon the Group: 
 > IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’ was issued in May 2014 and amended in 
September 2015. This standard will be applicable to the Group from 1 July 2018. The standard 
sets out requirements for revenue recognition from contracts with customers. The standard 
uses a five-step model to apportion revenue to the individual promises, or performance 
obligations within a contract on the basis of standalone selling prices. We do not currently 
expect the standard to have a material impact on our reported results. The Group continues 
to assess the impact of the standard on the Group, however, we have concluded on a number 
of areas which are likely to affect the Group results: 
The Group previously offered a five-year warranty on private house sales. Under existing 
standards, no adjustment is made to revenue to reflect this warranty when the property 
is sold, although an allowance for future costs associated to the warranty is held within the 
Balance Sheet. An element of this warranty represents a separate performance obligation. 
On transition to IFRS 15, an element of the sales price of plots previously sold with this 
warranty will be deferred and recognised over the warranty period following the sale. 
The impact of this at transition is a net reduction in brought forward reserves of less than 
1%. The associated revenue and cost of sales will be subsequently recognised over the 
warranty period in the Income Statement, with the majority of this revenue and cost of sales 
recognised by the end of FY20. This will have a temporary, positive impact on gross margin 
following transition. 
The timing of revenue recognition on some long term commercial and housing contracts 
is likely to change. The timing, in some cases, of completion related revenue on commercial 
contracts may be brought forward; with revenue on housing contracts delayed. The effect of 
these changes is expected to be minimal as since the end of FY15 only a small number of new 
housing contracts have been recognised on a long term contract basis.  
The standard will require presentational changes to our Income Statement to show part-
exchange income and expenses separately below gross margin. These income and costs are 
currently recognised on a net basis within cost of sales, as disclosed in note 2.1. This change 
is expected to have a negative impact of less than 1% on gross margin. 
In addition, some presentation changes will be necessary. Introductory fees are currently 
deducted from revenue but under the new standard will be recognised in cost of sales. 
This will have no effect on gross margin. Management fees on construction contracts currently 
included in other income, will form part of revenue which will have a minimal positive impact 
on gross margin. 
The above items will have no effect on the Group’s cash flows. 
 > IFRS 16 ‘Leases’ was issued in January 2016, it is expected to be effective for the Group from 
1 July 2019. The standard specifies how leases are recognised, presented, measured and 
disclosed. The standard requires the recognition of a right of use asset and a corresponding 
lease liability on the Balance Sheet. In the Income Statement, the existing operating lease 
charge, the majority of which is currently recognised within operating profit will be replaced 
by a depreciation charge in respect of the right of use asset. In addition there will be an interest 
cost in relation to the lease liability which will be recognised within finance costs. The Group 
has continued its assessment of the impact of the standard on the Group’s results and financial 
position. We do not currently expect the standard to have a material impact on our reported 
results. The majority of the Group’s lease commitments will be brought onto the Balance 
Sheet together with corresponding right of use assets. This is likely to impact the timing of the 
recognition of lease costs within the Income Statement although it will not affect the Group’s 
cash flows. Based on an analysis of lease commitments held by the Group at the previous year 
end, and utilising estimated discount rates, the approximated net impact of the standard based 
on those lease commitments, would be a net reduction in profit before tax of less than 1% and 
a reduction in net assets of less than 1%. A detailed impact assessment of the standard will 
be made closer to transition, as the composition of the Group’s lease commitments are likely 
to change over time and the discount rates applied are required to be updated to reflect the 
prevailing economic environment.
 > IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’ was issued in final form incorporating the impairment, 
classification and measurement requirements in July 2014 and is scheduled to replace IAS 
39 ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement’ for the Group from 1 July 2018. 
IFRS 9 will impact the classification, measurement, impairment and de-recognition of financial 
instruments as well as introducing a new hedge accounting model. The Group continues 
to assess the impact and application of the standard on the Group’s results and financial 
position. We do not currently expect the standard to have a material impact on our reported 
results. The impairment requirements of the standard will require the Group to consider 
the expected lifetime losses on all financial assets. In addition, the requirements of the new 
hedge accounting model will be reflected in the Group’s existing hedging strategy, policies 
and documentation.
There may be corresponding tax liability implications in relation to all of the above impacts. 
 > Amendments to IAS 7 ‘Statement of Cash Flows’ was issued in January 2016 and will be 
applicable to the Group from 1 July 2017. The Amendment requires enhanced disclosures 
of changes in financing liabilities. 126       Barratt Developments PLC – Annual Report and Accounts 2017

2. 1 Revenue
The Group’s revenue derives principally from the sale of the homes we build and from the sale 
of commercial property.
Sale of goods – Revenue is recognised at legal completion in respect of the total proceeds of building 
and development. Revenue is measured at the fair value of consideration received or receivable and 
represents the amounts receivable for the property, net of discounts and VAT. The sale proceeds of 
part-exchange properties are not included in revenue and are recognised on a net basis within cost 
of sales on the basis that they are incidental to the main revenue-generating activities of the Group.
Contract accounting revenue – Revenue is only recognised on a construction contract where 
the outcome can be estimated reliably. Contracts are only treated as construction contracts 
when they have been specifically negotiated for the construction of a development or property. 
Variations to, and claims arising in respect of, construction contracts, are included in revenue 
to the extent that they have been agreed with the customer. Revenue is recognised by reference 
to the stage of completion of contract activity at the balance sheet date. This is normally 
measured by surveys of work performed to date. No revenue is recognised until a contract 
has reached an appropriate stage of completion which is normally assessed to be when over 
30% of the total contract work has been completed. When it is probable that the total costs on 
a construction contract will exceed total contract revenue, the expected loss is immediately 
recognised as an expense in the Income Statement.
Lease income – The Group enters into leasing arrangements with third parties following the 
completion of constructed developments until the date of the sale of the development to third 
parties. Rental income from these operating leases is recognised in the Income Statement 
on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating 
and arranging an operating lease are added to the carrying amount of the leased asset and 
recognised in the Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
An analysis of the Group’s revenue is as follows:

Sale of goods includes £437.7m (2016: £369.9m) of revenue generated where the sale has been 
achieved using part-exchange incentives. 
Proceeds received on the disposal of part-exchange properties, which are not included 
in revenue, were £241.3m (2016: £220.1m).
Other income principally comprises the sale of freehold reversions, property management 
income and management fees receivable from joint ventures.

2.2 Segmental analysis
The Group consists of two separate segments for management reporting and control purposes, 
being housebuilding and commercial developments. The segments are considered appropriate 
for reporting under IFRS 8 ‘Operating Segments’ since these segments are regularly reviewed 
internally by the Board without further significant categorisation. The Group presents its primary 
segment information on the basis of these operating segments. As the Group operates in a single 
geographic market, Great Britain, no secondary segmentation is provided.
Adjusted items – Items that are material in size or unusual or infrequent in nature are 
presented as adjusted items in the Income Statement. The Directors are of the opinion that 
the separate presentation of adjusted items provides helpful information about the Group’s 
underlying business performance. Examples of events that, inter alia, may give rise to the 
classification of items as adjusted are the restructuring of existing and newly-acquired 
businesses, refinancing costs, gains or losses on the disposal of businesses or individual 
assets, pension scheme curtailments and asset impairments, including land, work in 
progress, goodwill and investments.

2.3 Profit from operations
Profit from operations includes all of the revenue and costs derived from the Group’s operating 
businesses. Profit from operations excludes finance costs, finance income, the Group’s share 
of profits or losses from joint ventures and associates and tax. 
Lease charges – Operating lease rentals are charged to the Income Statement in equal 
instalments over the life of the lease.
Estimation of future income and costs to complete – In order to determine the profit that the 
Group is able to recognise on its developments in a specific period, the Group has to allocate 
site-wide development costs between units built in the current year and in future years. It also 
has to estimate costs to complete on such developments and make estimates relating to 
future sales price margins on those developments and units. In making these assessments 
there is a degree of inherent uncertainty. The Group has developed internal controls to assess 
and review carrying values and the appropriateness of estimates made.
Profit from operations is stated after charging/(crediting):

2.4 Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit for the year attributable to ordinary 
shareholders of the parent company of £615.8m (2016: £550.3m) by the weighted average number 
of ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding those held by the Employee Benefit Trust 
which are treated as cancelled, which was 1,004.3m (2016: 998.7m) shares.
Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit for the year attributable to ordinary 
shareholders of the parent company of £615.8m (2016: £550.3m) by the weighted average number 
of ordinary shares in issue adjusted to assume conversion of all potentially dilutive share options 
from the start of the year, giving a figure of 1,014.7m (2016: 1,013.0m) shares. 
The earnings per share from continuing operations were as follows:

The proposed final dividend and the special dividend are subject to approval by shareholders 
at the Annual General Meeting. The cost has been calculated based on the issued share capital 
at 30 June 2017 and has not been included as a liability at 30 June 2017.
2.6 Tax
All profits of the Group are subject to UK corporation tax.
The current year tax charge has been provided for at an effective rate of 19.75% (2016: 20.0%) and 
the closing deferred tax assets and liabilities have been provided in these Financial Statements at 
a rate of between 17.0% and 19.0% (2016: between 18.0% and 20.0%) of the temporary differences 
giving rise to these assets and liabilities, dependent upon when they are expected to reverse.
Tax – The tax currently payable is based on the taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs 
from net profit as reported in the Income Statement because it excludes items of income or 
expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are 
never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates 
that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. 
Deferred tax – Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences 
between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the 
corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using 
the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis using 
the tax rates and laws that have then been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance 
sheet date, and is charged or credited to the income statement, except when it relates to 
items charged or credited directly to other comprehensive income or equity, in which case 
the deferred tax is also dealt with in other comprehensive income or equity. 
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred 
tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available 
against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not 
recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition (other 
than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither 
the taxable profit nor the accounting profit. Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable 
temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and interests in joint ventures, except 
where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that 
the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. 
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets are reviewed at each balance sheet date and 
reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be 
available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered. Deferred tax assets and liabilities 
are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set-off current tax assets against current 
tax liabilities and when they relate to taxes levied by the same tax authority and the Group 
intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis. 130       Barratt Developments PLC – Annual Report and Accounts 2017

The deferred tax liability in respect of brands represents the amount of tax that would become 
due if the brand was sold at its book value. There is no intention to sell the brand in the foreseeable 
future and, therefore, it is not anticipated that any of the deferred tax liability in respect of brands 
will reverse in the 12 months following the balance sheet date. The deferred tax asset in respect 
of share schemes represents an estimate of the future tax deduction available on the exercise or 
vesting of awards under those schemes. Whilst it is anticipated that an element of the remaining 
deferred tax assets and liabilities will reverse during the 12 months following the balance sheet 
date, at present it is not possible to accurately quantify the value of all of these reversals.
In addition to the deferred tax liability shown above, the Group has not recognised a deferred 
tax asset of £2.0m (2016: £2.1m) in respect of capital and other losses amounting to £11.5m 
(2016: £11.6m) because these are not considered recoverable in the foreseeable future.

Notes to the Financial Statements Year ended 30 June 2017 continued
3. 1 Inventories
Inventories – Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost of work 
in progress comprises direct materials, direct labour costs and those overheads that have 
been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. 
Land held for development, including land in the course of development, is initially recorded 
at discounted cost. Where, through deferred purchase credit terms, the carrying value differs 
from the amount that will ultimately be paid in settling the liability, this difference is charged 
as a finance cost in the Income Statement over the period of settlement.
Due to the scale of the Group’s developments, the Group has to allocate site-wide development 
costs between units built in the current year and in future years. It also has to estimate costs to 
complete on such developments. In making these assessments, there is a degree of inherent 
uncertainty. The Group has developed internal controls to assess and review carrying values 
and the appropriateness of estimates made.
Carrying value of land and work in progress – The Group’s principal activities are 
housebuilding and commercial development. The majority of the development activity is not 
contracted prior to the development commencing. Accordingly, the Group has in its Balance 
Sheet at 30 June 2017 current assets that are not covered by a forward sale. The Group’s 
internal controls are designed to identify any developments where the balance sheet value 
of land and work in progress is more than the projected lower of cost or net realisable value. 
During the year the Group has conducted six-monthly reviews of the net realisable value of 
specific sites identified as at high risk of impairment, based upon a number of criteria including 
low site profit margins and sites with no forecast completions. Where the estimated net 
realisable value of a site was less than its current carrying value within the Balance Sheet, 
the Group has impaired the land and work in progress value. 
Carrying value of land and work in progress continued – During the year, due to performance 
variations, changes in assumptions and changes to viability on individual sites, there were 
gross impairment charges of £16.8m (2016: £11.0m) and gross impairment reversals of £3.3m 
(2016: £2.4m), resulting in a net impairment charge of £13.5m (2016: £8.6m) included within 
profit from operations.
The key estimates in these reviews are those used to estimate the realisable value of a site, 
which is determined by forecast sales rates, expected sales prices and estimated costs to 
complete. The estimation of future sales prices and costs to complete included zero net 
inflation (2016: zero net inflation for the first three years and then low single digit inflation 
thereafter). If the UK housing market were to change beyond management expectations in 
the future, in particular with regards to the assumptions around sales prices and estimated 
costs to complete, further adjustments to the carrying value of land and work in progress 
may be required. A 5% reduction in forecast average selling prices would result in additional 
impairment of inventories, however this would not be material.
The land held at the balance sheet date that has already been impaired is most sensitive 
to the judgements being applied and the potential for further impairment or reversal. 
Forecasting risk also increases in relation to those sites that are not expected to be realised 
in the short to medium term.

3.1.1 Nature of inventories 
The Directors consider all inventories to be essentially current in nature, although the Group’s 
operational cycle is such that a proportion of inventories will not be realised within 12 months. 
It is not possible to determine with accuracy when specific inventory will be realised as this will 
be subject to a number of variables such as consumer demand and planning permission delays.
3.1.2 Expensed inventories
The value of inventories expensed in the year ended 30 June 2017 and included in cost of sales 
was £3,509.6m (2016: £3,233.7m).

3.2 Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables – Trade and other receivables are financial assets with fixed or 
determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. They are included in current 
assets, except for those with maturities greater than 12 months after the balance sheet date, 
which are classified as non-current assets and are measured at amortised cost less an 
allowance for any uncollectable amounts. The net of these balances are classified as ‘trade 
and other receivables’ in the Balance Sheet. 
Trade and other receivables are classified as ‘loans and receivables’.
Trade and other receivables are assessed for indicators of impairment at each balance sheet 
date and are impaired where there is objective evidence that the recovery of the receivable is 
in doubt. 
Objective evidence of impairment could include significant financial difficulty of the customer, 
default on payment terms or the customer going into liquidation.
The carrying amount of trade and other receivables is reduced through the use of an allowance 
account. When a trade or other receivable is considered uncollectable, it is provided against 
the allowance account. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited 
against the allowance account. Changes in the carrying amount of the allowance account are 
recognised in the Income Statement.

The allowance for doubtful receivables consists of individually impaired trade receivables that 
are in default. The impairment recognised in cost of sales represents the difference between 
the carrying amount of these trade receivables and the present value of any expected recoveries. 
The Group does not hold any collateral over these balances.
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade receivables approximates to their 
fair value.

3.3 Trade and other payables
Trade and other payables – Trade and other payables on normal terms are not interest bearing 
and are stated at amortised cost.
Trade and other payables on extended terms, particularly in respect of land, are recorded 
at their fair value at the date of acquisition of the asset to which they relate by discounting at 
prevailing market interest rates at the date of recognition. The discount to nominal value, which 
will be paid in settling the deferred purchase terms liability, is amortised over the period of the 
credit term and charged to finance costs using the ‘effective interest rate’ method.

comprise payments received on account and payments relating to the acquisition of land in 
a non-wholly controlled subsidiary. Other payables classified as non-current liabilities at  
30 June 2017 principally comprise payments and deposits received in advance.
The Group has £382.7m (2016: £351.3m) of payables secured by legal charges on certain assets 
and £61.9m (2016: £88.8m) supported by promissory notes. Other non-current payables are 
unsecured and non-interest bearing. 
Further disclosures relating to financial liabilities are set out in note 5.3.
3.4 Contract accounting
Contract accounting – Contracts are only treated as construction contracts when they 
have been specifically negotiated for the construction of a development or property. 
Amounts recoverable on construction contracts are included in trade receivables and stated 
at cost plus attributable profit less any foreseeable losses. Payments received on account for 
construction contracts are deducted from amounts recoverable on construction contracts. 
Payments received in excess of amounts recoverable on construction contracts are included 
in trade payables.

At 30 June 2017, retentions held by customers for contract work on contracts in progress at the 
balance sheet date amounted to £2.1m (2016: £3.4m), of which £1.3m (2016: £1.7m) is due for 
settlement after 12 months. Advances received from customers for contract work on contracts 
in progress at the balance sheet date amounted to £nil (2016: £1.9m), of which £nil (2016: £1.9m) 
relates to work, which is not expected to be performed in the next 12 months. Annual Report and Accounts 2017 – Barratt Developments PLC     135
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Other Information
3.5 Available for sale financial assets
Available for sale financial assets principally comprise interest free loans that were granted 
as part of sales transactions and for which the cash flows receivable are based on the value 
of the property at redemption. These loans are secured by way of a second legal charge on 
the respective property (after the first mortgage charge). 
Available for sale financial assets – Available for sale financial assets are held at fair value 
calculated as the present value of expected future cash flows, taking into account the estimated 
market value of the property at the estimated time of repayment. Gains and losses arising from 
changes in fair value are recognised in equity within other comprehensive income. Gains and 
losses arising from impairment losses, changes in future cash flows and interest calculated 
using the ‘effective interest rate’ method are recognised directly in the Income Statement.
For financial assets classified as available for sale, a significant or prolonged decline in 
the value of the property underpinning the value of the loan or increased risk of default are 
considered to be objective evidence of impairment. Increases itn the fair value of available 
for sale assets previously subject to impairment, which can be objectively related to an event 
occurring after recognition of the impairment loss, are recognised in the Income Statement 
to the extent that they reverse the impairment loss.

Consolidation – The financial statements of subsidiary undertakings are consolidated from 
the date when control passes to the Group using the purchase method of accounting and up 
to the date control ceases. All of the subsidiaries’ identifiable assets and liabilities, including 
contingent liabilities, existing at the date of acquisition are recorded at their fair values. 
All changes to those assets and liabilities and the resulting gains and losses that arise after 
the Group has gained control of the subsidiary are included in the post-acquisition Income 
Statement. All intra-Group transactions and intercompany profits or losses are eliminated 
on consolidation.
A full list of the subsidiary undertakings of the Group and Company is included in note 7.5.

4.1.3 Company investments in subsidiary undertakings
Company investments – The Company’s interests in subsidiary undertakings are accounted 
for at cost less any provision for impairment.
Where share-based payments are granted to the employees of subsidiary undertakings by 
the Company, they are treated as a capital contribution to the subsidiary and the Company’s 
investment in the subsidiary is increased accordingly.

4.2.1 Goodwill 
Goodwill – Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the fair value of the 
consideration over the fair value of the separately identifiable net assets and liabilities acquired. 
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiary undertakings and businesses is capitalised 
as an asset but reviewed for impairment at least annually (see note 4.2.3).
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Group’s cash-
generating units expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination at acquisition 
being housebuilding and commercial developments. Cash-generating units to which goodwill 
has been allocated are tested for impairment at least annually. If the recoverable amount of 
the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is 
allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then 
to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in 
the unit. Any impairment loss is recognised immediately in the Income Statement and is not 
subsequently reversed.

4.2 Goodwill and other intangible assets continued
4.2.2 Other intangible assets – Brands
Brands – The Group has capitalised, as intangible assets, brands that have been acquired. 
Acquired brand values are calculated using discounted cash flows. Where a brand is 
considered to have a finite life, it is amortised over its useful life on a straight-line basis. 
Where a brand is capitalised with an indefinite life, it is not amortised. The factors that 
contribute to the durability of brands capitalised are that there are no material legal, 
regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic or other factors that limit the useful life 
of these intangible assets. Internally generated brands are not capitalised.
The Group carries out an annual impairment review of indefinite life brands as part of the 
review of the carrying value of goodwill, by performing a value-in-use calculation, using a 
discount factor based upon the Group’s pre-tax weighted average cost of capital (note 4.2.3).

The Group does not amortise the housebuilding brand acquired with Wilson Bowden, being 
David Wilson Homes, valued at £100.0m, as the Directors consider that this brand has an 
indefinite useful economic life due to the fact that the Group intends to hold and support the 
brand for an indefinite period and there are no factors that would prevent it from doing so.
The brand of Wilson Bowden Developments (valued at £7.0m prior to amortisation) was being 
amortised over ten years as it is a business-to-business brand operating in niche markets. 
Following an impairment review at 30 June 2008, the Wilson Bowden Developments brand 
was fully impaired.
4.2.3 Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets
The Group conducts an annual impairment review of goodwill and intangibles together for the 
housebuilding segment. 
Impairment of goodwill and brands – The impairment review for the goodwill of the 
housebuilding business and the Group’s indefinite life brand, David Wilson Homes, requires 
an estimation of the value-in-use of the housebuilding segment. The value-in-use calculation 
requires an estimate of the future cash flows expected from the housebuilding business, 
including the anticipated growth rate of revenue and costs, and requires the determination of 
a suitable discount rate to calculate the present value of the cash flows. The discount rate used 
is based on the average capital structure of the Group, current market assessments of the time 
value of money and risks appropriate to the Group’s housebuilding business. Changes in these 
may impact upon the Group’s discount rate in future periods. The sensitivity of the valuation of 
goodwill and brands to changes in expectations and discount rates is set out in this note.
An impairment review was performed at 30 June 2017 and compared the value-in-use  
of the housebuilding segment with the carrying value of its tangible and intangible assets 
and allocated goodwill.
The value-in-use was determined by discounting the expected future cash flows of the 
housebuilding segment. The first two years of cash flows were determined using the Group’s 
approved detailed site-by-site business plan. The cash flows for the third to the fifth years  
were determined using Group level internal forecasted cash flows based upon expected 
volumes, selling prices and margins, taking into account available land purchases and work  
in progress levels. The cash flows for year six onwards were extrapolated in perpetuity using  
an estimated growth rate of 2.5%, which was based upon the historical long term growth rate  
of the UK economy. 140       Barratt Developments PLC – Annual Report and Accounts 2017

4.2 Goodwill and other intangible assets continued
4.2.3 Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets continued
The key assumptions for the value-in-use calculations were:
 > Discount rate: this is a pre-tax rate reflecting current market assessments of the time value 
of money and risks appropriate to the Group’s housebuilding business. Accordingly, the rate of 
14.5% (2016: 14.2%) is considered by the Directors to be the appropriate pre-tax risk adjusted 
discount rate, being the Group’s estimated long term pre-tax weighted average cost of capital. 
The rate used in the 30 June 2017 impairment review is calculated using the average capital 
structure of the Group during the financial year, consistent with the prior year, due to the 
cyclicality of the Group’s borrowing requirements.
 > Expected changes in selling prices for completed houses and the related impact upon 
operating margin: these are determined on a site-by-site basis for the first two years 
dependent upon local market conditions and product type. For years three to five, these 
have been estimated at a Group level based upon past experience and expectations of 
future changes in the market, taking into account external market forecasts.
 > Sales volumes: these are determined on a site-by-site basis for the first two years dependent 
upon local market conditions, land availability and planning permissions. For years three to 
five, these have been estimated at a Group level based upon past experience and expectations 
of future changes in the market, taking into account external market forecasts.
 > Expected changes in site costs to complete: these are determined on a site-by-site basis for the 
first two years dependent upon the expected costs of completing all aspects of each individual 
development. For years three to five, these have been estimated at a Group level based upon 
past experience and expectations of future changes in the market, taking into account external 
market forecasts.
The conclusion of this impairment review was that given the current position of the 
housebuilding segment and the expectations as to its future performance based upon 
current forecasts for sales volumes and expected changes in both selling prices and costs 
to complete, the housebuilding segment’s goodwill and intangible assets were not impaired. 
The recoverable value of goodwill and intangible assets exceeded its carrying value by £1,720.8m 
(2016: £1,424.6m). 
If the UK housing market and expectations regarding its future were to deteriorate with either 
operating margins reduced each year by 4.8% (2016: 4.2%) per annum versus management 
expectations or the appropriate discount rate were to increase by 5.4% (2016: 4.5%) and all other 
variables were held constant, then the recoverable value of goodwill and intangible assets would 
equal its carrying value.
4.3 Investments in jointly controlled entities and associated entities
A jointly controlled entity (joint venture) is an entity, including an unincorporated entity such 
as a partnership, in which the Group holds an interest with one or more other parties where 
a contractual arrangement has established joint control over the entity. An associated entity 
is an entity, including an unincorporated entity such as a partnership, in which the Group holds 
a significant influence and that is neither a subsidiary nor an interest in a joint venture.
Jointly controlled entities – Joint ventures and associated entities are accounted for using 
the equity method of accounting.

Judgements applied in determining the classification of joint arrangements 
1
  The Group holds one joint venture investment (Barratt Wates (Horley) Limited) not in equal share, and one (Ravenscraig Limited) with more than one other party. However, in both cases,  
the Group has equal voting rights and control over the activities of the companies with the other parties. In addition, the Group and the other parties to the agreements only have rights  
to the net assets of these companies through the terms of the contractual arrangements. These entities are therefore classified as joint ventures.
2
  The Group’s interests in a number of the entities classified as joint ventures are held indirectly. 
 > Barratt Wates (East Grinstead) No. 2 Limited is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Group’s joint venture, Barratt Wates (East Grinstead) Limited, and is therefore classified as a joint venture 
of the Group. 
 > Aldgate Land One Limited and Aldgate Land Two Limited are wholly owned subsidiaries of the Group’s joint venture, Aldgate Place (GP) Limited, and are therefore classified as joint ventures 
of the Group. 
 > BDWZest Developments LLP, Alie Street LLP, Queensland Road LLP, Fulham Wharf LLP, and Nine Elms LLP, form a group of limited liability partnerships jointly owned (directly or indirectly) 
by BDWZest LLP and ZestBDW LLP, both of which are joint ventures of the Group. Nine Elms One Limited and Nine Elms Two Limited are wholly owned subsidiaries of Nine Elms LLP and 
Fulham Wharf One Limited and Fulham Wharf Two Limited are wholly owned subsidiaries of, Fulham Wharf LLP. All of these entities are therefore classified as joint ventures of the Group.

During the year, the Group and Company entered into a number of transactions with their joint 
ventures in respect of funding and development management services (with charges made 
based on the utilisation of these services) in addition to the provision of construction services. 
Further details on these transactions are provided in note 7.3. The Group and Company have 
a number of contingent liabilities relating to their joint ventures. Further details on these are 
provided in note 7.2.
The Group has made loans of £174.9m (2016: £84.9m) to its joint ventures, which are included 
within Group investments accounted for using the equity method. Included within the Group’s 
share of net assets of joint ventures is a proportion of loans to the joint ventures calculated 
using the Group’s ownership share of £172.5m (2016: £80.7m). 
The transfer of funds from the Group’s joint ventures to the Group is determined by the terms 
of the joint venture agreements, which specify how available funds should be applied in repaying 
loans and capital, and distributing profits to the partners. The joint venture agreement entered 
into in respect of Rose Shared Equity LLP provides for the return of the capital invested by our 
joint venture partner (the ‘preferred capital’) before any funds can be transferred to the Group. 
As at 30 June 2016 all of the preferred capital had been repaid. BDWZest Developments LLP has

5.1.2 Borrowings and facilities 
Loans and borrowings – Interest bearing loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds 
received plus accrued interest applied to the account less any repayments made, net of direct 
issue costs.
Where bank agreements include a legal right of offset for in hand and overdraft balances, 
and the Group intends to settle the net outstanding position, the offset arrangements are 
applied to record the net position in the Balance Sheet.

5.3 Financial instruments
Recognition – Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Balance Sheet 
when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
The Group derecognises a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash flows 
from the asset expire or it transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and 
rewards of ownership of the asset to another entity.
The Group derecognises a financial liability only when the Group’s obligations are discharged, 
cancelled or they expire. 
Classification and measurement – Non-derivative financial assets are classified as either 
‘available for sale financial assets’ or ‘loans and receivables’. The classification depends on the 
nature and purpose of the financial assets and is determined at the time of initial recognition. 
All non-derivative financial liabilities are classified as ‘other financial liabilities’ and are initially 
measured at fair value, net of transaction costs. Other financial liabilities consist of bank 
borrowings and trade and other payables.
Financial liabilities are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional 
right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date. 
The fair value of available for sale assets is determined as described in note 3.5. The fair values 
of other non-derivative financial assets and liabilities are determined based on discounted cash 
flow analysis using current market rates for similar instruments. Other financial liabilities are 
subsequently measured at amortised cost using the ‘effective interest rate’ method.
All of the Group’s interest rate and cross currency swaps are designated as cash flow 
hedges. Derivative financial instruments are measured at the present value of future cash 
flows estimated and discounted based on the applicable yield curves derived from quoted 
interest rates. Annual Report and Accounts 2017 – Barratt Developments PLC     149

5.3.3 Financial assets and liabilities measured subsequent to initial recognition  
at fair value
The following tables provide an analysis of financial assets and financial liabilities that are 
measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, grouped into Levels 1 to 3 based  
on the degree to which the fair value is observable:
 > Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active 
markets for identical liabilities;
 > Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices 
included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) 
or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and 
 > Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that 
include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data 
(unobservable inputs).
There have been no transfers of liabilities between levels of the fair value hierarchy and  
no non-recurring fair value measurements. 150       Barratt Developments PLC – Annual Report and Accounts 2017

5.4 Derivative financial instruments – swaps
The Group has entered into derivative financial instruments in the form of interest rate swaps 
and cross currency swaps to manage the interest rate and foreign exchange rate risk arising 
from the Group’s operations and sources of finance. The use of financial derivatives is governed 
by the Group’s policies approved by the Board of Directors as detailed in note 5.5. Neither the 
Group nor the Company enters into any derivatives for speculative purposes.
Derivative financial instruments – Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date a 
derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured to their fair value at each 
balance sheet date. The resulting gain or loss is recognised in the profit or loss immediately 
unless the derivative is designated and effective as a hedging instrument, in which event the 
timing of the recognition in profit or loss depends on the nature of the hedge relationship. 
The interest rate and cross currency swap arrangements are designated as hedging 
instruments, being either hedges of a change in future cash flows as a result of interest 
rate movements or hedges of a change in future cash flows as a result of foreign currency 
exchange rate movements. At the inception of the hedge relationship, the Group documents 
the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item, along with its risk 
management objectives and its strategy for undertaking various hedged transactions. 
In addition, at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, the Group documents 
whether the hedging instrument is highly effective in offsetting the changes in cash flows  
of the hedged items. Annual Report and Accounts 2017 – Barratt Developments PLC     151
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Other Information
5.4 Derivative financial instruments – swaps continued
Derivative financial instruments continued – The fair value of hedging derivatives is 
classified as a non-current asset or a non-current liability if the remaining maturity of the 
hedge relationship is more than 12 months and as a current asset or a current liability if 
the remaining maturity of the hedge relationship is less than 12 months.
Hedge accounting – The Group has adopted hedge accounting for its swaps. If it ceases to be 
highly probable that there is sufficient forecast debt to match with the period of the interest rate 
swaps or if the cross currency hedges cease to be highly effective, any changes in fair value of 
the swaps would be recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement, rather than equity.
The Group includes foreign exchange swaps within net debt. These swaps were entered into 
to hedge the foreign exchange exposure upon the Group’s US Dollar denominated private 
placement notes. The Group’s foreign exchange swaps have both an interest rate and an 
exchange rate element and only the exchange rate element on the notional amount of the 
swap is included within the net cash note.

5.4.1 Interest rate swaps 
The Group and Company enter into derivative transactions in the form of swap arrangements 
to manage the cash flow risks, related to interest rates, arising from the Group’s and Company’s 
sources of finance. 
In previous years the Group and Company have entered into swap arrangements to swap £25.0m 
(2016: £137.0m) of floating rate debt into fixed rate Sterling debt in accordance with the Group and 
Company Treasury policy outlined in note 5.5. After taking into account swap arrangements, the 
fixed interest rates applicable to the debt were as follows:

*  The £25.0m 2022 interest rate swap arrangement contains a clause allowing the Group and the Company 
or counterparty to cancel the swap on 22 August 2017 at fair value. 
The Group has concluded that future floating rate borrowing is no longer expected to be highly 
probable. As a result, the Group intends to discontinue prospectively hedge accounting for the 
interest rate swap. As the transaction is no longer highly probable the loss previously recognised 
on the interest rate swap of £5.8m has been reclassified from equity to the Income Statement 
during the year ended 30 June 2017. This is included in the Statement of Consolidated Income 
within the £10.2m reclassified to the Income Statement in the year.
In addition, during the year ended 30 June 2017 hedging ineffectiveness of £0.7m (2016: £0.7m 
charge) was credited to the Consolidated Income Statement.
Further disclosures relating to financial instruments are set out in note 5.3.
5.4.2 Foreign exchange swaps 
The Group and Company enter into derivative transactions in the form of swap arrangements 
to manage the cash flow risks related to foreign exchange arising from the Group’s sources 
of finance denominated in US Dollars. 
As at 30 June 2017, the Group and Company had outstanding fixed rate US Dollar loan notes  
of US$80.0m (2016: US$80.0m). 
The Group and Company have entered into swap arrangements to swap all of this debt into fixed 
rate Sterling debt in accordance with the Group and Company Treasury policy outlined in note 
5.5. After taking into account swap arrangements, the fixed interest rates applicable to the debt 
were as follows:

5.4.3 Hedge accounting and hedging reserve
Hedge accounting – To the extent that the Group’s cash flow hedges are effective, gains 
and losses on the fair value of the interest rate and cross currency swap arrangements are 
deferred in equity in the hedging reserve until realised. On realisation, such gains and losses 
are recognised within finance charges in the Income Statement. 
To the extent that any hedge is ineffective, gains and losses on the fair value of these swap 
arrangements are recognised immediately in finance charges in the Income Statement.
Amounts deferred in equity are recycled in profit or loss in the periods when the hedged item 
is recognised in profit or loss. 
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the Group revokes the hedging relationship, the 
hedging instrument expires, is sold or terminated or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. 
At that time, any cumulative gain or loss deferred in equity remains in equity and is recognised 
when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in profit or loss. When a forecast 
transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was deferred 
in equity is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
The hedging reserve represents the cumulative effective portion of deferred fair value 
gains or losses on derivative financial instruments that have been designated as cash flow 
hedges by the Group and Company, where the hedged cash flows are still expected to occur. 
As discussed in note 5.4.1 the cash flows hedged by the interest rate swap are no longer 
expected to occur and the resulting ineffectiveness has been transferred to the Income 
Statement in the year.

5.5 Financial risk management
The Group’s approach to risk management and the principal operational risks of the business 
are detailed on pages 40 to 44. The Group’s financial assets, financial liabilities and derivative 
financial instruments are detailed in notes 5.3 and 5.4.
The Group’s operations and financing arrangements expose it to a variety of financial risks of 
which the most material are: credit risk, foreign exchange risk, liquidity risk, interest rates 
and the availability of funding at reasonable margins. There is a regular, detailed system for 
the reporting and forecasting of cash flows from the operations to Group management to 
ensure that liquidity risks are promptly identified and appropriate mitigating actions taken 
by the Treasury department. These forecasts are further stress-tested at a Group level on 
a regular basis to ensure that adequate headroom within facilities and banking covenants is 
maintained. In addition, the Group has in place a risk management programme that seeks to 
limit the adverse effects of the other risks on its financial performance, in particular by using 
financial instruments, including debt and derivatives, to hedge interest rates and currency rates. 
The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. 
The Board approves treasury policies and certain day-to-day treasury activities have been 
delegated to a centralised Treasury Operating Committee, which in turn regularly reports to the 
Board. The Treasury department implements guidelines that are established by the Board and 
the Treasury Operating Committee.
5.5.1 Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will be unable to meet its liabilities as they fall due. 
The Group actively maintains a mixture of long term and medium term committed facilities that 
are designed to ensure that the Group has sufficient available funds for operations. The Group’s 
borrowings are typically cyclical throughout the financial year and peak in April and May; and 
October and November of each year, due to seasonal trends in income. Accordingly, the Group 
maintains sufficient facility headroom to cover these requirements. On a normal operating 
basis, the Group has a policy of maintaining a minimum headroom of £150.0m. The Group 
identifies and takes appropriate actions based upon its regular, detailed system for the reporting 
and forecasting of cash flows from its operations. The Group’s drawn debt, excluding fees, 
represented 11.3% (2016: 20.0%) of available committed facilities at 30 June 2017. In addition, 
the Group had £784.4m (2016: £758.0m) of cash and cash equivalents. 
The Group was in compliance with its financial covenants at 30 June 2017. At the date of 
approval of the Financial Statements, the Group’s internal forecasts indicate that it will remain 
in compliance with these covenants for the foreseeable future, being at least 12 months from 
the date of signing these Financial Statements.
One of the Group’s objectives is to minimise refinancing risk. The Group therefore has a policy 
that the average maturity of its committed bank facilities and private placement notes is at least 
two years on average with a target of three years. At 30 June 2017, the average maturity of the 
Group’s facilities was 4.1 years (2016: 3.0 years). Annual Report and Accounts 2017 – Barratt Developments PLC     153

5.5 Financial risk management continued
5.5.2 Market risk (price risk)
5.5.2.1 Interest rate risk
The Group has both interest bearing assets and interest bearing liabilities. Floating rate 
borrowings expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk and fixed rate borrowings expose 
the Group to fair value interest rate risk.
The Group has a conservative treasury risk management strategy and the Group’s interest rates 
are fixed using both derivatives and fixed rate debt instruments. The Group’s policy target is for 
0-40% of average borrowings over the three-year plan period to be at fixed rates of interest. 
Due to the seasonality of the Group’s funding requirements, 111.7% (2016: 108.6%) of the Group’s 
gross borrowings were fixed as at 30 June 2017 and the average over the three-year plan period 
has increased to 60.1% (2016: 42.4%) due to the issuance of a £200m fixed rate sterling USPP in 
August 2017 (see note 7.4).

Floating interest rates on Sterling borrowings are linked to the UK bank rate, LIBOR and money 
market rates. The floating rates are fixed in advance for periods generally ranging from one 
to six months. Short term flexibility is achieved through the use of overdraft, committed and 
uncommitted bank facilities. The weighted average interest rate for floating rate borrowings 
in 2017 was 3.7% (2016: 3.6%).
US Dollar denominated private placement notes of £61.6m (2016: £60.0m) were arranged at 
fixed interest rates and exposed the Group to fair value interest rate risk. The weighted average 
interest rate for fixed rate US Dollar denominated private placement notes, after the effect of 
foreign exchange rate swaps, for 2017 was 8.2% (2016: 8.2%) with, at 30 June 2017, a weighted 
average period of 0.2 years (2016: 1.2 years) for which the rate is fixed.
Sensitivity analysis:
In the year ended 30 June 2017, if UK interest rates had been 0.5% higher/lower (considered 
to be a reasonably possible change) and all other variables were held constant, the Group’s 
pre-tax profit would increase/decrease by £0.9m (2016: £0.1m), the Group’s post-tax profit 
would increase/decrease by £0.7m (2016: £nil) and the Group’s equity would increase/decrease 
by £0.7m (2016: £nil).
5.5.2.2 Foreign exchange rate risk
As at 30 June 2017, the Group had fixed rate US Dollar denominated private placement notes 
of US$80.0m (2016: US$80.0m). In order to mitigate risks associated with the movement in the 
foreign exchange rate the Group has entered into foreign exchange swap arrangements all 
of which are designated as cash flow hedges, which fully hedge the principal of its US Dollar 
denominated debt and the US Dollar interest payments.
Details of the Group’s foreign exchange swaps are provided in note 5.4.2.
5.5.3 Credit risk
In the majority of cases, the Group receives cash upon legal completion for private sales 
and receives advance stage payments from registered providers for affordable housing. 
Included within trade and other receivables is £64.1m (2016: £48.8m) due from the Homes and 
Communities Agency in respect of the Help to Buy scheme. Since this receivable is due from 
a UK Government agency, the Group considers that this receivable has an insignificant risk 
of default. Other than this, neither the Group nor the Company have a significant concentration 
of credit risk, as their exposure is spread over a large number of counterparties and customers. Annual Report and Accounts 2017 – Barratt Developments PLC     155
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Other Information
5.5 Financial risk management continued
5.5.3 Credit risk continued
The Group manages credit risk in the following ways:
 > The Group has a credit policy that is limited to financial institutions with high credit ratings, 
as set by international credit rating agencies, and has a policy determining the maximum 
permissible exposure to any single counterparty. 
 > The Group only contracts derivative financial instruments with counterparties with which 
the Group has an ISDA Master Agreement in place. These agreements permit net settlement, 
thereby reducing the Group’s credit exposure to individual counterparties.
The maximum exposure to any counterparty at 30 June 2017 was £140.0m (2016: £144.4m) of 
cash on deposit with a financial institution. The carrying amount of financial assets recorded 
in the Financial Statements, net of any allowance for losses, represents the Group’s maximum 
exposure to credit risk. 
As at 30 June 2017, the Company was exposed to £75.8m (2016: £75.9m) of credit risk in relation 
to intercompany loans, as well as financial guarantees, performance bonds and the bank 
borrowings of subsidiary undertakings. Further details are provided in notes 7.2 and 7.3.
5.5.4 Capital risk management (cash flow risk)
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard its ability to continue as a going 
concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and meet its liabilities as they fall due whilst 
maintaining an appropriate capital structure.
The Group manages its share capital as equity, as set out in the Statement of Changes in 
Shareholders’ Equity; and its bank borrowings (being overdrafts, loan notes and bank loans) 
and its private placement notes as other financial liabilities, as set out in note 5.3.2. 
The Group is subject to the prevailing conditions of the UK economy and the quantum of 
the Group’s earnings are dependent upon the level of UK house prices. UK house prices are 
determined by the UK economy and economic conditions including employment levels, interest 
rates, consumer confidence, mortgage availability and competitor pricing. The Group’s approach 
to the management of the principal operational risks of the business are detailed on pages 40 
to 44.
In addition, the other methods by which the Group can manage its short term and long term 
capital structure include: adjusting the level of dividends and special cash payments paid to 
shareholders (assuming the Company is paying a dividend or a special cash payment); issuing 
new share capital; arranging debt to meet liability payments; and selling assets to reduce debt.

Defined benefit scheme – The cost of providing benefits is determined using the Projected 
Unit Credit Method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at each balance sheet date. 
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur. They are 
recognised outside profit or loss and presented in the Statements of Comprehensive Income. 
Net interest is calculated by applying a discount rate to the net defined benefit liability or asset.
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the Balance Sheet represents the present value 
of the defined benefit obligation as reduced by the fair value of the scheme assets. 
Defined benefit pension scheme – The Directors engage a qualified independent actuary 
to calculate the Group’s asset in respect of its defined benefit pension scheme. In calculating 
this asset, it is necessary for actuarial assumptions to be made, which include estimations 
of discount rates, salary and pension increases, price inflation, the long term rate of return 
upon scheme assets and mortality. As actual rates of increase and mortality may differ 
from those assumed, the pension liability/asset may differ from that included in these 
Financial Statements. 
The sensitivities regarding the principal assumptions used to measure the Scheme liabilities 
are set out in note 6.2.2. 158       Barratt Developments PLC – Annual Report and Accounts 2017

6.2.1 Defined contribution schemes
The Group operates defined contribution retirement benefit schemes for all qualifying 
employees, under which it pays contributions to an independently administered fund. 
Contributions are based upon a fixed percentage of the employee’s pay and once these 
have been paid, the Group has no further obligations under these schemes.

At the balance sheet date, there were outstanding contributions of £0.9m (2016: £0.6m), which 
were paid on or before the due date.
6.2.2 Defined benefit scheme 
The Group operates a funded defined benefit pension scheme in Great Britain, the Barratt Group 
Pension & Life Assurance Scheme (the ‘Scheme’), which, with effect from 30 June 2009, ceased 
to offer future accrual of defined benefit pensions. Alternative defined contribution pension 
arrangements are in place for current employees.
The Scheme provides benefits to members based on their length of service and their salary 
in the final years leading up to retirement or date of ceasing active accrual if earlier. The Group 
operates the Scheme under the UK regulatory framework, with a legally separate fund that is 
Trustee administered. The Trustees are responsible for ensuring that the Scheme is sufficiently 
funded to meet current and future benefit payments and for the investment policy with regard 
to scheme assets. 
The Trustees must agree a funding plan with the Group such that any funding shortfall is 
expected to be met by additional contributions and investment performance. In order to assess 
the level of contributions, triennial valuations are carried out using prudent assumptions. 
The most recent full actuarial valuation of the Scheme was carried out at 30 November 2016. 
The results of this valuation have been updated to 30 June 2017 by a qualified independent 
actuary. The Group agreed with the Trustees of the Scheme to make contributions to the Scheme 
of £14.5m per annum from 1 July 2017 until 31 March 2020 (with the increase backdated to 1 April 
2017 paid in July 2017) to address the Scheme’s actuarial deficit. The Group also continues 
to meet the Scheme’s administration expenses and Pension Protection Fund levy.
At the balance sheet date, there were outstanding contributions of £2.0m (2016: £0.8m).
The Scheme exposes the Group to a number of risks, the most significant being:
Risk Description
Volatile asset returns The defined benefit obligation (‘DBO’) is calculated using a discount rate set with reference to high 
quality corporate bond yields. If assets underperform this discount rate, this will create a plan 
deficit. The Scheme holds a proportion of its assets in equities and other growth assets which 
are expected to outperform corporate bonds in the long term. However, returns are likely to be 
volatile in the short term, potentially resulting in short term cash requirements and an increase 
in the defined benefit obligation recorded on the Balance Sheet. The allocation to growth assets 
is monitored to ensure it remains appropriate given the Scheme’s long term objectives.
Changes in bond yields A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase the funding and accounting liabilities, although 
this will be partially offset by an increase in the value of the Scheme’s investments in corporate 
and government bonds. 
Inflation risk A significant proportion of the DBO is indexed in line with price inflation, with higher inflation 
leading to higher liabilities.
Life expectancy The majority of the Scheme’s obligations are to provide a pension for the life of each of the 
members, so increases in life expectancy will result in an increase in the liabilities. Annual Report and Accounts 2017 – Barratt Developments PLC     159
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Other Information
6.2 Retirement benefit obligations continued
6.2.2 Defined benefit scheme continued
For the purposes of calculating the accounting costs and obligations of the Scheme, the assets 
of the defined benefit scheme have been calculated at fair (bid) value. The liabilities of the 
Scheme have been calculated at each balance sheet date using the following assumptions:
Principal actuarial assumptions 2017 2016
Weighted average assumptions to determine benefit obligations
Discount rate 2.60% 2.90%
Rate of price inflation 3.21% 2.80%
Weighted average assumptions to determine net cost
Discount rate 2.90% 3.80%
Rate of price inflation 2.80% 3.30%
Members are assumed to exchange 19% of their pension for cash on retirement. 
The assumptions have been chosen by the Group following advice from Mercer Limited, 
the Group’s actuarial advisers.
The following table illustrates the life expectancy for an average member on reaching age 65, 
according to the mortality assumptions used to calculate the Scheme liabilities:
Assumptions Male Female 
Retired member born in 1952 (life expectancy at age 65) 23.3 years 25.2 years
Non-retired member born in 1972 (life expectancy at age 65) 24.8 years 26.7 years
The base mortality assumptions are based upon the S2PA (2016: S1NA) mortality tables with an 
adjustment to allow for the Scheme members being treated as if they are 1.5 years younger than 
the population of the S2PA mortality tables. Allowance for future increases in life expectancy is 
made in line with the CMI 2016 projections with a long term trend of 1.25% per annum (2016: CMI 
2015 projection with a long term trend of 1.25% per annum).

The Group has obtained legal advice on the rights to the Group’s defined benefit pension 
scheme’s assets after the death of the last member. Based on this advice, the Group has 
concluded that it is appropriate to recognise an asset related to this scheme.
6.3 Share-based payments
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees. 
Share-based payments – In accordance with the transitional provisions, IFRS 2 ‘Share-based 
Payments’ has been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that had 
not vested at 1 January 2005.
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at the fair value of the equity instrument 
at the date of grant. Fair value is measured either using Black-Scholes, Present-Economic 
Value or Monte Carlo models depending on the characteristics of the scheme. The fair value 
is expensed in the Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on 
the Group’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest where non-market vesting conditions 
apply. Non-vesting conditions are taken into account in the estimate of the fair value of the 
equity instruments.

6.3.3 Further information relating to the share-based payment schemes
Long Term Performance Plan and the Executive Share Option Scheme 
The grant of awards under the LTPP and options under the ESOS are at the discretion of the 
Remuneration Committee taking into account individual performance and overall performance 
of the Group. Vesting under these schemes is dependent upon performance conditions based 
on total shareholder return, earnings per share and, for recent LTPP awards, return on capital 
employed. Further details can be found in the Remuneration report on pages 92 to 105.
Deferred Bonus Plan  
For any bonus deferred prior to November 2015, the Remuneration Committee utilised the rules 
of the Group’s Co-Investment Plan (‘CIP’) for the purposes of the DBP. From FY16, deferred 
shares are held in accordance with the DBP as approved by the shareholders at the 2015 
AGM. The DBP is currently utilised to hold shares awarded in respect of any bonus earned in 
excess of 100% of base salary. Pending the adoption of the new remuneration policy to be put 
to shareholders at the 2017 AGM, the Remuneration Committee has the discretion to award 
matching shares against the deferred shares; however, no matching shares have been awarded 
to date. Matching share awards will no longer be available following approval of the new 
remuneration policy. Further details can be found on page 83.
Savings-Related Share Option Scheme 
Under the Sharesave, participants are required to make monthly contributions to a HM Revenue 
and Customs (‘HMRC’) approved savings contract with a bank or building society for a period of 
three or five years. On entering into the savings contract, participants are granted an option to 
acquire ordinary shares in the Company at an exercise price determined under the rules of the 
Sharesave. The Sharesave is open to all eligible employees as determined by the Board and is 
not subject to the satisfaction of any performance conditions.
Senior Management Share Option Plan 
The Board approved the grant of share options to employees under the SMSOP, which are 
normally exercisable between three and ten years from the date of grant, provided the 
employee remains employed by the Group. The 2009/10 SMSOP vested on 10 December 2012. 
Individuals who participate in the SMSOP are not eligible to participate in the LTPP or ESOS; 
therefore Executive Directors do not participate in the SMSOP. There is currently no intention 
to make any further grants under the SMSOP. 
Senior Management Incentive Scheme 
Awards under the SMIS are at the discretion of the Chief Executive (or in his absence, the 
Chairman of the Board). Any awards under the SMIS must be held for a minimum of three years 
from the date of grant. Executive Directors and those individuals directly below this level are not 
eligible to participate in the SMIS. Any award granted under the SMIS is subject to performance 
conditions as set for the LTPP, excluding the total shareholder return condition, granted in the 
same financial year. 
CFO Scheme
The Company granted to Neil Cooper awards on joining the Company which were designed 
in quantum to compensate for awards which were forfeited by him on leaving his previous 
employment. They were structured to approximately mirror the vesting timescales and 
performance conditions of the Company’s LTPP awards made in 2013 and 2014, so his incentives 
were aligned with those of other Executives. Further details of how Neil Cooper’s awards were 
treated following his resignation from the Group can be found in the Remuneration report on 
pages 92 to 105.

7.2 Contingent liabilities
7.2.1 Contingent liabilities related to subsidiaries
The Company has guaranteed certain bank borrowings of its subsidiary undertakings.
Certain subsidiary undertakings have commitments for the purchase of trading stock entered 
into in the normal course of business.
In the normal course of business, the Group has given counter-indemnities in respect of 
performance bonds and financial guarantees. Management estimate that the bonds and 
guarantees amount to £464.1m (2016: £482.0m), and confirm that at the date of these Financial 
Statements the possibility of cash outflow is considered minimal and no provision is required.
As previously disclosed in the Group’s financial statements following correspondence with an 
industry wide final salary pension scheme, there is a risk of an obligation arising in respect 
of pension scheme funding pursuant to Section 75 of the Pensions Act 1995 for employees of 
a subsidiary who left the Group following disposal of its business and assets. The Directors 
consider that whilst it is increasingly probable that a liability could result in the future; at 
present the amount of any such provision cannot be reliably estimated given the fundamental 
uncertainties underlying any such calculation. No provision has been recognised in relation 
to this matter as at 30 June 2017.
The Group is currently engaging with legal and professional advisors in its efforts to understand 
the position of the Trustees and how they might reach a reliable estimate of any potential liability. 
The Court determination scheduled to take place in late spring was deferred by the Trustees 
following advice from a Scottish QC. It still remains difficult to predict how long the Trustees 
will take to calculate any liability and when the debt notices will be served. At this point the 
Group will be able to re-consider its options in respect of any obligation arising in this matter. 
Therefore disclosure on this matter is made in accordance with note 7.2.3.
7.2.2 Contingent liabilities related to joint ventures and associates
The Group has given counter-indemnities in respect of performance bonds and financial 
guarantees to its joint ventures totalling £62.5m at 30 June 2017 (2016: £56.5m). The Group 
has also provided principal guarantees of £9.0m (2016: £9.0m) and cost and interest overrun 
guarantees in relation to the borrowings of a number of the Group’s London joint ventures. 
At 30 June 2017, no cost or interest overruns had been incurred (2016: £nil). The Group’s 
maximum exposure under these cost and interest overrun guarantees is estimated at £18.1m 
as at 30 June 2017 (2016: £17.7m).
At 30 June 2017, the Group has an obligation to repay £0.9m (2016: £0.9m) of grant monies 
received by a joint venture upon certain future disposals of land. 
The Group has also given a number of performance guarantees in respect of the obligations  
of its joint ventures, requiring the Group to complete development agreement contractual  
obligations in the event that the joint ventures do not perform as required under the terms  
of the related contracts.
There are no contingent liabilities in relation to associates at 30 June 2017.
7. 1 Operating lease obligations continued
7.1.2 The Group as lessor
The Group has lease agreements with third parties for certain commercial properties, either 
in the process of development or which have been developed by the Group, and units on land 
to be subsequently developed for residential use. It is intended that the commercial properties, 
with their future rental income, will be sold to third parties in the normal course of business 
and therefore they are classified as work in progress until the date of sale.

7.2 Contingent liabilities continued
7.2.3 Contingent liabilities related to legal claims
Provision is made for the Directors’ best estimate of all known material legal claims and all legal 
actions in progress. The Group takes legal advice as to the likelihood of success of claims and 
actions and no provision is made (other than for legal costs) where the Directors consider, based 
on such advice, that claims or actions are unlikely to succeed, or a sufficiently reliable estimate 
of the potential obligations cannot be made.
No contingent liability in respect of such claims has been recognised.

KPI definitions and why we measure
KPI Definition Why we measure
Adjusted gross margin Gross profit before adjusted items divided by total revenue, expressed as a percentage. This measures underlying gross profitability of the Group before overhead costs,  
finance costs, tax and one-off items. This is a key internal management metric 
for assessing performance. 
Adjusted profit before tax (PBT) The Group’s profit before tax including its share of profits from JV’s and associates, 
before any adjusted items. 
This measure demonstrates the overall underlying profitability of the Group after 
administrative costs and finance costs but before one-off items. This is consistent  
with how the business performance is reported to and assessed by the Board. 
Return on capital employed (ROCE) Calculated as earnings before interest, tax, operating charges relating to the defined 
benefit pension scheme and operating adjusting or exceptional items, divided by average 
net assets adjusted for goodwill and intangibles, tax, cash, loans and borrowings, 
retirement benefit assets/obligations and derivative financial instruments.
We measure return on capital employed to demonstrate the level of return as a 
percentage from our core operations and to demonstrate the generation of shareholder 
value. It is a key internal management performance measure for ensuring efficient and 
effective use of shareholders’ capital within business operations. 
Year end net cash Calculated as cash and cash equivalents, less total borrowings being total drawn debt, 
plus/minus the value of any foreign exchange swaps held. 
We measure net cash/debt as a measure of our liquidity and available funds at any  
given point in time. We adjust for the effect of foreign exchange swaps in place on debt 
denoted in foreign currencies to better reflect the Group’s available funds in sterling.  
This is a key measure used to assess the ability of the Group to fund its ongoing operations 
and commitments. 
Earnings per share (EPS) Calculated by dividing the profit for the year attributable to ordinary shareholders  
by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year , excluding 
those held by the Employee Benefit Trust which are treated as cancelled. 
We measure earnings per share for our shareholders as it measures the amount  
of post-tax profit attributable to them over the period and is used in the calculation 
of dividends. 
T otal Shareholder Return (TSR) TSR is a measure of the performance of the Group’s share price over a period  
of three financial years. It combines share price appreciation and dividends paid  
to show the total return to the shareholders expressed as a percentage. 
We measure TSR as it enables our shareholders to identify the amount of appreciation  
and income they have derived from holding the Group’s shares over a three-year period 
when compared against other investments. 
Health and Safety  
(SHE audit compliance)
The percentage of internal inspections which are compliant with SHE guidelines. We measure compliance with Health & Safety as it is our number one priority. We strive  
to ensure that our people, whether employees, sub-contractors or members of the public, 
remain safe throughout the whole construction and sales process of our developments 
and in our wider business.
Customer service The percentage of home buyers who would recommend the Group to family  
and friends taken from the HBF Homebuilder Survey.
We measure customer service as our customers are key to our success as a business. 
The HBF Homebuilder survey is an industry recognised, independently measured 
indicator of both our customer service and build quality.
The survey is designed to provide home buyers with information about housebuilders 
to help guide their purchasing decision, and to encourage excellent levels of service  
to be delivered by housebuilders.
Employee engagement score The percentage level of satisfaction of our people measured using a yearly  
independently conducted survey. This is compared against a UK wide benchmark  
to assess overall engagement. 
We measure employee engagement because we aim to have a highly engaged workforce 
across the Group. We aim to attract and retain the best people and seek to invest in their 
development and success. 
Owned and controlled land bank years Owned and controlled plots as at the end of the financial year divided by the number  
of private and affordable completions for the current financial year . 
The availability of land is a key input to our business. We continually monitor our land bank 
and the mix of land we have to ensure we have an appropriate land supply.
Land approvals (plots) The number of plots approved for purchase by the Group. We measure and monitor land approvals to monitor our land intake and ensure we are 
approving for purchase an appropriate amount of land to support our business activities 
going forward.
T otal completions Homes sold during the year including 100% of JV homes sold in which the Group  
has an interest. 
Completions are an industry wide measure which reflects the level of activity and growth 
of the business. 176       Barratt Developments PLC – Annual Report and Accounts 2017
